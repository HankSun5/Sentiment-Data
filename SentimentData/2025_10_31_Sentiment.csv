This deepening scarcity, one of the most pronounced readings in months, comes as data suggests large-scale investors are accumulating the asset, setting the stage for a potential supply squeeze. Conflicting Signals from Large Holders Data from October shared by Arab Chain shows that Binance’s Bitcoin Scarcity Index moved upward through the month, jumping sharply in late October to exceed a reading of 9. This index is a direct measure of the reduction in Bitcoin supply available for immediate trading on the exchange. In simple terms, a rising index means the amount of Bitcoin sitting on Binance that is available for purchase is gradually falling. The analytics platform clarified that this typically points to an accumulation phase, where large investors and whales are buying and withdrawing BTC from Binance, effectively taking them off the market. “This is generally considered a positive long-term signal that supports the likelihood of continued upside in the medium term, despite short-term price fluctuations, as buyers appear to be racing to acquire Bitcoin in the market,” noted Arab Chain. The assessment also pointed out that such supply drops are often linked to positive news or sudden capital inflows. However, it also presented a critical caveat: scarcity alone cannot push prices higher. For a major price increase to occur, this limited supply must be met with genuine new demand from an increasing number of buyers. Still, this positive accumulation signal is not the only story. Another metric tells a different tale. The 7-day average of Binance’s Exchange Whale Ratio has also climbed steeply, rising from around 0.33 on October 12 to approximately 0.41 between October 22 and 25. This ratio measures large deposits to the exchange, and such a sustained increase has historically indicated that major holders are preparing to sell, creating a wall of supply that can slow or reverse a price rally. It creates a complex picture where one set of data suggests holding, while another points toward potential selling. Broader Market Trends The movement of coins off exchanges is not solely about whales holding in private wallets. A growing trend shows that some large BTC holders are shifting their assets into spot Bitcoin ETFs like those from BlackRock. These “in-kind” transfers allow whales to swap their Bitcoin for ETF shares without creating a taxable event, a process that could act as another drain on the liquid supply available on crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, in the market, BTC was priced at $110,232 at the time of writing, dipping from the $111,400 level it was trading at yesterday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its second consecutive interest rate cut. While it’s up 1.2% over seven days, the 30-day view shows a 3.4% decline, and it remains more than 12% below the new all-time high past $126,000 it attained in early October.

The company posted $180.2 million in revenue, up from $84.8 million in the same quarter last year. Riot also reported net income of $104.5 million, equal to $0.26 per diluted share, compared to a $154.4 million loss or $(0.54) per diluted share in Q3 2024. The shift was driven mainly by stronger Bitcoin mining revenue and the current value of Bitcoin it holds. Riot said it produced 1,406 bitcoin in the quarter, up from 1,104 mined in the same period last year. The company held 19,287 bitcoin as of September 30, 2025. About 3,300 bitcoin from that total are being used as collateral. Based on a Bitcoin market price of $114,068 on that date, Riot’s holdings were valued at around $2.2 billion. The company also ended the quarter with $170.0 million in working capital, $330.7 million in unrestricted cash, and $75.6 million in restricted cash. Riot expands data center development Riot said the growth this quarter came alongside major steps in its data center development plan. CEO Jason Les said the company is moving ahead with the core and shell construction of the first two buildings at its Corsicana data center campus, which together will support 112 megawatts of critical IT load when operational. Les stated, “Riot made decisive progress in the development of our data center business this quarter. This progress has culminated in announcing today the initiation of the core and shell development of the first two buildings at our Corsicana data center campus, representing 112 MW of total critical IT capacity.” He said the company reached four key achievements this quarter connected to the Corsicana expansion: Acquired a new 67‑acre land parcel adjacent to the original site. Completed the full campus design for Corsicana. Completed the Basis of Design that will be used as Riot’s standard data center build template. Continued expanding and staffing its in‑house data center team to support construction and scaling. Les said these moves support the company’s plan to transform Riot into a large‑scale data center operator linked directly to its land and power access strategy. Mining revenue increases while cost pressures continue The company reported $160.8 million in Bitcoin mining revenue, up from $67.5 million in the same quarter in 2024. The increase came from higher average Bitcoin prices and increases in Riot’s operational hash rate. The company noted, however, that the average global network hash rate also increased during the same period, which limited some of the revenue upside. The average cost to mine one bitcoin, excluding depreciation, was $46,324 this quarter, compared to $35,376 last year. Riot linked this rise mainly to a 52% increase in the global network hash rate from last year. This was partly offset by a 147% increase in power credits the company received in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024. Riot reported $19.1 million in engineering revenue for the quarter, up from $12.6 million in Q3 2024. Since purchasing ESS Metron in December 2021, the company said it has achieved $23.0 million in capex savings tied directly to that acquisition. Riot also reported Non‑GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $197.2 million, which includes a $133.1 million gain on Bitcoin held on its balance sheet.

This remarkable forecast, highlighted by Cointelegraph and a report from venture capital firm 1KX, signals a pivotal moment for the blockchain ecosystem. The firm noted that revenue generated from user-paid fees already hit a record $9.7 billion in the first half of 2025 alone, demonstrating significant momentum. Why is On-Chain Revenue a Game Changer? What exactly makes on-chain revenue such a critical metric? According to 1KX, the fees users pay on blockchain networks are a direct reflection of real-world adoption and utility. These aren’t just speculative transactions; they represent genuine value that individuals and businesses are willing to pay for repeatedly. Think of it as the ‘usage fee’ for digital services, much like a subscription or a transaction charge in traditional finance. This willingness to pay is a powerful signal of a protocol’s fundamental strength. It moves beyond mere hype, focusing instead on tangible economic activity. As such, these fees provide a clear window into the actual demand for decentralized applications and services. Indicator of Real Utility: Fees show users find genuine value in a protocol’s offerings. Tangible Economic Activity: Demonstrates actual usage, not just speculative trading. Repeated Engagement: Users pay because they derive ongoing benefit from the service. The Maturation of Protocols: A New Era for On-Chain Revenue As blockchain protocols continue to evolve and mature, the landscape for on-chain revenue generation is transforming. Early experimental networks are giving way to more robust, scalable, and user-friendly platforms. This evolution, coupled with a clearer regulatory environment, is making it easier for projects to build sustainable business models. Moreover, the report emphasizes that the ability to generate consistent revenue is quickly becoming the ultimate benchmark for distinguishing fleeting trends from long-term, viable blockchain solutions. It’s a shift towards a more sustainable and economically sound ecosystem where true value creation takes precedence. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Growing On-Chain Revenue? The rise in on-chain revenue brings a host of benefits, fostering a healthier and more innovative ecosystem. Protocols with strong revenue streams can reinvest in development, enhance security, and expand their features, ultimately benefiting users. It also instills greater confidence in investors, who look for projects with clear paths to profitability and sustainability. However, this growth also presents its own set of challenges that need careful navigation. Scalability issues can lead to higher fees, potentially deterring users. Furthermore, maintaining a seamless user experience and navigating intense competition from new protocols are constant hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty, while improving, still poses risks that projects must address proactively. Key Benefits: Sustainability: Protocols can fund ongoing development and operations independently.

As long as XRP fails to regain the $3.00 resistance point, its price action is indicative of short-term uncertainty but patiently optimistic in the long run. Still, further consolidation or breakdown below support would kill momentum and prompt investors to look at other options. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes into the limelight. This rapidly emerging DeFi platform is now becoming the top crypto to buy among early adopters. With its Phase 6 presale already more than 80% sold out and over $18.2 million raised, MUTM’s explosive growth is attracting the type of early momentum witnessed by leaders of previous cycles. As XRP struggles with regaining its bullish momentum, most analysts think that Mutuum Finance might just be the one leading the next altcoin season, possibly becoming the next crypto to hit $1 for early investors. XRP Bulls Show Signs of Life, Targets Are $3.4 and Higher XRP is again getting hot as the bullish momentum takes shape in the market. Following the 2.55 resistance breakdown and key $2.55, the token has experienced an 11% four-day rally fueled by rekindled whale activity and rising Open Interest from $550 million to $590 million in the last 24 hours. Traders are now looking toward $3.1–$3.4, although the $2.64 and $2.77 resistances are still key levels to break through before a complete bullish breakout can be declared. If momentum is carried through and demand continues to build, XRP may be poised to initiate a strong push towards the $4.5 level in the near future. With faith regained in blue-chip altcoins such as XRP, market participants are equally paying close attention to nascent DeFi entrants such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fresh entry that is fast gaining popularity as the overall market prepares for the next major rally, potentially becoming the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most demanded cryptocurrencies in 2025, with investors worldwide keenly observing. The project’s presale still rages on with more than 17,600 participants and more than $18.2 million raised to date. Now in Phase 6, the MUTM token trades at $0.035, its most undervalued point of entry prior to the next planned hop to $0.04 during Phase 7. With 80% of tokens in this phase sold out, the speed indicates increasing investor confidence in the long-term DeFi potential of Mutuum Finance. This quick growth solidly positions MUTM as the top crypto to buy today, with short-term potential and long-term worth for early investors to gain from before what some think is potentially the next crypto to hit $1. Earn Passive Income with Mutuum Finance Beyond its token appreciation potential, Mutuum Finance also provides investors with the ability to derive passive income consistently through its liquidity pools, where users can earn annual percentage yields (APY) based on demand in the market. As an example, an investor who invests 50,000 USDT can potentially earn 5,000 USDT annually with a 10% APY through the leverage of automated yield generation and compounded over time. In addition to enhancing user confidence, the Mutuum Finance development team has introduced an official bug bounty program in collaboration with CertiK, with a reward pool of $50,000 USDT distributed across four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. The program induces thorough vulnerability scanning and reaffirms the team’s dedication to transparency and reliability following a successful CertiK audit. During this time, the project’s V1 protocol is set to launch in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia testnet , which brings important DeFi features like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. Lending and borrowing support will initially offer ETH and USDT, with P2P lending markets to allow negotiability of terms for best yield. Whereas XRP is rallying against resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up pace with $18.2M raised and Phase 6 80% sold. Due to its dual-lending DeFi model, passive income prospects, and future V1 protocol, MUTM is a strong recommendation for short-term appreciation as well as long-term appreciation, and possibly leading the next altcoin rally, making it the top crypto to buy for early adopters and a clear contender for the next crypto to hit $1.

53839014,617278,1761861627,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,State Of The XRP Ledger Report Gives Deep Insight Into How Institutions Are Moving In,https://bitcoinist.com/the-state-of-the-xrp-ledger/,"This week, crypto market intelligence platform Messari released its Q3 State of XRP Ledger (XRPL) report, revealing a maturing network that continues to draw institutional attention. The data points to stronger engagement, increased transaction volumes , and a growing number of new addresses, signaling that the Ledger is evolving from a retail-heavy blockchain into one increasingly driven by enterprise-adoption and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization . Institutional Activity Reflected In XRP Ledger Network Growth Messari’s report highlights clear signs of institutional movement within the XRPL network during Q3 2025. Average daily transactions rose 8.9% Quarter-Over-Quarter (QoQ), from $1.6 million to $1.8 million. Likewise, the average daily active sender addresses increased by 15.4% from 21,900 to 23,300, while total new addresses rose by 46.3% to 447,200. Overall, the Ledger closed the quarter with 6.9 million total addresses, up 6.1% from the previous quarter, according to Messari’s metric chart. Notably, for the fifth consecutive quarter, Messari notes that the number of active receiver addresses on the Ledger continued to surpass the number of active sender addresses. In Q3 2025, average daily receivers declined 30.01% QoQ, falling from 72,000 to 50,300, while average daily senders rose 15.4% from 21,900 to 25,300. Despite the drop in receiver activity, data shows that total network throughput strengthened, with average daily transactions climbing 8.9% QoQ to $1.8 million. This reflects a more concentrated and higher-value transaction flow, typically linked to custodians and CEXs , which use destination tags to manage deposits for institutions and large groups of users. Messari also reported that “Payment” transactions on XRPL remained dominant, representing 55.7% of total network activity, while “ OfferCreate ” transactions, which submit orders to exchanges, increased to 33.2%. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter that Payments have led transaction types. Data shows that payment volume rose 1% QoQ to 986,600 after a previous decline, while OfferCreate activity showed growing liquidity operations among institutional market makers. OracleSet, used to create or update on-chain price oracles, also rose to 0.7% of all transactions, underscoring the Ledger’s growing integration with asset pricing and financial data feeds since their activation in late 2024. Infrastructure Upgrades And ETFs Signal XRPL Institutional Adoption The second half of Messari’s report highlights structural developments in the XRPL ecosystem aimed at facilitating institutional adoption. Data reveals that the Ledger introduces Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) that embed metadata for RWA parameters. It also implemented confidential MPTs secured by Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and advanced credential systems supporting KYC and AML compliance . Together, these upgrades address the network’s identity, financial, compliance, and privacy requirements, laying the foundation for widespread institutional adoption. Messari further reported that Institutional sentiment is further supported by the pending approval of seven US Spot XRP ETF applications . Notably, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue its decision between October 18 and November 14. Polymarket currently assigns a 99% probability that a US XRP ETF will be approved in 2025.",XRP|AML|CEXs|KYC|messari|MPTs|Multi-Purpose Tokens|OracleSet|Polymarket|Real-World Asset|ripple|RWA|Securities and Exchange Commission|Spot XRP ETF|US SEC|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Zero Knowledge Proofs|ZKPs,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-30 22:00:27

By enabling faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining full ETH security and composability, Linea is building the infrastructure for real economic activity. Why Ethereum Needs An Economic Backbone Linea is rapidly evolving into the Ethereum economic backbone. Crypto analyst Henry has revealed on X that Linea was built from first principles as a reinforcement layer for ETH’s future. The reason why Linea is catching serious attention is that over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and $130 million in stablecoins represent real liquidity inflow into the network, not inflated metrics. Related Reading: Ethereum Treasury Giant SharpLink Resumes ETH Purchases As Holdings Top $3.5 Billion Furthermore, Linea’s buyback and burn mechanism ties are built directly into protocol revenue. MetaMask’s deep integration and the seamless user experience (UX) are instant reach, and the developer-first architecture actually scales without breaking ETH’s security. The rumors of a MASK airdrop and upcoming institutional deployments only add fuel to the narrative. While others are chasing hype, LineaBuild is constructing the infrastructure that powers real revenue. Henry concluded that every stat is screaming one thing, and adoption is real. “Nothing can defeat this, and Linea is ETH’s execution layer for the next cycle,” the expert added. Crypto analyst BullifyX has also made a bold declaration that the next evolution of Web3 is unfolding right on LineaBuild. Linea isn’t just another Layer 2 blockchain, but it’s a new foundation for scalability, speed, and developer freedom. With zkEVM precision, ultra-low gas, and ETH-grade security, Linea bridges the gap between innovation and accessibility. Furthermore, LineaBuild is a frictionless playground for builders, while for users, it delivers pure performance. BullifyX emphasizes that Linea’s role is to transform complex blockchain experiences into smooth, scalable realities, powering applications, digital economies, and the immersive metaverses. “The future doesn’t wait. It scales on LineaBuild.” BullifyX noted. The First Public Company Just Proved Ethereum’s Real-World Use Case In a monumental shift, the institutional adoption of Ethereum had just leveled up. According to Stacy Muur, the founder of GREENDOTS, the catalyst for this advancement is the deployment of an impressive $200 million in ETH on LineaBuild by SharpLink, a publicly traded company, powered by EigenLayer’s EigenCloud, ether_fi restaking, and Anchorage for secure, regulated custody. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As The Sole Trillion-Dollar Institutional Store Of Value — Here’s Why Muur explained that this is the first fully verifiable, ETH-aligned institutional treasury activation.

53839252,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=849515,1761861816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53839252.jpeg,Volkswagen posted a €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion) operating loss in Q3 due to Porsche’s EV strategy reversal and U.S. tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/volkswagen-earnings-miss-estimates/,"Volkswagen just reported a €1.3 billion operating loss (that’s $1.52 billion gone) in the third quarter of 2025. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the real cost of two punches: Porsche’s failed EV gamble and Donald Trump’s tariffs still hammering the company like it’s 2019 all over again. According to Volkswagen’s earnings report, €4.7 billion in charges have already been booked this year because Porsche flipped its electric strategy upside down. Instead of pushing EVs, Porsche is going back to combustion engines and hybrids. That decision blew a crater into the group’s financials. On top of that, the company says it could take another €5 billion hit from U.S. import tariffs by the end of the year. CFO Arno Antlitz didn’t sugarcoat it. “Those effects will continue to persist – and that is why we must rigorously implement the performance programs in place, push forward efficiency measures, and develop new approaches,” Arno said. Arno called the company’s current state a “mixed picture,” mentioning that EV sales in Europe are still going strong and that some internal restructuring has helped. But the reality is that the move to electric is squeezing margins dry. Volkswagen’s loss was ugly, but still better than expected. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had forecast a deeper €1.7 billion loss, so technically the company did “better than feared.” Investors didn’t seem too shaken, though, as Volkswagen’s stock actually went up by 1.2% in early Frankfurt trading. Porsche pulls back on EVs, burns €4.7 billion Porsche, which is 75.4% owned by Volkswagen , dragged the whole group down this quarter. Its sudden decision to delay electric car production and switch focus to hybrids and combustion models was expensive… €4.7 billion expensive. The idea is to win back buyers who aren’t quite ready to go full electric yet. But that decision came with a price. The man overseeing both brands, Oliver Blume, is stepping back from Porsche to focus on Volkswagen alone. Oliver, who holds CEO titles at both companies, will hand off Porsche leadership at the end of the year. This comes after growing pressure from investors who questioned whether one man could steer two ships during a storm like this. Volkswagen didn’t ditch its full-year forecast, but there’s a catch. The company said its guidance is based on chip availability; a risky assumption. The trade spat around Dutch chipmaker Nexperia could easily spill into production delays if it escalates. Volkswagen already lowered its expectations earlier this month, now targeting just 2% to 3% return on sales, and breaking even on net automotive cash flow. Trump’s tariffs cost billions, hit U.S. deliveries Let’s not pretend this is all on Porsche. Trump’s tariffs are still hitting hard. Last year, Volkswagen earned €21.7 billion (about $25.10 billion) in operating income. This year, that figure could be down $5.8 billion, or about 23% wiped out, because of tariffs alone. In Q2, tariff costs hit $1.52 billion, and even though the EU–U.S. trade deal lowered tariffs to 15% in August, Mexican-built vehicles like the Tiguan still face a massive 27.5% import tax. And yeah, Volkswagen builds a lot of cars in Mexico. Volkswagen said U.S. deliveries dropped 8% in the first nine months of the year. Overall global deliveries were up 1%, but that U.S. number stings. The company still makes about 200,000 vehicles in the U.S., but it also imports 240,000 from Germany and 287,000 from Mexico. That math right there? That’s a logistics nightmare. Especially when your best-seller, the Tiguan, is built in Puebla, Mexico, and slammed with high tariffs every time it crosses the border.

Investors reacted fast, and the stock sold off as soon as the plan was laid out. The move signaled higher costs ahead, and the market did not wait to see how it plays out. Mark Zuckerberg said the company is building more computing power to meet rising demand for AI tools across Meta’s core business. He said the company has seen this pattern before. In his words, “we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption, and then we keep on having more demand to be able to use more compute, especially in the core business.” Mark admitted that the plan could go too far. He said, “I mean, it’s, of course, possible to overshoot that right?” If Meta ends up with extra unused compute, he said the company will “absorb” it and use it in the future. According to Mark, internal teams and outside partners already request access to Meta’s infrastructure for APIs and compute, so even excess capacity might be used over time. Wall Street cuts targets That explanation was not enough to settle the market. The idea of building now and hoping the need catches up later sounded like costs first, benefits later, and the Street is allergic to that. Analysts started moving price targets down almost instantly. BofA Global Research’s Justin Post cut Meta’s price target from $900 to $810, though he kept a Buy rating. KeyBanc’s Justin Patterson lowered his target from $905 to $875, holding Overweight. TD Cowen’s John Blackledge brought his target down from $875 to $810, also keeping Buy. Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak, Goldman Sachs’ Eric Sheridan, Citi’s Ron Josey, and Cantor Fitzgerald’s Deepak Mathivanan all lowered targets too, while maintaining either Buy or Overweight positions. Translation: they still think Meta has value long term, but the near-term financial pressure is real. Not every analyst turned, though. HSBC’s Nicolas Cote-Colisson held his target at $905, and Wedbush’s Scott Devitt also left his target unchanged. Rising AI costs and Reality Labs losses weigh on the stock The company did share a bright figure: Meta’s AI-powered advertising tools now have an annual run rate of $60 billion. So the AI investments are doing something. But that number did not override concerns about spending going up too fast. The Reality Labs segment added more pressure. Meta reported another $4 billion loss from Reality Labs. That division continues to operate at a loss, and there are no signs of it slowing down. Forrester’s vice president and research director, Mike Proulx said, “Unfortunately, Meta’s strong revenue and user growth in Q3 is tainted by significantly increased costs across the board.” He added, “True to form, Meta’s Reality Labs continued its streak of losses with no signs of slowing down.” Meta’s stock is now trailing the S&P 500. Meta shares are up 15% year to date and 14% in the past 12 months. The S&P 500 is up 16% year to date and 18% over the past 12 months. Meta is still growing, but the pace is now behind the broader market.

Crypto’s traditional “Uptober” rally faded quickly after President Donald Trump introduced sweeping 100% tariffs on goods imported from China barely a week in. Yet optimism has returned following the recent U.S. launch of Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera ETFs, along with growing speculation that the Fed’s announcement of another 25 basis point interest rate cut yesterday. These developments indicate strong altcoin performance will characterise the next bull run . Qwen3-MAX forecasts SOL, XRP and Cardano will lead. Solana (SOL): Qwen3-MAX Predicts a Major Rally Following ETFs Solana ($SOL) remains one of the most rapidly advancing smart contract blockchains, currently valued at over $105 billion with around $12 billion in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi on chain. Source: Qwen3-MAX The green light for Bitwise and Grayscale’s spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. has ignited renewed excitement. Institutional inflows could mirror the significant surges seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs debuted. Renowned for ultra-fast throughput, negligible fees, and widespread adoption in tokenization and stablecoin applications, Solana is increasingly viewed as a top-tier network for enterprises. After reaching a high of $250 in January and a low of roughly $100 in April, SOL now trades near $186, down 34.5% from its all-time high (ATH) of $293 set mid January. Having recently broken out of a bullish flag pattern, Qwen3-MAX anticipates Solana could climb as high as $800 to $1,200 by Christmas, a bold yet plausible target that will need help from crypto-friendly US legislation. XRP ($XRP): Up to 400% Gains by Christmas, Says Qwen3-MAX Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) stands out in Qwen3-MAX’s models as another breakout contender, with projections pointing to a potential rise toward $8—$12 by year-end, potentially growing 372% above its current value of $2.65. Following its decisive courtroom victory over the SEC earlier this year, confidence in Ripple soared, driving XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, XRP has climbed 388%, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum by a country mile. Ripple’s introduction of its RLUSD stablecoin, coupled with CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s contacts with President Trump, has branded the company as one aligned with regulatory compliance, greatly enhancing diverse investor appeal. XRP’s technical indicators show multiple bullish flag setups throughout 2025, pointing to the possibility of a major end of year breakout. Should further catalysts like ETF approvals, strategic partnerships, or clear U.S. crypto regulations materialize, Qwen3-MAX projects that XRP could potentially reach the $12 mark. Cardano ($ADA): Over 700% Upside Predicted for Q4 In decentralized finance, Cardano ($ADA) continues to strengthen its reputation as a rival to Ethereum, supported by a robust developer ecosystem building innovative dApps. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s hallmark is its peer-reviewed and academically rigorous design, emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and mathematical verification. With a current market capitalization around $23 billion, Cardano remains among the top DeFi networks, but would need substantial growth to rival Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Qwen3-MAX forecasts ADA could reach as high as $5 in November, a 709% increase from its current price of about $0.6181. If risk-on sentiment builds through November, Qwen3-MAX AI projects ADA could climb to $3 by late 2025, potentially surpassing its 2021 all-time high of $3.09 should a broader bull run appear. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin With 100x Potential Finally, one project too new for Qwen3-MAX is setting the presales market on fire. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has become one of the most talked-about meme coin presales of the season, raising over $3.8 million from investors seeking the next major Dogecoin-style rally. Positioned as Dogecoin’s louder, more irreverent counterpart, Maxi Doge embodies crypto’s degen spirit through meme contests, community-driven initiatives, and a vibrant social media presence. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from faster and cheaper transactions compared to Dogecoin’s original blockchain. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which supports marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. Staking is already live, offering up to 80% APY in rewards, though yields will taper as more users join. The current presale price stands at $0.0002655, with scheduled price increases for each phase. Investors can buy MAXI using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

Within days, prices slid sharply after President Trump unveiled a sweeping 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a saga that is still ongoing. Despite yesterday’s Federal Reserve FOMC meeting, where investors got their hoped-for rate cuts, crypto’s collective market cap dropped 1.8% in the last 24 hours to $3.82 trillion. While the prolonged downturn is causing concern, many crypto old hands view it as a correction, clearing out excessive leverage and weak hands before the next major rally. This is an idea that has plenty of precedent in crypto’s short history of bull runs preceded by crashes. That said, top quality altcoins like XRP, ZEC, and HYPE stand to gain the most. Ripple (XRP): Set to Revolutionize Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s digital asset, XRP ($XRP) , powers a high-speed, low-fee payment protocol designed to outperform legacy networks such as SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with institutions like the UN Capital Development Fund and several leading U.S. banks, XRP has become the world’s fourth-largest crypto asset with a market cap exceeding $154 billion. Ripple’s release of the RLUSD stablecoin marks an early move into one of the fastest-growing and most vital upcoming sectors in digital payments. Over the past twelve months, XRP has surged 388%, reaching $3.65 in mid-July, its highest price since 2018, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 53% gain over the same period. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers near 48. Its price has re-aligned with its 30-day moving average, signaling the end of a brief period of relative weakness. Technical indicators reveal two as yet unfulfilled bullish flag patterns from the summer months, hinting at potential upside if US authorities deliver spot ETF approvals or comprehensive regulation. In that scenario, XRP could climb into the $5–$10 range. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Token Surges 147% in One Week Debuting in 2016 as a fork of Bitcoin, Zcash ($ZEC) was purpose-built to deliver complete transactional privacy. Its zk-SNARK cryptography (“zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge”) allows transaction verification without disclosing sender, receiver, or transfer details. Zcash offers both shielded and transparent addresses, balancing user confidentiality with regulatory requirements. Over the past week, ZEC rose a staggering 52% to $359, outperforming every coin in the top 100 by market cap. While Zcash’s rallies in early October aligned with broader rallies across other privacy coins like Monero ($XMR), this week’s rally does not fit the trend. ZEC’s RSI currently stands around 73 and is trending slightly downward as traders lock in profits. This means we can expect depreciation in the short term, ZEC could approach the $500 level by year-end. Hyperliquid: The DEX Minting a New Wave of Crypto Millionaires Launched in late 2024, Hyperliquid ($HYPE) has rapidly become a leading force in the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Running on its own custom Layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid focuses on speed, transparency, and asset security. Unlike centralized exchanges, it enables users to retain full control of their holdings, an increasingly valuable feature following collapses like FTX. Featuring ultra-low fees, lightning-fast execution, and tools such as perpetual futures, Hyperliquid bridges the gap between centralized convenience and decentralized trust. Price charts show steady bullish momentum since launch. Two flag patterns emerged between winter and spring, formations often preceding sharp rallies. Between early April and May 26, HYPE’s value quadrupled from roughly $10 to $40. Since then, HYPE’s support and resistance lines entered a broadening channel that collapsed with the early October crypto crash, but the fact that HYPE bounced 25% in the last 7 days highlights surging demand. At its current price around $48, it’s 19% down from its September 18 ATH of $59.30. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 That Could Define Bitcoin’s 2026 One of 2025’s most buzzed-about projects, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) merges Bitcoin’s security with advanced Layer-2 scalability and the viral appeal of meme tokens. The network aims to turbocharge Bitcoin’s ecosystem through near-instant transactions, DAO-driven governance, and smart contract capabilities built on its proprietary Layer-2 framework. The presale has already exceeded $25.25 million, with some forecasts suggesting possible 100x gains after launch. By leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports high-speed operations and seamless BTC bridging via its Canonical Bridge, ensuring compatibility with decentralized apps (dApps). A recent Coinsult audit confirmed the project’s clean bill of health, reporting no security flaws and strengthening investor confidence. HYPER tokens fuel governance, staking, and transaction operations, with early adopters earning up to 46% APY in staking rewards.

Eddie Yue, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), HKMA, shared these plans in his latest article, which also outlined the achievements they have made so far in their “Fintech 2025” strategy. Yue also discussed the future direction of the initiative, which aims to cement Hong Kong’s position as a global fintech leader. Enabling the digital economy with strong infrastructures Yue stated that “Financial infrastructure is like a highway, enabling capital and financial assets to travel safely and efficiently through our economy.” The CEO pointed out the need to build this financial infrastructure, stating, “For Hong Kong’s digital economy to thrive, not only do we need the above-mentioned ‘soft infrastructure,’ robust financial ‘hard infrastructure’ is equally crucial.” There’s no shortage of infrastructure currently, as Hong Kong runs the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, which operates across four currencies. Also, its Faster Payment System (FPS), which was launched in 2018, has become a fixture of daily transactions. FPS is not limited to Hong Kong, as it has been connected with systems in Thailand and mainland China, creating a cross-border payment network that allows instant transfers between economies. While the leadership acknowledges the need to build a strong infrastructure, it is not an indictment of the current ones in Hong Kong but a call to action to build for the present and future, where digital finance is a main feature. The city has been working on building on the already established infrastructure, and one of these developments is the digital Hong Kong dollar, or e-HKD, which the HKMA has been exploring since 2017. The authority recently completed an e-HKD pilot program, and it is now exploring introducing it in “retail scenarios for the general public.” The e-HKD, issued directly by the HKMA , carries no credit risk and is initially being tested for wholesale payments, particularly in international trade settlements. One example of the e-HKD’s success was Project mBridge, a cross-border initiative linking the e-HKD with the CBDCs of mainland China, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Project mBridge reportedly hit the minimum viable product stage (MVP) in 2024, and it has already reduced the time required for cross-border transactions from days to seconds. The HKMA launched Project Ensemble to promote a tokenization ecosystem that supports the conversion of real-world assets, such as money or securities, into digital tokens in 2024. The project has done over 20 sandbox experiments with local financial institutions and collaborated with international financial organizations such as the central banks of Brazil, France, and Thailand, among others. Yue’s analogy about digital islands and bridges The Commercial Data Interchange (CDI) is the poster child of what Yue describes as the “digital bridges” initiative, covering payments, e-commerce, and import/export records. Launched in 2022 to link banks with data providers, the CDI already covers 26 banks and 17 data providers. It has also expanded to include government data sources. As of September 2025, it had facilitated more than 71,000 loan applications and reviews, as well as HK$58.1 billion in approved credit. The city’s Open Application Programming Interface (API) framework and Interbank Account Data Sharing (IADS) service are more examples of Hong Kong’s progress in data connectivity.

According to his charts, XRP/USD on the two-day timeframe is trading in what he characterizes as a reaccumulation range rather than a topping pattern. Will XRP Follow Gold’s Pattern? The structure is labeled in classic Elliott Wave A-B-C form, with the C leg ending in what he calls a “Spring.” The October 10 crash marks the Wyckoff terms the final violent liquidation wick that clears late longs and forces capitulation before the next markup phase. The XRP chart shows price capped by a horizontal resistance band near the local top marked “B,” with that B high sitting above $3.40 and extending toward roughly $3.66 at the peak. After that move, XRP retraced into a sideway band where Osemka labels internal subdivisions “a,” “b,” and “c,” implying a corrective internal chop inside the broader range. The lower boundary of the range is drawn in the $1.62 area. This lower boundary is simultaneously labeled “A” and described as the base of Reaccumulation, implying that buyers repeatedly defended that zone. The subsequent rally back toward the upper boundary defined the “B” top. What followed was a final flush into “C,” which he explicitly tags “Spring,” with the wick piercing below prior support and then snapping back above $2.20–$2.30 and into the ~$2.58 region shown on the chart. Related Reading: Why This Analyst Is More Bullish On XRP Over Ethereum For The Short-Term The message is that the C wave was fast, deep, and terminal. He calls it “a sharp ending in the C wave,” adding that this is “very common.” In classical Elliott interpretation, an A-B-C corrective move that ends with an aggressive C spike often resolves with trend continuation in the direction of the original impulse. In his wording, the surge established the impulse, and everything since has been digestion, not distribution. He argues that “it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge.” Notably, Osemka places XRP’s pattern next to gold’s weekly chart during its own multi-quarter sideways phase. Gold’s structure is annotated almost identically: an “A” low anchored around roughly $1,680–$1,700 per ounce, a mid-range chop labeled “a / b / c,” a “B” high pressing into the $2,050–$2,100 ceiling, and finally a “C” leg that undercut that same $1,700 floor before reversing.

Signal Flashes Familiar Warning When gold finally pushed through the long-capped $2,100 area in July 2024 and broke into sustained new all-time highs near $2,480, that break acted like a trigger: safe-haven demand, Fed rate-cut expectations and central bank buying drove an almost uninterrupted vertical phase in the metal, and over the following months gold kept taking out round numbers — $2,500, $3,000, $4,000 and beyond — ultimately stretching more than 80% higher from that $2,100 breakout zone to reach about $4,381 per ounce at the peak. By placing XRP and gold side by side, using the same lettering, same boundary logic, and the same “Spring” terminology, Osemka is presenting XRP as sitting at the equivalent moment gold occupied just before its parabolic run. “This one is for the XRP community, where I see some gurus preaching for the end of the cycle. Bros, it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge. In Elliott wave terms: an ABC with a sharp ending in the C wave. Very common. Last shakeout or Spring. There is basically no difference to this reaccumulation example on Gold years ago. Thank me later,” the analyst concluded. At press time, XRP traded at $2.49.

The company’s developers have added new privacy tools that keep user and payment details hidden during transaction confirmation. The update represents a massive leap for XRP Ledger privacy, allowing users to send and confirm transactions without exposing personal information. Ripple Developers Add Zero-Knowledge Proofs To The XRP Ledger According to a new post on X by xrpl.to (@xrplto), Ripple developers have made a significant leap forward for the network’s privacy features, integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) into the XRP Ledger. The feature lets users verify transactions on the XRP ledger without revealing any details, such as who sends the funds, who receives them, or how much money moves between them. The research report attached to the post details how Ripple’s developers have built a system called ZKProver to manage the Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy layer on the XRP Ledger. ZKProver manages every step of the private transaction process , from building secure digital circuits to verifying deposits and withdrawals, all while keeping sensitive data hidden. The privacy engine also handles the cryptographic keys that protect each network operation and guarantees transaction integrity. The report also notes that the new privacy engine on the XRP ledger generates and verifies proofs to confirm transaction validity without introducing tampering risks. It converts data into secure formats and produces random values that make every transaction unique. This randomness adds another layer of protection, making it nearly impossible to link or trace activities on the XRP ledger. By automating these advanced cryptographic steps, the network can now support shielded transactions without sacrificing speed or efficiency. New Privacy Features And Transaction Types Introduced The integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs strengthens the XRP Ledger’s privacy by adding shielded transactions that hide key details from public view, making XRP transfers harder to trace. The upgrade also introduces three new private transaction types for shielded transactions, each extending the transactor base class. ZkDeposit lets users deposit tokens into a private pool that hides the details from view, while ZkWithdraw allows users to withdraw tokens from that pool while keeping the transaction private . Last but not least, ZkPayment lets users send XRP privately between wallets without revealing amounts or addresses to the public. These transaction types draw inspiration from Zcash, a well-known cryptocurrency famous for its focus on confidential transactions. Ripple’s approach shows how the company is inspired by proven privacy concepts and adapting them to strengthen the XRP Ledger. The latest update further underscores the XRP Ledger’s growth into a more improved, private, and user-focused network. As privacy remains a key topic in crypto, the Zero Knowledge Proofs privacy upgrade helps the XRP Ledger stand out as a more secure , enterprise-grade blockchain network.",Ripple|XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Adoption|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-30 23:00:52

Once one of the top three digital assets by market capitalization, Cardano now ranks 10th as it continues to face bearish market conditions and selling pressure. Cardano’s Position in the Market During the 2021 bull run, Cardano’s price climbed to $3.10, briefly placing it ahead of XRP. However, the token has since experienced a steep decline as broader market trends turned negative. At the time of writing, ADA trades around $0.6052 , reflecting a 27% decline year-to-date, along with drops of 10.7% in six months, 15% in three months, and 22.61% in the past month. Cardano’s total market capitalization currently stands at $21.70 billion, a fraction of XRP’s estimated $147.63 billion. XRP, priced around $2.46 , remains the third-largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike ADA, XRP has recorded notable growth this year, up 24.1% year-to-date and 16.6% over the past six months. Continued Selling and Market Pressure Despite brief recovery attempts, Cardano continues to face downward pressure from persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and investor sell-offs. Market analysts have linked part of this weakness to large-scale liquidations by whales. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, major ADA holders offloaded 100 million ADA tokens within the past week, intensifying market volatility. Broader economic factors, including global inflationary pressures and reduced investor risk appetite, have also limited ADA’s momentum. While the Cardano network continues to develop its ecosystem, these market conditions have made it difficult for the token to sustain meaningful rallies. What It Would Take to Overtake XRP To reclaim a higher market ranking, Cardano’s valuation would need to exceed that of XRP . Based on the current figures, ADA’s market capitalization would have to rise from $21 billion to at least $147 billion to surpass XRP’s present value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given Cardano’s circulating supply of about 35.86 billion ADA, this would require a price of approximately $4.32 per token, a 572% increase from its current level. Such a rise would also establish a new record high, surpassing the token’s 2021 peak of $3.10. However, this projection assumes XRP’s market cap remains steady. Any upward movement in XRP’s price or trading volume would further expand the gap between the two assets. In July 2024, for instance, XRP’s valuation briefly climbed above $210 billion, demonstrating how quickly market dynamics can shift among top digital assets. Analysts’ and Community Outlook Despite the challenges, optimism remains within the Cardano community. Several analysts have maintained that ADA could eventually return to the $4 price range under favorable market conditions. In December 2024, Ali Martinez reiterated his target zone between $4 and $6 for taking profits on ADA, citing the token’s historical performance patterns. Similarly, Crypto Smith identified a cup-and-handle formation on ADA’s chart in July 2024, suggesting that the asset could be preparing for an extended upward move. Meanwhile, community commentator Mintern also forecasted a $4 price target for this year, though some market data providers, such as Changelly, have issued a more conservative projection, estimating that ADA may not reach this level until 2029. Cardano’s road back to the upper tier of the crypto market would require a price surge of over 570%, bringing its value above $4.32 to overtake XRP. While technical indicators and community sentiment show some optimism, prevailing market challenges and XRP’s continued strength make this goal a demanding one in the near term.

On Thursday, the company posted third-quarter results that wiped the floor with every estimate. Revenue jumped 68% year-over-year to $585 million, while earnings per share landed at $0.80, blowing past the $0.51 target. Shares immediately shot up more than 8% in after-hours trading, and by Friday morning, the stock was up 10%. And folks, this is Reddit’s cleanest beat yet since going public. Net income came in at $163 million, up from $133 million during the same period last year, a 23% increase. The company also raised its Q4 outlook. It expects revenue between $655 million and $665 million, comfortably above the Street’s $638 million forecast. Adjusted earnings guidance for Q4 is now $275 million to $285 million, outpacing projections of $259 million. This wasn’t a “beat by a little” moment. Reddit slapped expectations off the table. Reddit boosts revenue from users and licensing, but U.S. growth weakens During Q3, average global revenue per user hit $5.04, higher than the $4.82 estimate. The U.S. market, Reddit’s biggest money-maker, brought in $480 million, topping StreetAccount’s $445 million guess. International sales also edged past expectations at $105 million, versus the $104 million analysts projected. Revenue from “Other” sources, which includes data licensing, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. That’s the category where Reddit counts big names like Google and OpenAI as customers. This segment is getting a lot more attention as tech firms chase Reddit’s real-time, human-made content to train AI systems. Global daily active users (uniques) reached 116 million, a 19% increase compared to last year.Analysts were only expecting 114 million.The logged-in DAUq globally rose 14% to 50.2 million, and logged-out DAUq surged 24% to 65.8 million. But it wasn’t all clean. In the U.S., logged-in DAUq only grew 7% to 23.1 million. That’s slower than Q2’s 12% growth, and it’s the fifth straight quarter U.S. user growth has cooled. CEO Steve Huffman spoke about traffic patterns during the earnings call. He said Reddit isn’t getting much boost from AI-powered chat tools like those popping up from Google or OpenAI. “I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Steve said. Still, he believes “there’s plenty of opportunity” ahead. Company leans into marketing as it pushes for more sign-ups Steve also talked about getting more people to create accounts. He said Reddit is focused on improving the user experience and removing barriers that keep people from seeing relevant content. “The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,” Steve said. “It’s not rocket science.” COO Jen Wong said Reddit is now spending more on performance-marketing campaigns, especially in countries where it’s still new and less known. “We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,” she said. Jen added that there were gains in brand awareness and consideration, and said that’ll help build performance later. While Google and Meta also beat earnings expectations this week, Reddit’s report stood out for how far it beat both revenue and profit targets, and for how clearly it admitted U.S. user growth is starting to level off. But globally, Reddit is clearly still expanding its footprint, especially by squeezing more value out of its users and its massive data firehose.

The measure aims to free up liquidity and boost lending amid ongoing economic pressures. This development comes soon after President Javier Milei’s party achieved a critical midterm election victory. As stated before, reserve ratios remain the same and vary depending on the type of deposit or instrument. The primary difference between the current amendment and the previous one is that financial institutions, in addition to maintaining daily compliance stringency, are now permitted to moderate their daily liquidity buffer. Officials say the step is designed to help credit flow to households and businesses while maintaining overall financial stability. According to the press release, the Bank of Argentina describes the revision as the first major policy change since the midterm election, in which Milei’s party received a landslide victory in both chambers of parliament, and the market responded with optimism. The change in Argentina comes after months of high inflation and tight liquidity, which have constrained bank lending. Analysts note that while the easing is modest, it signals the central bank’s intent to support economic activity without triggering major inflationary pressures. Milei’s victory prompts central bank action The easing was warranted following the president’s victory, but also due to pressure from banking representatives. The latter’s leaders had been discussing the matter earlier, arguing that the requirement to set aside the reserves daily forces them to maintain inefficiently large balances . The sector’s leaders had called on the BCRA to adopt a monthly compliance model, but the bank opted for a gradual approach. The regulator, in this instance, assures that the easing is not a full rollback, freeing some liquidity back into the financial ecosystem, but one that will not induce inflation pressure or weaken the peso. The adjustability granted to the banks will facilitate more lending to the business and consumer sectors. The released funds will no longer be held in reserve but will be utilized through lines of credit and investments. Nevertheless, analysts are warning that this is a tepid reform rather than a root-and-branch renewal. Liquidity in Argentina’s financial system is scarce, with the BCRA much more concerned about introducing too many pesos. The eased costs come after a strong few weeks of market performance upon Milei’s presidential win. Investors were cautiously optimistic about the continuity of the short-term trend, a sentiment the BCRA is eager to challenge. Argentina moves to ease tight liquidity Argentina’s banking sector has struggled with liquidity restrictions for well over a year. The interest rate on peso-denominated assets had reached and even surpassed triple-digit figures, depleting profit margins and the demand for credit. Some banks had stopped issuing mortgages in the past few months, given the weakening economy and soaring delinquencies approaching post-crisis highs. The high reserve demands and the fear of issuing loans resulted in a credit freeze that strangled the cash flow of small firms. The Milei regime has expressed its unwavering commitment to maintaining the value of the peso and the trust of the people in the financial system. Therefore, there has been no doubt that the “reserve rules” would be lifted. Although they were tightened recently to ban speculative currency runs on the peso, they also limited most banks’ ability to borrow and lend, prompting demands for a return to greater socialization. Policy makers are likely to proceed conservatively, despite the expectations that further steps towards normality are to be taken. If the peso or inflation were to deteriorate unexpectedly, much as it has done before, global liquidity injections could trigger a panic or surge in currency depreciation that would erase recent value gains. In the short term, banks will utilize the new break to help with daily liquidity management and address immediate financing difficulties. In the medium term, if inflation and currency profits numbers continue, more relaxed reserve rules could be in place. For now, the change is minor in absolute terms, but it exemplifies the intent to continue an economic recovery among Argentina’s banking authorities.

This remarkable Bitcoin price surge has captivated investors and analysts alike, signaling a potentially robust period for the leading digital asset. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is now trading at an impressive $108,007 on platforms like the Binance USDT market, showcasing strong momentum. What’s Driving This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the forces behind such a rapid ascent is crucial for any market observer. The current Bitcoin price surge isn’t an isolated event; it’s often a confluence of various factors that collectively bolster investor confidence and market demand. While specific triggers can be complex, several key elements are likely contributing to this upward trajectory: Increased Institutional Interest: More traditional financial institutions are exploring and investing in Bitcoin, bringing significant capital and legitimacy to the crypto space. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties can sometimes push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is often seen as a hedge against inflation or traditional market volatility. Supply Dynamics: Events such as the Bitcoin halving, which reduces the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, inherently create scarcity and can drive up prices over time. Positive Market Sentiment: A general optimistic outlook among retail and institutional investors can create a self-reinforcing cycle of buying pressure. Is This Sustainable? Understanding Market Dynamics While the current momentum is strong, the sustainability of any significant market movement, including this Bitcoin price surge , is always a pertinent question. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and price corrections are a natural part of its cycle. However, analyzing underlying fundamentals can offer clues. Many analysts look at technical indicators, trading volumes, and broader economic trends to gauge future movements. A sustained rally often requires consistent buying interest, coupled with favorable market conditions. It’s important for investors to remain vigilant and understand that market sentiment can shift rapidly. What Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Mean for Investors? For those involved in the crypto market, a substantial price movement like this offers both opportunities and considerations. The Bitcoin price surge can significantly impact portfolio values and influence future investment strategies. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: Existing holders see the value of their investments increase, potentially leading to substantial gains. Increased Market Confidence: A strong rally can attract new investors and instill greater confidence in the long-term viability of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Broader Adoption: Higher prices often bring more mainstream media attention, which can further accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption and integration into global finance. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Risk: While prices are rising, the potential for sharp pullbacks always exists. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New investors might feel pressured to buy at elevated prices, potentially exposing them to greater risk if a correction occurs. Risk Management: It’s crucial for investors to have a clear strategy, including setting stop-loss orders and diversifying their portfolios. Actionable Insights for Investors: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the fundamentals and risks associated with any investment. Consider Long-Term Holdings: Many Bitcoin advocates suggest a long-term holding strategy, often referred to as “HODLing,” to ride out short-term fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore other cryptocurrencies or asset classes to mitigate risk. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of the Bitcoin Price Surge Predicting the exact future of any asset, especially a volatile one like Bitcoin, is challenging. However, several ongoing trends suggest continued interest and potential for growth. The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by major corporations, the development of more accessible investment vehicles, and the evolving regulatory landscape all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s path. This latest Bitcoin price surge serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s dynamic nature and its capacity to deliver significant returns. As the digital economy continues to evolve, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, constantly redefining financial possibilities. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $108,000 marks an exciting chapter in its journey.

He also suggested that if countries needed smaller foreign reserves because payments were easier and cheaper, that would shift long-held financial balances. That kind of shift could face strong pushback. Scott noted a decentralized payment and reserve setup “ruins the existing power structure,” meaning political resistance is likely. Community Voices Split The post prompted a range of reactions from within the XRP crowd. Nenad Stojkovic said Ripple stands out because of its infrastructure and regulatory steps, calling it a rare “serious financial company” in crypto — a view Scott agreed with. One user, SonOfRichard, argued Ripple’s new product Ripple Prime might lift XRP even without new laws, since it’s already compliant with some rules. Scott pushed back, replying that real progress still needs clear laws. Other voices were critical; Tommy Raz questioned the company’s top leaders. He spoke in their favor, saying their actions match the stated mission and that some online comments, especially from Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz, get misunderstood.

53842265,617232,1761868840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53842265.jpeg,Hong Kong Regulator Sounds Alarm on Companies Holding Crypto In Treasuries,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-regulator-alarm-holding-crypto-treasuries/,"Hong Kong’s SFC has raised concerns about the rise of digital asset treasuries, companies that put crypto on their balance sheet. Hong Kong SFC Is Closely Monitoring Crypto Treasury Developments As reported by the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is keeping an eye on how firms are using crypto as part of their treasury management. The term Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) refers to a public company that acquires and holds Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to give stockholders exposure to price movements. Often, the stock price of such firms trades at a premium compared to their treasury reserves, and this seems to be where the SFC’s concern lies. Kelvin Wong Tin-yau, the regulator’s chairman, noted, “The SFC is concerned about whether DAT companies’ share prices are traded at a substantial premium above the cost of their DAT holdings.” Wong’s statement comes a week after Bloomberg reported that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) blocked a DAT strategy pivot for at least five firms in recent months. HKEX operates the city’s main stock exchange, one of the largest markets in the world. The bourse operator, which names the Hong Kong Government as its largest shareholder, challenged the plans of these companies, raising compliance issues with rules that prohibit large liquid holdings. Wong revealed that the SFC is closely monitoring DATs and plans to strengthen public awareness about the associated risks. “We caution investors to fully understand the underlying risks of DAT,” said the SFC chairman. The DAT strategy was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which adopted a Bitcoin treasury as its core business back in 2020. The company’s reserves have since grown to 640,808 BTC, worth a whopping $70.6 billion. The firm paid about $47.4 billion in total to assemble its BTC treasury, so at the current price of the crypto, it’s sitting at a healthy profit of almost 49%. Strategy’s success has unleashed a DAT wave, as other companies rush to replicate the model. Bitcoin isn’t the only asset that corporates are looking at today; there has also been a rise in DATs focused on Ethereum and Solana. Bitmine owns the largest ETH treasury in the world, containing about 3.34 million tokens, equivalent to $13 billion. While Forward Industries is the king of SOL DATs with 6,822 coins or $1.3 billion in assets. DATs represent just one route that traders can take for gaining indirect exposure to digital assets. Another path is through the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , investment vehicles that trade on traditional exchanges and buy the underlying crypto on behalf of investors. Demand for spot ETFs appears to be weak right now, however, as according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant , the 7-day change in the netflow of the US Bitcoin funds has dropped to a negative value of 281 BTC, which is the lowest since April. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $110,000, down around 2.7% over the last 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto DAT|Cryptocurrency|DAT|digital asset treasury,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 00:00:40
53842247,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88093,1761868858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ETH Retests Support, LINK Eyes $46 Target, & BlockDAG’s Genesis Day Countdown Shapes the Best Crypto for the Future",https://timestabloid.com/eth-retests-support-link-eyes-46-target-blockdags-genesis/,"Crypto markets are navigating a transition phase where sustained structure matters more than speculation. Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK) are demonstrating that principle, each showing resilience despite market compression. Ethereum’s price outlook remains constructive as it retests support levels before what analysts describe as a probable rebound, while Chainlink continues to impress by holding near $17.85 with a long-term target around $46. But even as these established names strengthen their cases, BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for a launch phase that blends infrastructure readiness with event-driven momentum. Its Genesis Day countdown signals a complete ecosystem rollout that aims to redefine engagement and accessibility. Together, these three highlight how strong fundamentals define the best crypto for the future. Ethereum Price Outlook: Stability Above Key Support Ethereum is trading around key structural support as traders watch for confirmation of a rebound that could set the tone for the next market leg. Analysts note that ETH’s price continues to hold near the $3,000–$3,200 range, showing stability after a series of volatile sessions. On-chain data reflects steady staking inflows and declining exchange reserves, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. Technically, Ethereum remains above its ascending support line, with momentum indicators showing the potential for renewed upward movement. A confirmed retest of $3,000 followed by a close above $3,400 could signal a return to medium-term strength. Institutional flows through ETH-based ETFs continue to offer background support. While short-term noise persists, Ethereum’s network dominance in DeFi and stable long-term adoption rates reinforce its position as one of the best crypto assets for future growth. Chainlink Price Update: Steady Growth and Oracle Adoption Chainlink’s performance continues to validate its growing role as a cornerstone of decentralized data infrastructure. The token is holding steady near $17.85, consolidating after a period of gradual appreciation. Analysts maintain a bullish long-term target of $46, driven by sustained oracle demand and Chainlink’s integration across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Recent updates to its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) have also expanded enterprise adoption, further strengthening the project’s outlook. On-chain data indicates increased wallet activity and reduced exchange supply, both signaling confidence among holders. Technical setups suggest that maintaining current support could pave the way for a mid-range move toward $25 before long-term targets come into play. In the context of the best crypto for the future, Chainlink stands as a model of steady execution and consistent real-world application within the data connectivity layer of blockchain technology. BlockDAG’s Genesis Day & Keynote 4: Final Launch Phase Underway While Ethereum and Chainlink sustain network confidence, BlockDAG is entering its defining chapter. The project’s Genesis Day is set for November 26, marking the culmination of a presale that has raised $435 million with only 4.5B coins remaining. Priced at $0.005 in Batch 32, the project is now preparing for its Genesis Day on November 26 and planned listing scheduled for February 10, 2026 it will officially open the network to the public. The upcoming Keynote 4 event will detail this transition, unveiling final integration updates and mainnet readiness milestones. Every element of BlockDAG’s ecosystem, from its hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Engagement consensus to its distributed X-Series miners, is being synchronized for seamless deployment. The infrastructure already supports speeds between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS, combining DAG scalability with blockchain-level security. Beyond the technology, the scale of community participation stands out. 3.5 million X1 mobile miners and thousands of X-Series hardware units are active or in shipment, ensuring immediate decentralization at launch. Exchange partnerships with 20 confirmed CEX listings further anchor market confidence. Genesis Day represents not just a launch but a transformation, a shift from presale community to public blockchain operation. As the countdown continues, BlockDAG’s execution and transparency place it firmly among the best crypto for the future, merging working infrastructure with a growing global audience. The Bottom Line Ethereum’s steady recovery from support underscores its technical strength, and Chainlink’s expanding oracle integrations continue to validate its importance to blockchain interoperability. Both projects showcase resilience within an evolving market. Yet BlockDAG’s transition into its Genesis Day launch phase defines a different kind of maturity, one based on real utility, delivered milestones, and transparent execution. With $435 million raised, 3.5 million X1 users engaged, and 20 exchanges preparing listings, BlockDAG’s readiness separates it from speculation-driven ventures. As investors search for the best crypto for the future, Ethereum and Chainlink represent proven networks, but BlockDAG represents the next evolution: a blockchain already built for global scale before it even lists.

53842387,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88141,1761869151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO Reveals the Truth About 100 Billion XRP Supply,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-reveals-the-truth-about-100-billion-xrp-supply/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has explained the reasoning behind the XRP Ledger’s decision to issue a total of 100 billion XRP tokens . The clarification came after a community member questioned why the network’s creators chose such a large number instead of a smaller or larger supply. When the XRP Ledger was launched in 2012 , its three founders, David Schwartz, Arthur Britto, and Jed McCaleb, pre-mined all 100 billion XRP. Unlike Bitcoin, which gradually releases new coins through mining, XRP’s full supply was created from the start. Since then, questions about this fixed figure have continued to circulate among users. How the Question Arose The latest discussion began when Diep Sanh, a well-known XRP supporter, asked on X why the creators of the XRP Ledger decided on a total of 100 billion tokens. He questioned whether there was a technical or symbolic reason behind the number. In response, Schwartz outlined three main factors that influenced the choice: the need for divisibility to support small transactions, the ability to fit the total within a 64-bit integer for processing efficiency, and the desire for a simple, memorable figure. To meet three criteria: 1) Adequate divisibility. 2) Fits in 64-bit integer. 3) Easy for humans to remember. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 29, 2025 Reasons Behind the 100 Billion Supply Schwartz first explained that the large supply ensures that XRP can be divided into small units for microtransactions. Each token can be split into one million drops, allowing the network to handle very small payments efficiently. This level of precision supports XRP’s role as a utility token for cross-border transactions and payment settlements. He also noted that the XRP Ledger has a practical limit to how finely tokens can be divided, but the current structure is sufficient for its intended use cases. The system’s divisibility ensures that XRP can facilitate both large and minimal-value transfers with ease. The second reason is technical compatibility. By setting the total number of XRP at 100 billion, the ledger ensures that all token amounts fit comfortably within a 64-bit unsigned integer, a computer data type that can store numbers up to more than 18 quintillion. This helps the ledger avoid rounding errors and maintain fast transaction processing. Finally, Schwartz said the number was chosen partly for simplicity. A round figure like 100 billion is easier for users to remember and discuss, making it more accessible for the public compared to arbitrary or uneven totals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Views on XRP’s Total Supply Beyond Schwartz’s comments, several community members have expressed differing opinions about whether the 100 billion supply is sufficient. In December 2024, Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of The Black Swan Capitalist, argued that the growing demand for tokenized assets, stablecoins such as RLUSD , and liquidity solutions could make XRP’s total supply appear limited in the future. He suggested that, as tokenization and institutional use cases expand, demand might outpace availability. Similarly, in June 2024, game developer Chad Steingraber highlighted that a significant portion of XRP remains locked in escrow or held by large investors. According to him, the amount actually circulating in the open market is much smaller than the total supply, which could create scarcity over time if demand increases. Another community member, Dave Lui, expressed a similar view in 2020, noting that while 100 billion XRP might seem excessive, it becomes logical when considering the asset’s evolving role in financial systems and the growing participation of institutions likely to hold substantial amounts for long periods. In March 2024, XRP supporter Jack the Rippler also defended the figure, stating that solving global payment inefficiencies, a market worth trillions of dollars, requires a high supply to ensure sufficient liquidity across global markets. David Schwartz’s explanation clarifies that XRP’s 100 billion token supply was not arbitrary but a deliberate choice balancing divisibility, system efficiency, and user accessibility. While some in the community believe this amount may prove insufficient as XRP adoption grows, others see it as a necessary foundation for a network designed to support global-scale payments.

Two new addresses, widely presumed to be connected to crypto mining giant Bitmain, have recently executed a substantial Bitmain ETH withdrawal . This move involves a staggering 44,036 ETH, valued at approximately $170 million, pulled from major exchanges Kraken and BitGo. This shocking development has caught the attention of market analysts and investors alike, prompting questions about its potential impact. What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitmain ETH Withdrawal? Onchain-Lense, a reputable analytics firm, first reported this notable transaction. The details indicate that these two newly created addresses collectively transferred 44,036 Ethereum tokens out of Kraken and BitGo. Such a large-scale Bitmain ETH withdrawal immediately caught the attention of market observers and analysts due to its sheer size and the prominence of the entity involved. For context, Bitmain (BMNR) is a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining hardware industry. Their actions often carry significant weight and can offer insights into broader market trends or their operational strategies. This particular movement of funds is not just about the sheer volume; it also raises questions about the intent behind such a substantial transfer. Is it a strategic operational adjustment, a shift in asset management, or something else entirely? The crypto community is eager to understand the implications. Why Does a Bitmain ETH Withdrawal Command So Much Attention? When an entity as prominent as Bitmain moves such a colossal amount of digital assets, the crypto community pays close attention. Here’s why this Bitmain ETH withdrawal is particularly noteworthy: Scale of Funds: $170 million in ETH is a significant sum, capable of impacting market liquidity if sold. Bitmain’s Influence: As a key player in the mining sector, Bitmain’s treasury management decisions can reflect broader industry sentiment or upcoming strategic shifts. New Addresses: The use of new addresses suggests a deliberate, perhaps strategic, decision rather than routine operational transfers, adding a layer of intrigue. Understanding the motivations behind such a move is crucial for investors and market analysts. It could signal various intentions, from consolidating assets to preparing for new investments or even potential off-market transactions. This makes monitoring such events vital for staying ahead in the crypto space. Unpacking the Market Impact of Bitmain’s ETH Movement Could this substantial Bitmain ETH withdrawal influence the Ethereum market? Large movements of assets from exchanges often spark speculation. When significant amounts of crypto are withdrawn from exchanges, it can sometimes be interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell immediately. Conversely, such a large sum being moved could also be seen as preparation for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, which wouldn’t directly impact exchange prices but still represents a shift in ownership. The market typically reacts to perceived supply and demand dynamics, and a major withdrawal changes the available supply on exchanges. Investors often monitor these on-chain metrics closely for clues about institutional sentiment and potential future price action. The immediate impact on ETH’s price remains to be seen, but the event certainly adds a layer of intrigue to the market. Will this lead to increased volatility or a quiet repositioning of assets? The Critical Role of On-Chain Analytics in Tracking Major Crypto Moves This event underscores the invaluable nature of on-chain analytics. Without platforms like Onchain-Lense, such significant transfers might go unnoticed by the broader public. On-chain data provides transparency into the otherwise opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. Analysts use these tools to track whale movements, identify potential accumulation or distribution phases, and gain insights into the behavior of large entities. Monitoring a Bitmain ETH withdrawal or similar large transactions helps in: Identifying Trends: Spotting patterns in large-holder behavior, which can indicate market sentiment. Risk Assessment: Understanding potential market volatility or significant shifts in asset allocation. Informed Decision-Making: Providing crucial data points for investors and traders to make better choices. The ability to trace funds, even through new addresses, offers a unique window into the flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem, enhancing market intelligence and security. What’s Next After This Significant Bitmain ETH Withdrawal? While the exact reasons behind Bitmain’s latest move are not yet public, the cryptocurrency community will undoubtedly continue to monitor these addresses for further activity. Whether this Bitmain ETH withdrawal is a precursor to a new strategic initiative, an internal asset reallocation, or something else entirely, it highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Staying informed about such significant on-chain events is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. It reminds us that even major players like Bitmain are constantly adjusting their strategies in response to the evolving digital asset landscape. Keep an eye on the blockchain; it always tells a compelling story of capital movement and market shifts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of Bitmain withdrawing such a large amount of ETH? A1: A large Bitmain ETH withdrawal is significant because Bitmain is a major player in the crypto mining industry. Such a move can signal strategic shifts, asset consolidation, or preparation for large-scale investments or transactions, potentially influencing market sentiment and liquidity. Q2: Where did Bitmain withdraw the 44,036 ETH from? A2: The 44,036 ETH, valued at approximately $170 million, was withdrawn from two prominent cryptocurrency exchanges: Kraken and BitGo. Q3: How was this Bitmain ETH withdrawal identified? A3: This significant transaction was identified and reported by Onchain-Lense, an analytics firm specializing in tracking and analyzing cryptocurrency movements on the blockchain. Their tools provide transparency into large-scale transfers. Q4: Could this withdrawal impact the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A4: While not a direct guarantee of price movement, large withdrawals from exchanges can reduce the immediate supply available for trading, which some interpret as a bullish signal. However, the funds could also be intended for an over-the-counter (OTC) sale, which would not directly affect exchange prices. Market observers will be watching closely. Q5: What are “new addresses” in this context? A5: “New addresses” refer to cryptocurrency wallet addresses that have not been previously associated with significant activity or identified with a known entity like Bitmain. Their use for such a large Bitmain ETH withdrawal suggests a deliberate and perhaps strategic decision to manage these specific funds.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.4013 Market Cap $747.69M Trading Volume $131.39M Circulating Supply 1.89B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.4489 24-hour Low $0.3879 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 25.53% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.6240 14-Day RSI 36.67 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.7275 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP remains weak near $0.40 with RSI nearing oversold, hinting at a potential bounce. A close above $0.42 could confirm recovery, but failure to hold $0.39 opens downside risk. Optimism 1-day price chart As of October 31, Optimism (OP/USDT) is hovering at $0.3999, down 0.10%, marking another day of sideways movement following persistent bearish pressure. The Bollinger Bands show a constricting formation, with the lower band near $0.3912 acting as immediate support and the midline at $0.4432 now a firm resistance barrier. This tightening range indicates reduced volatility but also hints that a breakout move may be brewing. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains weakly positive, yet the histogram is fading, signaling momentum loss among buyers. The RSI at 33.53 hovers close to oversold levels, suggesting the coin is undervalued in the short term and may soon see relief buying. However, the lack of follow-through above $0.41 keeps optimism muted for now. If OP can hold above $0.39, the next bullish target sits around $0.43, with a secondary resistance at $0.45 (the mid-Bollinger level). But a drop below $0.39 could invite another pullback toward $0.37–$0.36. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows OP trading at $0.4005, up slightly by 0.05% after briefly testing $0.39 earlier. The Alligator indicator lines remain spread and sloping downward, confirming a prevailing short-term bearish structure. However, the green line flattening near $0.416 suggests that selling pressure is slowing, with consolidation possibly forming around this zone. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The PVT (70.65M) reflects mild accumulation after consistent distribution over the past few sessions, and the Balance of Power (0.09) suggests a neutral-to-slightly-bullish tone returning among intraday traders. For any meaningful reversal, OP must reclaim the $0.415–$0.42 zone; otherwise, it risks re-entering a sideways-to-downtrend channel below $0.395. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5355 SELL SMA 5 $0.5062 SELL SMA 10 $0.4874 SELL SMA 21 $0.4824 SELL SMA 50 $0.6240 SELL SMA 100 $0.6757 SELL SMA 200 $0.7275 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5240 SELL EMA 5 $0.5753 SELL EMA 10 $0.6350 SELL EMA 21 $0.6785 SELL EMA 50 $0.6944 SELL EMA 100 $0.7107 SELL EMA 200 $0.8487 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is stabilizing after an extended selloff, but the trend remains fragile. Holding above $0.39 is key to building a base for a mild rebound toward $0.43, while slipping below that would confirm continued weakness. Momentum indicators suggest a possible short-term bounce, but broader recovery needs stronger buyer conviction. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future?

The crypto market is buzzing with a renewed sense of caution as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has recently fallen five points, landing at a significant 29. This reading clearly indicates that a state of fear continues to grip investors, according to the latest data from Alternative.me. For anyone involved in digital assets, understanding this shift in sentiment is absolutely critical. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : What Does it Measure? Many wonder what exactly this index is and why it holds so much weight. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale: zero signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed.’ This comprehensive index compiles various data points to offer a holistic view of market sentiment. Its calculation relies on a blend of crucial factors: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates. High volatility often signals a nervous market. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a declining market can indicate panic selling. Social Media Mentions (15%): An analysis of crypto-related hashtags and sentiment on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Surveys (15%): Polling investors to understand their current outlook (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market share often suggests investors are moving into safer assets. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracking search queries related to crypto, especially ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash,’ can indicate fear. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 29 Matters for You A low reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , like the current 29, is more than just a number; it reflects the collective psychology of the market. When fear dominates, investors tend to sell off their holdings, often leading to price declines. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes presented unique buying opportunities for long-term investors, as assets might be undervalued. Conversely, extreme greed can signal an overheated market ripe for a correction. This persistent fear can be a challenging environment for both new and experienced traders. It tests conviction and often leads to emotional decision-making. Understanding that the market is driven by these fundamental human emotions—fear and greed—allows investors to approach their strategies with a more rational perspective. The index serves as a valuable counter-indicator, suggesting that when others are fearful, it might be a time to be cautious, yet also observant for potential entry points. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Low So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signaling fear, what should you do? It is crucial to avoid impulsive reactions. Instead, consider a few strategic approaches to protect your portfolio and potentially capitalize on future growth. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making a large, single investment, spread your investments over time. This reduces the risk associated with market timing. Conduct Thorough Research: Use this period to dive deep into projects with strong fundamentals, solid roadmaps, and active development teams. Fear often indiscriminately impacts all assets, not just the weak ones. Reassess Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. This might be a good time to trim highly speculative assets if you’re overexposed. Focus on the Long Term: For many, crypto investing is a marathon, not a sprint. Short-term market fluctuations, while unsettling, often smooth out over a longer investment horizon. Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : A Broader Perspective While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a valuable snapshot of market sentiment, it is important to remember that it is just one tool in an investor’s toolkit. Relying solely on any single indicator can be misleading. The broader economic landscape, regulatory developments, technological advancements within specific projects, and global events all play significant roles in shaping the crypto market. Always combine sentiment analysis with fundamental and technical analysis. Look at on-chain data, read whitepapers, and stay informed about macroeconomic trends. This holistic approach ensures you are making well-rounded, informed decisions rather than simply reacting to fear or greed. Due diligence remains paramount in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Navigating Fear with Foresight The latest drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 29 serves as a potent reminder that fear is a persistent force in the crypto market. While it can be unsettling, understanding this sentiment allows investors to approach their strategies with greater clarity and less emotion. By focusing on sound investment principles, conducting diligent research, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate these fearful times more effectively. Remember, informed decisions are your best defense against market volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Although dYdX will initially allow American users to spot trade major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, it will prevent U.S. users from accessing its derivative products, including perpetual contracts. The exchange will also charge lower trading fees, ranging between 50 and 65 basis points for American traders, as the company strives to attract more liquidity and compete with existing U.S. cryptocurrency trading platforms. During the interview, the president of the decentralized exchange welcomed this decision as a new direction for the exchange, which specializes in derivatives. Notably, sources highlighted that dYdX was previously unavailable for American users. dYdX eyes the US market for expansion amid Trump’s pro-crypto stance Centralized exchanges, such as Kraken and Coinbase, function as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. However, decentralized platforms such as dYdX tend to take a different approach by eliminating intermediaries and allowing users to trade directly on a blockchain network that supports cryptocurrencies. For dYdX, its main focus is on perpetual contracts, a type of derivative that permits traders to bet on the price of an asset without actually owning it. Compared to regular futures contracts, these contracts do not have an expiration date. Following the launch announcement , the San Francisco-based firm recently shared data highlighting that its total trading volume has surged over $1.5 trillion since it started operations. To remain competitive in the industry, the platform announced its intention to expand services by launching spot trading for Solana and other related cryptocurrencies in the US by the end of the year, according to Eddie Zhang, the president of dYdX. “It’s crucial for us as a platform to have something in the United States, because I believe it shows the direction we want to head in,” said Zhang. This decision follows US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, adopted this year, which has contributed to a favourable environment for crypto trading. To support this claim, sources noted that Trump’s support for the crypto ecosystem led to the withdrawal of several lawsuits against leading crypto platforms and a significant shift in the approach of financial regulators toward developing specific rules for digital assets. The US SEC and CFTC consider exposing crypto perpetuals to crypto trade Regarding dYdX’s intention to enter the US market, Zhang shared that when this plan succeeds, they will reduce their trading fees by up to 50%, lowering them to between 50 and 65 basis points. He further explained that although perpetual contracts will not be available in the United States, dYdX hopes the nation’s regulators will ultimately issue guidance enabling decentralized platforms to offer such products. Industry analysts say dYdX’s move could pressure other exchanges to adjust fees and expand their offerings in the U.S., while also signaling growing mainstream adoption of decentralized trading platforms. The company has not yet confirmed the exact date of its U.S. launch or the full list of supported assets; however, the end-of-year target remains its stated goal. In the meantime, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement last month, mentioning that they will consider allowing crypto perpetuals to trade on regulated platforms in the country. Concerning this decision, the commissioners initiated a combined effort known as “Project Crypto-Crypto Sprint” to clarify the regulations for digital assets. In early October 2025, they also outlined plans for a joint roundtable to tackle decentralized finance (DeFi) and perpetual contracts. The agencies’ move marks another significant milestone in the crypto ecosystem, signaling a new approach to a favorable crypto trading environment and boosting investor confidence.

A staggering $13.42 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options and $2.46 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC. This isn’t just a routine expiry; it represents a substantial portion of open interest, making it a crucial moment for traders and investors alike. Understanding the mechanics behind this event is key to navigating the potential market shifts that may follow. What is This Massive Crypto Options Expiration All About? At its core, a crypto options contract grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. When that date arrives, the options “expire.” If the contract is “in the money” (profitable), it can be exercised; otherwise, it typically expires worthless. The sheer scale of today’s expiration, as reported by crypto options exchange Deribit, highlights its importance. Billions in notional value are on the line, creating an environment where market participants are closely watching price action. This volume can often lead to increased volatility as market makers and large holders adjust their positions. Decoding Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain Price for Crypto Options To truly grasp the potential impact of a crypto options expiration , we need to look at two vital metrics: the put/call ratio and the max pain price. Put/Call Ratio: This ratio indicates the sentiment among options traders. Put options are essentially bets on a price decrease, while call options are bets on a price increase. A ratio below 1, like the 0.7 seen for both BTC and ETH options today, suggests that more call options are open compared to put options. This typically implies a more bullish sentiment among options traders leading up to the expiration. Max Pain Price: This is the price point at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. For Bitcoin, the max pain price is $114,000, and for Ethereum, it stands at $4,100. Historically, the price of the underlying asset can gravitate towards the max pain point as expiration approaches, driven by the actions of market makers who aim to minimize their liabilities. These figures provide valuable clues about where the market might be headed in the short term. However, it is important to remember that they are not definitive predictors. How Does This Crypto Options Expiration Impact Bitcoin and Ethereum? The immediate effect of a large crypto options expiration often manifests as increased market volatility. Leading up to 8:00 a.m. UTC, and even shortly after, we might observe sharper price movements for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market makers, who typically hold balanced books of options, may need to buy or sell the underlying assets to hedge their positions as contracts expire. This activity can influence spot prices. If many call options are in the money, for example, market makers might have to buy BTC or ETH to fulfill their obligations, potentially pushing prices up. Conversely, if many put options are exercised, they might sell, exerting downward pressure. While the max pain price can act as a magnet, it does not guarantee the asset will close at that level. The actual price action depends on a multitude of factors, including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic news, and significant spot market activity. Navigating the Market: Strategies for Today’s Crypto Options Expiration For those involved in the crypto markets, understanding today’s crypto options expiration is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Volatility: Be prepared for potentially heightened price swings. If you are an active trader, ensure your risk management strategies are robust. Observe Max Pain: Watch how Bitcoin and Ethereum prices react as they approach their respective max pain prices of $114,000 and $4,100. Significant resistance or support could emerge around these levels. Context is Key: Remember that options expiration is one factor among many. Always consider the broader market trends, news events, and on-chain data before making any decisions. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, the immediate impact of an options expiration is often transient. Focus on your long-term investment thesis rather than short-term fluctuations. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the sophisticated financial instruments that now play a role within it. In conclusion, today’s massive crypto options expiration for Bitcoin and Ethereum is a significant event, bringing billions in notional value to a head. With specific put/call ratios and max pain prices acting as guides, the market anticipates potential volatility and strategic price movements. While these expirations offer insights into short-term market dynamics, they are just one piece of the complex puzzle. Staying informed and exercising caution remains paramount for all participants in this evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto options contracts? Crypto options contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on or before a certain date. They are financial derivatives used for hedging or speculation. 2. What does it mean when crypto options expire? When crypto options expire, the contract reaches its end date. If the option is profitable (in the money), the holder can choose to exercise it. If it’s not profitable (out of the money), it typically expires worthless, and the holder loses the premium paid. 3. What is the “max pain price” in crypto options? The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless. It represents the point of maximum financial loss for options holders and can sometimes act as a magnet for the underlying asset’s price around expiration. 4. How does a put/call ratio of 0.7 for crypto options indicate market sentiment? A put/call ratio of 0.7 means there are fewer put options (bearish bets) than call options (bullish bets) open. This suggests a predominantly bullish sentiment among options traders, as more participants are betting on a price increase rather than a decrease. 5. Should I trade based solely on crypto options expiration events? While crypto options expiration can influence market volatility and price action, it is not advisable to trade based solely on this event. Always consider a comprehensive analysis, including broader market trends, technical indicators, and fundamental news, as part of your trading strategy.

Activity concentrates in tokens tied to measurable drivers such as policy developments, liquidity programs, and on-chain participation. MemeCore, Aerodrome Finance, and Tether Gold all posted gains through October 30, offering a look at how traders are repositioning around utility and global sentiment instead of broad speculative risk. The Altcoin Season Index sits near 28, while Bitcoin dominance remains around 59%. These readings show a market where liquidity is still concentrated in major assets, but smaller coins can attract inflows when linked to clear narratives. MemeCore: Community Tailwinds and Steady Screens MemeCore (M) is currently trading near $2.49 , up by about 5% in 24 hours. Market data indicates a steady climb in volume across mid-tier exchanges, supported by active retail participation and recurring social interest. The structure of MemeCore’s trading has improved slightly compared with earlier in the month. Spreads have tightened across active pairs, and price discovery has remained consistent throughout regional sessions. Liquidity across both spot and perpetual markets suggests traders are staying involved, though the pace remains moderate. Whether the trend endures depends on participation during the coming week and whether cross-market depth can hold steady while volatility compresses. Aerodrome Finance: Accumulation and Base Activity Aerodrome Finance (AERo) now trades around $1.01, showing an increase of about 3.3% in 24 hours. The token’s movement follows continued lending and liquidity operations on its associated network. Visible accumulation is seen from recurring program flows, particularly around the one-dollar mark, which has served as both resistance and support over recent weeks. AERO Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Volumes have stayed consistent, supported by on-chain activity that signals gradual accumulation instead of speculative surges. Market participants are watching whether Aerodrome can maintain stability above this threshold, which would indicate a more reliable trading base. If the pair continues to attract volume from multiple venues, it could extend its recovery in measured steps instead of single-session bursts. Tether Gold: Crypto’s Gold Proxy Follows Bullion Tether Gold (XAUT) trades near $4,026 , up about 1.9% in 24 hours. The move tracks the rally in global bullion prices after reports of easing tensions between the United States and China after their trade meeting . Market data shows gold gaining traction as investors rotate into hedging assets amid expectations of softer policy rates and improved trade visibility. Because XAUT is backed by physical gold, its price action often mirrors the performance of the global metal market. Recent strength in bullion has translated directly into token demand, drawing renewed interest from portfolios seeking on-chain alternatives to traditional hedges. The relationship between gold and its token counterpart has remained close, suggesting that real-world developments continue to influence digital asset pricing when sentiment turns defensive.

Trump pic.twitter.com/6wtEeVbiWp — The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 30, 2025 Altcoin Season Market Outlook The overall market remains cautious. The Altcoin Season Index below 30 signals that broad participation has yet to return, and Bitcoin continues to absorb most inflows. Still, certain altcoins are managing to attract attention by connecting with identifiable catalysts. MemeCore benefits from social-driven liquidity, Aerodrome gains from structured yield participation, and Tether Gold reflects shifts in global asset preference. Together they form a picture of a fragmented but functioning market where selective conviction replaces generalized optimism. Sustained improvement will depend on whether depth and cross-market activity expand in the coming sessions, allowing capital to flow beyond a handful of headline-driven assets.

The latest reading from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is certainly turning heads. It has registered a notable drop to 28, down four points from yesterday. This isn’t just a number; it’s a significant indicator that could shape your investment decisions and highlight current market dynamics. Let’s dive into what this crucial shift means for altcoins and Bitcoin. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Measure? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is key to navigating the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. This unique index, provided by the reputable cryptocurrency data platform CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market sentiment. It’s calculated by comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against the performance of Bitcoin. The timeframe for this comparison is the past 90 days, offering a snapshot of recent trends. So, when is an altcoin season officially declared? It happens when a significant majority—specifically 75%—of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over that 90-day period. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, we are in what’s known as a Bitcoin season. A reading closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index strongly indicates an altcoin season, suggesting broad strength across the altcoin market. Decoding the Current Altcoin Season Index Reading of 28 A reading of 28 on the Altcoin Season Index is a clear signal that we are currently far from an altcoin season. In fact, it points strongly towards a prevailing Bitcoin season. This low number indicates that a vast majority of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin over the last three months. What are the implications for investors? A low Altcoin Season Index suggests that capital might be flowing out of altcoins and consolidating into Bitcoin. This could be due to various factors, including a flight to perceived safety during uncertain times or simply Bitcoin asserting its dominance after a significant price movement. For many, this reading serves as a warning sign for altcoin-heavy portfolios. It encourages a closer look at diversification and risk management strategies, reminding us that market leadership can shift quickly. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Dropping Now? Several factors could contribute to the recent dip in the Altcoin Season Index . Market movements are rarely singular events; they are often influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic trends, specific crypto events, and shifting investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s Strength: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong rally, it can draw liquidity away from altcoins, causing them to lag. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties can push investors towards more established assets, and in crypto, that often means Bitcoin. Regulatory Concerns: Heightened regulatory scrutiny on certain altcoins or the broader crypto space can dampen investor enthusiasm for riskier assets. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin gains, investors might be rotating profits back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. These challenges for altcoins highlight Bitcoin’s foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. When the market is risk-averse, Bitcoin often becomes the preferred choice. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights During a Low Altcoin Season Index When the Altcoin Season Index is low, it’s not necessarily a time for panic, but rather for strategic reflection. Understanding this indicator can empower you to make more informed decisions about your crypto portfolio. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider if your current altcoin allocation aligns with a Bitcoin-dominant market. Focus on Bitcoin: During a Bitcoin season, concentrating a larger portion of your portfolio in Bitcoin might be a prudent strategy. High-Conviction Altcoins: If you hold altcoins, focus on those with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. These may be more resilient. Risk Management: Implement stop-losses or consider taking some profits to reduce exposure to more volatile altcoins. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, sentiment, and the Altcoin Season Index for signs of a potential shift. The benefit of paying attention to the Altcoin Season Index is that it provides a quantitative measure to help guide your investment thesis, rather than relying solely on anecdotal evidence or social media hype. A Compelling Summary of the Altcoin Season Index The recent drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 28 is a compelling signal of the current market landscape. It strongly indicates a Bitcoin-dominant period, where altcoins are generally underperforming. This index is a powerful tool for understanding the broader trends in the crypto market, helping investors discern whether it’s a time for broad altcoin growth or a period where Bitcoin is leading the charge. While a low reading might seem daunting for altcoin holders, it also presents an opportunity to refine strategies, focus on robust assets, and prepare for future shifts. Staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index can truly give you an edge in making strategic decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Altcoin Season? An Altcoin Season is declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It signifies a broad rally across the altcoin market. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The Altcoin Season Index is calculated by comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. What does a low Altcoin Season Index mean for investors? A low Altcoin Season Index (like the current 28) suggests that Bitcoin is currently outperforming most altcoins. For investors, this typically indicates a Bitcoin-dominant market, potentially signaling a need to re-evaluate altcoin exposure and consider stronger assets or Bitcoin itself. Is it always a bad time for altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. While a low index indicates general underperformance, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique narratives can still perform well. It emphasizes the importance of selective investing and thorough research rather than broad market exposure to altcoins. What typically causes the Altcoin Season Index to change? Changes in the Altcoin Season Index can be driven by Bitcoin’s price movements, overall market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, significant news events, and shifts in investor risk appetite between Bitcoin and altcoins.

The project has seen strong demand in its presale in recent weeks. Phase 6 is now nearly complete with more than $18.2 million raised. Investors show strong interest aiming to reap huge bull run gains. This has positioned MUTM among the most talked-about DeFi cryptos of 2025. The presale’s rapid sellout pace signals massive FOMO, with early participants eager to secure tokens before the next price increase. Mutuum Finance’s upcoming V1 protocol, expected to debut on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, will feature an advanced lending and borrowing ecosystem powered by liquidity pools, mtTokens, and an automated liquidator bot. This launch represents a major milestone in building a secure, scalable, and user-centric DeFi platform. With momentum accelerating and presale availability shrinking fast, MUTM stands out as the new crypto investors are rushing to accumulate before its potential breakout moment. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 6 Nears Sell-Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured strong interest with its ongoing presale. The project rallied past its first 5 presale stages faster than expected and is now in the sixth at $0.035. Joining the presale today means getting MUTM tokens at the cheapest possible price. When phase 7 kicks off, the price per coin will pump nearly 20%. This emphasizes the need to buy while it’s still early. More than 17550 investors have scooped up MUTM tokens, bringing the presale raise to $18.15 million. The rapid uptake underscores Mutuum Finance’s growing reputation as the best DeFi crypto to invest in for both high short-term rewards and long-term value growth. Built on Secure Infrastructure and Smart Risk Management At its core, Mutuum Finance is built around a secure, risk-weighted infrastructure designed to protect both the protocol and its users. Key features include a Loan-to-Value (LTV) system that controls borrowing limits relative to collateral, asset-backed reserves, and dynamic liquidation tiers tailored to each asset’s individual risk profile. Additionally, the platform incorporates a reserve factor, an internal buffer designed to absorb volatility or default events. Higher-risk assets maintain larger reserve allocations, promoting long-term platform stability and strengthening investor confidence. Community-Driven Ecosystem and Incentive Rewards To complement its strong security framework, Mutuum Finance fosters a community-focused incentive model that rewards participation and ecosystem engagement. This structure not only drives user growth but also encourages sustainable participation in the project’s long-term vision for secure and transparent decentralized finance. Stablecoin, Oracles, and Analyst Price Forecasts Looking beyond the launch, Mutuum Finance plans to release a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by verified on-chain collateral. This asset will play a crucial role in maintaining stability across the platform’s lending ecosystem by anchoring borrowing and repayment to a predictable value. It reduces exposure to market swings and makes returns more consistent for both lenders and borrowers. To ensure accurate pricing across supported assets, Mutuum Finance will use oracle systems such as Chainlink to supply real-time market data. These oracles will ensure that collateral values, borrowing limits, and liquidation thresholds always match current market conditions. If one feed fails, backup and aggregated data sources will maintain price accuracy, a vital safeguard for DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $18.2M, with 80% of Phase 6 sold at $0.035. As its V1 protocol nears launch, investor demand keeps climbing, cementing MUTM as 2025’s breakout DeFi crypto. With the next phase set to rise to $0.04, now is the time to secure tokens before the priced spikes in the next phase.

Global asset management firm WisdomTree has just made a significant move, launching 14 innovative tokenized funds on the Plume blockchain. This strategic step marks a pivotal moment for real-world assets (RWAs) and their digital future, offering investors unprecedented access and efficiency. What Are WisdomTree’s New Tokenized Funds? WisdomTree, a well-established name in asset management, is diving deeper into the digital asset space. The firm introduced 14 new tokenized funds , making a strong statement about the future of finance. These offerings are not just theoretical; they are live and accessible on Plume, a blockchain specifically designed for regulatory-compliant real-world assets. Among the notable launches are: Government Money Market Digital Fund: This fund provides a digital avenue to traditional money market investments. CRDT Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund: An offering that opens up private credit and alternative income streams to a broader investor base through tokenization. What makes these tokenized funds particularly appealing is the ability for investors to directly hold, transfer, and settle them on the Plume blockchain. This direct interaction bypasses many of the intermediaries and complexities associated with traditional fund management, promising greater transparency and efficiency. Why Did WisdomTree Choose Plume for Tokenized Funds? Plume is not just any blockchain; it is a specialized platform built from the ground up to handle regulatory-compliant real-world assets. This focus on compliance is crucial for institutional players like WisdomTree. Plume has integrated robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solutions directly at the protocol level, ensuring a high standard of security and regulatory adherence. Moreover, the platform offers essential services such as wallet screening and sanctions compliance. This comprehensive approach minimizes risks and ensures that all transactions involving tokenized funds meet stringent regulatory requirements. Plume’s credibility was further bolstered by its recent approval as a registered transfer agent by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a significant milestone for any blockchain platform operating in the RWA space. The platform’s growing ecosystem already boasts over 276,000 RWA holders and manages an impressive $600 million in tokenized assets, demonstrating its established presence and potential for future growth. How Do Tokenized Funds Transform Traditional Investing? The introduction of tokenized funds represents a paradigm shift in how investors can access and manage assets. This innovation brings several compelling benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: By tokenizing traditional assets, fractional ownership becomes easier, potentially lowering the entry barrier for investors. Increased Liquidity: Digital representation on a blockchain can facilitate faster and more efficient trading compared to illiquid traditional assets. Greater Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, verifiable record of ownership and transactions. Operational Efficiency: Automation of processes like settlement and transfers can reduce costs and time. This move by WisdomTree illustrates a broader trend where traditional finance is increasingly embracing blockchain technology to unlock new efficiencies and investment opportunities. It’s about blending the reliability of established financial products with the innovation of digital assets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Real-World Assets? WisdomTree’s launch of tokenized funds on Plume is a powerful signal for the entire real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector. It signifies a growing confidence from major financial institutions in the viability and potential of blockchain technology for mainstream investment products. As more traditional assets become tokenized, we can anticipate a future where digital ownership and seamless global transfers are commonplace. This development could pave the way for a more inclusive financial system, where diverse asset classes, from real estate to private equity, are accessible to a wider range of investors through digital formats. The regulatory compliance built into platforms like Plume is key to this evolution, ensuring that innovation proceeds responsibly. WisdomTree’s venture into tokenized funds on the Plume blockchain is a groundbreaking step, showcasing the immense potential of digital assets to reshape traditional finance. By offering regulated, accessible, and efficient investment products, they are not just participating in the future of finance but actively shaping it. This initiative highlights the critical role of compliant blockchain platforms in fostering institutional adoption and expanding the reach of real-world assets into the digital realm. Frequently Asked Questions About Tokenized Funds Q1: What exactly are tokenized funds? A1: Tokenized funds are traditional investment funds, like money market or private credit funds, whose units of ownership are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This allows for direct digital ownership, transfer, and settlement. Q2: How do tokenized funds differ from traditional funds? A2: The primary difference lies in their underlying technology and operational model. Tokenized funds leverage blockchain for ownership records, transfers, and settlements, offering potentially greater transparency, efficiency, and fractional ownership compared to traditional paper-based or centralized systems. Q3: Is investing in tokenized funds regulated? A3: Yes, platforms like Plume are designed for regulatory compliance. They integrate KYC/AML solutions and have secured approvals, such as Plume’s registration as a transfer agent with the SEC, to ensure that tokenized funds operate within established legal frameworks. Q4: What are the benefits of investing in tokenized funds? A4: Benefits include increased accessibility, potential for greater liquidity, enhanced transparency through blockchain’s immutable ledger, and improved operational efficiency in transactions and record-keeping. Q5: Can any investor access these tokenized funds? A5: While the concept aims for broader accessibility, specific eligibility criteria will depend on the fund’s nature and regulatory requirements, similar to traditional investment products. However, the tokenized format can facilitate easier access for qualified investors globally. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

With the downward wave showing signs of completion, market watchers are now eyeing a potential shift in momentum that could spark the next bullish reversal. Price Channel Near Completion: One Key Level Left To Break After examining the Dogecoin (DOGE) 30-minute chart, the Elliott Waves Academy updated its outlook to confirm a period of strong selling pressure. Technical analysis clearly indicates that the DOGE/USD pair is nearing the completion of a defined price channel pattern, with only one key level remaining before the next major wave is confirmed. Related Reading: Bullish Window For Dogecoin Opens in November, Analyst Says Specifically, the downward leg represents Wave (5) of Wave 3 within a larger bearish sequence. According to Elliott Waves Academy, the bearish outlook is heavily supported by the preceding structure, which involves a confirmed and strong downward wave representing Wave (3), demonstrating robust and sustained momentum from the sellers. A continuation of the bearish outlook is structurally reinforced by the presence of the price channel pattern itself. Key to confirming the final downward wave hinges on the price breaking the key support level of the current minor correction. Elliott Waves Academy emphasized that successfully breaking this critical key level will provide undeniable confirmation of the bearish view and set a precise trajectory for the completion of the move. Elliott Waves Academy targets the $0.1843646$ level as the expected floor for this phase. The objective is anticipated to be the point at which the internal wave structure is complete and the current bout of selling pressure is exhausted. Finally, Elliott Waves Academy noted that a crucial follow-up action: after reaching the $0.1843646$ level, a corrective upward main wave is predicted to follow. This implies that anticipated downside is part of a structural cycle and should be followed by a noticeable relief rally. Momentum Builds Quietly Beneath The Surface According to EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL, Dogecoin continues to follow the same structural rhythm observed in previous market cycles. The price action is unfolding in a familiar pattern, suggesting that the asset may be preparing for another significant move once conditions align. Related Reading: Volatility Loading: Dogecoin Eyes Explosive Path To $3 In his post, EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL revealed that momentum is quietly building above key support levels, signaling underlying strength in the market despite the recent volatility.

He concluded by emphasizing that patience is key before the next ignition phase, as Dogecoin consolidates and gathers momentum. The current setup suggests a potential upside once a breakout confirms renewed bullish momentum.

The company’s application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national trust bank charter, proposed under the name Ripple National Trust Bank, has entered its final review window. According to official OCC filings, the standard 120-day review period following the application’s publication is set to conclude this Friday, October 31. Ripple’s Application For A National Trust Bank License Ripple applied for a national trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on July 2, 2025. The application was for a national trust bank, not a traditional bank, and is intended to provide fiduciary activities like custody and infrastructure for its RLUSD stablecoin. The application was made in early July and entered a public review phase in October. The Ripple National Trust Bank application represents Ripple Labs’ strategic expansion into federally supervised financial services. If approved, the charter would authorize the firm to operate a national trust bank headquartered at 111-119 West 19th Street in New York City. The application lists senior figures in the company like Stuart Alderoty, Timothy Keaney, John McDonald, David Puth, and John Zavaglia as the organizers, with Ripple Labs Inc. serving as the sponsoring institution from its San Francisco base. This move extends the firm’s push beyond cross-border payments into full-scale institutional custody and settlement. It also aligns with the company’s ongoing efforts to establish the RLUSD stablecoin as a regulated, transparent digital dollar. As noted by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, if approved, the firm would have both state and federal oversight, which is a new and unique benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. This comment was made by the Ripple CEO in July 2025 as confirmation of the license application. The 120-Day Review Window And What Comes Next Under OCC procedures, applications for national trust bank charters undergo a 120-day review to assess governance, capitalization, compliance programs, and management suitability. Ripple’s application entered that timeline after its public filing, meaning the review period ends on October 31. At this point, the OCC may issue an initial decision of approval, denial, or extension, depending on whether additional information is needed. However, the ongoing US government shutdown could influence the timing of the company’s license review. The payment firm’s application is part of a growing list of crypto-based companies seeking a national trust bank charter as the digital asset industry pushes closer to full regulatory integration with traditional finance. Companies like Circle, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and Paxos have also applied with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for national trust bank charters.",Ripple|Brad Garlinghouse|Circle|coinbase|Comptroller of the Currency|Crypto.com|David Puth|John McDonald|John Zavaglia|OCC|Paxos|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|Stuart Alderoty|The Ripple National Trust Bank|Timothy Keaney|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 01:00:41

Despite prevailing caution, many of these projections suggest the possibility of record-breaking valuations across the sector. Analysts’ Bitcoin Forecasts for Q4 2025 Crypto market commentator CryptoJulzss predicts that Bitcoin could climb to $180,000 by the close of 2025. If this materializes, it would represent a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency, bringing its estimated market capitalization to nearly $3.5 trillion. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Leshka.eth provided a slightly higher outlook, forecasting Bitcoin within the $225,000 to $240,000 range by year-end. Such a rally would raise Bitcoin’s total valuation beyond $4.5 trillion, potentially positioning it among the world’s top three most valuable assets by market capitalization. These predictions align with the broader bullish sentiment expressed by other industry figures earlier in the year. Analysts such as Ash Crypto and Mario Nawfal have attributed potential Bitcoin growth to rising institutional adoption, continued ETF inflows , and an easing global monetary environment. BTC to $180k ETH to $9k $SOL to $350 $XRP to $25 $ASTER to $5 $ALGO to $3 $DOG to $1 What am I missing? — Julia (@CryptoJulzss) October 26, 2025 Adding to this optimism, Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, reiterated at the Money 20/20 conference that he expects Bitcoin to reach $150,000 before the end of 2025. He cited growing regulatory clarity in the U.S., including the SEC’s evolving stance on tokenized securities and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s endorsement of stablecoins, as catalysts that could accelerate institutional participation in the sector. XRP’s Year-End Prospects Alongside Bitcoin, analysts are also anticipating a strong performance from XRP. Currently trading around $2.44 , XRP has shown resilience through market volatility and continues to benefit from Ripple’s expanding partnerships in global payments. According to CryptoJulzss, XRP could surge to $25 by the end of 2025, a projected tenfold increase that would give the asset a market capitalization exceeding $1.5 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tokens in existence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On the other hand, Leshka.eth maintains a more moderate but still bullish outlook , placing XRP between $8.50 and $9.00 by year-end. Her projection corresponds closely with previous forecasts from Ash Crypto (who estimated a range of $5–$8) and Mario Nawfal, who predicted $10 if Bitcoin reaches $225,000. These expectations are largely based on the assumption that Ripple’s ongoing institutional adoption, combined with the potential approval of XRP-based ETFs , could significantly expand market demand during the final months of 2025. Broader Market Expectations Both analysts also shared insights on other major digital assets. CryptoJulzss anticipates Ethereum reaching $9,000 and Solana climbing to $350. In contrast, Leshka.eth projects higher figures across several assets, predicting Ethereum between $11,000 and $13,000, Solana at $800–$900, and BNB within the $2,800–$3,300 range. She further expects Dogecoin to trade between $1 and $2.50, while Chainlink (LINK) could reach $250–$400 if market conditions remain favorable. Market Sentiment Moving Into Year-End Although the current month has not delivered the price action many investors hoped for, analysts believe the final two months of the year could set the tone for a strong 2025 close. Historically, November and December have been among the most favourable periods for the cryptocurrency market, often marking the start of major upward trends. While market volatility remains a factor, the overarching view among leading analysts is that both Bitcoin and XRP could experience substantial appreciation in the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by institutional momentum, improving macroeconomic conditions, and greater integration of blockchain assets into global finance.

This stood as the second-highest monthly total of the year. The sudden move came as traders pulled back from risky leveraged positions after the massive $19 billion in losses earlier in the month. A Costly Lesson for Leveraged Traders The October crash started when US President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China. Within hours, Bitcoin fell from $122,000 to around $101,000 on some exchanges. More than 1.6 million traders were forced to close positions. CoinGlass data showed that long traders suffered the worst and lost nearly $17 billion. One trader reportedly lost $19 million on Hyperliquid. A few whales profited by shorting Bitcoin before the fall. The market suffered massive liquidations on 10 October | source: Coinglass The fallout from this event was severe because it wiped out months of gains and reminded the market how quickly leveraged bets can implode. By the end of October, Bitcoin recovered to about $110,800. The price stayed range-bound between $108,000 and $116,000 and is showing signs of stabilisation after a chaotic start to the month. Bitcoin Spot Trading Gains Strength Binance dominated Bitcoin spot trading in October, after handling about $174 billion of the total volume. Data also showed that activity came from both retail traders and institutional investors. Analysts from CryptoQuant said the rise in spot trading showed a trend toward real accumulation rather than short-term speculation. People appear to be focusing more on owning Bitcoin outright instead of betting on short-term price swings. Bitcoin spot trading has gained strength since the crash | source: CryptoQuant This transition may be an important turning point. When markets are driven by actual buying and selling rather than leveraged contracts, prices tend to show genuine demand. That could mean fewer extreme swings and a stronger foundation for future growth. Analysts Warn of Fragile Recovery Despite fresh interest in spot markets, not everyone is confident that the worst is over. On-chain firm Santiment noted that retail traders are becoming overly optimistic. Many are “buying the dip” too early, which often leads to more losses when the market turns again. Market analyst Ali Martinez also flagged warning signs. He mentioned that the TD Sequential indicator flashed another possible sell signal. Concerns about global liquidity are still strong, even after the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut. The move caused another $700 million in liquidations across crypto markets. Signs of Long-Term Accumulation Exchange data supports this shift toward direct Bitcoin ownership. Total BTC held on exchanges dropped from 2.65 million to 2.38 million during October. This means more traders are moving their coins into personal wallets instead of leaving them on platforms for short-term trading. Some whales still moved large amounts into exchanges to sell, but many others continued to buy. Data from Binance showed that sell-taker orders slightly outnumbered buy orders. Bybit, on the other hand, saw stronger buying activity. Despite these mixed flows, the overall balance leaned toward accumulation. Traders used time-weighted average price (TWAP) orders to slowly build positions without spiking prices.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-31 01:04:15

Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has once again captured global attention as Bitcoin hits $109,000 . This significant milestone, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at an impressive $109,112.32 on the Binance USDT market. It is a moment that sparks both celebration and curiosity, prompting many to ask: what exactly is driving this remarkable ascent? What’s Fueling This Remarkable Ascent After Bitcoin Hits $109,000? The latest Bitcoin price surge above $109,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several powerful forces are converging to propel its value upwards. Firstly, institutional interest continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Large financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and an inflation hedge. Moreover, global macroeconomic factors play a crucial role. As traditional markets face uncertainties and inflation concerns persist, investors seek alternative assets. Bitcoin offers a decentralized and limited supply option, making it an attractive safe haven. This increased demand from both retail and institutional players contributes significantly to BTC’s upward momentum. Decoding the Market Dynamics Behind the Latest Bitcoin Price Surge Understanding the underlying market dynamics is key to appreciating why Bitcoin hits $109,000 . Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins, creates a powerful demand-side pressure. The periodic halving events, which reduce the reward for mining new blocks, further tighten supply, historically leading to price appreciation. Additionally, growing mainstream adoption is a critical factor. More businesses and payment processors are integrating Bitcoin, making it easier for everyday users to access and utilize. This expansion of its utility strengthens its value proposition. Positive market sentiment, often fueled by news of institutional adoption or technological advancements, also plays a pivotal role in driving prices higher. Implications for Investors: Navigating the Landscape as Bitcoin Hits $109,000 For current and prospective investors, the fact that Bitcoin hits $109,000 carries significant implications. On one hand, it validates the long-term potential of Bitcoin and can instill greater confidence in the asset class. Existing holders see their portfolios grow, while new investors might feel compelled to enter the market, fearing they might miss out on further gains. However, it is crucial to approach such price movements with a balanced perspective. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and price corrections can occur. Therefore, informed decision-making is paramount. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment choices. Diversification remains a wise strategy. What Lies Ahead After Bitcoin Hits $109,000? Future Outlook As Bitcoin hits $109,000 , many eyes are on what the future holds. Experts offer various predictions, often pointing to continued growth driven by ongoing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ continues to gain traction, positioning it as a fundamental asset in a diversified portfolio. However, potential challenges like increased regulatory scrutiny, environmental concerns related to mining, and competition from other digital assets could influence its trajectory. Investors must remain vigilant, staying informed about market trends and global economic shifts. Responsible investing involves managing risks and understanding that past performance does not guarantee future results. In conclusion, the ascent of Bitcoin hits $109,000 is a testament to its enduring strength and growing influence in the global financial landscape. While the excitement is palpable, a strategic and informed approach remains essential for navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. This milestone underscores Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital experiment to a significant financial asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent Bitcoin price surge?

The move raised expectations that the Bank of Japan might soon need to boost interest rates, with the October 29 data suggesting that the cost pressures are persistent at the same time as world inflation calms down. The stronger number also drives a goal to pair the yen with increasing trader sentiment, suggesting that Japan’s decade of near-zero rates is almost over. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the cost of core exclusive fresh food increased by 2.8% in October compared to the same month in the previous year. The number was significantly higher than the 2.6% average forecast of experts and faster than the 2.5% increase in September. Prices that include both fresh food and energy, a measure the BOJ monitors to exclude commodity expense, increased 2.8%, the fastest since 2.4% in April. BOJ remains cautious, but pressure is mounting Tokyo’s main inflation has been at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for three and one-half years. Economists say the inflation in Tokyo, which is greater than projected, gives the Bank of Japan reason to consider another interest rate increase this year. Bloomberg Economics economist Taro Kimura said Tokyo’s unexpectedly strong inflation in October could prompt the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. He noted that companies are increasing prices for household goods, and the end of the city’s water-bill waiver has further added to the inflationary pressure. It was in Tokyo in October when the main reason was the cessation of the city’s water charge waiver, which dramatically reduced prices in September. Without this relief, the value of the water increased rapidly, lifting the general index. The cost of semi-manufactured food and energy decreased in the meantime, indicating that inflation remains strong, not weak, driven by imported priorities. The yen continued to strengthen after the data was released. It was around ¥153.84 per US dollar, compared to ¥154.17 before the announcement as investors increased their bets on a rate hike by the BOJ. As Tokyo’s inflation figures are typically ahead of their nationwide counterpart, with this report to be published on November 19, some analysts predict that it will follow the same accelerating trend. Japan weighs inflation boost against wage boost. Thursday, the BOJ’s board chose to maintain the bank’s benchmark short-term rate after the report. Tokyo’s governor, Kazuo Ueda, mentioned that the Bank of Japan would continue to hold its current stance until quantifiable wage growth supports the inflation increase. Japan’s economy shows signs of resilience The current rise has no basis in reality, according to Ueda, as the bank’s official goal is a 2% annual inflation target. Inflation has been rising above the standard 2 percent for the majority of the year, but according to Ueda, the “trend underlying inflation hasn’t been robust”. The main problem was that while prices have been rising, businesses have been keeping wages moderate. Therefore, consumers are receiving less of a pay increase compared to the prices of goods. A majority of economists believe that the BOJ would consider making the hike next month, according to a Bloomberg survey. Masamichi Adachi, chief economist at UBS Securities Japan, said the latest Tokyo CPI data makes a December rate hike by the Bank of Japan more likely, as it shows that domestic inflation momentum remains strong. He added that the figures give the central bank greater confidence in the sustainability of price growth. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is introducing new measures to ease the cost-of-living burden on households. Her cabinet has decided to cut the gasoline tax, lower current electricity and gas prices to support citizens this winter, and provide larger grants to local governments that can aid them. Aside from inflation, other gauges of the Japanese economy were relatively consistent. Industrialization surged 2.2% month-to-month in September, up from the anticipated 1.5%, while retail sales rose 0.3% month-to-month and 0.5% annually – a clear indication of a strong consumer.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again demonstrated its incredible volatility and upward potential, soaring above the significant $110,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at approximately $110,013.27 on major exchanges like Binance USDT market. This monumental leap isn’t just a number; it signals a renewed surge of investor confidence and a potential shift in the broader digital asset landscape.

Understanding the forces behind this rally is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic crypto market. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors appear to be contributing to Bitcoin’s impressive climb. Market analysts point to a confluence of macroeconomic trends and increasing institutional interest as primary drivers. The global economic climate, characterized by inflation concerns and a search for alternative assets, often pushes investors towards Bitcoin. Institutional Adoption: More corporations and financial institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving reduced the supply of new BTC, historically leading to upward price pressure as demand outstrips supply. Positive Market Sentiment: A general sense of optimism is permeating the crypto community, fueled by positive regulatory discussions and technological advancements within the blockchain space. Macroeconomic Factors: Geopolitical uncertainties and traditional market volatility make Bitcoin an attractive hedge for many investors seeking stability. These elements combined create a powerful upward momentum, propelling the Bitcoin price to new heights and capturing global attention. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Landscape? When Bitcoin experiences such a significant price movement, its effects ripple across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin’s dominance often dictates the overall market sentiment, influencing the performance of altcoins and other digital assets. A rising Bitcoin price typically acts as a catalyst for the altcoin market. Investors often reallocate profits from Bitcoin into promising altcoins, leading to an “altcoin season” where other cryptocurrencies also see substantial gains. This interconnectedness means that Bitcoin’s health is often a barometer for the entire crypto market’s vitality. Moreover, this rally enhances investor confidence across the board. It validates the long-term potential of digital assets for both seasoned traders and new entrants. This positive sentiment can attract more capital into the space, fostering innovation and further development within various blockchain projects. Navigating Volatility: Smart Moves for Your Bitcoin Investment While the current surge is exciting, the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Smart investors understand the importance of strategic planning and risk management. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Always understand the fundamentals of your investments. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of assets. Set Clear Goals: Determine your entry and exit points based on your financial objectives. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the Bitcoin price , to mitigate risk over time. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and technological developments. Remember, the crypto market can be unpredictable. Making informed decisions and managing risk are paramount to long-term success. The recent ascent of the Bitcoin price above $110,000 marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of digital finance. It underscores Bitcoin’s resilience, its growing acceptance, and its undeniable role as a leading digital asset. While the path ahead may involve its characteristic ups and downs, this milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of cryptocurrency. Whether you are a seasoned investor or simply curious about the future of money, Bitcoin’s journey continues to be one of the most compelling stories in modern finance. As the market matures, its influence will only grow, solidifying its position as a cornerstone of the global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the Bitcoin price surge mean for new investors? A1: A surge often indicates strong market sentiment and potential for further growth, but it also means increased volatility. New investors should research thoroughly and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q2: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? A2: Many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, market entry timing is crucial. It’s important to invest based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Q3: What factors could cause the Bitcoin price to drop?

The round also saw participation from JinQiu Fund (a ByteDance-affiliated fund) and Baidu Ventures, signaling growing institutional confidence in AI-powered education technology. https://t.co/sxEk3EEqjo — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) October 30, 2025 Building the Future of Learning VideoTutor aims to redefine how students learn. The platform combines large language models (LLMs) with a Manim-based animation rendering engine, converting any question into a personalized animated lesson. Its system can explain complex problems visually and conversationally, producing step-by-step animated tutorials that adapt in real time to each learner’s pace and understanding. The company describes VideoTutor as an “educational AI agent”, not just a video generator but an interactive teaching assistant that turns questions into lessons on the spot. Currently, the platform has reached 20,000 global users and has received more than 1,000 API integration requests, a strong indicator of demand from developers and schools looking to embed AI tutoring into their systems. Kai Zhao: The 20-Year-Old Behind the Vision VideoTutor was founded by Kai Zhao, a 20-year-old serial AI entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley. Zhao’s vision is to make personalized education scalable, using AI to transform static video learning into a dynamic, interactive experience. From day one, he set out to “transform passive watching into interactive mastery,” merging AI reasoning with mathematical visualization tools to make complex subjects more intuitive. His approach reflects the new wave of AI-native educational tools, platforms designed from the ground up around machine learning, content generation, and real-time adaptability, not retrofitted onto older e-learning models. VideoTutor’s technology stack integrates a large language model (LLM) for contextual understanding and content generation with Manim, a mathematical animation framework used to visualize equations, geometry, and problem-solving steps. The result is a real-time teaching engine that creates short, animated lessons tailored to each user’s question. Instead of searching for pre-made videos, users can simply ask a question, and the system automatically builds a custom tutorial with both narration and animation. This system bridges a long-standing gap in online education: scalable personalization. YZi Labs Expands Into AI Software The $11 million investment marks YZi Labs’ first major move into the AI software space. Known primarily for its early-stage blockchain and fintech investments, the firm’s expansion into AI signals a broader strategic shift. “VideoTutor represents the intersection of education, creativity, and generative AI,” a spokesperson from YZi Labs said during the announcement. “Our goal is to back projects that use intelligent systems to empower human potential.” YZi Labs’ participation also strengthens the company’s positioning in AI-driven consumer applications, diversifying beyond crypto infrastructure into real-world software solutions. Education Meets Intelligent Design The partnership between YZi Labs and VideoTutor highlights a growing focus on AI education tools, systems that can scale personalized learning globally without sacrificing quality. VideoTutor’s platform doesn’t just answer questions; it teaches users how to think through them. By combining LLM-generated explanations with visual learning, it gives students a deeper understanding of complex material. In a demo, a simple algebra question transforms into a narrated visual animation, the AI breaks down each step, draws graphs, and explains the reasoning in plain language. This makes advanced learning instantly accessible, even for students without a tutor. From Seed Funding to Global Reach With the new $11 million in funding, VideoTutor plans to: Accelerate product development Expand its engineering and research teams Partner with schools and universities worldwide Enhance its AI models for deeper subject coverage According to Kai Zhao, the funding will also support the launch of interactive classroom integrations, allowing educators to use AI-generated visuals during live lessons. Excited to announce that @VideoTutor has raised an $11M Seed round led by @yzilabs , with support from @amino_capital and BV FUND、JinQiu Fund and others. From day one, we’ve set out to redefine how students learn with AI transforming passive watching into interactive mastery.… https://t.co/XCmlKAtsMJ — VideoTutor (@VideoTutor_io) October 30, 2025 Zhao said the company is “building the future of learning, one where AI transforms education from passive consumption to active, personalized discovery.” YZi Labs’ Broader Investment Activity YZi Labs has been making quiet but strategic moves across several verticals, including AI, crypto, and prediction markets. Earlier this quarter, it co-invested in Opinion Labs, a prediction market platform backed by Binance and Amber Group, which raised $5 million to expand its decentralized betting infrastructure. While the prediction market meta is still emerging, YZi Labs’ involvement shows its growing interest in hybrid AI-fintech models, areas where data, markets, and intelligence intersect. With VideoTutor, YZi Labs now adds a high-impact education technology investment to its portfolio, complementing its financial and blockchain interests with a long-term AI vision. The shift toward AI-driven learning tools marks a new phase in global education. Platforms like VideoTutor remove the limits of geography, cost, and time, providing on-demand, personalized lessons that can reach anyone with an internet connection. AI tutors are not replacing teachers; they’re amplifying them, enabling educators to serve larger groups with more precision and individualized attention. As LLMs become smarter and rendering systems like Manim evolve, the gap between human and AI instruction continues to close. VideoTutor’s system not only explains but also visualizes, turning theory into motion and making learning more memorable. YZi Labs’ Strategic Timing For YZi Labs, the timing couldn’t be better. The global appetite for AI-driven educational tools is exploding, with billions of students and professionals seeking flexible, digital learning formats. By investing early in VideoTutor, YZi Labs positions itself at the frontier of AI education, just as the market begins to mature. The move reflects the firm’s broader strategy, investing in next-generation infrastructure that brings real-world functionality to AI and Web3 ecosystems. This isn’t just about funding a startup; it’s about reshaping how learning happens. As VideoTutor continues to develop, its core focus remains clear, making high-quality, AI-powered learning accessible to everyone. The next stage includes deeper LLM integration, improved animation realism, and expanded subject coverage, from STEM to humanities. For YZi Labs, this investment could be the beginning of a larger move into AI consumer products, following the same pattern that once led it to early wins in Web3 ventures. The educational landscape is changing fast, and with players like VideoTutor, the future classroom might not have four walls at all. YZi Labs’ $11 million seed investment in VideoTutor marks a pivotal moment for both companies. For VideoTutor, it’s the capital and credibility needed to scale globally. For YZi Labs, it’s a milestone, the firm’s first step into AI software, expanding its reach beyond crypto and finance into intelligent learning systems. A 20-year-old founder, a breakthrough educational AI product, and a seasoned tech investor, together, they’re building what could become the next frontier of education technology.

The exploit, which occurred across multiple chains, has forced the project to temporarily halt operations and sparked renewed concerns about vulnerabilities in cross-chain protocols. Garden Finance was likely exploited for $10.8M+ on multiple chains. An address related to the team sent a message onchain to the alleged exploiter offering a 10% whitehat bounty but has yet to comment publicly on the incident. All freezeable assets were quickly swapped. Theft… pic.twitter.com/A4il25YiLn — Vladimir S. | Officer's Notes (@officer_cia) October 30, 2025 The Garden Finance Breach and What Happened On-chain data shows that Garden Finance was likely exploited for more than $10.8 million, affecting wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and other cross-chain assets. The attack targeted a weakness in the project’s liquidity pools or swap mechanism, allowing the exploiter to drain funds before the team could respond. Within hours of detecting the anomaly, Garden Finance’s developers sent an on-chain message to the hacker, offering a 10% white-hat bounty in exchange for returning the funds. However, there has been no public comment from the team since that offer. The known theft address has been identified as: `0x98BCc6c34A489CEfdD9DfA8d792CFEFb02Ea2D12` and another address tied to the case on non-EVM networks: `WZy4xxpqktWa1b6MPMRiWsD487CT8mDcapB6GufBJCH`. Cross-chain bridges are the single most exploited category in blockchain by tvs (total value stolen), and the data is not even close $3.82B (about 58% of all defi losses) Garden finance ( @gardenfi ) might be joining this stack today with about $5.5M in exploited assets mostly… pic.twitter.com/co8TB2Qncp — Brown (@Brown_ux) October 30, 2025 Immediate Aftermath Shortly after the breach, all freezeable assets were quickly swapped, a typical move by attackers to make stolen funds untraceable. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that about 25% of Garden Finance’s total fund movements were already tied to previously stolen assets, including incidents connected to Bybit and Swissborg. The irony wasn’t lost on the community. Just days before the exploit, ZachXBT had criticized Garden Finance on X (formerly Twitter) for ignoring victims’ requests to return fees from transactions involving stolen funds. “More than 25% of Garden Finance’s activity is related to stolen assets,” ZachXBT wrote, pointing to the project’s repeated association with compromised wallets. The Official Response Following community outcry, Garden Finance’s official X account acknowledged the situation, saying a “compromise involving one of Garden’s solvers” was detected. The platform was temporarily taken offline as investigations began. “The impact is limited to the solver’s own inventory, user funds and the Garden protocol are not at risk,” the team stated. “We’ll share updates as soon as we have more information.” That claim, however, has been met with skepticism. Analysts argue that the movement of funds and the scale of the losses suggest the compromise went beyond internal inventory. we’ve detected a compromise involving one of garden’s solvers. the app is temporarily offline while we complete a full investigation. the impact is limited to the solver’s own inventory — user funds and garden protocol are not at risk. we’ll share updates as soon as we have… — Garden (@gardenfi) October 30, 2025 Cross-Chain Bridges: DeFi’s Weakest Link Garden Finance’s troubles highlight a long-running issue in decentralized finance, the fragility of cross-chain bridges. Bridges account for about $3.82 billion, or 58% of all DeFi losses recorded to date. Bridges are inherently risky. They often rely on custodial mechanisms like multi-signature wallets or validator sets, creating single points of failure. When these fail, funds across entire ecosystems can be drained. For Bitcoin-based DeFi, the risk compounds due to finality mismatches between Bitcoin and EVM chains, sometimes introducing double-spend vectors. “Zero-Custody” Marketing Meets Real-World Bugs Garden Finance had branded itself as a “zero-custody, atomic-swap protocol”, a system designed to eliminate trust assumptions between chains. But as the latest exploit shows, even so-called “trustless” systems can fall apart if a single bug in the swap logic exists. The project’s promise of atomic security couldn’t hold up under a real-world attack vector. As of now, the root cause remains under investigation, but experts suggest it likely stems from a vulnerability in the swap contracts used for cross-chain transactions. This incident arrives at a time when the DeFi community is still grappling with the aftermath of multiple bridge hacks, from Multichain’s $126M exploit to Nomad’s $190M breach. Each new incident underscores a painful truth: cross-chain interoperability still comes at a heavy cost. With protocols pushing to connect ecosystems faster than they can secure them, the same patterns repeat, overconfidence, insufficient audits, and complex trust assumptions. The project’s immediate move to contact the attacker with a 10% white-hat offer mirrors recent approaches from teams like Curve and Euler Finance, both of which later recovered part of their funds. Whether Garden Finance can do the same remains uncertain. For now, users have been advised to avoid interacting with the protocol until an official post-mortem report is released. As investigations continue, the situation serves as yet another reminder that even “trustless” systems still require trust, in their code, in their audits, and in their teams.

As reported by LookOnChain, Vitalik just sold a massive 2.75 trillion CAT tokens, worth 14,216 USDC, from his wallet. The tokens were part of a free airdrop he received just days ago. On October 30th, blockchain sleuths spotted the move: 2% of the total $CAT supply, gone in a single transaction. The sell came shortly after CatCoin’s official X account proudly announced they had sent 2% of the entire supply (275 trillion CAT) to vitalik.eth. The community cheered. The memes flowed. The dream of “Vitalik’s cat season” began. Then Vitalik sold it. And just like that, the hype train screeched to a halt. vitalik.eth( @VitalikButerin ) is selling off the memecoins he received for free again, cashing out 14,216 $USDC . https://t.co/pMvkZHjIyD pic.twitter.com/VzWpLV4Ily — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 30, 2025 The CAT Hype That Went Purrfectly Wrong Just three days before the sale, CatCoin’s team had tweeted with excitement: “We’ve just sent 2% of the total supply (275,000,000,000,000 $CAT) to vitalik.eth , Now it’s in @VitalikButerin’s hands to make CATCOIN the next 100x memecoin on Ethereum and lead the new meme era.” We’ve just sent 2% of the total supply (275,000,000,000,000 $CAT ) to vitalik.eth Now it’s in @VitalikButerin ’s hands to make #CATCOIN the next 100x #memecoin on #Ethereum and lead the new meme era. Tag @VitalikButerin let him know. He loves cats pic.twitter.com/Jgc2uvLonl — CATCOIN (ETH) (@catethz) October 27, 2025 For a moment, the plan looked flawless. The team leveraged Vitalik’s wallet as a marketing catalyst, and it worked. The CAT chart spiked. Liquidity surged. Traders rushed in hoping Vitalik’s wallet would be the ultimate stamp of legitimacy. But Vitalik, true to his track record, didn’t play along. He sold. And that one move became the headline across crypto Twitter. Vitalik’s Meme Coin Routine This isn’t the first time Vitalik has been sent “free” tokens, or sold them. Back in 2021, during the height of the meme coin boom, he famously received billions in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme tokens as “gifts.” Instead of keeping them, he donated large chunks to charity or burned them completely. It was his polite way of saying: “Stop doing this.” So when CatCoin dropped tokens into his wallet again, most seasoned traders knew what was coming. Still, it didn’t stop the frenzy. The idea of “Vitalik’s cat” quickly became a meme of its own, a new flavor in the never-ending rotation of crypto animal coins. But the Ethereum founder doesn’t play meme politics. This latest sale only reaffirms that stance: Vitalik won’t endorse unsolicited tokens. Whether it’s a strategic move or just cleaning house, it’s a reminder that even the biggest names aren’t immune to meme coin fatigue. $CAT Community Reels Within hours of the sale, CatCoin’s market cap plunged. Trading volume dropped sharply as short-term traders exited. It’s a sharp reversal from the bullish spike just days earlier, when traders speculated the Vitalik tag would push the token into top-tier meme status. The community’s response has been mixed. Some took it lightly, joking that “Vitalik just declawed CatCoin.” Others expressed frustration, claiming that the project should never have airdropped that much supply to one wallet, especially his. CatCoin’s Response: Grace Under Pressure To their credit, the CatCoin team handled the moment with positivity. Hours after the transaction was spotted, they tweeted again: “Thank you @VitalikButerin for accepting our donation around National Cat Day We truly appreciate it and hope to have your support in making CatCoin the next big memecoin on the Ethereum chain! $CAT needs your support.” Thank you @VitalikButerin for accepting our donation around National Cat Day We truly appreciate it and hope to have your support in making #CatCoin the next big memecoin on the Ethereum chain! $CAT need your support — CATCOIN (ETH) (@catethz) October 30, 2025 The tone was diplomatic. No drama. Just optimism. Still, most observers agree, the sell signaled the end of the short-lived hype cycle. For a project that relied heavily on meme momentum, this was a reality check. The Meme Coin Dilemma Vitalik’s move once again highlights an ongoing dilemma in crypto: the “airdrop for attention” strategy. Projects often send tokens to high-profile wallets, from Elon Musk to Vitalik, hoping for exposure or validation. It’s free marketing, until it backfires. The problem? Most of these recipients never asked for the tokens and rarely support the projects. For developers, it’s a gamble. For traders, it’s a trap. Meme coins thrive on narrative, but when that narrative collapses, liquidity follows. Vitalik’s Message to the Market By selling, Vitalik didn’t just offload a few meme coins, he sent a message. A reminder that not every token drop is worth holding. A reminder that Ethereum’s founder cares more about utility than virality. He’s not the meme king. He’s the builder. And his wallet, though often used for marketing stunts, remains a symbol of crypto’s transparency, where every move is public, and every transaction tells a story. “Vitalik doesn’t dump projects. He dumps expectations,” one user wrote. That sentiment captures it perfectly. A Cat That Landed on Its Feet? Despite the setback, CatCoin still holds a lively community. The project continues to push its “meme utility” narrative, with plans for NFT collections, community staking, and cross-chain bridges. It’s not the end. Just a rough chapter. Crypto thrives on comeback stories, and if CatCoin can channel the attention into innovation, it may still find its place among the meme elite, alongside Doge, Pepe, and Bonk. But for now, the Vitalik episode will remain a cautionary tale for meme projects everywhere. Vitalik’s $14,216 USDC sale isn’t about the money, it’s about the message. Six years ago, people sent him tokens as a marketing stunt. Today, it still happens. And each time, he reminds the market that influence can’t be bought. The CatCoin saga might have been short-lived, but it perfectly captures the energy, and the chaos, of the memecoin era. A market built on jokes, driven by hype, and humbled by reality. And if there’s one takeaway from this latest twist? Even in crypto, curiosity may kill the cat, but transparency always wins. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The value of his holdings now stands at $118.4 billion, down sharply with Bitcoin’s latest pullback. But even with the drop, Satoshi remains wealthier than Mukesh Ambani, Michael Bloomberg, and Bill Gates. That’s right, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, who hasn’t moved a single coin in over a decade, is still among the world’s richest individuals. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC trades around $107,220, down 4% in 24 hours . The market may be shaky, but the legacy of Bitcoin’s creator is still intact. Sixteen Years Since the Whitepaper That Changed the World Tomorrow marks 16 years since October 31, 2008, the day Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper, a nine-page PDF that changed global finance forever. Back then, Bitcoin was an idea. Today, it’s a multi-trillion-dollar asset class, shaping economies, challenging governments, and inspiring thousands of digital currencies. In just 16 years, Bitcoin has gone from zero to one of the most recognized and traded assets on Earth. It has outperformed every traditional investment over the past decade, and it’s not even close. “What began as an experiment in decentralized money became the blueprint for an entirely new economy.” That legacy alone keeps Satoshi’s name relevant every time Bitcoin makes a move, up or down. Bitcoin Quiet, Stablecoins Loud Here’s the strange part: while Bitcoin remains the face of crypto, its on-chain activity has almost vanished. Data shows that the number of BTC withdrawals from exchanges has remained flat since October 2024. That’s a full year of near-zero movement in long-term holdings. For the first time in a major market cycle, Bitcoin’s on-chain engagement is at record lows. Investors aren’t moving coins. They’re leaving them parked on exchanges or trading within centralized platforms, a shift that signals a new kind of market behavior. When you compare Bitcoin’s on-chain activity to that of stablecoins, the contrast is massive: Bitcoin’s on-chain volume: at the lowest level ever recorded. Stablecoin volume: hitting new record highs every day. In short, Bitcoin’s blockchain is quiet. Stablecoins are screaming liquidity. Interesting to observe: the number of BTC withdrawals from exchanges has remained almost unchanged since October 2024. And that brings an important reflection. For the first time in a market cycle, we’re seeing low on-chain engagement for Bitcoin. Data suggests that many… pic.twitter.com/1ms4mEnAnv — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) October 30, 2025 What This Means for Bitcoin The stagnation in Bitcoin’s on-chain volume isn’t necessarily bearish, but it does raise questions. Historically, heavy on-chain activity meant either accumulation or panic. But today, the market feels more institutional. The coins are sitting still while stablecoins do the heavy lifting of liquidity and transaction flow. It’s a sign that investors are comfortable holding BTC as a store of value while using USDT, USDC, and DAI for everything else, trading, yield, and payments. In other words: Bitcoin has officially become the gold standard of crypto, while stablecoins are the cash moving through the pipes. The Satoshi Paradox Satoshi’s net worth may swing by billions daily, but the irony is, he can’t, or won’t, spend a single cent. The original 1.1 million BTC mined by Satoshi between 2009 and 2010 have never been moved. They sit frozen, untouched, in early blockchain addresses known to analysts but inaccessible to anyone else. If those coins ever moved, it would trigger one of the largest market reactions in crypto history. SATOSHI NAKAMOTO IS DOWN ALMOST $5 BILLION IN THE PAST 24 HOURS The value of Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings is down $4.9 Billion in the past day, to a total of $118.4 Billion. He is still wealthier than Mukesh Ambani, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates. pic.twitter.com/GcNrBYWGzy — Arkham (@arkham) October 30, 2025 That silence remains one of Bitcoin’s most powerful features, an unshakable belief that value can exist beyond identity. Where the Smart Money Is Looking The slowdown in Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics doesn’t mean apathy, it’s adaptation. Institutional players are focusing on Layer 2s, stablecoin ecosystems, and tokenized treasuries instead of direct BTC transactions. This shift represents maturity: Bitcoin as the foundation, stablecoins as the transaction layer, and DeFi as the engine. The market is no longer defined by speculation alone, it’s defined by infrastructure. Meanwhile, retail investors remain cautious. After a brutal “Rektober” that saw $25 billion in longs liquidated, traders are wary of chasing volatility. Many now see Bitcoin sub-$110K as an accumulation zone rather than a panic level. 16 Years Later, the Vision Holds It’s almost poetic that as Satoshi’s wealth fluctuates wildly, the Bitcoin idea he created remains stable in purpose. Bitcoin has survived wars, bans, forks, and crashes, yet it still leads every market cycle. In 16 years, the world has gone from mocking digital money to regulating it, taxing it, and building empires on top of it. From El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds to BlackRock’s BTC ETF, the vision has become reality. The world runs on Satoshi’s code, whether Wall Street admits it or not. So, what’s next for Bitcoin? If stablecoins are the heartbeat of liquidity and Bitcoin the store of value, then the next evolution will connect the two seamlessly. Networks like Lightning, Stacks, and BitVM are already building bridges to make Bitcoin more usable again, without compromising its decentralized purity. The quiet chain doesn’t mean a dying one. It means a patient one. Bitcoin is resting while the rest of the market experiments. It’s the anchor in a sea of volatility, and Satoshi’s unmoved coins remain its silent testament. Satoshi Nakamoto may be “down” $5 billion on paper, but in truth, he’s never looked richer. He built a system that outlived governments, rewired global finance, and gave birth to the largest decentralized movement in history. Sixteen years later, Bitcoin is more than a currency. It’s a language of value, one spoken in hashes, mined in blocks, and secured by believers. So while Satoshi’s wallet sits untouched and his wealth fluctuates, his influence remains untouchable. Bitcoin still belongs to no one, and that’s why it belongs to everyone. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Instead, it turned into Rektober. Over $25 billion worth of long positions have been liquidated across crypto markets this month, one of the heaviest waves of forced selling in 2025. This is insane. $25,000,000,000 in long positions has been liquidated this month. Uptober has turned into Rektober. — Ted (@TedPillows) October 30, 2025 In the past 24 hours alone, data from CoinGlass shows 218,829 traders got wiped out, with $1.11 billion in total liquidations. Bitcoin and Ethereum led the bloodbath, followed by Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. The mood? Pure chaos. Bitcoin Slips Below $110K as ETFs Trigger Outflows The correction didn’t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin ETFs saw $470 million in outflows following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut, the largest drawdown in two weeks. ETF investors, usually the calmest in the room, are quietly trimming exposure after months of inflows. Here’s how the outflows stacked up: Fidelity: –$164M ARK Invest: –$143M BlackRock: –$88M Grayscale: –$65M Despite the outflows, ETFs still collectively hold 1.5 million BTC, about 7.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. But the tone in institutional circles is shifting. Some traders call it a “controlled exit wave”, a rotation into cash or short-term bonds while waiting for volatility to settle. BLACKROCK JUST MOVED $87M IN BITCOIN BlackRock’s $IBIT ETF transferred 794 BTC ($87.4M) to Coinbase, plus 48 $ETH ($188K).

BlackRock Moves $87M in Bitcoin to Coinbase Then came the BlackRock move. On-chain data flagged a transfer of 794 BTC (worth $87.4 million) and 48 ETH ($188K) from BlackRock’s IBIT ETF wallet to Coinbase on Wednesday. At first glance, it could just be routine ETF settlement. But it’s happening right as volatility spikes, and traders are watching closely. Whenever BlackRock moves coins to an exchange, it sends a signal. Whether it’s to rebalance holdings, settle redemptions, or prepare for liquidity events, markets read it as a potential shift in sentiment. Some analysts see it as early de-risking ahead of month-end. Others call it “business as usual” for ETF accounting. But either way, it has people talking. Bitcoin ETFs saw $470M in outflows after the Fed’s rate cut – the biggest in two weeks. $BTC slipped below $110K as institutions trimmed exposure: • Fidelity: -$164M • ARK Invest: -$143M • BlackRock: -$88M • Grayscale: -$65M ETFs still hold 1.5M BTC (~7.3% of total supply),… pic.twitter.com/cVm5atIMke — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) October 30, 2025 Institutions Hit Pause After Fed Rate Cut The Federal Reserve’s latest 0.25% rate cut was supposed to be bullish for risk assets. But instead of triggering another leg up, it seems to have caused a profit-taking cascade. Funds that were overweight Bitcoin and Ethereum started locking in gains after a 20% rally earlier this month. “The cut wasn’t a green light, it was a signal to rebalance,” said one macro trader on X. Add to that concerns over U.S. election uncertainty and quarter-end portfolio shuffling, and you get a perfect setup for liquidation pressure. For context, October’s total liquidation figure, $25 billion, is the largest since June 2022’s post-Terra crash cycle. SpaceX Joins the Action, Quietly While Wall Street was unloading, SpaceX was quietly reorganizing its crypto reserves. According to Lookonchain, Elon Musk’s aerospace company transferred 281 BTC (worth $31.28 million) to a new wallet: bc1qmg6ajfshpqe5gsp332ehqjju4ecrl9xcrqrmh2 But that’s not all. Over the past 10 days, SpaceX has moved Bitcoin three separate times, suggesting a broader internal restructuring or custody optimization. What’s interesting is the pattern, each transfer routes to new, clean wallets, often used for institutional-grade cold storage. No official statement from SpaceX yet, but analysts are speculating it could be tied to custody migration or audit preparation ahead of quarterly reporting. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) just transferred another 281 $BTC ($31.28M) to a new wallet — likely for custody purposes. In the past 10 days, #SpaceX has moved their BTC holdings three times. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/XstZgyryOA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 30, 2025 Market Sentiment Swings Funding rates on perpetual futures flipped negative across major exchanges, with long traders paying shorts, a sign of fading bullish momentum. Altcoins took the biggest hit: SOL: down 7.4% AVAX: down 9.1% DOGE: down 6.8% PEPE: down 11.2% Ethereum fell 7% to $3,700 Analysts Split on What’s Next Opinions are divided. Some see this as healthy correction territory, not a full trend reversal. Long-term holders, particularly whale wallets, haven’t significantly reduced their positions. On-chain data still shows net accumulation among large holders despite ETF redemptions. That suggests institutions are adjusting exposure, not abandoning the market. Others warn the worst may not be over. With U.S. GDP data and corporate earnings due next week, volatility could spike again if macro indicators disappoint. A Turning Point for Uptober Just two weeks ago, the narrative was simple: Bitcoin ETFs were surging, retail sentiment was high, and Uptober memes flooded X. Now? Uptober has officially turned into Rektober. But if history is any guide, these shakeouts often mark the mid-cycle reset before the next move higher. Bitcoin is still up 14% year-to-date, and the number of active addresses continues to rise, both signs that the bull structure remains intact. From BlackRock’s quiet transfers to SpaceX’s hidden wallet moves, the message is clear: institutional players are watching, adjusting, and staying nimble. Crypto markets are evolving, faster, sharper, and more sensitive to macro shifts than ever before. Whether this month’s chaos ends in a rebound or another correction, one truth stands: the game has changed. Bitcoin is no longer just retail-driven. It’s macro money now, and when giants move, markets follow. For now, Rektober lives up to its name. But as every crypto veteran knows, pain today often fuels the next rally. Brace for Novembull.

The bank predicts that the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will reach $2 trillion by 2028. According to Standard Chartered Bank analysis, the growth towards $2T by RWAs will be fueled by a self-reinforcing cycle of liquidity and innovation sparked by the 2025 stablecoin performance. Stablecoins have pushed blockchain-based finance beyond the crypto niche and into the broader financial ecosystem. Standard Chartered Bank highlights that MMFs and equities could bring $750 billion each According to Standard Chartered estimates, non-stablecoin tokenized assets are projected to grow from the current $35 billion to $2 trillion by 2028, matching the expected size of the stablecoin market. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, noted that DeFi eliminates the need for a central authority and operates on the principles of transparency, accessibility, and code-based trust. He added that the DeFi ecosystem is emerging as a credible challenge to established traditional financial structures. 🚨 NEW: STANDARD CHARTERED SEES $2T IN TOKENIZED RWA MARKET BY 2028 The bank says this would match stablecoins as DeFi enters a self-sustaining growth phase. pic.twitter.com/ShylCXlexC — Kyle Chassé / DD🐸 (@kyle_chasse) October 30, 2025 The report highlighted that money-market funds and listed equities could each account for approximately $750 billion of the total. ETF funds, private equity, commodities, corporate debt, and real estate will contribute the rest. The report further highlighted how stablecoins have evolved to become a core payment infrastructure. Stablecoin adoption has driven on-chain liquidity, supporting lending, borrowing, and digital payments, initially dominated by banks. The stablecoin market cap currently stands at roughly $308 billion, led by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Based on on-chain data , Tether USDT has a market cap of $183.39 billion, followed by USDC at $75.82 billion. Other emerging stablecoins are Ethena USDe, with roughly $9 billion, Sky Dollar USDS, with approximately $5 billion, and DAI, with $4.8 billion. Kendrick noted that the growth in stablecoin use in 2025 has helped push the maturity of the DeFi ecosystem. He added that it enabled non-banking entities to handle payments and savings products, while creating liquidity that helps in lending and investments across the blockchain. He described that the liquidity created a flywheel effect, resulting in new products that attract more liquidity and make DeFi more competitive with traditional financial systems. Standard Chartered believes regulatory uncertainty thwarts growth The bank, however, warned that U.S. regulatory uncertainty poses a risk factor, noting that if regulators fail to deliver clear digital asset rules before the 2026 midterm elections, market momentum could slow. The study by the lender highlighted the regulatory frameworks already in place in Europe, the UK, and Singapore, noting that they are more advanced and supportive of tokenization. For instance, the European Union members have adopted the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation MiCA licensing, which regulates crypto-related activities across the bloc. According to a July report , nearly 40 crypto asset providers had already obtained the license. The regulation was applied first to CASPs in June 2024, replacing the by-country law, forming a unified approach to crypto regulation across the bloc. The license enables crypto firms to operate legally across the European Economic Area. Singapore, so far, is the leading region in terms of people adopting cryptocurrencies, as well as having clear regulations surrounding crypto assets. Cryptopolitan recently reported that the country achieved a composite score of 100, driven by crypto adoption and public interest. The report also revealed that roughly 24% of Singapore’s population holds crypto assets, which is more than double the 11% adoption rate last year, due to clear regulations supporting the industry. Standard Chartered projects that the line between DeFi on-chain finance and traditional markets will shrink faster as DeFi platforms continue to tokenize real-world assets, such as corporate bonds and real estate. The bank believes that the convergence of the two markets may reshape the global finance industry, currently valued at around $100 trillion, by integrating programmable money, automated lending, and 24/7 settlement.

The world of cryptocurrency investment and traditional stock markets often sees dramatic shifts, but few stories are as stark as the recent performance of KindlyMD stock . Investors are reeling from a shocking 98% plunge in the Nasdaq-listed firm’s stock price since May. This significant downturn has left many wondering about the future of a company that, interestingly, also holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin. What Caused the Dramatic Drop in KindlyMD Stock? The precipitous fall of KindlyMD stock didn’t happen in a vacuum. Cointelegraph reported that the decline was primarily triggered by a massive investor sell-off. This exodus occurred shortly after the company completed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, raising an astonishing $563 million. PIPE Deal Impact: A PIPE typically involves institutional investors buying shares directly from a public company, often at a discount. While it injects capital, existing shareholders sometimes view it negatively, fearing dilution or perceiving it as a sign of financial distress. Investor Reaction: In KindlyMD’s case, the market reacted strongly, leading to widespread selling pressure that decimated the stock’s value. The sheer scale of the sell-off underscores a significant lack of confidence among investors following the announcement. Understanding the dynamics of such a significant financial event is crucial for anyone tracking the intersection of biotech and crypto investments. KindlyMD’s Bitcoin Holdings: A Silver Lining or Added Complexity for NAKA Stock? Amidst the turmoil surrounding KindlyMD stock , it’s essential to consider the company’s unique position as a firm that actively acquires Bitcoin. KindlyMD’s merger with Bitcoin investment firm Nakamoto Holdings was a pivotal moment, aligning its future with the volatile cryptocurrency market. Currently, KindlyMD boasts an impressive treasury of 5,765 BTC. At recent valuations, these holdings are worth approximately $653 million. This substantial Bitcoin stash raises an intriguing question: Could KindlyMD’s significant Bitcoin portfolio eventually stabilize or even boost its stock? While holding Bitcoin offers potential for future appreciation, it also introduces additional market volatility. The value of these holdings fluctuates daily with the broader crypto market, adding another layer of risk for investors in KindlyMD stock . Navigating Market Volatility: Lessons from KindlyMD’s Journey The journey of KindlyMD stock offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities at the crossroads of traditional finance and the digital asset world. The company’s recent performance highlights how even significant capital raises and substantial crypto holdings do not guarantee stability in a dynamic market. For investors, this situation underscores several key considerations: Due Diligence: Thoroughly research a company’s financial strategies, especially when mergers and large private placements are involved. Market Sentiment: Be aware that market reactions to financial events can sometimes outweigh a company’s underlying asset value in the short term. Diversification: Relying heavily on a single asset class, whether traditional stock or cryptocurrency, can expose portfolios to greater risk. KindlyMD’s stock closed at $0.85 on Thursday, a stark reminder of its peak value just months prior. This figure reflects the harsh reality of investor sentiment and market forces at play. What’s Next for KindlyMD Stock and Its Future? The path forward for KindlyMD stock appears challenging, but not without potential. The company’s significant Bitcoin reserves could, under different market conditions, become a strong asset. However, rebuilding investor confidence will be paramount. Key areas to watch include: Operational Performance: How will KindlyMD leverage the PIPE funds for its core business operations? Bitcoin Strategy: Will the company adjust its Bitcoin acquisition or holding strategy in response to market pressures? Investor Relations: What steps will KindlyMD take to communicate its long-term vision and reassure shareholders? Ultimately, the recovery of KindlyMD stock will depend on a combination of strategic execution, favorable market conditions for both its core business and Bitcoin, and a renewed trust from the investment community. The dramatic fall of KindlyMD’s stock serves as a powerful case study in the unpredictable nature of today’s markets, particularly for companies bridging the gap between traditional equity and the burgeoning world of digital assets. While the company holds significant Bitcoin, the immediate investor reaction to its PIPE deal highlights the complex interplay of financial mechanisms and market psychology. Moving forward, all eyes will be on KindlyMD as it navigates these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the 98% plunge in KindlyMD stock? A: The significant decline was primarily due to a massive investor sell-off following a recent $563 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, as reported by Cointelegraph. Q2: How much Bitcoin does KindlyMD currently hold? A: KindlyMD currently holds 5,765 BTC, which was valued at approximately $653 million at the time of the report. Q3: What is a PIPE deal and why did it affect KindlyMD stock? A: A PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) involves institutional investors buying shares directly from a public company. While it raises capital, existing shareholders sometimes react negatively, fearing dilution or perceiving it as a sign of underlying issues, leading to sell-offs. Q4: Does KindlyMD’s Bitcoin holdings affect its stock price? A: Yes, while the Bitcoin holdings offer potential for appreciation, they also introduce additional volatility to the company’s valuation, as the value of BTC fluctuates with the broader crypto market. Q5: What is Nakamoto Holdings? A: Nakamoto Holdings is a Bitcoin investment firm that merged with KindlyMD, aligning KindlyMD’s strategy with Bitcoin acquisition and investment.

Trading in the $2.50–$2.70 range, XRP may be in the early stages of a new upward leg driven by ETFs, treasury-flows, and structural technical setups. Related Reading: Bitcoin Technical Setup Shows Short-Term Pullback May Fuel Long-Term Upside Institutional Flows & Treasury Vehicles Spark Bullish Outlook XRP’s resurgence is supported by a sharp uptick in institutional interest. A recently launched XRP-exposure vehicle has already pulled in over $115 million in assets, while trading volumes in related futures markets have soared into the billions. This trend echoes the supply-constraint thesis that many analysts believe will fuel the next leg higher. Beyond ETF vehicles, corporate treasuries and dedicated acquisition firms are lining up behind XRP. One example is a firm planning to raise over $1 billion for a publicly-traded entity focused exclusively on XRP accumulation via its balance sheet. With such large-scale buying set to lock up supply, scarcity dynamics could increasingly favor the bulls. This institutional tailwind now places XRP in the same narrative once reserved for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with XRP rapidly capturing mainstream investor interest. XRP Chart-Setup Resembles 2017 Bull Cycle, Targeting Double-Digits Technically, XRP’s current structure has drawn comparisons to its 2017 run. Analysts tracking Elliott Wave counts suggest XRP may be in the early phase of Wave 3, a phase that historically triggers major price moves. Under one scenario, this could propel the token from its current $2.56 level into double-digit territory. Support near the $2.50–$2.60 band remains intact, underpinning the bullish case. If XRP can break and hold above nearby resistance (circa $2.67–$2.70), momentum could accelerate. XRP's price records some losses on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD chart on Tradingview That said, caution flags remain. Divergence between price and momentum indicators and elevated selling pressure from large holders suggest that short-term pull-backs are possible unless volume picks up decisively. Nevertheless, with the institutional backdrop strengthening and a classic bullish base forming, XRP appears positioned to follow its 2017 ‘re-accumulation to breakout’ script, potentially setting up a move toward $10, $20, or beyond, should all variables align. The Road Ahead: Key Levels & Watch-points Market watchers will be keeping close tabs on two key levels. On the upside, a sustained breakout above $2.70 could open a path to $3 and perhaps much higher if institutional flows accelerate. On the downside, a breakdown below $2.50 might signal delay and consolidation. Meanwhile, headlines around ETF approvals, corporate treasury buys, and real-world asset activity on the XRP Ledger will likely set the tone for the next major leg.

53845648,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88096,1761876010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Kaspa and ZCash’s Charts Draw Eyes, But BlockDAG’s  Coinbase–Kraken Leak Has Everyone Talking!",https://timestabloid.com/kaspa-and-zcashs-charts-draw-eyes-but-blockdags-coinbase/,"The Kaspa (KAS) price chart has shown sharp moves this week, swinging between $0.05 and $0.06 as traders search for balance after a recent drop. At the same time, the ZCash (ZEC) price performance has shocked many after rising from under $140 to almost $280 in a few days. This sudden spike has doubled attention toward privacy-focused coins. Both charts reveal a familiar pattern: funds are rotating fast, and the search for the next big opportunity for investing in crypto is heating up. So, where does this energy move next? Often, when large platforms quietly prepare for something new, it’s a sign that major change is on the way. That’s when BlockDAG (BDAG) caught the spotlight. The post that set the market talking came from That Martini Guy, hinting that @blockdagnetwork might be getting ready for listings on Coinbase and Kraken. BlockDAG: The Leak That Is Drawing Global Attention! It began with a single tweet and turned into global chatter. That Martini Guy ’s mention of possible Coinbase and Kraken listings made every crypto feed light up, and BlockDAG quickly became the most discussed project online. This wasn’t a baseless rumor. Verified reports and early-stage documents show that real talks could be taking place behind closed doors. The timing couldn’t be more perfect. BlockDAG’s presale just soared past nearly $435M, gaining more than 312,000 holders. Many now see this as more than market gossip; it feels like an early sign of something real. If these exchange discussions turn into reality, BlockDAG could shift from a presale story to one with a strong institutional presence almost overnight. Sources mention that liquidity support, trading partnerships, and marketing plans already fit Coinbase and Kraken’s typical listing models. This alignment is what’s driving the buzz that BDAG could be the best option for investing in crypto right now, as it moves from early growth to global trust. Its structure only adds strength to that claim. With Batch 32 priced at $0.005 and a confirmed $0.05 listing set for February 10, 2026, the built-in growth potential is huge. Combine that with its hybrid PoW-DAG framework, 20K+ miners already distributed, and mounting exchange talk, and it’s easy to see why many call BlockDAG the next big step in investing in crypto before headlines confirm what insiders already sense. ZCash (ZEC) Price Performance Signals Comeback ZCash (ZEC) has been one of this month’s biggest stories. In only a few weeks, its price shot from nearly $130 to close to $280, more than doubling in value. This comeback followed major updates that boosted transaction speed and cut network fees by almost 97%. The quick recovery pushed ZEC back into the spotlight, outpacing several large-cap coins and drawing new attention on exchanges. For a project that had stayed quiet for months, this rebound proved that privacy-driven assets can still make huge moves when the fundamentals and momentum align. Analysts say this surge also follows clear chart signals, like a “golden cross” on major timeframes and shrinking short-term supply on trading platforms. With global talks rising around privacy rights and data safety, ZEC’s next key resistance at $300 could decide its next direction. Whether it keeps climbing or pauses, this run has already shifted the market’s outlook, turning ZCash into one of 2025’s strongest recovery plays. Kaspa (KAS) Price Chart Shows Strength Around $0.05 Kaspa’s (KAS) chart continues to show tight movement between $0.05 and $0.06 after sliding from around $0.064 earlier in October. This pattern signals consolidation, with traders waiting for the next clear move. The $0.050 support has held firm through several tests, suggesting that buying pressure remains even with smaller trading volume. Experts view this level as the key to sustaining interest, especially after last week’s pullback from recent highs. Resistance sits near $0.060–$0.065, where selling pressure tends to appear each time the price tests higher. Models show that if Kaspa stays above the current support, a short rebound could push it beyond $0.06 again. If it slips, the next support could form around $0.042. Technical indicators like RSI and MACD show neutral energy for now. Still, Kaspa’s fast DAG-based structure keeps it appealing to analysts. BlockDAG Leads the Future of Investing in Crypto! ZCash’s price strength and Kaspa’s stable chart both show how crypto trends are shifting right now. ZEC’s fast October rise doubled its worth, while Kaspa’s steady range shows firm structure and potential for its next push. Both highlight that the strongest coins are those proving their base, either through stability or fast recovery. Yet the biggest buzz surrounds BlockDAG. With its nearly $435M presale, 312K+ holders, and rumors of Coinbase–Kraken listings, it’s become impossible to ignore. Many see BDAG as the next major story in investing in crypto, one that could reshape market rankings once the official confirmations drop.

53845626,617320,1761876012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53845626.jpeg,Old Bitcoin Supply Remains Calm: ASOL Shows No Panic Selling,https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-supply-remains-calm-asol-panic-selling/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to hold the $110,000 support level as price pressure intensifies heading into the final days of the month. Market structure remains fragile following recent volatility, and several analysts warn that BTC could still retest lower demand zones before establishing a stronger base. With liquidity pockets sitting below current price and sellers showing persistence near resistance, short-term downside cannot be ruled out as traders reassess positioning after the Federal Reserve’s policy shift. However, not all signals point to weakness. Many investors remain optimistic as macroeconomic conditions begin favoring risk assets once again. The Fed’s recent 25bps rate cut and confirmation that quantitative tightening will end by December 1st have laid the groundwork for what some view as the early phase of a new liquidity cycle — historically constructive for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. On-chain data also supports a calmer market environment. Over the past month, the activity of old coins has remained moderate, with long-term holders showing no signs of panic selling. This behavior suggests conviction among seasoned market participants, even as BTC navigates short-term turbulence. Collectively, these dynamics frame a market in transition: tactically cautious, yet strategically positioned for potential upside. Low ASOL Activity Signals Strong Holder Conviction According to on-chain insights highlighted by top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s recent spending behavior among long-term holders remains remarkably stable, underscoring strong market conviction even as price struggles to hold above key support. Adler points to the Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) — a metric that measures the average age of coins being moved on-chain — noting that while there were short-lived upticks to 245 days on October 8 and 209 days on October 21, these signals were far weaker than the heavy long-term holder activity seen in spring and June. This distinction is important: during those earlier periods, older coins moving signaled meaningful distribution events, often preceding corrective phases. In contrast, the recent mild increases indicate no widespread desire among long-term holders to exit positions. The 30-day ASOL moving average currently sits near 111 days, which Adler characterizes as a structural baseline — a zone consistent with healthy consolidation rather than distribution. In practical terms, this means seasoned holders remain patient, showing no urgency to take profits, despite macro uncertainty and short-term volatility. At the same time, incoming liquidity continues to absorb supply, as referenced in this week’s Substack commentary. This absorption dynamic is crucial: it reflects a market where available Bitcoin is gradually tightening, enabling price stability even as speculative flows remain constrained. Collectively, these on-chain conditions suggest a foundational phase rather than exhaustion. As liquidity improves and macro headwinds ease, this quiet conviction among long-term holders could form the groundwork for the next significant leg higher — once demand meaningfully re-accelerates. For now, the market remains calm beneath the surface, a posture historically associated with accumulation phases and future expansion rather than broader distribution or capitulation. Bitcoin Holds Above $110K But Faces Rejections Below Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $110,100, attempting to stabilize after another sharp rejection from the $117,500 resistance area — a level that has consistently capped upside attempts since mid-August. The 12-hour chart shows a repeat pattern: each move toward the upper range fades near the cluster of moving averages, with sellers stepping in aggressively at resistance and forcing BTC back into its mid-range support zone. BTC is currently holding above a key demand band between $108,500 and $110,000, an area that previously acted as a pivot during late-September and early-October price action. Maintaining this zone is critical for bulls. A breakdown here would expose Bitcoin to the $104,000–$106,000 region, where price wicked during the October 10 liquidation flush. On the upside, a structural shift requires BTC to reclaim the 50- and 100-period moving averages on the 12h timeframe and establish a foothold above $114,500. Only then would momentum build for another test of $117,500, with a confirmed breakout opening a path toward $120,000–$123,000. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound, caught between macro optimism and lingering supply pressure. With volatility compressing again, the next strong move is likely to come once the market digests recent policy shifts and liquidity flows begin redirecting decisively.

53845988,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=849604,1761876372,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53845988.jpeg,Nvidia bets $1B on AI startup poolside driving its value,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-bets-1b-on-poolside/,"Nvidia Corp. commits to allocating as much as $1 billion to Poolside, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company, according to sources close to the matter. Based on their prediction, this investment plan would increase the value of the AI startup by four times its current value. The announcement leaks on the heels of Poolside’s plans to raise approximately $2 billion while being valued at $12 billion. It is essential to note that the quoted number does not incorporate prior financing. Although the sum of Nvidia’s commitment to this current round has not been revealed, a source who asked to remain anonymous stated that the tech giant would start at $500 million and increase to as high as $1 billion if Poolside meets its fundraising goals. This news follows the rise of Nvidia stock to a record closing price after the company announced new products, collaborations, and investments at its GTC event, pushing its market valuation to $5 trillion . Nvidia also revealed earlier this week that it’s teaming up with the US Department of Energy to construct seven supercomputers, including one designed with 10,000 of its Blackwell GPUs. The semiconductor firm, aiming to work on national security applications, also announced new alliances with Palantir and Oracle, as well as with telecom companies such as Cisco and T-Mobile, to support the next wave of 6G infrastructure. Big tech companies seek to offer support to a growing network of AI startups Regarding its funding round, sources have revealed that Poolside has already received more than $1 billion in commitments, with around $700 million secured from its current investors . Meanwhile, Magnetar, a money management company specializing in hedge fund investments, is also in talks to participate in this round, according to The Information. Following this announcement, Poolside’s valuation substantially increased from the $3 billion investors predicted during a funding round last year. The outcome illustrates growing investor confidence in an AI startup that introduced its first product just a year ago, as evidenced by its big commitment. Founded in 2023, Poolside focuses on coding automation for government and defense uses but seeks to establish a multipurpose artificial general intelligence (AGI). Notably, it has offices in the US and Paris, France. With AGI, the AI startup intends to remain competitive in the industry. On the other hand, Nvidia’s involvement in the funding round demonstrates a growing trend among big companies by market value seeking to support a growing network of AI startups with the perspective that these startups might become important clients. For example, one source noted that Poolside plans to utilize some of the newly raised funds to purchase Nvidia’s GB300 chips. According to the source, Nvidia has previously invested in the AI startup. This agreement also aligns with Poolside’s extensive infrastructure plans. Earlier this month, the company announced a partnership with CoreWeave Inc. to develop one of the biggest data centers in the US as part of Project Horizon. The facility is slated to be located in West Texas and is projected to have a capacity of 2 gigawatts, sufficient to supply power to approximately 1.5 million homes. Nvidia aims to remain competitive with significant investments in the AI industry Under the leadership of Jason Warner, who was a former executive at GitHub, Poolside is among several fast-growing AI firms that have caught Nvidia’s attention. According to reports from sources, Nvidia has already invested in 59 AI startups as of mid-October this year. This number has exceeded its total investments from the previous year, according to PitchBook data. Moreover, the Silicon Valley-based AI chipmaker has invested in Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, and Figure AI, a company focusing on humanoid robotics. During Nvidia’s GTC conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s Chief Executive Officer, expressed his pleasure in discovering that AI startups are built on Nvidia. “There are many reasons for this. First, our ecosystem is strong. Our tools perform really well,” Huang added.

While transparency is a core tenet of blockchain, exposing personal financial history can be a major concern for users. This is where the groundbreaking collaboration between zero-knowledge (ZK) technology firm Brevis and AI-based Web3 information platform Kaito steps in, introducing a revolutionary approach to privacy-preserving on-chain verification within the InfoFi (Information + Finance) ecosystem. What is Privacy-Preserving On-Chain Verification? Imagine being able to prove your credentials or financial standing on a blockchain without revealing a single detail about your wallet address or entire portfolio. That’s the essence of privacy-preserving on-chain verification . It’s a game-changer for how we interact with decentralized applications and services. Brevis, a leader in ZK technology, has teamed up with Kaito, an innovative platform that merges information with finance. Their joint effort aims to create a more secure and private environment for Web3 participants. This means users can now verify their on-chain history in Kaito campaigns using Brevis’s sophisticated ZK proof technology, all while keeping their sensitive data under wraps. Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In simpler terms, you can prove you meet a certain criterion without showing the underlying data that confirms it. This is crucial for maintaining user anonymity and trust in the Web3 space. Why Does On-Chain Privacy Matter in Web3? For a long time, participating in Web3 activities meant exposing your wallet address and, by extension, your entire transaction history to the public. This lack of privacy raised significant concerns for many users, ranging from potential security risks to unwanted scrutiny of their financial activities. Moreover, it hindered broader adoption by those wary of relinquishing their anonymity. The introduction of privacy-preserving on-chain verification directly addresses these issues. By enabling users to verify their status—such as being a long-term holder or an active DeFi participant—without disclosing their complete financial footprint, the collaboration fosters a more secure and equitable environment. Users gain greater control over their data, minimizing the risk of targeted attacks or unwanted surveillance. Consequently, this enhanced privacy encourages more users to engage with Web3 platforms and campaigns. When individuals feel their data is protected, they are more likely to participate, contributing to a healthier and more vibrant decentralized ecosystem. This move signifies a crucial step towards making Web3 truly accessible and safe for everyone. How Does Brevis’s ZK Proof Technology Power This Innovation? At the heart of this partnership lies Brevis’s cutting-edge ZK proof technology. This advanced cryptographic solution is what makes true privacy-preserving on-chain verification possible. Previously, users on platforms like Kaito had to directly connect their wallets, a practice that, while functional, presented clear privacy vulnerabilities. Their entire portfolio became visible, potentially exposing them to various risks. With Brevis’s technology, this changes dramatically. Instead of revealing their wallet, users can now generate a ZK proof. This proof cryptographically confirms that they meet specific criteria (e.g., holding a certain asset for a defined period) without actually disclosing their wallet address or the details of their holdings. It’s like proving you have a valid ID without showing your name or address. This innovative feature has already been successfully applied to the Brevis Yapher Leaderboard. Participants can now anonymously prove their eligibility and status. This not only enhances user privacy but also builds a stronger foundation of trust, allowing for more secure and inclusive participation in the InfoFi ecosystem. The Future of InfoFi: What Does This Partnership Mean? The collaboration between Brevis and Kaito is more than just a technical upgrade; it represents a significant leap forward for the entire InfoFi landscape. By prioritizing privacy-preserving on-chain verification , they are setting a new standard for how information and finance intertwine in Web3. This initiative is expected to unlock a wave of new possibilities and applications. For instance, imagine more secure and equitable lending platforms, anonymous governance participation, or personalized financial services that respect user privacy by default. This partnership paves the way for a Web3 where users can confidently engage in complex financial interactions without compromising their personal data. Moreover, as trust and privacy become foundational elements, we can anticipate increased institutional and mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies. The ability to verify without revealing is a powerful incentive for individuals and organizations alike to participate more actively and securely in the decentralized future. This strategic alliance underscores a clear trend: the future of Web3 is private, secure, and user-centric. Brevis and Kaito are not just building tools; they are shaping the infrastructure for a more responsible and accessible digital economy. Conclusion The partnership between Brevis and Kaito marks a pivotal moment for Web3 privacy. By introducing robust privacy-preserving on-chain verification , they are empowering users with unprecedented control over their digital identities and financial data. This move promises to foster greater trust, encourage broader participation, and ultimately accelerate the evolution of a more secure and equitable decentralized internet. It’s a testament to the innovative spirit driving Web3 towards a future where privacy and transparency can coexist harmoniously.

Her remarks illuminate the Russian stablecoin policy , indicating a cautious yet strategic approach. This move is crucial for anyone watching the global crypto landscape, especially regarding how major economies integrate digital currencies into their financial systems. What Does the Russian Stablecoin Policy Entail? The Governor’s statement, as reported by Cryptopolitan, is straightforward: stablecoins can indeed be issued within Russia. However, there’s a critical caveat. These digital assets are strictly prohibited for domestic payments. This clear directive shapes the core of the Russian stablecoin policy . Key takeaway: Stablecoins are permitted for issuance. Crucial restriction: Not for use in internal transactions. This distinction highlights Russia’s intent to leverage the benefits of digital assets without disrupting its internal monetary stability or sovereignty. Why International Use for Stablecoins Under Russia’s Policy? So, if not for domestic payments, what’s the purpose? Nabiullina emphasized two primary applications for stablecoins: international settlements and attracting foreign investment. This aspect of the Russian stablecoin policy points towards a strategic play in the global financial arena. Boosting Cross-Border Trade: Stablecoins could streamline international transactions, potentially offering faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional banking channels. Attracting Capital: By providing a regulated framework for stablecoin issuance, Russia aims to create new avenues for foreign capital inflow, potentially bypassing some traditional financial hurdles. This pragmatic approach could offer Russia a competitive edge in an increasingly digital global economy. The Drive Behind Russia’s Stablecoin Policy Discussions These recent remarks from the Central Bank Governor don’t come out of the blue. They follow a significant call from Russian Senator Artem Sheikin. The Senator advocated for the issuance of a ruble-pegged stablecoin and the establishment of a robust regulatory framework to support it. Senator Sheikin’s Vision: Aims to create a national digital asset tied to the ruble. Regulatory Imperative: Emphasizes the need for clear rules to govern these new financial instruments. This ongoing dialogue underscores a growing recognition within Russian official circles regarding the potential, and the challenges, of digital currencies. The Russian stablecoin policy is clearly a topic of active debate and development. Navigating the Challenges and Future of Russian Stablecoin Policy While the potential benefits for international trade and investment are clear, the prohibition on domestic use reflects underlying concerns. Central banks globally often worry about the impact of private digital currencies on monetary policy, financial stability, and consumer protection. Monetary Sovereignty: Preventing stablecoins from becoming an alternative currency within Russia helps maintain the central bank’s control over the national monetary supply. Financial Stability: Unregulated domestic stablecoins could pose risks to the banking system and broader financial stability. The cautious rollout of the Russian stablecoin policy demonstrates a measured approach, balancing innovation with the imperative to protect the national financial system. As global digital asset regulations evolve, Russia’s approach will be a key one to watch. The journey towards a fully integrated digital economy is complex, and nations like Russia are carefully charting their course. Elvira Nabiullina’s recent statement provides vital clarity on Russia’s approach to digital currencies. The Russian stablecoin policy is emerging as a nuanced strategy: embracing stablecoins for their international potential while firmly restricting their domestic application. This measured stance reflects a careful balance between fostering innovation in cross-border finance and safeguarding national monetary stability. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Russia’s distinctive path will undoubtedly influence global discussions on cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary directive of Russia’s central bank regarding stablecoins? A1: The primary directive is that stablecoins can be issued in Russia, but they are strictly prohibited for domestic payments. Q2: For what purposes can stablecoins be used under the new Russian policy? A2: Stablecoins can be used for international settlements and to attract foreign investment. Q3: Who is Elvira Nabiullina? A3: Elvira Nabiullina is the Governor of the Central Bank of Russia. Q4: What prompted the Central Bank’s recent statements on stablecoins?

A5: This restriction helps the central bank maintain monetary sovereignty, control over the national money supply, and safeguard financial stability within the country.

Fidelity’s FETH also contributed with $18.53 million in outflows. Notably, no Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows for the day, underscoring the collective bearish sentiment for the period. Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Losing Their Luster? Consecutive days of net outflows raise questions about the immediate appeal of Spot Ethereum ETFs .

If so, there’s a crucial announcement you need to be aware of. South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has declared a temporary Bithumb OM suspension for both deposits and withdrawals of Mantra (OM) tokens. This important change is scheduled to begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5. It is essential for all OM token holders to understand the implications of this upcoming event. Understanding the Bithumb OM Suspension Details This temporary halt is not arbitrary; it stems from a planned network upgrade for the Mantra (OM) token. Network upgrades are vital for improving blockchain efficiency, security, and introducing new features. While they are beneficial in the long run, they often require exchanges to pause transactions to ensure the safety and integrity of user funds during the transition. The Bithumb OM suspension ensures that no transactions are lost or mishandled during this technical process. This proactive measure by Bithumb helps protect users from potential issues that could arise if trading continued during the upgrade. It’s a standard practice within the cryptocurrency industry. What Does This Mean for Mantra (OM) Holders? For individuals holding Mantra (OM) tokens on Bithumb, the primary impact is the inability to move their tokens on or off the exchange starting November 5. This means you will not be able to deposit new OM tokens into your Bithumb account or withdraw existing ones. However, typically, trading within the exchange for OM tokens might continue, though it’s always wise to verify Bithumb’s specific policy regarding internal trading during such suspensions. It’s important to remember that this is a temporary situation. Once the network upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb verifies the stability of the new network, deposits and withdrawals will resume. Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact timing of the service restoration following the Bithumb OM suspension . Navigating the Temporary Halt: Actionable Steps If you need to move your Mantra (OM) tokens before the suspension, you have a limited window. Consider these actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you intend to deposit or withdraw OM tokens, do so well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline on November 5. Monitor Announcements: Regularly check Bithumb’s official website or social media channels for updates regarding the network upgrade and the resumption of services. Understand Your Options: If you require immediate liquidity for your OM tokens during the suspension, explore if internal trading on Bithumb remains active, or consider other exchanges that might not be affected (though transferring before the suspension is the only way to move off Bithumb). Being prepared is your best strategy to avoid any inconvenience caused by the Bithumb OM suspension . Why Do Exchanges Suspend Services for Upgrades? Exchanges like Bithumb temporarily suspend services for network upgrades to maintain the highest level of security and operational integrity. These upgrades often involve significant changes to the blockchain’s underlying code. During this period, transactions might not be processed correctly on an older version of the network, or new features might not be compatible with existing exchange infrastructure. By pausing services, Bithumb ensures a smooth transition to the upgraded network. This minimizes risks such as: Loss of funds during deposits or withdrawals. Incorrect transaction confirmations. Security vulnerabilities. Ultimately, these suspensions are for the benefit of the users, ensuring a safer and more robust trading environment post-upgrade. This commitment to security and functionality is a hallmark of a reliable exchange. Looking Ahead: Post-Suspension Expectations Once the Mantra (OM) network upgrade is complete and Bithumb has conducted all necessary checks, the Bithumb OM suspension for deposits and withdrawals will be lifted. Users can then expect a return to normal service. The upgrade itself might bring improvements to transaction speed, lower fees, or new functionalities for the Mantra (OM) token, potentially enhancing its utility and appeal. Staying informed through official channels is paramount. Bithumb will provide clear communication regarding when services are fully restored, allowing you to resume your usual OM token activities without any further interruptions. The upcoming Bithumb OM suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals is a temporary, yet significant, event driven by a necessary network upgrade. While it requires users to plan accordingly, it underscores Bithumb’s commitment to maintaining a secure and efficient trading platform. By understanding the reasons behind this suspension and taking proactive steps, OM token holders can navigate this period smoothly and look forward to an improved Mantra network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the exact date and time of the Bithumb OM suspension? A1: The temporary suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals on Bithumb will begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5. Q2: Why is Bithumb suspending OM deposits and withdrawals? A2: Bithumb is implementing the Bithumb OM suspension due to a scheduled network upgrade for the Mantra (OM) token. This is a standard procedure to ensure the safety and integrity of funds during technical transitions. Q3: Can I still trade Mantra (OM) on Bithumb during the suspension? A3: While deposits and withdrawals will be halted, internal trading of OM tokens on Bithumb may still be possible. Users should check Bithumb’s official announcements for the most precise information regarding trading activities during the suspension period. Q4: How long will the Bithumb OM suspension last? A4: The suspension is temporary and will last until the Mantra (OM) network upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb has verified the new network’s stability. Bithumb will announce the exact resumption time. Q5: What should I do if I need to move my OM tokens urgently? A5: If you need to deposit or withdraw OM tokens, it is crucial to complete these transactions before 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5. After this time, the services will be unavailable.

The market remains cautious following recent volatility, and traders are watching closely to determine whether ETH will resume its uptrend or continue drifting lower. Analysts are currently split: some argue Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, fueled by network activity, scaling advancements, and institutional traction, while others point to increasing downside pressure and weakening market structure that could lead to a deeper pullback. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Awakens After 8 Years – 1,500 ETH Sent to Kraken After 8 Years Despite the uncertainty in price, fresh on-chain data signals growing confidence among long-term participants. According to Santiment, more than 200,000 ETH — worth approximately $780 million — have been withdrawn from exchanges over the past 48 hours, marking one of the largest short-term outflow spikes this quarter. Such activity typically suggests accumulation, as investors move assets into self-custody rather than keeping them on exchanges to sell. This divergence between price hesitation and heavy accumulation reinforces the current market debate. With liquidity dynamics shifting, Ethereum sits at a pivotal moment, and its ability to reclaim $4,000 will likely determine whether bullish momentum re-emerges heading into November. Large ETH Withdrawals Signal Investor Conviction As Market Shifts Toward Risk-On Environment The recent wave of large Ethereum withdrawals from exchanges further reinforces a growing theme in the market: investor conviction is strengthening. With more than 200,000 ETH moved into self-custody within 48 hours, many participants appear confident in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. Historically, substantial exchange outflows have coincided with accumulation phases ahead of major market advances, especially when paired with favorable macro shifts. For many analysts, Ethereum now sits at the center of a potential bullish impulse across altcoins. Despite its recent struggle to convincingly reclaim the $4,000 level, sentiment in the broader market remains constructive. ETH continues to benefit from fundamental tailwinds, including increasing network utility, expanding Layer-2 activity, and rising staking participation. If market conditions turn decisively risk-on, Ethereum’s role as the primary settlement and liquidity hub for the altcoin ecosystem positions it to lead capital flows. Macro conditions are also aligning in ETH’s favor. With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 25 basis points and signaling the end of quantitative tightening, global liquidity is expected to gradually improve. Historically, shifts toward monetary easing have accelerated inflows into risk assets — crypto included. As traditional markets anticipate a clearer pivot, investors may increasingly seek exposure to high-beta assets with strong structural narratives, and Ethereum fits that profile.

After failing to sustain moves above the $4,200 resistance area earlier this month, ETH has drifted lower into a tightening range, reflecting indecision and reduced volatility following recent macro-driven swings. The chart shows ETH trading below both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, which currently sit just above price and are acting as dynamic resistance. For bulls, reclaiming these levels — particularly a daily close above $4,050–$4,150 — would be a constructive sign that momentum is shifting back in favor of buyers. Such a reclaim could open a path toward retesting $4,300–$4,500, where recent supply pressure has consistently emerged.

However, the 200-day moving average (red) remains well below the price near $3,200, signaling that the long-term bullish structure is still intact.

Just recently, Bitcoin (BTC) saw its value dip below the crucial $109,000 mark, sending ripples through digital asset portfolios. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC’s trading price on platforms like the Binance USDT market briefly touched $108,992.13. This movement is more than just a number; it reflects underlying market sentiment and various contributing factors. A sudden fall like this often triggers questions about market stability and future trajectories. For many, Bitcoin’s journey below $109,000 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility within the crypto space. It underscores the importance of staying informed and prepared for rapid shifts. What Factors Contributed to This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop? Several elements can influence a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Pinpointing a single cause is often challenging, as the market is a complex interplay of various forces. However, we can identify common catalysts: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events, often spill over into risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create investor apprehension, leading to sell-offs and contributing to a Bitcoin price drop . Technical Breakdowns: When key support levels are breached, it can trigger automated selling orders and psychological panic among traders, accelerating the downward momentum. Whale Activity: Large institutional or individual holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ moving significant amounts of BTC can impact liquidity and price stability. Market Sentiment: Negative news cycles or a general shift in investor confidence can quickly turn bullish sentiment bearish, contributing to a noticeable Bitcoin price drop . These factors rarely act in isolation; instead, they often combine to create a cumulative effect, amplifying market movements. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Your Portfolio? For current holders, a dip below a significant level like $109,000 can be concerning. However, it’s essential to consider both the short-term implications and the long-term perspective. Understanding the potential effects can help in making rational decisions. Increased Volatility: Such price movements highlight the high-risk, high-reward nature of cryptocurrency investments. Potential Buying Opportunity: Experienced investors often view significant dips as a chance to accumulate assets at a lower price, a strategy known as ‘buying the dip.’ Emotional Response: It’s natural to feel anxious during a market downturn. Maintaining a rational, long-term strategy is crucial to avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear. Portfolio Rebalancing: A price fall might be an opportune moment to review and rebalance your crypto holdings, aligning them with your risk tolerance and investment goals. It is important to remember that market fluctuations are a normal part of the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights After a Bitcoin Price Drop Understanding market dynamics is key, especially after a significant event like this Bitcoin price drop . Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these volatile periods: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reputable news sources and market analysis to understand the broader context. Knowledge is your best defense against market panic. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can also mitigate risks, spreading your exposure across different assets. Long-Term Vision: Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant downturns. A long-term perspective often helps weather short-term volatility, focusing on the asset’s fundamental value. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can smooth out the impact of price fluctuations over time. While the immediate news of BTC falling below $109,000 might seem daunting, it’s a typical event in the highly cyclical world of cryptocurrency. Informed decisions, coupled with a disciplined approach, are your best allies. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $109,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and the continuous interplay of various global and technical factors. While such movements can be unsettling, they also offer crucial learning opportunities for investors. By staying informed, managing risks effectively, and maintaining a long-term perspective, participants can navigate these fluctuations with greater confidence. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and understanding these shifts is paramount for anyone involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when BTC falls below a key psychological level like $109,000? A: When BTC falls below a key psychological level, it often signals a shift in market sentiment, potentially triggering further sell-offs as traders react to the breach of a perceived support level. It can also lead to increased volatility. Q2: Is a Bitcoin price drop a definitive sign of a bear market? A: Not necessarily. A single Bitcoin price drop doesn’t always confirm a bear market. It could be a temporary correction or a reaction to specific news. A bear market is typically characterized by sustained downward trends over an extended period. Q3: What should I do if my Bitcoin portfolio is currently down due to this drop? A: It’s crucial to avoid impulsive decisions. Review your original investment thesis, assess your risk tolerance, and consider your long-term goals. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging or holding (HODLing) might be appropriate, depending on your individual situation. Q4: How often do Bitcoin prices experience significant drops? A: Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and significant price drops are not uncommon. Historically, it has experienced numerous corrections, sometimes by substantial percentages, often followed by periods of recovery and new highs. Q5: What is the role of market sentiment in BTC price movements? A: Market sentiment plays a huge role. Positive sentiment (greed) can drive prices up, while negative sentiment (fear) can lead to rapid sell-offs. News, social media trends, and investor confidence heavily influence this collective sentiment. Did you find this analysis helpful?

While major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum saw limited breakout momentum, risk appetite rebounded across sectors such as memecoin, GameFi, and AI, driving impressive secondary market rallies. As a global leading digital asset trading platform, HTX captured this momentum with a diversified range of listings. The week’s top 10 gainers spanned memecoin, GameFi, Base AI, DeFi, and Privacy sectors, with the leading token soaring by 222%. This strengthens the platform’s role as a hub for emerging opportunities. AI Agents on Base Blockchain Ignite Smart Economy This year, the “AI + Blockchain” narrative continues to dominate popularity in the crypto space. Base, Ethereum’s Layer 2 powerhouse, is at the center of the new AI revolution. ● GAME (GAME by Virtuals) : Up 167%. As an AI agent token within the Virtuals Protocol ecosystem, it is designed for on-chain business and generative service applications. GAME climbed from $0.013 to $0.034, fueled by Base network upgrades and renewed enthusiasm for AI narratives. ● VIRTUAL (Virtuals Protocol) : Up 80%.

Hot Token Listing Winners——10.20-10.26 2025 Memecoin Sector: Viral Momentum Keeps the Party Going As the emotional amplifier of the crypto market, memecoins once again showcased their explosive power. ● DARK (Dark Eclipse) : It led the week with an approximate 222% rally, becoming the undisputed champion. As a Solana-based hybrid of AI and memecoin narratives, DARK’s surge was likely fueled by a mix of community hype, liquidity expansion, and speculative focus. ● GIGGLE (Giggle Fund) : Up 56%. This BSC-based memecoin gained moderate traction compared to DARK. Its growth was mainly driven by social media engagement, KOL exposure, and event-driven marketing such as airdrops. Cautionary Note: While memecoins can yield eye-popping returns, they remain highly volatile with limited fundamental support. DeFi Sector: Efficiency Boost Through Leverage and Synthetic Assets ● F (SynFutures) : Up 106%. F is the governance token of SynFutures, supporting a single-token liquidity model that enables users to freely list and trade any asset in seconds. SynFutures recently introduced the industry’s first Perp Launchpad, allowing instant listings of assets ranging from blue-chip tokens to LSTs and memecoins. ● AVNT (Avantis) : Up 51% to $0.74. Positioned as the largest RWA perpetuals DEX on Base, Avantis allows users to trade not only crypto, but real-world assets (RWAs) like FX, commodities, indices, and soon, equities. The token’s listing on Binance.US last week drove a new wave of interest, and HTX’s margin trading for AVNT has made it a preferred choice for professional traders. GameFi and Privacy: Old Themes, New Momentum ● MAVIA (Heroes of Mavia) : 167% weekly growth, ranking second among all gainers. As the governance token of the Heroes of Mavia strategy game, MAVIA enables players to earn RUBY rewards through real-time base-building battles. The price jumping from $0.09 to $0.24 was fueled by its integration with BNB Chain bridges and the launch of the game’s new season, which attracted millions of active players. ● ZEC (Zcash) : Rose 46%, a privacy token representative. Powered by zk-SNARKs, Zcash provides state-of-the-art privacy protection. Renewed attention followed Arthur Hayes’ bold “$10,000 ZEC” prediction, triggering a 20% 24-hour surge and reviving discussions on privacy as crypto’s foundational ethos. From Base’s AI agent revolution to memecoin euphoria, GameFi’s play-to-earn revival, DeFi’s efficiency breakthroughs, and Privacy’s comeback, the week of Oct 20-26 showcased a broad market rotation toward smaller projects, high-narrative assets with tangible progress potential.
