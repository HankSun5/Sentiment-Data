This deepening scarcity, one of the most pronounced readings in months, comes as data suggests large-scale investors are accumulating the asset, setting the stage for a potential supply squeeze. Conflicting Signals from Large Holders Data from October shared by Arab Chain shows that Binance’s Bitcoin Scarcity Index moved upward through the month, jumping sharply in late October to exceed a reading of 9. This index is a direct measure of the reduction in Bitcoin supply available for immediate trading on the exchange. In simple terms, a rising index means the amount of Bitcoin sitting on Binance that is available for purchase is gradually falling. The analytics platform clarified that this typically points to an accumulation phase, where large investors and whales are buying and withdrawing BTC from Binance, effectively taking them off the market. “This is generally considered a positive long-term signal that supports the likelihood of continued upside in the medium term, despite short-term price fluctuations, as buyers appear to be racing to acquire Bitcoin in the market,” noted Arab Chain. The assessment also pointed out that such supply drops are often linked to positive news or sudden capital inflows. However, it also presented a critical caveat: scarcity alone cannot push prices higher. For a major price increase to occur, this limited supply must be met with genuine new demand from an increasing number of buyers. Still, this positive accumulation signal is not the only story. Another metric tells a different tale. The 7-day average of Binance’s Exchange Whale Ratio has also climbed steeply, rising from around 0.33 on October 12 to approximately 0.41 between October 22 and 25. This ratio measures large deposits to the exchange, and such a sustained increase has historically indicated that major holders are preparing to sell, creating a wall of supply that can slow or reverse a price rally. It creates a complex picture where one set of data suggests holding, while another points toward potential selling. Broader Market Trends The movement of coins off exchanges is not solely about whales holding in private wallets. A growing trend shows that some large BTC holders are shifting their assets into spot Bitcoin ETFs like those from BlackRock. These “in-kind” transfers allow whales to swap their Bitcoin for ETF shares without creating a taxable event, a process that could act as another drain on the liquid supply available on crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, in the market, BTC was priced at $110,232 at the time of writing, dipping from the $111,400 level it was trading at yesterday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve announced its second consecutive interest rate cut. While it’s up 1.2% over seven days, the 30-day view shows a 3.4% decline, and it remains more than 12% below the new all-time high past $126,000 it attained in early October.

The company posted $180.2 million in revenue, up from $84.8 million in the same quarter last year. Riot also reported net income of $104.5 million, equal to $0.26 per diluted share, compared to a $154.4 million loss or $(0.54) per diluted share in Q3 2024. The shift was driven mainly by stronger Bitcoin mining revenue and the current value of Bitcoin it holds. Riot said it produced 1,406 bitcoin in the quarter, up from 1,104 mined in the same period last year. The company held 19,287 bitcoin as of September 30, 2025. About 3,300 bitcoin from that total are being used as collateral. Based on a Bitcoin market price of $114,068 on that date, Riot’s holdings were valued at around $2.2 billion. The company also ended the quarter with $170.0 million in working capital, $330.7 million in unrestricted cash, and $75.6 million in restricted cash. Riot expands data center development Riot said the growth this quarter came alongside major steps in its data center development plan. CEO Jason Les said the company is moving ahead with the core and shell construction of the first two buildings at its Corsicana data center campus, which together will support 112 megawatts of critical IT load when operational. Les stated, “Riot made decisive progress in the development of our data center business this quarter. This progress has culminated in announcing today the initiation of the core and shell development of the first two buildings at our Corsicana data center campus, representing 112 MW of total critical IT capacity.” He said the company reached four key achievements this quarter connected to the Corsicana expansion: Acquired a new 67‑acre land parcel adjacent to the original site. Completed the full campus design for Corsicana. Completed the Basis of Design that will be used as Riot’s standard data center build template. Continued expanding and staffing its in‑house data center team to support construction and scaling. Les said these moves support the company’s plan to transform Riot into a large‑scale data center operator linked directly to its land and power access strategy. Mining revenue increases while cost pressures continue The company reported $160.8 million in Bitcoin mining revenue, up from $67.5 million in the same quarter in 2024. The increase came from higher average Bitcoin prices and increases in Riot’s operational hash rate. The company noted, however, that the average global network hash rate also increased during the same period, which limited some of the revenue upside. The average cost to mine one bitcoin, excluding depreciation, was $46,324 this quarter, compared to $35,376 last year. Riot linked this rise mainly to a 52% increase in the global network hash rate from last year. This was partly offset by a 147% increase in power credits the company received in Q3 2025 compared to Q3 2024. Riot reported $19.1 million in engineering revenue for the quarter, up from $12.6 million in Q3 2024. Since purchasing ESS Metron in December 2021, the company said it has achieved $23.0 million in capex savings tied directly to that acquisition. Riot also reported Non‑GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $197.2 million, which includes a $133.1 million gain on Bitcoin held on its balance sheet.

This remarkable forecast, highlighted by Cointelegraph and a report from venture capital firm 1KX, signals a pivotal moment for the blockchain ecosystem. The firm noted that revenue generated from user-paid fees already hit a record $9.7 billion in the first half of 2025 alone, demonstrating significant momentum. Why is On-Chain Revenue a Game Changer? What exactly makes on-chain revenue such a critical metric? According to 1KX, the fees users pay on blockchain networks are a direct reflection of real-world adoption and utility. These aren’t just speculative transactions; they represent genuine value that individuals and businesses are willing to pay for repeatedly. Think of it as the ‘usage fee’ for digital services, much like a subscription or a transaction charge in traditional finance. This willingness to pay is a powerful signal of a protocol’s fundamental strength. It moves beyond mere hype, focusing instead on tangible economic activity. As such, these fees provide a clear window into the actual demand for decentralized applications and services. Indicator of Real Utility: Fees show users find genuine value in a protocol’s offerings. Tangible Economic Activity: Demonstrates actual usage, not just speculative trading. Repeated Engagement: Users pay because they derive ongoing benefit from the service. The Maturation of Protocols: A New Era for On-Chain Revenue As blockchain protocols continue to evolve and mature, the landscape for on-chain revenue generation is transforming. Early experimental networks are giving way to more robust, scalable, and user-friendly platforms. This evolution, coupled with a clearer regulatory environment, is making it easier for projects to build sustainable business models. Moreover, the report emphasizes that the ability to generate consistent revenue is quickly becoming the ultimate benchmark for distinguishing fleeting trends from long-term, viable blockchain solutions. It’s a shift towards a more sustainable and economically sound ecosystem where true value creation takes precedence. What are the Benefits and Challenges of Growing On-Chain Revenue? The rise in on-chain revenue brings a host of benefits, fostering a healthier and more innovative ecosystem. Protocols with strong revenue streams can reinvest in development, enhance security, and expand their features, ultimately benefiting users. It also instills greater confidence in investors, who look for projects with clear paths to profitability and sustainability. However, this growth also presents its own set of challenges that need careful navigation. Scalability issues can lead to higher fees, potentially deterring users. Furthermore, maintaining a seamless user experience and navigating intense competition from new protocols are constant hurdles. Regulatory uncertainty, while improving, still poses risks that projects must address proactively. Key Benefits: Sustainability: Protocols can fund ongoing development and operations independently.

As long as XRP fails to regain the $3.00 resistance point, its price action is indicative of short-term uncertainty but patiently optimistic in the long run. Still, further consolidation or breakdown below support would kill momentum and prompt investors to look at other options. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes into the limelight. This rapidly emerging DeFi platform is now becoming the top crypto to buy among early adopters. With its Phase 6 presale already more than 80% sold out and over $18.2 million raised, MUTM’s explosive growth is attracting the type of early momentum witnessed by leaders of previous cycles. As XRP struggles with regaining its bullish momentum, most analysts think that Mutuum Finance might just be the one leading the next altcoin season, possibly becoming the next crypto to hit $1 for early investors. XRP Bulls Show Signs of Life, Targets Are $3.4 and Higher XRP is again getting hot as the bullish momentum takes shape in the market. Following the 2.55 resistance breakdown and key $2.55, the token has experienced an 11% four-day rally fueled by rekindled whale activity and rising Open Interest from $550 million to $590 million in the last 24 hours. Traders are now looking toward $3.1–$3.4, although the $2.64 and $2.77 resistances are still key levels to break through before a complete bullish breakout can be declared. If momentum is carried through and demand continues to build, XRP may be poised to initiate a strong push towards the $4.5 level in the near future. With faith regained in blue-chip altcoins such as XRP, market participants are equally paying close attention to nascent DeFi entrants such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fresh entry that is fast gaining popularity as the overall market prepares for the next major rally, potentially becoming the next crypto to hit $1. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the most demanded cryptocurrencies in 2025, with investors worldwide keenly observing. The project’s presale still rages on with more than 17,600 participants and more than $18.2 million raised to date. Now in Phase 6, the MUTM token trades at $0.035, its most undervalued point of entry prior to the next planned hop to $0.04 during Phase 7. With 80% of tokens in this phase sold out, the speed indicates increasing investor confidence in the long-term DeFi potential of Mutuum Finance. This quick growth solidly positions MUTM as the top crypto to buy today, with short-term potential and long-term worth for early investors to gain from before what some think is potentially the next crypto to hit $1. Earn Passive Income with Mutuum Finance Beyond its token appreciation potential, Mutuum Finance also provides investors with the ability to derive passive income consistently through its liquidity pools, where users can earn annual percentage yields (APY) based on demand in the market. As an example, an investor who invests 50,000 USDT can potentially earn 5,000 USDT annually with a 10% APY through the leverage of automated yield generation and compounded over time. In addition to enhancing user confidence, the Mutuum Finance development team has introduced an official bug bounty program in collaboration with CertiK, with a reward pool of $50,000 USDT distributed across four levels of severity: critical, major, minor, and low. The program induces thorough vulnerability scanning and reaffirms the team’s dedication to transparency and reliability following a successful CertiK audit. During this time, the project’s V1 protocol is set to launch in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia testnet , which brings important DeFi features like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. Lending and borrowing support will initially offer ETH and USDT, with P2P lending markets to allow negotiability of terms for best yield. Whereas XRP is rallying against resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up pace with $18.2M raised and Phase 6 80% sold. Due to its dual-lending DeFi model, passive income prospects, and future V1 protocol, MUTM is a strong recommendation for short-term appreciation as well as long-term appreciation, and possibly leading the next altcoin rally, making it the top crypto to buy for early adopters and a clear contender for the next crypto to hit $1.

53839014,617278,1761861627,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,State Of The XRP Ledger Report Gives Deep Insight Into How Institutions Are Moving In,https://bitcoinist.com/the-state-of-the-xrp-ledger/,"This week, crypto market intelligence platform Messari released its Q3 State of XRP Ledger (XRPL) report, revealing a maturing network that continues to draw institutional attention. The data points to stronger engagement, increased transaction volumes , and a growing number of new addresses, signaling that the Ledger is evolving from a retail-heavy blockchain into one increasingly driven by enterprise-adoption and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization . Institutional Activity Reflected In XRP Ledger Network Growth Messari’s report highlights clear signs of institutional movement within the XRPL network during Q3 2025. Average daily transactions rose 8.9% Quarter-Over-Quarter (QoQ), from $1.6 million to $1.8 million. Likewise, the average daily active sender addresses increased by 15.4% from 21,900 to 23,300, while total new addresses rose by 46.3% to 447,200. Overall, the Ledger closed the quarter with 6.9 million total addresses, up 6.1% from the previous quarter, according to Messari’s metric chart. Notably, for the fifth consecutive quarter, Messari notes that the number of active receiver addresses on the Ledger continued to surpass the number of active sender addresses. In Q3 2025, average daily receivers declined 30.01% QoQ, falling from 72,000 to 50,300, while average daily senders rose 15.4% from 21,900 to 25,300. Despite the drop in receiver activity, data shows that total network throughput strengthened, with average daily transactions climbing 8.9% QoQ to $1.8 million. This reflects a more concentrated and higher-value transaction flow, typically linked to custodians and CEXs , which use destination tags to manage deposits for institutions and large groups of users. Messari also reported that “Payment” transactions on XRPL remained dominant, representing 55.7% of total network activity, while “ OfferCreate ” transactions, which submit orders to exchanges, increased to 33.2%. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter that Payments have led transaction types. Data shows that payment volume rose 1% QoQ to 986,600 after a previous decline, while OfferCreate activity showed growing liquidity operations among institutional market makers. OracleSet, used to create or update on-chain price oracles, also rose to 0.7% of all transactions, underscoring the Ledger’s growing integration with asset pricing and financial data feeds since their activation in late 2024. Infrastructure Upgrades And ETFs Signal XRPL Institutional Adoption The second half of Messari’s report highlights structural developments in the XRPL ecosystem aimed at facilitating institutional adoption. Data reveals that the Ledger introduces Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) that embed metadata for RWA parameters. It also implemented confidential MPTs secured by Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and advanced credential systems supporting KYC and AML compliance . Together, these upgrades address the network’s identity, financial, compliance, and privacy requirements, laying the foundation for widespread institutional adoption. Messari further reported that Institutional sentiment is further supported by the pending approval of seven US Spot XRP ETF applications . Notably, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to issue its decision between October 18 and November 14. Polymarket currently assigns a 99% probability that a US XRP ETF will be approved in 2025.",XRP|AML|CEXs|KYC|messari|MPTs|Multi-Purpose Tokens|OracleSet|Polymarket|Real-World Asset|ripple|RWA|Securities and Exchange Commission|Spot XRP ETF|US SEC|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT|Zero Knowledge Proofs|ZKPs,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-30 22:00:27

By enabling faster, cheaper transactions while maintaining full ETH security and composability, Linea is building the infrastructure for real economic activity. Why Ethereum Needs An Economic Backbone Linea is rapidly evolving into the Ethereum economic backbone. Crypto analyst Henry has revealed on X that Linea was built from first principles as a reinforcement layer for ETH’s future. The reason why Linea is catching serious attention is that over $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and $130 million in stablecoins represent real liquidity inflow into the network, not inflated metrics. Related Reading: Ethereum Treasury Giant SharpLink Resumes ETH Purchases As Holdings Top $3.5 Billion Furthermore, Linea’s buyback and burn mechanism ties are built directly into protocol revenue. MetaMask’s deep integration and the seamless user experience (UX) are instant reach, and the developer-first architecture actually scales without breaking ETH’s security. The rumors of a MASK airdrop and upcoming institutional deployments only add fuel to the narrative. While others are chasing hype, LineaBuild is constructing the infrastructure that powers real revenue. Henry concluded that every stat is screaming one thing, and adoption is real. “Nothing can defeat this, and Linea is ETH’s execution layer for the next cycle,” the expert added. Crypto analyst BullifyX has also made a bold declaration that the next evolution of Web3 is unfolding right on LineaBuild. Linea isn’t just another Layer 2 blockchain, but it’s a new foundation for scalability, speed, and developer freedom. With zkEVM precision, ultra-low gas, and ETH-grade security, Linea bridges the gap between innovation and accessibility. Furthermore, LineaBuild is a frictionless playground for builders, while for users, it delivers pure performance. BullifyX emphasizes that Linea’s role is to transform complex blockchain experiences into smooth, scalable realities, powering applications, digital economies, and the immersive metaverses. “The future doesn’t wait. It scales on LineaBuild.” BullifyX noted. The First Public Company Just Proved Ethereum’s Real-World Use Case In a monumental shift, the institutional adoption of Ethereum had just leveled up. According to Stacy Muur, the founder of GREENDOTS, the catalyst for this advancement is the deployment of an impressive $200 million in ETH on LineaBuild by SharpLink, a publicly traded company, powered by EigenLayer’s EigenCloud, ether_fi restaking, and Anchorage for secure, regulated custody. Related Reading: Ethereum Emerges As The Sole Trillion-Dollar Institutional Store Of Value — Here’s Why Muur explained that this is the first fully verifiable, ETH-aligned institutional treasury activation.

53839252,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=849515,1761861816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53839252.jpeg,Volkswagen posted a €1.3 billion ($1.52 billion) operating loss in Q3 due to Porsche’s EV strategy reversal and U.S. tariffs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/volkswagen-earnings-miss-estimates/,"Volkswagen just reported a €1.3 billion operating loss (that’s $1.52 billion gone) in the third quarter of 2025. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the real cost of two punches: Porsche’s failed EV gamble and Donald Trump’s tariffs still hammering the company like it’s 2019 all over again. According to Volkswagen’s earnings report, €4.7 billion in charges have already been booked this year because Porsche flipped its electric strategy upside down. Instead of pushing EVs, Porsche is going back to combustion engines and hybrids. That decision blew a crater into the group’s financials. On top of that, the company says it could take another €5 billion hit from U.S. import tariffs by the end of the year. CFO Arno Antlitz didn’t sugarcoat it. “Those effects will continue to persist – and that is why we must rigorously implement the performance programs in place, push forward efficiency measures, and develop new approaches,” Arno said. Arno called the company’s current state a “mixed picture,” mentioning that EV sales in Europe are still going strong and that some internal restructuring has helped. But the reality is that the move to electric is squeezing margins dry. Volkswagen’s loss was ugly, but still better than expected. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had forecast a deeper €1.7 billion loss, so technically the company did “better than feared.” Investors didn’t seem too shaken, though, as Volkswagen’s stock actually went up by 1.2% in early Frankfurt trading. Porsche pulls back on EVs, burns €4.7 billion Porsche, which is 75.4% owned by Volkswagen , dragged the whole group down this quarter. Its sudden decision to delay electric car production and switch focus to hybrids and combustion models was expensive… €4.7 billion expensive. The idea is to win back buyers who aren’t quite ready to go full electric yet. But that decision came with a price. The man overseeing both brands, Oliver Blume, is stepping back from Porsche to focus on Volkswagen alone. Oliver, who holds CEO titles at both companies, will hand off Porsche leadership at the end of the year. This comes after growing pressure from investors who questioned whether one man could steer two ships during a storm like this. Volkswagen didn’t ditch its full-year forecast, but there’s a catch. The company said its guidance is based on chip availability; a risky assumption. The trade spat around Dutch chipmaker Nexperia could easily spill into production delays if it escalates. Volkswagen already lowered its expectations earlier this month, now targeting just 2% to 3% return on sales, and breaking even on net automotive cash flow. Trump’s tariffs cost billions, hit U.S. deliveries Let’s not pretend this is all on Porsche. Trump’s tariffs are still hitting hard. Last year, Volkswagen earned €21.7 billion (about $25.10 billion) in operating income. This year, that figure could be down $5.8 billion, or about 23% wiped out, because of tariffs alone. In Q2, tariff costs hit $1.52 billion, and even though the EU–U.S. trade deal lowered tariffs to 15% in August, Mexican-built vehicles like the Tiguan still face a massive 27.5% import tax. And yeah, Volkswagen builds a lot of cars in Mexico. Volkswagen said U.S. deliveries dropped 8% in the first nine months of the year. Overall global deliveries were up 1%, but that U.S. number stings. The company still makes about 200,000 vehicles in the U.S., but it also imports 240,000 from Germany and 287,000 from Mexico. That math right there? That’s a logistics nightmare. Especially when your best-seller, the Tiguan, is built in Puebla, Mexico, and slammed with high tariffs every time it crosses the border.

Investors reacted fast, and the stock sold off as soon as the plan was laid out. The move signaled higher costs ahead, and the market did not wait to see how it plays out. Mark Zuckerberg said the company is building more computing power to meet rising demand for AI tools across Meta’s core business. He said the company has seen this pattern before. In his words, “we build some amount of infrastructure to what we think is an aggressive assumption, and then we keep on having more demand to be able to use more compute, especially in the core business.” Mark admitted that the plan could go too far. He said, “I mean, it’s, of course, possible to overshoot that right?” If Meta ends up with extra unused compute, he said the company will “absorb” it and use it in the future. According to Mark, internal teams and outside partners already request access to Meta’s infrastructure for APIs and compute, so even excess capacity might be used over time. Wall Street cuts targets That explanation was not enough to settle the market. The idea of building now and hoping the need catches up later sounded like costs first, benefits later, and the Street is allergic to that. Analysts started moving price targets down almost instantly. BofA Global Research’s Justin Post cut Meta’s price target from $900 to $810, though he kept a Buy rating. KeyBanc’s Justin Patterson lowered his target from $905 to $875, holding Overweight. TD Cowen’s John Blackledge brought his target down from $875 to $810, also keeping Buy. Morgan Stanley’s Brian Nowak, Goldman Sachs’ Eric Sheridan, Citi’s Ron Josey, and Cantor Fitzgerald’s Deepak Mathivanan all lowered targets too, while maintaining either Buy or Overweight positions. Translation: they still think Meta has value long term, but the near-term financial pressure is real. Not every analyst turned, though. HSBC’s Nicolas Cote-Colisson held his target at $905, and Wedbush’s Scott Devitt also left his target unchanged. Rising AI costs and Reality Labs losses weigh on the stock The company did share a bright figure: Meta’s AI-powered advertising tools now have an annual run rate of $60 billion. So the AI investments are doing something. But that number did not override concerns about spending going up too fast. The Reality Labs segment added more pressure. Meta reported another $4 billion loss from Reality Labs. That division continues to operate at a loss, and there are no signs of it slowing down. Forrester’s vice president and research director, Mike Proulx said, “Unfortunately, Meta’s strong revenue and user growth in Q3 is tainted by significantly increased costs across the board.” He added, “True to form, Meta’s Reality Labs continued its streak of losses with no signs of slowing down.” Meta’s stock is now trailing the S&P 500. Meta shares are up 15% year to date and 14% in the past 12 months. The S&P 500 is up 16% year to date and 18% over the past 12 months. Meta is still growing, but the pace is now behind the broader market.

Crypto’s traditional “Uptober” rally faded quickly after President Donald Trump introduced sweeping 100% tariffs on goods imported from China barely a week in. Yet optimism has returned following the recent U.S. launch of Solana, Litecoin, and Hedera ETFs, along with growing speculation that the Fed’s announcement of another 25 basis point interest rate cut yesterday. These developments indicate strong altcoin performance will characterise the next bull run . Qwen3-MAX forecasts SOL, XRP and Cardano will lead. Solana (SOL): Qwen3-MAX Predicts a Major Rally Following ETFs Solana ($SOL) remains one of the most rapidly advancing smart contract blockchains, currently valued at over $105 billion with around $12 billion in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi on chain. Source: Qwen3-MAX The green light for Bitwise and Grayscale’s spot Solana ETFs in the U.S. has ignited renewed excitement. Institutional inflows could mirror the significant surges seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs debuted. Renowned for ultra-fast throughput, negligible fees, and widespread adoption in tokenization and stablecoin applications, Solana is increasingly viewed as a top-tier network for enterprises. After reaching a high of $250 in January and a low of roughly $100 in April, SOL now trades near $186, down 34.5% from its all-time high (ATH) of $293 set mid January. Having recently broken out of a bullish flag pattern, Qwen3-MAX anticipates Solana could climb as high as $800 to $1,200 by Christmas, a bold yet plausible target that will need help from crypto-friendly US legislation. XRP ($XRP): Up to 400% Gains by Christmas, Says Qwen3-MAX Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) stands out in Qwen3-MAX’s models as another breakout contender, with projections pointing to a potential rise toward $8—$12 by year-end, potentially growing 372% above its current value of $2.65. Following its decisive courtroom victory over the SEC earlier this year, confidence in Ripple soared, driving XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, XRP has climbed 388%, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum by a country mile. Ripple’s introduction of its RLUSD stablecoin, coupled with CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s contacts with President Trump, has branded the company as one aligned with regulatory compliance, greatly enhancing diverse investor appeal. XRP’s technical indicators show multiple bullish flag setups throughout 2025, pointing to the possibility of a major end of year breakout. Should further catalysts like ETF approvals, strategic partnerships, or clear U.S. crypto regulations materialize, Qwen3-MAX projects that XRP could potentially reach the $12 mark. Cardano ($ADA): Over 700% Upside Predicted for Q4 In decentralized finance, Cardano ($ADA) continues to strengthen its reputation as a rival to Ethereum, supported by a robust developer ecosystem building innovative dApps. Founded by Ethereum co-creator Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s hallmark is its peer-reviewed and academically rigorous design, emphasizing scalability, sustainability, and mathematical verification. With a current market capitalization around $23 billion, Cardano remains among the top DeFi networks, but would need substantial growth to rival Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Qwen3-MAX forecasts ADA could reach as high as $5 in November, a 709% increase from its current price of about $0.6181. If risk-on sentiment builds through November, Qwen3-MAX AI projects ADA could climb to $3 by late 2025, potentially surpassing its 2021 all-time high of $3.09 should a broader bull run appear. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin With 100x Potential Finally, one project too new for Qwen3-MAX is setting the presales market on fire. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has become one of the most talked-about meme coin presales of the season, raising over $3.8 million from investors seeking the next major Dogecoin-style rally. Positioned as Dogecoin’s louder, more irreverent counterpart, Maxi Doge embodies crypto’s degen spirit through meme contests, community-driven initiatives, and a vibrant social media presence. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI benefits from faster and cheaper transactions compared to Dogecoin’s original blockchain. Out of a total supply of 150.24 billion tokens, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund,” which supports marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. Staking is already live, offering up to 80% APY in rewards, though yields will taper as more users join. The current presale price stands at $0.0002655, with scheduled price increases for each phase. Investors can buy MAXI using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

Within days, prices slid sharply after President Trump unveiled a sweeping 100% tariff on Chinese imports, a saga that is still ongoing. Despite yesterday’s Federal Reserve FOMC meeting, where investors got their hoped-for rate cuts, crypto’s collective market cap dropped 1.8% in the last 24 hours to $3.82 trillion. While the prolonged downturn is causing concern, many crypto old hands view it as a correction, clearing out excessive leverage and weak hands before the next major rally. This is an idea that has plenty of precedent in crypto’s short history of bull runs preceded by crashes. That said, top quality altcoins like XRP, ZEC, and HYPE stand to gain the most. Ripple (XRP): Set to Revolutionize Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s digital asset, XRP ($XRP) , powers a high-speed, low-fee payment protocol designed to outperform legacy networks such as SWIFT. Backed by partnerships with institutions like the UN Capital Development Fund and several leading U.S. banks, XRP has become the world’s fourth-largest crypto asset with a market cap exceeding $154 billion. Ripple’s release of the RLUSD stablecoin marks an early move into one of the fastest-growing and most vital upcoming sectors in digital payments. Over the past twelve months, XRP has surged 388%, reaching $3.65 in mid-July, its highest price since 2018, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 53% gain over the same period. Currently, XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) hovers near 48. Its price has re-aligned with its 30-day moving average, signaling the end of a brief period of relative weakness. Technical indicators reveal two as yet unfulfilled bullish flag patterns from the summer months, hinting at potential upside if US authorities deliver spot ETF approvals or comprehensive regulation. In that scenario, XRP could climb into the $5–$10 range. Zcash (ZEC): Privacy Token Surges 147% in One Week Debuting in 2016 as a fork of Bitcoin, Zcash ($ZEC) was purpose-built to deliver complete transactional privacy. Its zk-SNARK cryptography (“zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge”) allows transaction verification without disclosing sender, receiver, or transfer details. Zcash offers both shielded and transparent addresses, balancing user confidentiality with regulatory requirements. Over the past week, ZEC rose a staggering 52% to $359, outperforming every coin in the top 100 by market cap. While Zcash’s rallies in early October aligned with broader rallies across other privacy coins like Monero ($XMR), this week’s rally does not fit the trend. ZEC’s RSI currently stands around 73 and is trending slightly downward as traders lock in profits. This means we can expect depreciation in the short term, ZEC could approach the $500 level by year-end. Hyperliquid: The DEX Minting a New Wave of Crypto Millionaires Launched in late 2024, Hyperliquid ($HYPE) has rapidly become a leading force in the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Running on its own custom Layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid focuses on speed, transparency, and asset security. Unlike centralized exchanges, it enables users to retain full control of their holdings, an increasingly valuable feature following collapses like FTX. Featuring ultra-low fees, lightning-fast execution, and tools such as perpetual futures, Hyperliquid bridges the gap between centralized convenience and decentralized trust. Price charts show steady bullish momentum since launch. Two flag patterns emerged between winter and spring, formations often preceding sharp rallies. Between early April and May 26, HYPE’s value quadrupled from roughly $10 to $40. Since then, HYPE’s support and resistance lines entered a broadening channel that collapsed with the early October crypto crash, but the fact that HYPE bounced 25% in the last 7 days highlights surging demand. At its current price around $48, it’s 19% down from its September 18 ATH of $59.30. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): A Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 That Could Define Bitcoin’s 2026 One of 2025’s most buzzed-about projects, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) merges Bitcoin’s security with advanced Layer-2 scalability and the viral appeal of meme tokens. The network aims to turbocharge Bitcoin’s ecosystem through near-instant transactions, DAO-driven governance, and smart contract capabilities built on its proprietary Layer-2 framework. The presale has already exceeded $25.25 million, with some forecasts suggesting possible 100x gains after launch. By leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER supports high-speed operations and seamless BTC bridging via its Canonical Bridge, ensuring compatibility with decentralized apps (dApps). A recent Coinsult audit confirmed the project’s clean bill of health, reporting no security flaws and strengthening investor confidence. HYPER tokens fuel governance, staking, and transaction operations, with early adopters earning up to 46% APY in staking rewards.

Eddie Yue, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), HKMA, shared these plans in his latest article, which also outlined the achievements they have made so far in their “Fintech 2025” strategy. Yue also discussed the future direction of the initiative, which aims to cement Hong Kong’s position as a global fintech leader. Enabling the digital economy with strong infrastructures Yue stated that “Financial infrastructure is like a highway, enabling capital and financial assets to travel safely and efficiently through our economy.” The CEO pointed out the need to build this financial infrastructure, stating, “For Hong Kong’s digital economy to thrive, not only do we need the above-mentioned ‘soft infrastructure,’ robust financial ‘hard infrastructure’ is equally crucial.” There’s no shortage of infrastructure currently, as Hong Kong runs the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, which operates across four currencies. Also, its Faster Payment System (FPS), which was launched in 2018, has become a fixture of daily transactions. FPS is not limited to Hong Kong, as it has been connected with systems in Thailand and mainland China, creating a cross-border payment network that allows instant transfers between economies. While the leadership acknowledges the need to build a strong infrastructure, it is not an indictment of the current ones in Hong Kong but a call to action to build for the present and future, where digital finance is a main feature. The city has been working on building on the already established infrastructure, and one of these developments is the digital Hong Kong dollar, or e-HKD, which the HKMA has been exploring since 2017. The authority recently completed an e-HKD pilot program, and it is now exploring introducing it in “retail scenarios for the general public.” The e-HKD, issued directly by the HKMA , carries no credit risk and is initially being tested for wholesale payments, particularly in international trade settlements. One example of the e-HKD’s success was Project mBridge, a cross-border initiative linking the e-HKD with the CBDCs of mainland China, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Project mBridge reportedly hit the minimum viable product stage (MVP) in 2024, and it has already reduced the time required for cross-border transactions from days to seconds. The HKMA launched Project Ensemble to promote a tokenization ecosystem that supports the conversion of real-world assets, such as money or securities, into digital tokens in 2024. The project has done over 20 sandbox experiments with local financial institutions and collaborated with international financial organizations such as the central banks of Brazil, France, and Thailand, among others. Yue’s analogy about digital islands and bridges The Commercial Data Interchange (CDI) is the poster child of what Yue describes as the “digital bridges” initiative, covering payments, e-commerce, and import/export records. Launched in 2022 to link banks with data providers, the CDI already covers 26 banks and 17 data providers. It has also expanded to include government data sources. As of September 2025, it had facilitated more than 71,000 loan applications and reviews, as well as HK$58.1 billion in approved credit. The city’s Open Application Programming Interface (API) framework and Interbank Account Data Sharing (IADS) service are more examples of Hong Kong’s progress in data connectivity.

According to his charts, XRP/USD on the two-day timeframe is trading in what he characterizes as a reaccumulation range rather than a topping pattern. Will XRP Follow Gold’s Pattern? The structure is labeled in classic Elliott Wave A-B-C form, with the C leg ending in what he calls a “Spring.” The October 10 crash marks the Wyckoff terms the final violent liquidation wick that clears late longs and forces capitulation before the next markup phase. The XRP chart shows price capped by a horizontal resistance band near the local top marked “B,” with that B high sitting above $3.40 and extending toward roughly $3.66 at the peak. After that move, XRP retraced into a sideway band where Osemka labels internal subdivisions “a,” “b,” and “c,” implying a corrective internal chop inside the broader range. The lower boundary of the range is drawn in the $1.62 area. This lower boundary is simultaneously labeled “A” and described as the base of Reaccumulation, implying that buyers repeatedly defended that zone. The subsequent rally back toward the upper boundary defined the “B” top. What followed was a final flush into “C,” which he explicitly tags “Spring,” with the wick piercing below prior support and then snapping back above $2.20–$2.30 and into the ~$2.58 region shown on the chart. Related Reading: Why This Analyst Is More Bullish On XRP Over Ethereum For The Short-Term The message is that the C wave was fast, deep, and terminal. He calls it “a sharp ending in the C wave,” adding that this is “very common.” In classical Elliott interpretation, an A-B-C corrective move that ends with an aggressive C spike often resolves with trend continuation in the direction of the original impulse. In his wording, the surge established the impulse, and everything since has been digestion, not distribution. He argues that “it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge.” Notably, Osemka places XRP’s pattern next to gold’s weekly chart during its own multi-quarter sideways phase. Gold’s structure is annotated almost identically: an “A” low anchored around roughly $1,680–$1,700 per ounce, a mid-range chop labeled “a / b / c,” a “B” high pressing into the $2,050–$2,100 ceiling, and finally a “C” leg that undercut that same $1,700 floor before reversing.

Signal Flashes Familiar Warning When gold finally pushed through the long-capped $2,100 area in July 2024 and broke into sustained new all-time highs near $2,480, that break acted like a trigger: safe-haven demand, Fed rate-cut expectations and central bank buying drove an almost uninterrupted vertical phase in the metal, and over the following months gold kept taking out round numbers — $2,500, $3,000, $4,000 and beyond — ultimately stretching more than 80% higher from that $2,100 breakout zone to reach about $4,381 per ounce at the peak. By placing XRP and gold side by side, using the same lettering, same boundary logic, and the same “Spring” terminology, Osemka is presenting XRP as sitting at the equivalent moment gold occupied just before its parabolic run. “This one is for the XRP community, where I see some gurus preaching for the end of the cycle. Bros, it is hard to see this range as anything less than a long reaccumulation after November’s surge. In Elliott wave terms: an ABC with a sharp ending in the C wave. Very common. Last shakeout or Spring. There is basically no difference to this reaccumulation example on Gold years ago. Thank me later,” the analyst concluded. At press time, XRP traded at $2.49.

The company’s developers have added new privacy tools that keep user and payment details hidden during transaction confirmation. The update represents a massive leap for XRP Ledger privacy, allowing users to send and confirm transactions without exposing personal information. Ripple Developers Add Zero-Knowledge Proofs To The XRP Ledger According to a new post on X by xrpl.to (@xrplto), Ripple developers have made a significant leap forward for the network’s privacy features, integrating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) into the XRP Ledger. The feature lets users verify transactions on the XRP ledger without revealing any details, such as who sends the funds, who receives them, or how much money moves between them. The research report attached to the post details how Ripple’s developers have built a system called ZKProver to manage the Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy layer on the XRP Ledger. ZKProver manages every step of the private transaction process , from building secure digital circuits to verifying deposits and withdrawals, all while keeping sensitive data hidden. The privacy engine also handles the cryptographic keys that protect each network operation and guarantees transaction integrity. The report also notes that the new privacy engine on the XRP ledger generates and verifies proofs to confirm transaction validity without introducing tampering risks. It converts data into secure formats and produces random values that make every transaction unique. This randomness adds another layer of protection, making it nearly impossible to link or trace activities on the XRP ledger. By automating these advanced cryptographic steps, the network can now support shielded transactions without sacrificing speed or efficiency. New Privacy Features And Transaction Types Introduced The integration of Zero-Knowledge Proofs strengthens the XRP Ledger’s privacy by adding shielded transactions that hide key details from public view, making XRP transfers harder to trace. The upgrade also introduces three new private transaction types for shielded transactions, each extending the transactor base class. ZkDeposit lets users deposit tokens into a private pool that hides the details from view, while ZkWithdraw allows users to withdraw tokens from that pool while keeping the transaction private . Last but not least, ZkPayment lets users send XRP privately between wallets without revealing amounts or addresses to the public. These transaction types draw inspiration from Zcash, a well-known cryptocurrency famous for its focus on confidential transactions. Ripple’s approach shows how the company is inspired by proven privacy concepts and adapting them to strengthen the XRP Ledger. The latest update further underscores the XRP Ledger’s growth into a more improved, private, and user-focused network. As privacy remains a key topic in crypto, the Zero Knowledge Proofs privacy upgrade helps the XRP Ledger stand out as a more secure , enterprise-grade blockchain network.",Ripple|XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Adoption|XRP Ledger news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-30 23:00:52

Once one of the top three digital assets by market capitalization, Cardano now ranks 10th as it continues to face bearish market conditions and selling pressure. Cardano’s Position in the Market During the 2021 bull run, Cardano’s price climbed to $3.10, briefly placing it ahead of XRP. However, the token has since experienced a steep decline as broader market trends turned negative. At the time of writing, ADA trades around $0.6052 , reflecting a 27% decline year-to-date, along with drops of 10.7% in six months, 15% in three months, and 22.61% in the past month. Cardano’s total market capitalization currently stands at $21.70 billion, a fraction of XRP’s estimated $147.63 billion. XRP, priced around $2.46 , remains the third-largest non-stablecoin cryptocurrency in the world. Unlike ADA, XRP has recorded notable growth this year, up 24.1% year-to-date and 16.6% over the past six months. Continued Selling and Market Pressure Despite brief recovery attempts, Cardano continues to face downward pressure from persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and investor sell-offs. Market analysts have linked part of this weakness to large-scale liquidations by whales. According to a recent post by Ali Martinez, major ADA holders offloaded 100 million ADA tokens within the past week, intensifying market volatility. Broader economic factors, including global inflationary pressures and reduced investor risk appetite, have also limited ADA’s momentum. While the Cardano network continues to develop its ecosystem, these market conditions have made it difficult for the token to sustain meaningful rallies. What It Would Take to Overtake XRP To reclaim a higher market ranking, Cardano’s valuation would need to exceed that of XRP . Based on the current figures, ADA’s market capitalization would have to rise from $21 billion to at least $147 billion to surpass XRP’s present value. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given Cardano’s circulating supply of about 35.86 billion ADA, this would require a price of approximately $4.32 per token, a 572% increase from its current level. Such a rise would also establish a new record high, surpassing the token’s 2021 peak of $3.10. However, this projection assumes XRP’s market cap remains steady. Any upward movement in XRP’s price or trading volume would further expand the gap between the two assets. In July 2024, for instance, XRP’s valuation briefly climbed above $210 billion, demonstrating how quickly market dynamics can shift among top digital assets. Analysts’ and Community Outlook Despite the challenges, optimism remains within the Cardano community. Several analysts have maintained that ADA could eventually return to the $4 price range under favorable market conditions. In December 2024, Ali Martinez reiterated his target zone between $4 and $6 for taking profits on ADA, citing the token’s historical performance patterns. Similarly, Crypto Smith identified a cup-and-handle formation on ADA’s chart in July 2024, suggesting that the asset could be preparing for an extended upward move. Meanwhile, community commentator Mintern also forecasted a $4 price target for this year, though some market data providers, such as Changelly, have issued a more conservative projection, estimating that ADA may not reach this level until 2029. Cardano’s road back to the upper tier of the crypto market would require a price surge of over 570%, bringing its value above $4.32 to overtake XRP. While technical indicators and community sentiment show some optimism, prevailing market challenges and XRP’s continued strength make this goal a demanding one in the near term.

On Thursday, the company posted third-quarter results that wiped the floor with every estimate. Revenue jumped 68% year-over-year to $585 million, while earnings per share landed at $0.80, blowing past the $0.51 target. Shares immediately shot up more than 8% in after-hours trading, and by Friday morning, the stock was up 10%. And folks, this is Reddit’s cleanest beat yet since going public. Net income came in at $163 million, up from $133 million during the same period last year, a 23% increase. The company also raised its Q4 outlook. It expects revenue between $655 million and $665 million, comfortably above the Street’s $638 million forecast. Adjusted earnings guidance for Q4 is now $275 million to $285 million, outpacing projections of $259 million. This wasn’t a “beat by a little” moment. Reddit slapped expectations off the table. Reddit boosts revenue from users and licensing, but U.S. growth weakens During Q3, average global revenue per user hit $5.04, higher than the $4.82 estimate. The U.S. market, Reddit’s biggest money-maker, brought in $480 million, topping StreetAccount’s $445 million guess. International sales also edged past expectations at $105 million, versus the $104 million analysts projected. Revenue from “Other” sources, which includes data licensing, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. That’s the category where Reddit counts big names like Google and OpenAI as customers. This segment is getting a lot more attention as tech firms chase Reddit’s real-time, human-made content to train AI systems. Global daily active users (uniques) reached 116 million, a 19% increase compared to last year.Analysts were only expecting 114 million.The logged-in DAUq globally rose 14% to 50.2 million, and logged-out DAUq surged 24% to 65.8 million. But it wasn’t all clean. In the U.S., logged-in DAUq only grew 7% to 23.1 million. That’s slower than Q2’s 12% growth, and it’s the fifth straight quarter U.S. user growth has cooled. CEO Steve Huffman spoke about traffic patterns during the earnings call. He said Reddit isn’t getting much boost from AI-powered chat tools like those popping up from Google or OpenAI. “I’m looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they’re not a major traffic driver today,” Steve said. Still, he believes “there’s plenty of opportunity” ahead. Company leans into marketing as it pushes for more sign-ups Steve also talked about getting more people to create accounts. He said Reddit is focused on improving the user experience and removing barriers that keep people from seeing relevant content. “The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,” Steve said. “It’s not rocket science.” COO Jen Wong said Reddit is now spending more on performance-marketing campaigns, especially in countries where it’s still new and less known. “We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,” she said. Jen added that there were gains in brand awareness and consideration, and said that’ll help build performance later. While Google and Meta also beat earnings expectations this week, Reddit’s report stood out for how far it beat both revenue and profit targets, and for how clearly it admitted U.S. user growth is starting to level off. But globally, Reddit is clearly still expanding its footprint, especially by squeezing more value out of its users and its massive data firehose.

The measure aims to free up liquidity and boost lending amid ongoing economic pressures. This development comes soon after President Javier Milei’s party achieved a critical midterm election victory. As stated before, reserve ratios remain the same and vary depending on the type of deposit or instrument. The primary difference between the current amendment and the previous one is that financial institutions, in addition to maintaining daily compliance stringency, are now permitted to moderate their daily liquidity buffer. Officials say the step is designed to help credit flow to households and businesses while maintaining overall financial stability. According to the press release, the Bank of Argentina describes the revision as the first major policy change since the midterm election, in which Milei’s party received a landslide victory in both chambers of parliament, and the market responded with optimism. The change in Argentina comes after months of high inflation and tight liquidity, which have constrained bank lending. Analysts note that while the easing is modest, it signals the central bank’s intent to support economic activity without triggering major inflationary pressures. Milei’s victory prompts central bank action The easing was warranted following the president’s victory, but also due to pressure from banking representatives. The latter’s leaders had been discussing the matter earlier, arguing that the requirement to set aside the reserves daily forces them to maintain inefficiently large balances . The sector’s leaders had called on the BCRA to adopt a monthly compliance model, but the bank opted for a gradual approach. The regulator, in this instance, assures that the easing is not a full rollback, freeing some liquidity back into the financial ecosystem, but one that will not induce inflation pressure or weaken the peso. The adjustability granted to the banks will facilitate more lending to the business and consumer sectors. The released funds will no longer be held in reserve but will be utilized through lines of credit and investments. Nevertheless, analysts are warning that this is a tepid reform rather than a root-and-branch renewal. Liquidity in Argentina’s financial system is scarce, with the BCRA much more concerned about introducing too many pesos. The eased costs come after a strong few weeks of market performance upon Milei’s presidential win. Investors were cautiously optimistic about the continuity of the short-term trend, a sentiment the BCRA is eager to challenge. Argentina moves to ease tight liquidity Argentina’s banking sector has struggled with liquidity restrictions for well over a year. The interest rate on peso-denominated assets had reached and even surpassed triple-digit figures, depleting profit margins and the demand for credit. Some banks had stopped issuing mortgages in the past few months, given the weakening economy and soaring delinquencies approaching post-crisis highs. The high reserve demands and the fear of issuing loans resulted in a credit freeze that strangled the cash flow of small firms. The Milei regime has expressed its unwavering commitment to maintaining the value of the peso and the trust of the people in the financial system. Therefore, there has been no doubt that the “reserve rules” would be lifted. Although they were tightened recently to ban speculative currency runs on the peso, they also limited most banks’ ability to borrow and lend, prompting demands for a return to greater socialization. Policy makers are likely to proceed conservatively, despite the expectations that further steps towards normality are to be taken. If the peso or inflation were to deteriorate unexpectedly, much as it has done before, global liquidity injections could trigger a panic or surge in currency depreciation that would erase recent value gains. In the short term, banks will utilize the new break to help with daily liquidity management and address immediate financing difficulties. In the medium term, if inflation and currency profits numbers continue, more relaxed reserve rules could be in place. For now, the change is minor in absolute terms, but it exemplifies the intent to continue an economic recovery among Argentina’s banking authorities.

This remarkable Bitcoin price surge has captivated investors and analysts alike, signaling a potentially robust period for the leading digital asset. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is now trading at an impressive $108,007 on platforms like the Binance USDT market, showcasing strong momentum. What’s Driving This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the forces behind such a rapid ascent is crucial for any market observer. The current Bitcoin price surge isn’t an isolated event; it’s often a confluence of various factors that collectively bolster investor confidence and market demand. While specific triggers can be complex, several key elements are likely contributing to this upward trajectory: Increased Institutional Interest: More traditional financial institutions are exploring and investing in Bitcoin, bringing significant capital and legitimacy to the crypto space. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties can sometimes push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is often seen as a hedge against inflation or traditional market volatility. Supply Dynamics: Events such as the Bitcoin halving, which reduces the rate at which new BTC enters circulation, inherently create scarcity and can drive up prices over time. Positive Market Sentiment: A general optimistic outlook among retail and institutional investors can create a self-reinforcing cycle of buying pressure. Is This Sustainable? Understanding Market Dynamics While the current momentum is strong, the sustainability of any significant market movement, including this Bitcoin price surge , is always a pertinent question. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and price corrections are a natural part of its cycle. However, analyzing underlying fundamentals can offer clues. Many analysts look at technical indicators, trading volumes, and broader economic trends to gauge future movements. A sustained rally often requires consistent buying interest, coupled with favorable market conditions. It’s important for investors to remain vigilant and understand that market sentiment can shift rapidly. What Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Mean for Investors? For those involved in the crypto market, a substantial price movement like this offers both opportunities and considerations. The Bitcoin price surge can significantly impact portfolio values and influence future investment strategies. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: Existing holders see the value of their investments increase, potentially leading to substantial gains. Increased Market Confidence: A strong rally can attract new investors and instill greater confidence in the long-term viability of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Broader Adoption: Higher prices often bring more mainstream media attention, which can further accelerate Bitcoin’s adoption and integration into global finance. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Risk: While prices are rising, the potential for sharp pullbacks always exists. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New investors might feel pressured to buy at elevated prices, potentially exposing them to greater risk if a correction occurs. Risk Management: It’s crucial for investors to have a clear strategy, including setting stop-loss orders and diversifying their portfolios. Actionable Insights for Investors: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always understand the fundamentals and risks associated with any investment. Consider Long-Term Holdings: Many Bitcoin advocates suggest a long-term holding strategy, often referred to as “HODLing,” to ride out short-term fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore other cryptocurrencies or asset classes to mitigate risk. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of the Bitcoin Price Surge Predicting the exact future of any asset, especially a volatile one like Bitcoin, is challenging. However, several ongoing trends suggest continued interest and potential for growth. The increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies by major corporations, the development of more accessible investment vehicles, and the evolving regulatory landscape all play a role in shaping Bitcoin’s path. This latest Bitcoin price surge serves as a powerful reminder of the asset’s dynamic nature and its capacity to deliver significant returns. As the digital economy continues to evolve, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, constantly redefining financial possibilities. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s ascent above $108,000 marks an exciting chapter in its journey.

He also suggested that if countries needed smaller foreign reserves because payments were easier and cheaper, that would shift long-held financial balances. That kind of shift could face strong pushback. Scott noted a decentralized payment and reserve setup “ruins the existing power structure,” meaning political resistance is likely. Community Voices Split The post prompted a range of reactions from within the XRP crowd. Nenad Stojkovic said Ripple stands out because of its infrastructure and regulatory steps, calling it a rare “serious financial company” in crypto — a view Scott agreed with. One user, SonOfRichard, argued Ripple’s new product Ripple Prime might lift XRP even without new laws, since it’s already compliant with some rules. Scott pushed back, replying that real progress still needs clear laws. Other voices were critical; Tommy Raz questioned the company’s top leaders. He spoke in their favor, saying their actions match the stated mission and that some online comments, especially from Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz, get misunderstood.

53842265,617232,1761868840,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53842265.jpeg,Hong Kong Regulator Sounds Alarm on Companies Holding Crypto In Treasuries,https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-regulator-alarm-holding-crypto-treasuries/,"Hong Kong’s SFC has raised concerns about the rise of digital asset treasuries, companies that put crypto on their balance sheet. Hong Kong SFC Is Closely Monitoring Crypto Treasury Developments As reported by the South China Morning Post, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is keeping an eye on how firms are using crypto as part of their treasury management. The term Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) refers to a public company that acquires and holds Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to give stockholders exposure to price movements. Often, the stock price of such firms trades at a premium compared to their treasury reserves, and this seems to be where the SFC’s concern lies. Kelvin Wong Tin-yau, the regulator’s chairman, noted, “The SFC is concerned about whether DAT companies’ share prices are traded at a substantial premium above the cost of their DAT holdings.” Wong’s statement comes a week after Bloomberg reported that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Clearing (HKEX) blocked a DAT strategy pivot for at least five firms in recent months. HKEX operates the city’s main stock exchange, one of the largest markets in the world. The bourse operator, which names the Hong Kong Government as its largest shareholder, challenged the plans of these companies, raising compliance issues with rules that prohibit large liquid holdings. Wong revealed that the SFC is closely monitoring DATs and plans to strengthen public awareness about the associated risks. “We caution investors to fully understand the underlying risks of DAT,” said the SFC chairman. The DAT strategy was popularized by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which adopted a Bitcoin treasury as its core business back in 2020. The company’s reserves have since grown to 640,808 BTC, worth a whopping $70.6 billion. The firm paid about $47.4 billion in total to assemble its BTC treasury, so at the current price of the crypto, it’s sitting at a healthy profit of almost 49%. Strategy’s success has unleashed a DAT wave, as other companies rush to replicate the model. Bitcoin isn’t the only asset that corporates are looking at today; there has also been a rise in DATs focused on Ethereum and Solana. Bitmine owns the largest ETH treasury in the world, containing about 3.34 million tokens, equivalent to $13 billion. While Forward Industries is the king of SOL DATs with 6,822 coins or $1.3 billion in assets. DATs represent just one route that traders can take for gaining indirect exposure to digital assets. Another path is through the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , investment vehicles that trade on traditional exchanges and buy the underlying crypto on behalf of investors. Demand for spot ETFs appears to be weak right now, however, as according to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant , the 7-day change in the netflow of the US Bitcoin funds has dropped to a negative value of 281 BTC, which is the lowest since April. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $110,000, down around 2.7% over the last 24 hours.",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto DAT|Cryptocurrency|DAT|digital asset treasury,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 00:00:40
53842247,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88093,1761868858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ETH Retests Support, LINK Eyes $46 Target, & BlockDAG’s Genesis Day Countdown Shapes the Best Crypto for the Future",https://timestabloid.com/eth-retests-support-link-eyes-46-target-blockdags-genesis/,"Crypto markets are navigating a transition phase where sustained structure matters more than speculation. Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink (LINK) are demonstrating that principle, each showing resilience despite market compression. Ethereum’s price outlook remains constructive as it retests support levels before what analysts describe as a probable rebound, while Chainlink continues to impress by holding near $17.85 with a long-term target around $46. But even as these established names strengthen their cases, BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing for a launch phase that blends infrastructure readiness with event-driven momentum. Its Genesis Day countdown signals a complete ecosystem rollout that aims to redefine engagement and accessibility. Together, these three highlight how strong fundamentals define the best crypto for the future. Ethereum Price Outlook: Stability Above Key Support Ethereum is trading around key structural support as traders watch for confirmation of a rebound that could set the tone for the next market leg. Analysts note that ETH’s price continues to hold near the $3,000–$3,200 range, showing stability after a series of volatile sessions. On-chain data reflects steady staking inflows and declining exchange reserves, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. Technically, Ethereum remains above its ascending support line, with momentum indicators showing the potential for renewed upward movement. A confirmed retest of $3,000 followed by a close above $3,400 could signal a return to medium-term strength. Institutional flows through ETH-based ETFs continue to offer background support. While short-term noise persists, Ethereum’s network dominance in DeFi and stable long-term adoption rates reinforce its position as one of the best crypto assets for future growth. Chainlink Price Update: Steady Growth and Oracle Adoption Chainlink’s performance continues to validate its growing role as a cornerstone of decentralized data infrastructure. The token is holding steady near $17.85, consolidating after a period of gradual appreciation. Analysts maintain a bullish long-term target of $46, driven by sustained oracle demand and Chainlink’s integration across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Recent updates to its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) have also expanded enterprise adoption, further strengthening the project’s outlook. On-chain data indicates increased wallet activity and reduced exchange supply, both signaling confidence among holders. Technical setups suggest that maintaining current support could pave the way for a mid-range move toward $25 before long-term targets come into play. In the context of the best crypto for the future, Chainlink stands as a model of steady execution and consistent real-world application within the data connectivity layer of blockchain technology. BlockDAG’s Genesis Day & Keynote 4: Final Launch Phase Underway While Ethereum and Chainlink sustain network confidence, BlockDAG is entering its defining chapter. The project’s Genesis Day is set for November 26, marking the culmination of a presale that has raised $435 million with only 4.5B coins remaining. Priced at $0.005 in Batch 32, the project is now preparing for its Genesis Day on November 26 and planned listing scheduled for February 10, 2026 it will officially open the network to the public. The upcoming Keynote 4 event will detail this transition, unveiling final integration updates and mainnet readiness milestones. Every element of BlockDAG’s ecosystem, from its hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Engagement consensus to its distributed X-Series miners, is being synchronized for seamless deployment. The infrastructure already supports speeds between 2,000 and 15,000 TPS, combining DAG scalability with blockchain-level security. Beyond the technology, the scale of community participation stands out. 3.5 million X1 mobile miners and thousands of X-Series hardware units are active or in shipment, ensuring immediate decentralization at launch. Exchange partnerships with 20 confirmed CEX listings further anchor market confidence. Genesis Day represents not just a launch but a transformation, a shift from presale community to public blockchain operation. As the countdown continues, BlockDAG’s execution and transparency place it firmly among the best crypto for the future, merging working infrastructure with a growing global audience. The Bottom Line Ethereum’s steady recovery from support underscores its technical strength, and Chainlink’s expanding oracle integrations continue to validate its importance to blockchain interoperability. Both projects showcase resilience within an evolving market. Yet BlockDAG’s transition into its Genesis Day launch phase defines a different kind of maturity, one based on real utility, delivered milestones, and transparent execution. With $435 million raised, 3.5 million X1 users engaged, and 20 exchanges preparing listings, BlockDAG’s readiness separates it from speculation-driven ventures. As investors search for the best crypto for the future, Ethereum and Chainlink represent proven networks, but BlockDAG represents the next evolution: a blockchain already built for global scale before it even lists.

53842387,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88141,1761869151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple CTO Reveals the Truth About 100 Billion XRP Supply,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-cto-reveals-the-truth-about-100-billion-xrp-supply/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has explained the reasoning behind the XRP Ledger’s decision to issue a total of 100 billion XRP tokens . The clarification came after a community member questioned why the network’s creators chose such a large number instead of a smaller or larger supply. When the XRP Ledger was launched in 2012 , its three founders, David Schwartz, Arthur Britto, and Jed McCaleb, pre-mined all 100 billion XRP. Unlike Bitcoin, which gradually releases new coins through mining, XRP’s full supply was created from the start. Since then, questions about this fixed figure have continued to circulate among users. How the Question Arose The latest discussion began when Diep Sanh, a well-known XRP supporter, asked on X why the creators of the XRP Ledger decided on a total of 100 billion tokens. He questioned whether there was a technical or symbolic reason behind the number. In response, Schwartz outlined three main factors that influenced the choice: the need for divisibility to support small transactions, the ability to fit the total within a 64-bit integer for processing efficiency, and the desire for a simple, memorable figure. To meet three criteria: 1) Adequate divisibility. 2) Fits in 64-bit integer. 3) Easy for humans to remember. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) October 29, 2025 Reasons Behind the 100 Billion Supply Schwartz first explained that the large supply ensures that XRP can be divided into small units for microtransactions. Each token can be split into one million drops, allowing the network to handle very small payments efficiently. This level of precision supports XRP’s role as a utility token for cross-border transactions and payment settlements. He also noted that the XRP Ledger has a practical limit to how finely tokens can be divided, but the current structure is sufficient for its intended use cases. The system’s divisibility ensures that XRP can facilitate both large and minimal-value transfers with ease. The second reason is technical compatibility. By setting the total number of XRP at 100 billion, the ledger ensures that all token amounts fit comfortably within a 64-bit unsigned integer, a computer data type that can store numbers up to more than 18 quintillion. This helps the ledger avoid rounding errors and maintain fast transaction processing. Finally, Schwartz said the number was chosen partly for simplicity. A round figure like 100 billion is easier for users to remember and discuss, making it more accessible for the public compared to arbitrary or uneven totals. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Views on XRP’s Total Supply Beyond Schwartz’s comments, several community members have expressed differing opinions about whether the 100 billion supply is sufficient. In December 2024, Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of The Black Swan Capitalist, argued that the growing demand for tokenized assets, stablecoins such as RLUSD , and liquidity solutions could make XRP’s total supply appear limited in the future. He suggested that, as tokenization and institutional use cases expand, demand might outpace availability. Similarly, in June 2024, game developer Chad Steingraber highlighted that a significant portion of XRP remains locked in escrow or held by large investors. According to him, the amount actually circulating in the open market is much smaller than the total supply, which could create scarcity over time if demand increases. Another community member, Dave Lui, expressed a similar view in 2020, noting that while 100 billion XRP might seem excessive, it becomes logical when considering the asset’s evolving role in financial systems and the growing participation of institutions likely to hold substantial amounts for long periods. In March 2024, XRP supporter Jack the Rippler also defended the figure, stating that solving global payment inefficiencies, a market worth trillions of dollars, requires a high supply to ensure sufficient liquidity across global markets. David Schwartz’s explanation clarifies that XRP’s 100 billion token supply was not arbitrary but a deliberate choice balancing divisibility, system efficiency, and user accessibility. While some in the community believe this amount may prove insufficient as XRP adoption grows, others see it as a necessary foundation for a network designed to support global-scale payments.

Two new addresses, widely presumed to be connected to crypto mining giant Bitmain, have recently executed a substantial Bitmain ETH withdrawal . This move involves a staggering 44,036 ETH, valued at approximately $170 million, pulled from major exchanges Kraken and BitGo. This shocking development has caught the attention of market analysts and investors alike, prompting questions about its potential impact. What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitmain ETH Withdrawal? Onchain-Lense, a reputable analytics firm, first reported this notable transaction. The details indicate that these two newly created addresses collectively transferred 44,036 Ethereum tokens out of Kraken and BitGo. Such a large-scale Bitmain ETH withdrawal immediately caught the attention of market observers and analysts due to its sheer size and the prominence of the entity involved. For context, Bitmain (BMNR) is a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining hardware industry. Their actions often carry significant weight and can offer insights into broader market trends or their operational strategies. This particular movement of funds is not just about the sheer volume; it also raises questions about the intent behind such a substantial transfer. Is it a strategic operational adjustment, a shift in asset management, or something else entirely? The crypto community is eager to understand the implications. Why Does a Bitmain ETH Withdrawal Command So Much Attention? When an entity as prominent as Bitmain moves such a colossal amount of digital assets, the crypto community pays close attention. Here’s why this Bitmain ETH withdrawal is particularly noteworthy: Scale of Funds: $170 million in ETH is a significant sum, capable of impacting market liquidity if sold. Bitmain’s Influence: As a key player in the mining sector, Bitmain’s treasury management decisions can reflect broader industry sentiment or upcoming strategic shifts. New Addresses: The use of new addresses suggests a deliberate, perhaps strategic, decision rather than routine operational transfers, adding a layer of intrigue. Understanding the motivations behind such a move is crucial for investors and market analysts. It could signal various intentions, from consolidating assets to preparing for new investments or even potential off-market transactions. This makes monitoring such events vital for staying ahead in the crypto space. Unpacking the Market Impact of Bitmain’s ETH Movement Could this substantial Bitmain ETH withdrawal influence the Ethereum market? Large movements of assets from exchanges often spark speculation. When significant amounts of crypto are withdrawn from exchanges, it can sometimes be interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell immediately. Conversely, such a large sum being moved could also be seen as preparation for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, which wouldn’t directly impact exchange prices but still represents a shift in ownership. The market typically reacts to perceived supply and demand dynamics, and a major withdrawal changes the available supply on exchanges. Investors often monitor these on-chain metrics closely for clues about institutional sentiment and potential future price action. The immediate impact on ETH’s price remains to be seen, but the event certainly adds a layer of intrigue to the market. Will this lead to increased volatility or a quiet repositioning of assets? The Critical Role of On-Chain Analytics in Tracking Major Crypto Moves This event underscores the invaluable nature of on-chain analytics. Without platforms like Onchain-Lense, such significant transfers might go unnoticed by the broader public. On-chain data provides transparency into the otherwise opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. Analysts use these tools to track whale movements, identify potential accumulation or distribution phases, and gain insights into the behavior of large entities. Monitoring a Bitmain ETH withdrawal or similar large transactions helps in: Identifying Trends: Spotting patterns in large-holder behavior, which can indicate market sentiment. Risk Assessment: Understanding potential market volatility or significant shifts in asset allocation. Informed Decision-Making: Providing crucial data points for investors and traders to make better choices. The ability to trace funds, even through new addresses, offers a unique window into the flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem, enhancing market intelligence and security. What’s Next After This Significant Bitmain ETH Withdrawal? While the exact reasons behind Bitmain’s latest move are not yet public, the cryptocurrency community will undoubtedly continue to monitor these addresses for further activity. Whether this Bitmain ETH withdrawal is a precursor to a new strategic initiative, an internal asset reallocation, or something else entirely, it highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Staying informed about such significant on-chain events is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space. It reminds us that even major players like Bitmain are constantly adjusting their strategies in response to the evolving digital asset landscape. Keep an eye on the blockchain; it always tells a compelling story of capital movement and market shifts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the significance of Bitmain withdrawing such a large amount of ETH? A1: A large Bitmain ETH withdrawal is significant because Bitmain is a major player in the crypto mining industry. Such a move can signal strategic shifts, asset consolidation, or preparation for large-scale investments or transactions, potentially influencing market sentiment and liquidity. Q2: Where did Bitmain withdraw the 44,036 ETH from? A2: The 44,036 ETH, valued at approximately $170 million, was withdrawn from two prominent cryptocurrency exchanges: Kraken and BitGo. Q3: How was this Bitmain ETH withdrawal identified? A3: This significant transaction was identified and reported by Onchain-Lense, an analytics firm specializing in tracking and analyzing cryptocurrency movements on the blockchain. Their tools provide transparency into large-scale transfers. Q4: Could this withdrawal impact the price of Ethereum (ETH)? A4: While not a direct guarantee of price movement, large withdrawals from exchanges can reduce the immediate supply available for trading, which some interpret as a bullish signal. However, the funds could also be intended for an over-the-counter (OTC) sale, which would not directly affect exchange prices. Market observers will be watching closely. Q5: What are “new addresses” in this context? A5: “New addresses” refer to cryptocurrency wallet addresses that have not been previously associated with significant activity or identified with a known entity like Bitmain. Their use for such a large Bitmain ETH withdrawal suggests a deliberate and perhaps strategic decision to manage these specific funds.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $11.14. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $27.9 and $33.66, with an average value of $28.88. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.4013 Market Cap $747.69M Trading Volume $131.39M Circulating Supply 1.89B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.4489 24-hour Low $0.3879 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 25.53% (Extremely High) 50-Day SMA $0.6240 14-Day RSI 36.67 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 34 (Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.7275 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP remains weak near $0.40 with RSI nearing oversold, hinting at a potential bounce. A close above $0.42 could confirm recovery, but failure to hold $0.39 opens downside risk. Optimism 1-day price chart As of October 31, Optimism (OP/USDT) is hovering at $0.3999, down 0.10%, marking another day of sideways movement following persistent bearish pressure. The Bollinger Bands show a constricting formation, with the lower band near $0.3912 acting as immediate support and the midline at $0.4432 now a firm resistance barrier. This tightening range indicates reduced volatility but also hints that a breakout move may be brewing. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains weakly positive, yet the histogram is fading, signaling momentum loss among buyers. The RSI at 33.53 hovers close to oversold levels, suggesting the coin is undervalued in the short term and may soon see relief buying. However, the lack of follow-through above $0.41 keeps optimism muted for now. If OP can hold above $0.39, the next bullish target sits around $0.43, with a secondary resistance at $0.45 (the mid-Bollinger level). But a drop below $0.39 could invite another pullback toward $0.37–$0.36. Optimism 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart shows OP trading at $0.4005, up slightly by 0.05% after briefly testing $0.39 earlier. The Alligator indicator lines remain spread and sloping downward, confirming a prevailing short-term bearish structure. However, the green line flattening near $0.416 suggests that selling pressure is slowing, with consolidation possibly forming around this zone. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The PVT (70.65M) reflects mild accumulation after consistent distribution over the past few sessions, and the Balance of Power (0.09) suggests a neutral-to-slightly-bullish tone returning among intraday traders. For any meaningful reversal, OP must reclaim the $0.415–$0.42 zone; otherwise, it risks re-entering a sideways-to-downtrend channel below $0.395. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5355 SELL SMA 5 $0.5062 SELL SMA 10 $0.4874 SELL SMA 21 $0.4824 SELL SMA 50 $0.6240 SELL SMA 100 $0.6757 SELL SMA 200 $0.7275 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5240 SELL EMA 5 $0.5753 SELL EMA 10 $0.6350 SELL EMA 21 $0.6785 SELL EMA 50 $0.6944 SELL EMA 100 $0.7107 SELL EMA 200 $0.8487 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is stabilizing after an extended selloff, but the trend remains fragile. Holding above $0.39 is key to building a base for a mild rebound toward $0.43, while slipping below that would confirm continued weakness. Momentum indicators suggest a possible short-term bounce, but broader recovery needs stronger buyer conviction. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future?

The crypto market is buzzing with a renewed sense of caution as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has recently fallen five points, landing at a significant 29. This reading clearly indicates that a state of fear continues to grip investors, according to the latest data from Alternative.me. For anyone involved in digital assets, understanding this shift in sentiment is absolutely critical. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : What Does it Measure? Many wonder what exactly this index is and why it holds so much weight. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to gauge the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. It operates on a simple scale: zero signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ while 100 represents ‘Extreme Greed.’ This comprehensive index compiles various data points to offer a holistic view of market sentiment. Its calculation relies on a blend of crucial factors: Volatility (25%): This measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates. High volatility often signals a nervous market. Market Volume (25%): High trading volumes in a declining market can indicate panic selling. Social Media Mentions (15%): An analysis of crypto-related hashtags and sentiment on platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Surveys (15%): Polling investors to understand their current outlook (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): An increase in Bitcoin’s market share often suggests investors are moving into safer assets. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracking search queries related to crypto, especially ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash,’ can indicate fear. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 29 Matters for You A low reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , like the current 29, is more than just a number; it reflects the collective psychology of the market. When fear dominates, investors tend to sell off their holdings, often leading to price declines. Historically, periods of extreme fear have sometimes presented unique buying opportunities for long-term investors, as assets might be undervalued. Conversely, extreme greed can signal an overheated market ripe for a correction. This persistent fear can be a challenging environment for both new and experienced traders. It tests conviction and often leads to emotional decision-making. Understanding that the market is driven by these fundamental human emotions—fear and greed—allows investors to approach their strategies with a more rational perspective. The index serves as a valuable counter-indicator, suggesting that when others are fearful, it might be a time to be cautious, yet also observant for potential entry points. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Low So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index signaling fear, what should you do? It is crucial to avoid impulsive reactions. Instead, consider a few strategic approaches to protect your portfolio and potentially capitalize on future growth. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of making a large, single investment, spread your investments over time. This reduces the risk associated with market timing. Conduct Thorough Research: Use this period to dive deep into projects with strong fundamentals, solid roadmaps, and active development teams. Fear often indiscriminately impacts all assets, not just the weak ones. Reassess Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. This might be a good time to trim highly speculative assets if you’re overexposed. Focus on the Long Term: For many, crypto investing is a marathon, not a sprint. Short-term market fluctuations, while unsettling, often smooth out over a longer investment horizon. Beyond the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : A Broader Perspective While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a valuable snapshot of market sentiment, it is important to remember that it is just one tool in an investor’s toolkit. Relying solely on any single indicator can be misleading. The broader economic landscape, regulatory developments, technological advancements within specific projects, and global events all play significant roles in shaping the crypto market. Always combine sentiment analysis with fundamental and technical analysis. Look at on-chain data, read whitepapers, and stay informed about macroeconomic trends. This holistic approach ensures you are making well-rounded, informed decisions rather than simply reacting to fear or greed. Due diligence remains paramount in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Navigating Fear with Foresight The latest drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 29 serves as a potent reminder that fear is a persistent force in the crypto market. While it can be unsettling, understanding this sentiment allows investors to approach their strategies with greater clarity and less emotion. By focusing on sound investment principles, conducting diligent research, and maintaining a long-term perspective, you can navigate these fearful times more effectively. Remember, informed decisions are your best defense against market volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

Although dYdX will initially allow American users to spot trade major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, it will prevent U.S. users from accessing its derivative products, including perpetual contracts. The exchange will also charge lower trading fees, ranging between 50 and 65 basis points for American traders, as the company strives to attract more liquidity and compete with existing U.S. cryptocurrency trading platforms. During the interview, the president of the decentralized exchange welcomed this decision as a new direction for the exchange, which specializes in derivatives. Notably, sources highlighted that dYdX was previously unavailable for American users. dYdX eyes the US market for expansion amid Trump’s pro-crypto stance Centralized exchanges, such as Kraken and Coinbase, function as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. However, decentralized platforms such as dYdX tend to take a different approach by eliminating intermediaries and allowing users to trade directly on a blockchain network that supports cryptocurrencies. For dYdX, its main focus is on perpetual contracts, a type of derivative that permits traders to bet on the price of an asset without actually owning it. Compared to regular futures contracts, these contracts do not have an expiration date. Following the launch announcement , the San Francisco-based firm recently shared data highlighting that its total trading volume has surged over $1.5 trillion since it started operations. To remain competitive in the industry, the platform announced its intention to expand services by launching spot trading for Solana and other related cryptocurrencies in the US by the end of the year, according to Eddie Zhang, the president of dYdX. “It’s crucial for us as a platform to have something in the United States, because I believe it shows the direction we want to head in,” said Zhang. This decision follows US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance, adopted this year, which has contributed to a favourable environment for crypto trading. To support this claim, sources noted that Trump’s support for the crypto ecosystem led to the withdrawal of several lawsuits against leading crypto platforms and a significant shift in the approach of financial regulators toward developing specific rules for digital assets. The US SEC and CFTC consider exposing crypto perpetuals to crypto trade Regarding dYdX’s intention to enter the US market, Zhang shared that when this plan succeeds, they will reduce their trading fees by up to 50%, lowering them to between 50 and 65 basis points. He further explained that although perpetual contracts will not be available in the United States, dYdX hopes the nation’s regulators will ultimately issue guidance enabling decentralized platforms to offer such products. Industry analysts say dYdX’s move could pressure other exchanges to adjust fees and expand their offerings in the U.S., while also signaling growing mainstream adoption of decentralized trading platforms. The company has not yet confirmed the exact date of its U.S. launch or the full list of supported assets; however, the end-of-year target remains its stated goal. In the meantime, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement last month, mentioning that they will consider allowing crypto perpetuals to trade on regulated platforms in the country. Concerning this decision, the commissioners initiated a combined effort known as “Project Crypto-Crypto Sprint” to clarify the regulations for digital assets. In early October 2025, they also outlined plans for a joint roundtable to tackle decentralized finance (DeFi) and perpetual contracts. The agencies’ move marks another significant milestone in the crypto ecosystem, signaling a new approach to a favorable crypto trading environment and boosting investor confidence.

A staggering $13.42 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) options and $2.46 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC. This isn’t just a routine expiry; it represents a substantial portion of open interest, making it a crucial moment for traders and investors alike. Understanding the mechanics behind this event is key to navigating the potential market shifts that may follow. What is This Massive Crypto Options Expiration All About? At its core, a crypto options contract grants the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. When that date arrives, the options “expire.” If the contract is “in the money” (profitable), it can be exercised; otherwise, it typically expires worthless. The sheer scale of today’s expiration, as reported by crypto options exchange Deribit, highlights its importance. Billions in notional value are on the line, creating an environment where market participants are closely watching price action. This volume can often lead to increased volatility as market makers and large holders adjust their positions. Decoding Key Metrics: Put/Call Ratio and Max Pain Price for Crypto Options To truly grasp the potential impact of a crypto options expiration , we need to look at two vital metrics: the put/call ratio and the max pain price. Put/Call Ratio: This ratio indicates the sentiment among options traders. Put options are essentially bets on a price decrease, while call options are bets on a price increase. A ratio below 1, like the 0.7 seen for both BTC and ETH options today, suggests that more call options are open compared to put options. This typically implies a more bullish sentiment among options traders leading up to the expiration. Max Pain Price: This is the price point at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for option holders. For Bitcoin, the max pain price is $114,000, and for Ethereum, it stands at $4,100. Historically, the price of the underlying asset can gravitate towards the max pain point as expiration approaches, driven by the actions of market makers who aim to minimize their liabilities. These figures provide valuable clues about where the market might be headed in the short term. However, it is important to remember that they are not definitive predictors. How Does This Crypto Options Expiration Impact Bitcoin and Ethereum? The immediate effect of a large crypto options expiration often manifests as increased market volatility. Leading up to 8:00 a.m. UTC, and even shortly after, we might observe sharper price movements for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Market makers, who typically hold balanced books of options, may need to buy or sell the underlying assets to hedge their positions as contracts expire. This activity can influence spot prices. If many call options are in the money, for example, market makers might have to buy BTC or ETH to fulfill their obligations, potentially pushing prices up. Conversely, if many put options are exercised, they might sell, exerting downward pressure. While the max pain price can act as a magnet, it does not guarantee the asset will close at that level. The actual price action depends on a multitude of factors, including broader market sentiment, macroeconomic news, and significant spot market activity. Navigating the Market: Strategies for Today’s Crypto Options Expiration For those involved in the crypto markets, understanding today’s crypto options expiration is vital. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Volatility: Be prepared for potentially heightened price swings. If you are an active trader, ensure your risk management strategies are robust. Observe Max Pain: Watch how Bitcoin and Ethereum prices react as they approach their respective max pain prices of $114,000 and $4,100. Significant resistance or support could emerge around these levels. Context is Key: Remember that options expiration is one factor among many. Always consider the broader market trends, news events, and on-chain data before making any decisions. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, the immediate impact of an options expiration is often transient. Focus on your long-term investment thesis rather than short-term fluctuations. This event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the sophisticated financial instruments that now play a role within it. In conclusion, today’s massive crypto options expiration for Bitcoin and Ethereum is a significant event, bringing billions in notional value to a head. With specific put/call ratios and max pain prices acting as guides, the market anticipates potential volatility and strategic price movements. While these expirations offer insights into short-term market dynamics, they are just one piece of the complex puzzle. Staying informed and exercising caution remains paramount for all participants in this evolving digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are crypto options contracts? Crypto options contracts give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on or before a certain date. They are financial derivatives used for hedging or speculation. 2. What does it mean when crypto options expire? When crypto options expire, the contract reaches its end date. If the option is profitable (in the money), the holder can choose to exercise it. If it’s not profitable (out of the money), it typically expires worthless, and the holder loses the premium paid. 3. What is the “max pain price” in crypto options? The max pain price is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless. It represents the point of maximum financial loss for options holders and can sometimes act as a magnet for the underlying asset’s price around expiration. 4. How does a put/call ratio of 0.7 for crypto options indicate market sentiment? A put/call ratio of 0.7 means there are fewer put options (bearish bets) than call options (bullish bets) open. This suggests a predominantly bullish sentiment among options traders, as more participants are betting on a price increase rather than a decrease. 5. Should I trade based solely on crypto options expiration events? While crypto options expiration can influence market volatility and price action, it is not advisable to trade based solely on this event. Always consider a comprehensive analysis, including broader market trends, technical indicators, and fundamental news, as part of your trading strategy.

Activity concentrates in tokens tied to measurable drivers such as policy developments, liquidity programs, and on-chain participation. MemeCore, Aerodrome Finance, and Tether Gold all posted gains through October 30, offering a look at how traders are repositioning around utility and global sentiment instead of broad speculative risk. The Altcoin Season Index sits near 28, while Bitcoin dominance remains around 59%. These readings show a market where liquidity is still concentrated in major assets, but smaller coins can attract inflows when linked to clear narratives. MemeCore: Community Tailwinds and Steady Screens MemeCore (M) is currently trading near $2.49 , up by about 5% in 24 hours. Market data indicates a steady climb in volume across mid-tier exchanges, supported by active retail participation and recurring social interest. The structure of MemeCore’s trading has improved slightly compared with earlier in the month. Spreads have tightened across active pairs, and price discovery has remained consistent throughout regional sessions. Liquidity across both spot and perpetual markets suggests traders are staying involved, though the pace remains moderate. Whether the trend endures depends on participation during the coming week and whether cross-market depth can hold steady while volatility compresses. Aerodrome Finance: Accumulation and Base Activity Aerodrome Finance (AERo) now trades around $1.01, showing an increase of about 3.3% in 24 hours. The token’s movement follows continued lending and liquidity operations on its associated network. Visible accumulation is seen from recurring program flows, particularly around the one-dollar mark, which has served as both resistance and support over recent weeks. AERO Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Volumes have stayed consistent, supported by on-chain activity that signals gradual accumulation instead of speculative surges. Market participants are watching whether Aerodrome can maintain stability above this threshold, which would indicate a more reliable trading base. If the pair continues to attract volume from multiple venues, it could extend its recovery in measured steps instead of single-session bursts. Tether Gold: Crypto’s Gold Proxy Follows Bullion Tether Gold (XAUT) trades near $4,026 , up about 1.9% in 24 hours. The move tracks the rally in global bullion prices after reports of easing tensions between the United States and China after their trade meeting . Market data shows gold gaining traction as investors rotate into hedging assets amid expectations of softer policy rates and improved trade visibility. Because XAUT is backed by physical gold, its price action often mirrors the performance of the global metal market. Recent strength in bullion has translated directly into token demand, drawing renewed interest from portfolios seeking on-chain alternatives to traditional hedges. The relationship between gold and its token counterpart has remained close, suggesting that real-world developments continue to influence digital asset pricing when sentiment turns defensive.

Trump pic.twitter.com/6wtEeVbiWp — The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 30, 2025 Altcoin Season Market Outlook The overall market remains cautious. The Altcoin Season Index below 30 signals that broad participation has yet to return, and Bitcoin continues to absorb most inflows. Still, certain altcoins are managing to attract attention by connecting with identifiable catalysts. MemeCore benefits from social-driven liquidity, Aerodrome gains from structured yield participation, and Tether Gold reflects shifts in global asset preference. Together they form a picture of a fragmented but functioning market where selective conviction replaces generalized optimism. Sustained improvement will depend on whether depth and cross-market activity expand in the coming sessions, allowing capital to flow beyond a handful of headline-driven assets.

The latest reading from CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is certainly turning heads. It has registered a notable drop to 28, down four points from yesterday. This isn’t just a number; it’s a significant indicator that could shape your investment decisions and highlight current market dynamics. Let’s dive into what this crucial shift means for altcoins and Bitcoin. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Actually Measure? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is key to navigating the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. This unique index, provided by the reputable cryptocurrency data platform CoinMarketCap, serves as a barometer for market sentiment. It’s calculated by comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, specifically excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, against the performance of Bitcoin. The timeframe for this comparison is the past 90 days, offering a snapshot of recent trends. So, when is an altcoin season officially declared? It happens when a significant majority—specifically 75%—of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over that 90-day period. Conversely, if Bitcoin is the dominant performer, we are in what’s known as a Bitcoin season. A reading closer to 100 on the Altcoin Season Index strongly indicates an altcoin season, suggesting broad strength across the altcoin market. Decoding the Current Altcoin Season Index Reading of 28 A reading of 28 on the Altcoin Season Index is a clear signal that we are currently far from an altcoin season. In fact, it points strongly towards a prevailing Bitcoin season. This low number indicates that a vast majority of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed Bitcoin over the last three months. What are the implications for investors? A low Altcoin Season Index suggests that capital might be flowing out of altcoins and consolidating into Bitcoin. This could be due to various factors, including a flight to perceived safety during uncertain times or simply Bitcoin asserting its dominance after a significant price movement. For many, this reading serves as a warning sign for altcoin-heavy portfolios. It encourages a closer look at diversification and risk management strategies, reminding us that market leadership can shift quickly. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Dropping Now? Several factors could contribute to the recent dip in the Altcoin Season Index . Market movements are rarely singular events; they are often influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic trends, specific crypto events, and shifting investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s Strength: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong rally, it can draw liquidity away from altcoins, causing them to lag. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties can push investors towards more established assets, and in crypto, that often means Bitcoin. Regulatory Concerns: Heightened regulatory scrutiny on certain altcoins or the broader crypto space can dampen investor enthusiasm for riskier assets. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin gains, investors might be rotating profits back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. These challenges for altcoins highlight Bitcoin’s foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. When the market is risk-averse, Bitcoin often becomes the preferred choice. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights During a Low Altcoin Season Index When the Altcoin Season Index is low, it’s not necessarily a time for panic, but rather for strategic reflection. Understanding this indicator can empower you to make more informed decisions about your crypto portfolio. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider if your current altcoin allocation aligns with a Bitcoin-dominant market. Focus on Bitcoin: During a Bitcoin season, concentrating a larger portion of your portfolio in Bitcoin might be a prudent strategy. High-Conviction Altcoins: If you hold altcoins, focus on those with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. These may be more resilient. Risk Management: Implement stop-losses or consider taking some profits to reduce exposure to more volatile altcoins. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news, sentiment, and the Altcoin Season Index for signs of a potential shift. The benefit of paying attention to the Altcoin Season Index is that it provides a quantitative measure to help guide your investment thesis, rather than relying solely on anecdotal evidence or social media hype. A Compelling Summary of the Altcoin Season Index The recent drop in the Altcoin Season Index to 28 is a compelling signal of the current market landscape. It strongly indicates a Bitcoin-dominant period, where altcoins are generally underperforming. This index is a powerful tool for understanding the broader trends in the crypto market, helping investors discern whether it’s a time for broad altcoin growth or a period where Bitcoin is leading the charge. While a low reading might seem daunting for altcoin holders, it also presents an opportunity to refine strategies, focus on robust assets, and prepare for future shifts. Staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index can truly give you an edge in making strategic decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an Altcoin Season? An Altcoin Season is declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It signifies a broad rally across the altcoin market. How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The Altcoin Season Index is calculated by comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. What does a low Altcoin Season Index mean for investors? A low Altcoin Season Index (like the current 28) suggests that Bitcoin is currently outperforming most altcoins. For investors, this typically indicates a Bitcoin-dominant market, potentially signaling a need to re-evaluate altcoin exposure and consider stronger assets or Bitcoin itself. Is it always a bad time for altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. While a low index indicates general underperformance, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals or unique narratives can still perform well. It emphasizes the importance of selective investing and thorough research rather than broad market exposure to altcoins. What typically causes the Altcoin Season Index to change? Changes in the Altcoin Season Index can be driven by Bitcoin’s price movements, overall market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, significant news events, and shifts in investor risk appetite between Bitcoin and altcoins.

The project has seen strong demand in its presale in recent weeks. Phase 6 is now nearly complete with more than $18.2 million raised. Investors show strong interest aiming to reap huge bull run gains. This has positioned MUTM among the most talked-about DeFi cryptos of 2025. The presale’s rapid sellout pace signals massive FOMO, with early participants eager to secure tokens before the next price increase. Mutuum Finance’s upcoming V1 protocol, expected to debut on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, will feature an advanced lending and borrowing ecosystem powered by liquidity pools, mtTokens, and an automated liquidator bot. This launch represents a major milestone in building a secure, scalable, and user-centric DeFi platform. With momentum accelerating and presale availability shrinking fast, MUTM stands out as the new crypto investors are rushing to accumulate before its potential breakout moment. Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 6 Nears Sell-Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured strong interest with its ongoing presale. The project rallied past its first 5 presale stages faster than expected and is now in the sixth at $0.035. Joining the presale today means getting MUTM tokens at the cheapest possible price. When phase 7 kicks off, the price per coin will pump nearly 20%. This emphasizes the need to buy while it’s still early. More than 17550 investors have scooped up MUTM tokens, bringing the presale raise to $18.15 million. The rapid uptake underscores Mutuum Finance’s growing reputation as the best DeFi crypto to invest in for both high short-term rewards and long-term value growth. Built on Secure Infrastructure and Smart Risk Management At its core, Mutuum Finance is built around a secure, risk-weighted infrastructure designed to protect both the protocol and its users. Key features include a Loan-to-Value (LTV) system that controls borrowing limits relative to collateral, asset-backed reserves, and dynamic liquidation tiers tailored to each asset’s individual risk profile. Additionally, the platform incorporates a reserve factor, an internal buffer designed to absorb volatility or default events. Higher-risk assets maintain larger reserve allocations, promoting long-term platform stability and strengthening investor confidence. Community-Driven Ecosystem and Incentive Rewards To complement its strong security framework, Mutuum Finance fosters a community-focused incentive model that rewards participation and ecosystem engagement. This structure not only drives user growth but also encourages sustainable participation in the project’s long-term vision for secure and transparent decentralized finance. Stablecoin, Oracles, and Analyst Price Forecasts Looking beyond the launch, Mutuum Finance plans to release a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by verified on-chain collateral. This asset will play a crucial role in maintaining stability across the platform’s lending ecosystem by anchoring borrowing and repayment to a predictable value. It reduces exposure to market swings and makes returns more consistent for both lenders and borrowers. To ensure accurate pricing across supported assets, Mutuum Finance will use oracle systems such as Chainlink to supply real-time market data. These oracles will ensure that collateral values, borrowing limits, and liquidation thresholds always match current market conditions. If one feed fails, backup and aggregated data sources will maintain price accuracy, a vital safeguard for DeFi platforms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $18.2M, with 80% of Phase 6 sold at $0.035. As its V1 protocol nears launch, investor demand keeps climbing, cementing MUTM as 2025’s breakout DeFi crypto. With the next phase set to rise to $0.04, now is the time to secure tokens before the priced spikes in the next phase.

Global asset management firm WisdomTree has just made a significant move, launching 14 innovative tokenized funds on the Plume blockchain. This strategic step marks a pivotal moment for real-world assets (RWAs) and their digital future, offering investors unprecedented access and efficiency. What Are WisdomTree’s New Tokenized Funds? WisdomTree, a well-established name in asset management, is diving deeper into the digital asset space. The firm introduced 14 new tokenized funds , making a strong statement about the future of finance. These offerings are not just theoretical; they are live and accessible on Plume, a blockchain specifically designed for regulatory-compliant real-world assets. Among the notable launches are: Government Money Market Digital Fund: This fund provides a digital avenue to traditional money market investments. CRDT Private Credit and Alternative Income Fund: An offering that opens up private credit and alternative income streams to a broader investor base through tokenization. What makes these tokenized funds particularly appealing is the ability for investors to directly hold, transfer, and settle them on the Plume blockchain. This direct interaction bypasses many of the intermediaries and complexities associated with traditional fund management, promising greater transparency and efficiency. Why Did WisdomTree Choose Plume for Tokenized Funds? Plume is not just any blockchain; it is a specialized platform built from the ground up to handle regulatory-compliant real-world assets. This focus on compliance is crucial for institutional players like WisdomTree. Plume has integrated robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) solutions directly at the protocol level, ensuring a high standard of security and regulatory adherence. Moreover, the platform offers essential services such as wallet screening and sanctions compliance. This comprehensive approach minimizes risks and ensures that all transactions involving tokenized funds meet stringent regulatory requirements. Plume’s credibility was further bolstered by its recent approval as a registered transfer agent by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a significant milestone for any blockchain platform operating in the RWA space. The platform’s growing ecosystem already boasts over 276,000 RWA holders and manages an impressive $600 million in tokenized assets, demonstrating its established presence and potential for future growth. How Do Tokenized Funds Transform Traditional Investing? The introduction of tokenized funds represents a paradigm shift in how investors can access and manage assets. This innovation brings several compelling benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: By tokenizing traditional assets, fractional ownership becomes easier, potentially lowering the entry barrier for investors. Increased Liquidity: Digital representation on a blockchain can facilitate faster and more efficient trading compared to illiquid traditional assets. Greater Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear, verifiable record of ownership and transactions. Operational Efficiency: Automation of processes like settlement and transfers can reduce costs and time. This move by WisdomTree illustrates a broader trend where traditional finance is increasingly embracing blockchain technology to unlock new efficiencies and investment opportunities. It’s about blending the reliability of established financial products with the innovation of digital assets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Real-World Assets? WisdomTree’s launch of tokenized funds on Plume is a powerful signal for the entire real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector. It signifies a growing confidence from major financial institutions in the viability and potential of blockchain technology for mainstream investment products. As more traditional assets become tokenized, we can anticipate a future where digital ownership and seamless global transfers are commonplace. This development could pave the way for a more inclusive financial system, where diverse asset classes, from real estate to private equity, are accessible to a wider range of investors through digital formats. The regulatory compliance built into platforms like Plume is key to this evolution, ensuring that innovation proceeds responsibly. WisdomTree’s venture into tokenized funds on the Plume blockchain is a groundbreaking step, showcasing the immense potential of digital assets to reshape traditional finance. By offering regulated, accessible, and efficient investment products, they are not just participating in the future of finance but actively shaping it. This initiative highlights the critical role of compliant blockchain platforms in fostering institutional adoption and expanding the reach of real-world assets into the digital realm. Frequently Asked Questions About Tokenized Funds Q1: What exactly are tokenized funds? A1: Tokenized funds are traditional investment funds, like money market or private credit funds, whose units of ownership are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This allows for direct digital ownership, transfer, and settlement. Q2: How do tokenized funds differ from traditional funds? A2: The primary difference lies in their underlying technology and operational model. Tokenized funds leverage blockchain for ownership records, transfers, and settlements, offering potentially greater transparency, efficiency, and fractional ownership compared to traditional paper-based or centralized systems. Q3: Is investing in tokenized funds regulated? A3: Yes, platforms like Plume are designed for regulatory compliance. They integrate KYC/AML solutions and have secured approvals, such as Plume’s registration as a transfer agent with the SEC, to ensure that tokenized funds operate within established legal frameworks. Q4: What are the benefits of investing in tokenized funds? A4: Benefits include increased accessibility, potential for greater liquidity, enhanced transparency through blockchain’s immutable ledger, and improved operational efficiency in transactions and record-keeping. Q5: Can any investor access these tokenized funds? A5: While the concept aims for broader accessibility, specific eligibility criteria will depend on the fund’s nature and regulatory requirements, similar to traditional investment products. However, the tokenized format can facilitate easier access for qualified investors globally. If you found this article insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

With the downward wave showing signs of completion, market watchers are now eyeing a potential shift in momentum that could spark the next bullish reversal. Price Channel Near Completion: One Key Level Left To Break After examining the Dogecoin (DOGE) 30-minute chart, the Elliott Waves Academy updated its outlook to confirm a period of strong selling pressure. Technical analysis clearly indicates that the DOGE/USD pair is nearing the completion of a defined price channel pattern, with only one key level remaining before the next major wave is confirmed. Related Reading: Bullish Window For Dogecoin Opens in November, Analyst Says Specifically, the downward leg represents Wave (5) of Wave 3 within a larger bearish sequence. According to Elliott Waves Academy, the bearish outlook is heavily supported by the preceding structure, which involves a confirmed and strong downward wave representing Wave (3), demonstrating robust and sustained momentum from the sellers. A continuation of the bearish outlook is structurally reinforced by the presence of the price channel pattern itself. Key to confirming the final downward wave hinges on the price breaking the key support level of the current minor correction. Elliott Waves Academy emphasized that successfully breaking this critical key level will provide undeniable confirmation of the bearish view and set a precise trajectory for the completion of the move. Elliott Waves Academy targets the $0.1843646$ level as the expected floor for this phase. The objective is anticipated to be the point at which the internal wave structure is complete and the current bout of selling pressure is exhausted. Finally, Elliott Waves Academy noted that a crucial follow-up action: after reaching the $0.1843646$ level, a corrective upward main wave is predicted to follow. This implies that anticipated downside is part of a structural cycle and should be followed by a noticeable relief rally. Momentum Builds Quietly Beneath The Surface According to EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL, Dogecoin continues to follow the same structural rhythm observed in previous market cycles. The price action is unfolding in a familiar pattern, suggesting that the asset may be preparing for another significant move once conditions align. Related Reading: Volatility Loading: Dogecoin Eyes Explosive Path To $3 In his post, EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL revealed that momentum is quietly building above key support levels, signaling underlying strength in the market despite the recent volatility.

He concluded by emphasizing that patience is key before the next ignition phase, as Dogecoin consolidates and gathers momentum. The current setup suggests a potential upside once a breakout confirms renewed bullish momentum.

The company’s application with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a national trust bank charter, proposed under the name Ripple National Trust Bank, has entered its final review window. According to official OCC filings, the standard 120-day review period following the application’s publication is set to conclude this Friday, October 31. Ripple’s Application For A National Trust Bank License Ripple applied for a national trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on July 2, 2025. The application was for a national trust bank, not a traditional bank, and is intended to provide fiduciary activities like custody and infrastructure for its RLUSD stablecoin. The application was made in early July and entered a public review phase in October. The Ripple National Trust Bank application represents Ripple Labs’ strategic expansion into federally supervised financial services. If approved, the charter would authorize the firm to operate a national trust bank headquartered at 111-119 West 19th Street in New York City. The application lists senior figures in the company like Stuart Alderoty, Timothy Keaney, John McDonald, David Puth, and John Zavaglia as the organizers, with Ripple Labs Inc. serving as the sponsoring institution from its San Francisco base. This move extends the firm’s push beyond cross-border payments into full-scale institutional custody and settlement. It also aligns with the company’s ongoing efforts to establish the RLUSD stablecoin as a regulated, transparent digital dollar. As noted by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, if approved, the firm would have both state and federal oversight, which is a new and unique benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. This comment was made by the Ripple CEO in July 2025 as confirmation of the license application. The 120-Day Review Window And What Comes Next Under OCC procedures, applications for national trust bank charters undergo a 120-day review to assess governance, capitalization, compliance programs, and management suitability. Ripple’s application entered that timeline after its public filing, meaning the review period ends on October 31. At this point, the OCC may issue an initial decision of approval, denial, or extension, depending on whether additional information is needed. However, the ongoing US government shutdown could influence the timing of the company’s license review. The payment firm’s application is part of a growing list of crypto-based companies seeking a national trust bank charter as the digital asset industry pushes closer to full regulatory integration with traditional finance. Companies like Circle, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and Paxos have also applied with the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for national trust bank charters.",Ripple|Brad Garlinghouse|Circle|coinbase|Comptroller of the Currency|Crypto.com|David Puth|John McDonald|John Zavaglia|OCC|Paxos|ripple|RLUSD|stablecoin|Stuart Alderoty|The Ripple National Trust Bank|Timothy Keaney|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 01:00:41

Despite prevailing caution, many of these projections suggest the possibility of record-breaking valuations across the sector. Analysts’ Bitcoin Forecasts for Q4 2025 Crypto market commentator CryptoJulzss predicts that Bitcoin could climb to $180,000 by the close of 2025. If this materializes, it would represent a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency, bringing its estimated market capitalization to nearly $3.5 trillion. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Leshka.eth provided a slightly higher outlook, forecasting Bitcoin within the $225,000 to $240,000 range by year-end. Such a rally would raise Bitcoin’s total valuation beyond $4.5 trillion, potentially positioning it among the world’s top three most valuable assets by market capitalization. These predictions align with the broader bullish sentiment expressed by other industry figures earlier in the year. Analysts such as Ash Crypto and Mario Nawfal have attributed potential Bitcoin growth to rising institutional adoption, continued ETF inflows , and an easing global monetary environment. BTC to $180k ETH to $9k $SOL to $350 $XRP to $25 $ASTER to $5 $ALGO to $3 $DOG to $1 What am I missing? — Julia (@CryptoJulzss) October 26, 2025 Adding to this optimism, Michael Saylor, the founder of MicroStrategy, reiterated at the Money 20/20 conference that he expects Bitcoin to reach $150,000 before the end of 2025. He cited growing regulatory clarity in the U.S., including the SEC’s evolving stance on tokenized securities and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s endorsement of stablecoins, as catalysts that could accelerate institutional participation in the sector. XRP’s Year-End Prospects Alongside Bitcoin, analysts are also anticipating a strong performance from XRP. Currently trading around $2.44 , XRP has shown resilience through market volatility and continues to benefit from Ripple’s expanding partnerships in global payments. According to CryptoJulzss, XRP could surge to $25 by the end of 2025, a projected tenfold increase that would give the asset a market capitalization exceeding $1.5 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tokens in existence. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On the other hand, Leshka.eth maintains a more moderate but still bullish outlook , placing XRP between $8.50 and $9.00 by year-end. Her projection corresponds closely with previous forecasts from Ash Crypto (who estimated a range of $5–$8) and Mario Nawfal, who predicted $10 if Bitcoin reaches $225,000. These expectations are largely based on the assumption that Ripple’s ongoing institutional adoption, combined with the potential approval of XRP-based ETFs , could significantly expand market demand during the final months of 2025. Broader Market Expectations Both analysts also shared insights on other major digital assets. CryptoJulzss anticipates Ethereum reaching $9,000 and Solana climbing to $350. In contrast, Leshka.eth projects higher figures across several assets, predicting Ethereum between $11,000 and $13,000, Solana at $800–$900, and BNB within the $2,800–$3,300 range. She further expects Dogecoin to trade between $1 and $2.50, while Chainlink (LINK) could reach $250–$400 if market conditions remain favorable. Market Sentiment Moving Into Year-End Although the current month has not delivered the price action many investors hoped for, analysts believe the final two months of the year could set the tone for a strong 2025 close. Historically, November and December have been among the most favourable periods for the cryptocurrency market, often marking the start of major upward trends. While market volatility remains a factor, the overarching view among leading analysts is that both Bitcoin and XRP could experience substantial appreciation in the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by institutional momentum, improving macroeconomic conditions, and greater integration of blockchain assets into global finance.

This stood as the second-highest monthly total of the year. The sudden move came as traders pulled back from risky leveraged positions after the massive $19 billion in losses earlier in the month. A Costly Lesson for Leveraged Traders The October crash started when US President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on China. Within hours, Bitcoin fell from $122,000 to around $101,000 on some exchanges. More than 1.6 million traders were forced to close positions. CoinGlass data showed that long traders suffered the worst and lost nearly $17 billion. One trader reportedly lost $19 million on Hyperliquid. A few whales profited by shorting Bitcoin before the fall. The market suffered massive liquidations on 10 October | source: Coinglass The fallout from this event was severe because it wiped out months of gains and reminded the market how quickly leveraged bets can implode. By the end of October, Bitcoin recovered to about $110,800. The price stayed range-bound between $108,000 and $116,000 and is showing signs of stabilisation after a chaotic start to the month. Bitcoin Spot Trading Gains Strength Binance dominated Bitcoin spot trading in October, after handling about $174 billion of the total volume. Data also showed that activity came from both retail traders and institutional investors. Analysts from CryptoQuant said the rise in spot trading showed a trend toward real accumulation rather than short-term speculation. People appear to be focusing more on owning Bitcoin outright instead of betting on short-term price swings. Bitcoin spot trading has gained strength since the crash | source: CryptoQuant This transition may be an important turning point. When markets are driven by actual buying and selling rather than leveraged contracts, prices tend to show genuine demand. That could mean fewer extreme swings and a stronger foundation for future growth. Analysts Warn of Fragile Recovery Despite fresh interest in spot markets, not everyone is confident that the worst is over. On-chain firm Santiment noted that retail traders are becoming overly optimistic. Many are “buying the dip” too early, which often leads to more losses when the market turns again. Market analyst Ali Martinez also flagged warning signs. He mentioned that the TD Sequential indicator flashed another possible sell signal. Concerns about global liquidity are still strong, even after the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut. The move caused another $700 million in liquidations across crypto markets. Signs of Long-Term Accumulation Exchange data supports this shift toward direct Bitcoin ownership. Total BTC held on exchanges dropped from 2.65 million to 2.38 million during October. This means more traders are moving their coins into personal wallets instead of leaving them on platforms for short-term trading. Some whales still moved large amounts into exchanges to sell, but many others continued to buy. Data from Binance showed that sell-taker orders slightly outnumbered buy orders. Bybit, on the other hand, saw stronger buying activity. Despite these mixed flows, the overall balance leaned toward accumulation. Traders used time-weighted average price (TWAP) orders to slowly build positions without spiking prices.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-31 01:04:15

Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has once again captured global attention as Bitcoin hits $109,000 . This significant milestone, confirmed by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at an impressive $109,112.32 on the Binance USDT market. It is a moment that sparks both celebration and curiosity, prompting many to ask: what exactly is driving this remarkable ascent? What’s Fueling This Remarkable Ascent After Bitcoin Hits $109,000? The latest Bitcoin price surge above $109,000 is not happening in a vacuum. Several powerful forces are converging to propel its value upwards. Firstly, institutional interest continues to grow at an unprecedented rate. Large financial institutions and corporations are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and an inflation hedge. Moreover, global macroeconomic factors play a crucial role. As traditional markets face uncertainties and inflation concerns persist, investors seek alternative assets. Bitcoin offers a decentralized and limited supply option, making it an attractive safe haven. This increased demand from both retail and institutional players contributes significantly to BTC’s upward momentum. Decoding the Market Dynamics Behind the Latest Bitcoin Price Surge Understanding the underlying market dynamics is key to appreciating why Bitcoin hits $109,000 . Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins, creates a powerful demand-side pressure. The periodic halving events, which reduce the reward for mining new blocks, further tighten supply, historically leading to price appreciation. Additionally, growing mainstream adoption is a critical factor. More businesses and payment processors are integrating Bitcoin, making it easier for everyday users to access and utilize. This expansion of its utility strengthens its value proposition. Positive market sentiment, often fueled by news of institutional adoption or technological advancements, also plays a pivotal role in driving prices higher. Implications for Investors: Navigating the Landscape as Bitcoin Hits $109,000 For current and prospective investors, the fact that Bitcoin hits $109,000 carries significant implications. On one hand, it validates the long-term potential of Bitcoin and can instill greater confidence in the asset class. Existing holders see their portfolios grow, while new investors might feel compelled to enter the market, fearing they might miss out on further gains. However, it is crucial to approach such price movements with a balanced perspective. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and price corrections can occur. Therefore, informed decision-making is paramount. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making any investment choices. Diversification remains a wise strategy. What Lies Ahead After Bitcoin Hits $109,000? Future Outlook As Bitcoin hits $109,000 , many eyes are on what the future holds. Experts offer various predictions, often pointing to continued growth driven by ongoing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ continues to gain traction, positioning it as a fundamental asset in a diversified portfolio. However, potential challenges like increased regulatory scrutiny, environmental concerns related to mining, and competition from other digital assets could influence its trajectory. Investors must remain vigilant, staying informed about market trends and global economic shifts. Responsible investing involves managing risks and understanding that past performance does not guarantee future results. In conclusion, the ascent of Bitcoin hits $109,000 is a testament to its enduring strength and growing influence in the global financial landscape. While the excitement is palpable, a strategic and informed approach remains essential for navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. This milestone underscores Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital experiment to a significant financial asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the recent Bitcoin price surge?

The move raised expectations that the Bank of Japan might soon need to boost interest rates, with the October 29 data suggesting that the cost pressures are persistent at the same time as world inflation calms down. The stronger number also drives a goal to pair the yen with increasing trader sentiment, suggesting that Japan’s decade of near-zero rates is almost over. According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, the cost of core exclusive fresh food increased by 2.8% in October compared to the same month in the previous year. The number was significantly higher than the 2.6% average forecast of experts and faster than the 2.5% increase in September. Prices that include both fresh food and energy, a measure the BOJ monitors to exclude commodity expense, increased 2.8%, the fastest since 2.4% in April. BOJ remains cautious, but pressure is mounting Tokyo’s main inflation has been at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for three and one-half years. Economists say the inflation in Tokyo, which is greater than projected, gives the Bank of Japan reason to consider another interest rate increase this year. Bloomberg Economics economist Taro Kimura said Tokyo’s unexpectedly strong inflation in October could prompt the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated. He noted that companies are increasing prices for household goods, and the end of the city’s water-bill waiver has further added to the inflationary pressure. It was in Tokyo in October when the main reason was the cessation of the city’s water charge waiver, which dramatically reduced prices in September. Without this relief, the value of the water increased rapidly, lifting the general index. The cost of semi-manufactured food and energy decreased in the meantime, indicating that inflation remains strong, not weak, driven by imported priorities. The yen continued to strengthen after the data was released. It was around ¥153.84 per US dollar, compared to ¥154.17 before the announcement as investors increased their bets on a rate hike by the BOJ. As Tokyo’s inflation figures are typically ahead of their nationwide counterpart, with this report to be published on November 19, some analysts predict that it will follow the same accelerating trend. Japan weighs inflation boost against wage boost. Thursday, the BOJ’s board chose to maintain the bank’s benchmark short-term rate after the report. Tokyo’s governor, Kazuo Ueda, mentioned that the Bank of Japan would continue to hold its current stance until quantifiable wage growth supports the inflation increase. Japan’s economy shows signs of resilience The current rise has no basis in reality, according to Ueda, as the bank’s official goal is a 2% annual inflation target. Inflation has been rising above the standard 2 percent for the majority of the year, but according to Ueda, the “trend underlying inflation hasn’t been robust”. The main problem was that while prices have been rising, businesses have been keeping wages moderate. Therefore, consumers are receiving less of a pay increase compared to the prices of goods. A majority of economists believe that the BOJ would consider making the hike next month, according to a Bloomberg survey. Masamichi Adachi, chief economist at UBS Securities Japan, said the latest Tokyo CPI data makes a December rate hike by the Bank of Japan more likely, as it shows that domestic inflation momentum remains strong. He added that the figures give the central bank greater confidence in the sustainability of price growth. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is introducing new measures to ease the cost-of-living burden on households. Her cabinet has decided to cut the gasoline tax, lower current electricity and gas prices to support citizens this winter, and provide larger grants to local governments that can aid them. Aside from inflation, other gauges of the Japanese economy were relatively consistent. Industrialization surged 2.2% month-to-month in September, up from the anticipated 1.5%, while retail sales rose 0.3% month-to-month and 0.5% annually – a clear indication of a strong consumer.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again demonstrated its incredible volatility and upward potential, soaring above the significant $110,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at approximately $110,013.27 on major exchanges like Binance USDT market. This monumental leap isn’t just a number; it signals a renewed surge of investor confidence and a potential shift in the broader digital asset landscape.

Understanding the forces behind this rally is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic crypto market. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Several key factors appear to be contributing to Bitcoin’s impressive climb. Market analysts point to a confluence of macroeconomic trends and increasing institutional interest as primary drivers. The global economic climate, characterized by inflation concerns and a search for alternative assets, often pushes investors towards Bitcoin. Institutional Adoption: More corporations and financial institutions are integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Halving Event Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving reduced the supply of new BTC, historically leading to upward price pressure as demand outstrips supply. Positive Market Sentiment: A general sense of optimism is permeating the crypto community, fueled by positive regulatory discussions and technological advancements within the blockchain space. Macroeconomic Factors: Geopolitical uncertainties and traditional market volatility make Bitcoin an attractive hedge for many investors seeking stability. These elements combined create a powerful upward momentum, propelling the Bitcoin price to new heights and capturing global attention. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Landscape? When Bitcoin experiences such a significant price movement, its effects ripple across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin’s dominance often dictates the overall market sentiment, influencing the performance of altcoins and other digital assets. A rising Bitcoin price typically acts as a catalyst for the altcoin market. Investors often reallocate profits from Bitcoin into promising altcoins, leading to an “altcoin season” where other cryptocurrencies also see substantial gains. This interconnectedness means that Bitcoin’s health is often a barometer for the entire crypto market’s vitality. Moreover, this rally enhances investor confidence across the board. It validates the long-term potential of digital assets for both seasoned traders and new entrants. This positive sentiment can attract more capital into the space, fostering innovation and further development within various blockchain projects. Navigating Volatility: Smart Moves for Your Bitcoin Investment While the current surge is exciting, the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Smart investors understand the importance of strategic planning and risk management. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Research: Always understand the fundamentals of your investments. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider a mix of assets. Set Clear Goals: Determine your entry and exit points based on your financial objectives. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the Bitcoin price , to mitigate risk over time. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and technological developments. Remember, the crypto market can be unpredictable. Making informed decisions and managing risk are paramount to long-term success. The recent ascent of the Bitcoin price above $110,000 marks a significant moment in the ongoing evolution of digital finance. It underscores Bitcoin’s resilience, its growing acceptance, and its undeniable role as a leading digital asset. While the path ahead may involve its characteristic ups and downs, this milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the transformative potential of cryptocurrency. Whether you are a seasoned investor or simply curious about the future of money, Bitcoin’s journey continues to be one of the most compelling stories in modern finance. As the market matures, its influence will only grow, solidifying its position as a cornerstone of the global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does the Bitcoin price surge mean for new investors? A1: A surge often indicates strong market sentiment and potential for further growth, but it also means increased volatility. New investors should research thoroughly and consider dollar-cost averaging. Q2: Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? A2: Many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, market entry timing is crucial. It’s important to invest based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Q3: What factors could cause the Bitcoin price to drop?

The round also saw participation from JinQiu Fund (a ByteDance-affiliated fund) and Baidu Ventures, signaling growing institutional confidence in AI-powered education technology. https://t.co/sxEk3EEqjo — YZi Labs (@yzilabs) October 30, 2025 Building the Future of Learning VideoTutor aims to redefine how students learn. The platform combines large language models (LLMs) with a Manim-based animation rendering engine, converting any question into a personalized animated lesson. Its system can explain complex problems visually and conversationally, producing step-by-step animated tutorials that adapt in real time to each learner’s pace and understanding. The company describes VideoTutor as an “educational AI agent”, not just a video generator but an interactive teaching assistant that turns questions into lessons on the spot. Currently, the platform has reached 20,000 global users and has received more than 1,000 API integration requests, a strong indicator of demand from developers and schools looking to embed AI tutoring into their systems. Kai Zhao: The 20-Year-Old Behind the Vision VideoTutor was founded by Kai Zhao, a 20-year-old serial AI entrepreneur based in Silicon Valley. Zhao’s vision is to make personalized education scalable, using AI to transform static video learning into a dynamic, interactive experience. From day one, he set out to “transform passive watching into interactive mastery,” merging AI reasoning with mathematical visualization tools to make complex subjects more intuitive. His approach reflects the new wave of AI-native educational tools, platforms designed from the ground up around machine learning, content generation, and real-time adaptability, not retrofitted onto older e-learning models. VideoTutor’s technology stack integrates a large language model (LLM) for contextual understanding and content generation with Manim, a mathematical animation framework used to visualize equations, geometry, and problem-solving steps. The result is a real-time teaching engine that creates short, animated lessons tailored to each user’s question. Instead of searching for pre-made videos, users can simply ask a question, and the system automatically builds a custom tutorial with both narration and animation. This system bridges a long-standing gap in online education: scalable personalization. YZi Labs Expands Into AI Software The $11 million investment marks YZi Labs’ first major move into the AI software space. Known primarily for its early-stage blockchain and fintech investments, the firm’s expansion into AI signals a broader strategic shift. “VideoTutor represents the intersection of education, creativity, and generative AI,” a spokesperson from YZi Labs said during the announcement. “Our goal is to back projects that use intelligent systems to empower human potential.” YZi Labs’ participation also strengthens the company’s positioning in AI-driven consumer applications, diversifying beyond crypto infrastructure into real-world software solutions. Education Meets Intelligent Design The partnership between YZi Labs and VideoTutor highlights a growing focus on AI education tools, systems that can scale personalized learning globally without sacrificing quality. VideoTutor’s platform doesn’t just answer questions; it teaches users how to think through them. By combining LLM-generated explanations with visual learning, it gives students a deeper understanding of complex material. In a demo, a simple algebra question transforms into a narrated visual animation, the AI breaks down each step, draws graphs, and explains the reasoning in plain language. This makes advanced learning instantly accessible, even for students without a tutor. From Seed Funding to Global Reach With the new $11 million in funding, VideoTutor plans to: Accelerate product development Expand its engineering and research teams Partner with schools and universities worldwide Enhance its AI models for deeper subject coverage According to Kai Zhao, the funding will also support the launch of interactive classroom integrations, allowing educators to use AI-generated visuals during live lessons. Excited to announce that @VideoTutor has raised an $11M Seed round led by @yzilabs , with support from @amino_capital and BV FUND、JinQiu Fund and others. From day one, we’ve set out to redefine how students learn with AI transforming passive watching into interactive mastery.… https://t.co/XCmlKAtsMJ — VideoTutor (@VideoTutor_io) October 30, 2025 Zhao said the company is “building the future of learning, one where AI transforms education from passive consumption to active, personalized discovery.” YZi Labs’ Broader Investment Activity YZi Labs has been making quiet but strategic moves across several verticals, including AI, crypto, and prediction markets. Earlier this quarter, it co-invested in Opinion Labs, a prediction market platform backed by Binance and Amber Group, which raised $5 million to expand its decentralized betting infrastructure. While the prediction market meta is still emerging, YZi Labs’ involvement shows its growing interest in hybrid AI-fintech models, areas where data, markets, and intelligence intersect. With VideoTutor, YZi Labs now adds a high-impact education technology investment to its portfolio, complementing its financial and blockchain interests with a long-term AI vision. The shift toward AI-driven learning tools marks a new phase in global education. Platforms like VideoTutor remove the limits of geography, cost, and time, providing on-demand, personalized lessons that can reach anyone with an internet connection. AI tutors are not replacing teachers; they’re amplifying them, enabling educators to serve larger groups with more precision and individualized attention. As LLMs become smarter and rendering systems like Manim evolve, the gap between human and AI instruction continues to close. VideoTutor’s system not only explains but also visualizes, turning theory into motion and making learning more memorable. YZi Labs’ Strategic Timing For YZi Labs, the timing couldn’t be better. The global appetite for AI-driven educational tools is exploding, with billions of students and professionals seeking flexible, digital learning formats. By investing early in VideoTutor, YZi Labs positions itself at the frontier of AI education, just as the market begins to mature. The move reflects the firm’s broader strategy, investing in next-generation infrastructure that brings real-world functionality to AI and Web3 ecosystems. This isn’t just about funding a startup; it’s about reshaping how learning happens. As VideoTutor continues to develop, its core focus remains clear, making high-quality, AI-powered learning accessible to everyone. The next stage includes deeper LLM integration, improved animation realism, and expanded subject coverage, from STEM to humanities. For YZi Labs, this investment could be the beginning of a larger move into AI consumer products, following the same pattern that once led it to early wins in Web3 ventures. The educational landscape is changing fast, and with players like VideoTutor, the future classroom might not have four walls at all. YZi Labs’ $11 million seed investment in VideoTutor marks a pivotal moment for both companies. For VideoTutor, it’s the capital and credibility needed to scale globally. For YZi Labs, it’s a milestone, the firm’s first step into AI software, expanding its reach beyond crypto and finance into intelligent learning systems. A 20-year-old founder, a breakthrough educational AI product, and a seasoned tech investor, together, they’re building what could become the next frontier of education technology.

The exploit, which occurred across multiple chains, has forced the project to temporarily halt operations and sparked renewed concerns about vulnerabilities in cross-chain protocols. Garden Finance was likely exploited for $10.8M+ on multiple chains. An address related to the team sent a message onchain to the alleged exploiter offering a 10% whitehat bounty but has yet to comment publicly on the incident. All freezeable assets were quickly swapped. Theft… pic.twitter.com/A4il25YiLn — Vladimir S. | Officer's Notes (@officer_cia) October 30, 2025 The Garden Finance Breach and What Happened On-chain data shows that Garden Finance was likely exploited for more than $10.8 million, affecting wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and other cross-chain assets. The attack targeted a weakness in the project’s liquidity pools or swap mechanism, allowing the exploiter to drain funds before the team could respond. Within hours of detecting the anomaly, Garden Finance’s developers sent an on-chain message to the hacker, offering a 10% white-hat bounty in exchange for returning the funds. However, there has been no public comment from the team since that offer. The known theft address has been identified as: `0x98BCc6c34A489CEfdD9DfA8d792CFEFb02Ea2D12` and another address tied to the case on non-EVM networks: `WZy4xxpqktWa1b6MPMRiWsD487CT8mDcapB6GufBJCH`. Cross-chain bridges are the single most exploited category in blockchain by tvs (total value stolen), and the data is not even close $3.82B (about 58% of all defi losses) Garden finance ( @gardenfi ) might be joining this stack today with about $5.5M in exploited assets mostly… pic.twitter.com/co8TB2Qncp — Brown (@Brown_ux) October 30, 2025 Immediate Aftermath Shortly after the breach, all freezeable assets were quickly swapped, a typical move by attackers to make stolen funds untraceable. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that about 25% of Garden Finance’s total fund movements were already tied to previously stolen assets, including incidents connected to Bybit and Swissborg. The irony wasn’t lost on the community. Just days before the exploit, ZachXBT had criticized Garden Finance on X (formerly Twitter) for ignoring victims’ requests to return fees from transactions involving stolen funds. “More than 25% of Garden Finance’s activity is related to stolen assets,” ZachXBT wrote, pointing to the project’s repeated association with compromised wallets. The Official Response Following community outcry, Garden Finance’s official X account acknowledged the situation, saying a “compromise involving one of Garden’s solvers” was detected. The platform was temporarily taken offline as investigations began. “The impact is limited to the solver’s own inventory, user funds and the Garden protocol are not at risk,” the team stated. “We’ll share updates as soon as we have more information.” That claim, however, has been met with skepticism. Analysts argue that the movement of funds and the scale of the losses suggest the compromise went beyond internal inventory. we’ve detected a compromise involving one of garden’s solvers. the app is temporarily offline while we complete a full investigation. the impact is limited to the solver’s own inventory — user funds and garden protocol are not at risk. we’ll share updates as soon as we have… — Garden (@gardenfi) October 30, 2025 Cross-Chain Bridges: DeFi’s Weakest Link Garden Finance’s troubles highlight a long-running issue in decentralized finance, the fragility of cross-chain bridges. Bridges account for about $3.82 billion, or 58% of all DeFi losses recorded to date. Bridges are inherently risky. They often rely on custodial mechanisms like multi-signature wallets or validator sets, creating single points of failure. When these fail, funds across entire ecosystems can be drained. For Bitcoin-based DeFi, the risk compounds due to finality mismatches between Bitcoin and EVM chains, sometimes introducing double-spend vectors. “Zero-Custody” Marketing Meets Real-World Bugs Garden Finance had branded itself as a “zero-custody, atomic-swap protocol”, a system designed to eliminate trust assumptions between chains. But as the latest exploit shows, even so-called “trustless” systems can fall apart if a single bug in the swap logic exists. The project’s promise of atomic security couldn’t hold up under a real-world attack vector. As of now, the root cause remains under investigation, but experts suggest it likely stems from a vulnerability in the swap contracts used for cross-chain transactions. This incident arrives at a time when the DeFi community is still grappling with the aftermath of multiple bridge hacks, from Multichain’s $126M exploit to Nomad’s $190M breach. Each new incident underscores a painful truth: cross-chain interoperability still comes at a heavy cost. With protocols pushing to connect ecosystems faster than they can secure them, the same patterns repeat, overconfidence, insufficient audits, and complex trust assumptions. The project’s immediate move to contact the attacker with a 10% white-hat offer mirrors recent approaches from teams like Curve and Euler Finance, both of which later recovered part of their funds. Whether Garden Finance can do the same remains uncertain. For now, users have been advised to avoid interacting with the protocol until an official post-mortem report is released. As investigations continue, the situation serves as yet another reminder that even “trustless” systems still require trust, in their code, in their audits, and in their teams.

As reported by LookOnChain, Vitalik just sold a massive 2.75 trillion CAT tokens, worth 14,216 USDC, from his wallet. The tokens were part of a free airdrop he received just days ago. On October 30th, blockchain sleuths spotted the move: 2% of the total $CAT supply, gone in a single transaction. The sell came shortly after CatCoin’s official X account proudly announced they had sent 2% of the entire supply (275 trillion CAT) to vitalik.eth. The community cheered. The memes flowed. The dream of “Vitalik’s cat season” began. Then Vitalik sold it. And just like that, the hype train screeched to a halt. vitalik.eth( @VitalikButerin ) is selling off the memecoins he received for free again, cashing out 14,216 $USDC . https://t.co/pMvkZHjIyD pic.twitter.com/VzWpLV4Ily — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 30, 2025 The CAT Hype That Went Purrfectly Wrong Just three days before the sale, CatCoin’s team had tweeted with excitement: “We’ve just sent 2% of the total supply (275,000,000,000,000 $CAT) to vitalik.eth , Now it’s in @VitalikButerin’s hands to make CATCOIN the next 100x memecoin on Ethereum and lead the new meme era.” We’ve just sent 2% of the total supply (275,000,000,000,000 $CAT ) to vitalik.eth Now it’s in @VitalikButerin ’s hands to make #CATCOIN the next 100x #memecoin on #Ethereum and lead the new meme era. Tag @VitalikButerin let him know. He loves cats pic.twitter.com/Jgc2uvLonl — CATCOIN (ETH) (@catethz) October 27, 2025 For a moment, the plan looked flawless. The team leveraged Vitalik’s wallet as a marketing catalyst, and it worked. The CAT chart spiked. Liquidity surged. Traders rushed in hoping Vitalik’s wallet would be the ultimate stamp of legitimacy. But Vitalik, true to his track record, didn’t play along. He sold. And that one move became the headline across crypto Twitter. Vitalik’s Meme Coin Routine This isn’t the first time Vitalik has been sent “free” tokens, or sold them. Back in 2021, during the height of the meme coin boom, he famously received billions in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and other meme tokens as “gifts.” Instead of keeping them, he donated large chunks to charity or burned them completely. It was his polite way of saying: “Stop doing this.” So when CatCoin dropped tokens into his wallet again, most seasoned traders knew what was coming. Still, it didn’t stop the frenzy. The idea of “Vitalik’s cat” quickly became a meme of its own, a new flavor in the never-ending rotation of crypto animal coins. But the Ethereum founder doesn’t play meme politics. This latest sale only reaffirms that stance: Vitalik won’t endorse unsolicited tokens. Whether it’s a strategic move or just cleaning house, it’s a reminder that even the biggest names aren’t immune to meme coin fatigue. $CAT Community Reels Within hours of the sale, CatCoin’s market cap plunged. Trading volume dropped sharply as short-term traders exited. It’s a sharp reversal from the bullish spike just days earlier, when traders speculated the Vitalik tag would push the token into top-tier meme status. The community’s response has been mixed. Some took it lightly, joking that “Vitalik just declawed CatCoin.” Others expressed frustration, claiming that the project should never have airdropped that much supply to one wallet, especially his. CatCoin’s Response: Grace Under Pressure To their credit, the CatCoin team handled the moment with positivity. Hours after the transaction was spotted, they tweeted again: “Thank you @VitalikButerin for accepting our donation around National Cat Day We truly appreciate it and hope to have your support in making CatCoin the next big memecoin on the Ethereum chain! $CAT needs your support.” Thank you @VitalikButerin for accepting our donation around National Cat Day We truly appreciate it and hope to have your support in making #CatCoin the next big memecoin on the Ethereum chain! $CAT need your support — CATCOIN (ETH) (@catethz) October 30, 2025 The tone was diplomatic. No drama. Just optimism. Still, most observers agree, the sell signaled the end of the short-lived hype cycle. For a project that relied heavily on meme momentum, this was a reality check. The Meme Coin Dilemma Vitalik’s move once again highlights an ongoing dilemma in crypto: the “airdrop for attention” strategy. Projects often send tokens to high-profile wallets, from Elon Musk to Vitalik, hoping for exposure or validation. It’s free marketing, until it backfires. The problem? Most of these recipients never asked for the tokens and rarely support the projects. For developers, it’s a gamble. For traders, it’s a trap. Meme coins thrive on narrative, but when that narrative collapses, liquidity follows. Vitalik’s Message to the Market By selling, Vitalik didn’t just offload a few meme coins, he sent a message. A reminder that not every token drop is worth holding. A reminder that Ethereum’s founder cares more about utility than virality. He’s not the meme king. He’s the builder. And his wallet, though often used for marketing stunts, remains a symbol of crypto’s transparency, where every move is public, and every transaction tells a story. “Vitalik doesn’t dump projects. He dumps expectations,” one user wrote. That sentiment captures it perfectly. A Cat That Landed on Its Feet? Despite the setback, CatCoin still holds a lively community. The project continues to push its “meme utility” narrative, with plans for NFT collections, community staking, and cross-chain bridges. It’s not the end. Just a rough chapter. Crypto thrives on comeback stories, and if CatCoin can channel the attention into innovation, it may still find its place among the meme elite, alongside Doge, Pepe, and Bonk. But for now, the Vitalik episode will remain a cautionary tale for meme projects everywhere. Vitalik’s $14,216 USDC sale isn’t about the money, it’s about the message. Six years ago, people sent him tokens as a marketing stunt. Today, it still happens. And each time, he reminds the market that influence can’t be bought. The CatCoin saga might have been short-lived, but it perfectly captures the energy, and the chaos, of the memecoin era. A market built on jokes, driven by hype, and humbled by reality. And if there’s one takeaway from this latest twist? Even in crypto, curiosity may kill the cat, but transparency always wins. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The value of his holdings now stands at $118.4 billion, down sharply with Bitcoin’s latest pullback. But even with the drop, Satoshi remains wealthier than Mukesh Ambani, Michael Bloomberg, and Bill Gates. That’s right, the anonymous founder of Bitcoin, who hasn’t moved a single coin in over a decade, is still among the world’s richest individuals. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC trades around $107,220, down 4% in 24 hours . The market may be shaky, but the legacy of Bitcoin’s creator is still intact. Sixteen Years Since the Whitepaper That Changed the World Tomorrow marks 16 years since October 31, 2008, the day Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper, a nine-page PDF that changed global finance forever. Back then, Bitcoin was an idea. Today, it’s a multi-trillion-dollar asset class, shaping economies, challenging governments, and inspiring thousands of digital currencies. In just 16 years, Bitcoin has gone from zero to one of the most recognized and traded assets on Earth. It has outperformed every traditional investment over the past decade, and it’s not even close. “What began as an experiment in decentralized money became the blueprint for an entirely new economy.” That legacy alone keeps Satoshi’s name relevant every time Bitcoin makes a move, up or down. Bitcoin Quiet, Stablecoins Loud Here’s the strange part: while Bitcoin remains the face of crypto, its on-chain activity has almost vanished. Data shows that the number of BTC withdrawals from exchanges has remained flat since October 2024. That’s a full year of near-zero movement in long-term holdings. For the first time in a major market cycle, Bitcoin’s on-chain engagement is at record lows. Investors aren’t moving coins. They’re leaving them parked on exchanges or trading within centralized platforms, a shift that signals a new kind of market behavior. When you compare Bitcoin’s on-chain activity to that of stablecoins, the contrast is massive: Bitcoin’s on-chain volume: at the lowest level ever recorded. Stablecoin volume: hitting new record highs every day. In short, Bitcoin’s blockchain is quiet. Stablecoins are screaming liquidity. Interesting to observe: the number of BTC withdrawals from exchanges has remained almost unchanged since October 2024. And that brings an important reflection. For the first time in a market cycle, we’re seeing low on-chain engagement for Bitcoin. Data suggests that many… pic.twitter.com/1ms4mEnAnv — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) October 30, 2025 What This Means for Bitcoin The stagnation in Bitcoin’s on-chain volume isn’t necessarily bearish, but it does raise questions. Historically, heavy on-chain activity meant either accumulation or panic. But today, the market feels more institutional. The coins are sitting still while stablecoins do the heavy lifting of liquidity and transaction flow. It’s a sign that investors are comfortable holding BTC as a store of value while using USDT, USDC, and DAI for everything else, trading, yield, and payments. In other words: Bitcoin has officially become the gold standard of crypto, while stablecoins are the cash moving through the pipes. The Satoshi Paradox Satoshi’s net worth may swing by billions daily, but the irony is, he can’t, or won’t, spend a single cent. The original 1.1 million BTC mined by Satoshi between 2009 and 2010 have never been moved. They sit frozen, untouched, in early blockchain addresses known to analysts but inaccessible to anyone else. If those coins ever moved, it would trigger one of the largest market reactions in crypto history. SATOSHI NAKAMOTO IS DOWN ALMOST $5 BILLION IN THE PAST 24 HOURS The value of Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings is down $4.9 Billion in the past day, to a total of $118.4 Billion. He is still wealthier than Mukesh Ambani, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Gates. pic.twitter.com/GcNrBYWGzy — Arkham (@arkham) October 30, 2025 That silence remains one of Bitcoin’s most powerful features, an unshakable belief that value can exist beyond identity. Where the Smart Money Is Looking The slowdown in Bitcoin’s on-chain metrics doesn’t mean apathy, it’s adaptation. Institutional players are focusing on Layer 2s, stablecoin ecosystems, and tokenized treasuries instead of direct BTC transactions. This shift represents maturity: Bitcoin as the foundation, stablecoins as the transaction layer, and DeFi as the engine. The market is no longer defined by speculation alone, it’s defined by infrastructure. Meanwhile, retail investors remain cautious. After a brutal “Rektober” that saw $25 billion in longs liquidated, traders are wary of chasing volatility. Many now see Bitcoin sub-$110K as an accumulation zone rather than a panic level. 16 Years Later, the Vision Holds It’s almost poetic that as Satoshi’s wealth fluctuates wildly, the Bitcoin idea he created remains stable in purpose. Bitcoin has survived wars, bans, forks, and crashes, yet it still leads every market cycle. In 16 years, the world has gone from mocking digital money to regulating it, taxing it, and building empires on top of it. From El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds to BlackRock’s BTC ETF, the vision has become reality. The world runs on Satoshi’s code, whether Wall Street admits it or not. So, what’s next for Bitcoin? If stablecoins are the heartbeat of liquidity and Bitcoin the store of value, then the next evolution will connect the two seamlessly. Networks like Lightning, Stacks, and BitVM are already building bridges to make Bitcoin more usable again, without compromising its decentralized purity. The quiet chain doesn’t mean a dying one. It means a patient one. Bitcoin is resting while the rest of the market experiments. It’s the anchor in a sea of volatility, and Satoshi’s unmoved coins remain its silent testament. Satoshi Nakamoto may be “down” $5 billion on paper, but in truth, he’s never looked richer. He built a system that outlived governments, rewired global finance, and gave birth to the largest decentralized movement in history. Sixteen years later, Bitcoin is more than a currency. It’s a language of value, one spoken in hashes, mined in blocks, and secured by believers. So while Satoshi’s wallet sits untouched and his wealth fluctuates, his influence remains untouchable. Bitcoin still belongs to no one, and that’s why it belongs to everyone. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Instead, it turned into Rektober. Over $25 billion worth of long positions have been liquidated across crypto markets this month, one of the heaviest waves of forced selling in 2025. This is insane. $25,000,000,000 in long positions has been liquidated this month. Uptober has turned into Rektober. — Ted (@TedPillows) October 30, 2025 In the past 24 hours alone, data from CoinGlass shows 218,829 traders got wiped out, with $1.11 billion in total liquidations. Bitcoin and Ethereum led the bloodbath, followed by Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. The mood? Pure chaos. Bitcoin Slips Below $110K as ETFs Trigger Outflows The correction didn’t come out of nowhere. Bitcoin ETFs saw $470 million in outflows following the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent rate cut, the largest drawdown in two weeks. ETF investors, usually the calmest in the room, are quietly trimming exposure after months of inflows. Here’s how the outflows stacked up: Fidelity: –$164M ARK Invest: –$143M BlackRock: –$88M Grayscale: –$65M Despite the outflows, ETFs still collectively hold 1.5 million BTC, about 7.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. But the tone in institutional circles is shifting. Some traders call it a “controlled exit wave”, a rotation into cash or short-term bonds while waiting for volatility to settle. BLACKROCK JUST MOVED $87M IN BITCOIN BlackRock’s $IBIT ETF transferred 794 BTC ($87.4M) to Coinbase, plus 48 $ETH ($188K).

BlackRock Moves $87M in Bitcoin to Coinbase Then came the BlackRock move. On-chain data flagged a transfer of 794 BTC (worth $87.4 million) and 48 ETH ($188K) from BlackRock’s IBIT ETF wallet to Coinbase on Wednesday. At first glance, it could just be routine ETF settlement. But it’s happening right as volatility spikes, and traders are watching closely. Whenever BlackRock moves coins to an exchange, it sends a signal. Whether it’s to rebalance holdings, settle redemptions, or prepare for liquidity events, markets read it as a potential shift in sentiment. Some analysts see it as early de-risking ahead of month-end. Others call it “business as usual” for ETF accounting. But either way, it has people talking. Bitcoin ETFs saw $470M in outflows after the Fed’s rate cut – the biggest in two weeks. $BTC slipped below $110K as institutions trimmed exposure: • Fidelity: -$164M • ARK Invest: -$143M • BlackRock: -$88M • Grayscale: -$65M ETFs still hold 1.5M BTC (~7.3% of total supply),… pic.twitter.com/cVm5atIMke — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) October 30, 2025 Institutions Hit Pause After Fed Rate Cut The Federal Reserve’s latest 0.25% rate cut was supposed to be bullish for risk assets. But instead of triggering another leg up, it seems to have caused a profit-taking cascade. Funds that were overweight Bitcoin and Ethereum started locking in gains after a 20% rally earlier this month. “The cut wasn’t a green light, it was a signal to rebalance,” said one macro trader on X. Add to that concerns over U.S. election uncertainty and quarter-end portfolio shuffling, and you get a perfect setup for liquidation pressure. For context, October’s total liquidation figure, $25 billion, is the largest since June 2022’s post-Terra crash cycle. SpaceX Joins the Action, Quietly While Wall Street was unloading, SpaceX was quietly reorganizing its crypto reserves. According to Lookonchain, Elon Musk’s aerospace company transferred 281 BTC (worth $31.28 million) to a new wallet: bc1qmg6ajfshpqe5gsp332ehqjju4ecrl9xcrqrmh2 But that’s not all. Over the past 10 days, SpaceX has moved Bitcoin three separate times, suggesting a broader internal restructuring or custody optimization. What’s interesting is the pattern, each transfer routes to new, clean wallets, often used for institutional-grade cold storage. No official statement from SpaceX yet, but analysts are speculating it could be tied to custody migration or audit preparation ahead of quarterly reporting. SpaceX( @SpaceX ) just transferred another 281 $BTC ($31.28M) to a new wallet — likely for custody purposes. In the past 10 days, #SpaceX has moved their BTC holdings three times. https://t.co/zW62EKM2RD pic.twitter.com/XstZgyryOA — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 30, 2025 Market Sentiment Swings Funding rates on perpetual futures flipped negative across major exchanges, with long traders paying shorts, a sign of fading bullish momentum. Altcoins took the biggest hit: SOL: down 7.4% AVAX: down 9.1% DOGE: down 6.8% PEPE: down 11.2% Ethereum fell 7% to $3,700 Analysts Split on What’s Next Opinions are divided. Some see this as healthy correction territory, not a full trend reversal. Long-term holders, particularly whale wallets, haven’t significantly reduced their positions. On-chain data still shows net accumulation among large holders despite ETF redemptions. That suggests institutions are adjusting exposure, not abandoning the market. Others warn the worst may not be over. With U.S. GDP data and corporate earnings due next week, volatility could spike again if macro indicators disappoint. A Turning Point for Uptober Just two weeks ago, the narrative was simple: Bitcoin ETFs were surging, retail sentiment was high, and Uptober memes flooded X. Now? Uptober has officially turned into Rektober. But if history is any guide, these shakeouts often mark the mid-cycle reset before the next move higher. Bitcoin is still up 14% year-to-date, and the number of active addresses continues to rise, both signs that the bull structure remains intact. From BlackRock’s quiet transfers to SpaceX’s hidden wallet moves, the message is clear: institutional players are watching, adjusting, and staying nimble. Crypto markets are evolving, faster, sharper, and more sensitive to macro shifts than ever before. Whether this month’s chaos ends in a rebound or another correction, one truth stands: the game has changed. Bitcoin is no longer just retail-driven. It’s macro money now, and when giants move, markets follow. For now, Rektober lives up to its name. But as every crypto veteran knows, pain today often fuels the next rally. Brace for Novembull.

The bank predicts that the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will reach $2 trillion by 2028. According to Standard Chartered Bank analysis, the growth towards $2T by RWAs will be fueled by a self-reinforcing cycle of liquidity and innovation sparked by the 2025 stablecoin performance. Stablecoins have pushed blockchain-based finance beyond the crypto niche and into the broader financial ecosystem. Standard Chartered Bank highlights that MMFs and equities could bring $750 billion each According to Standard Chartered estimates, non-stablecoin tokenized assets are projected to grow from the current $35 billion to $2 trillion by 2028, matching the expected size of the stablecoin market. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered Bank, noted that DeFi eliminates the need for a central authority and operates on the principles of transparency, accessibility, and code-based trust. He added that the DeFi ecosystem is emerging as a credible challenge to established traditional financial structures. 🚨 NEW: STANDARD CHARTERED SEES $2T IN TOKENIZED RWA MARKET BY 2028 The bank says this would match stablecoins as DeFi enters a self-sustaining growth phase. pic.twitter.com/ShylCXlexC — Kyle Chassé / DD🐸 (@kyle_chasse) October 30, 2025 The report highlighted that money-market funds and listed equities could each account for approximately $750 billion of the total. ETF funds, private equity, commodities, corporate debt, and real estate will contribute the rest. The report further highlighted how stablecoins have evolved to become a core payment infrastructure. Stablecoin adoption has driven on-chain liquidity, supporting lending, borrowing, and digital payments, initially dominated by banks. The stablecoin market cap currently stands at roughly $308 billion, led by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Based on on-chain data , Tether USDT has a market cap of $183.39 billion, followed by USDC at $75.82 billion. Other emerging stablecoins are Ethena USDe, with roughly $9 billion, Sky Dollar USDS, with approximately $5 billion, and DAI, with $4.8 billion. Kendrick noted that the growth in stablecoin use in 2025 has helped push the maturity of the DeFi ecosystem. He added that it enabled non-banking entities to handle payments and savings products, while creating liquidity that helps in lending and investments across the blockchain. He described that the liquidity created a flywheel effect, resulting in new products that attract more liquidity and make DeFi more competitive with traditional financial systems. Standard Chartered believes regulatory uncertainty thwarts growth The bank, however, warned that U.S. regulatory uncertainty poses a risk factor, noting that if regulators fail to deliver clear digital asset rules before the 2026 midterm elections, market momentum could slow. The study by the lender highlighted the regulatory frameworks already in place in Europe, the UK, and Singapore, noting that they are more advanced and supportive of tokenization. For instance, the European Union members have adopted the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation MiCA licensing, which regulates crypto-related activities across the bloc. According to a July report , nearly 40 crypto asset providers had already obtained the license. The regulation was applied first to CASPs in June 2024, replacing the by-country law, forming a unified approach to crypto regulation across the bloc. The license enables crypto firms to operate legally across the European Economic Area. Singapore, so far, is the leading region in terms of people adopting cryptocurrencies, as well as having clear regulations surrounding crypto assets. Cryptopolitan recently reported that the country achieved a composite score of 100, driven by crypto adoption and public interest. The report also revealed that roughly 24% of Singapore’s population holds crypto assets, which is more than double the 11% adoption rate last year, due to clear regulations supporting the industry. Standard Chartered projects that the line between DeFi on-chain finance and traditional markets will shrink faster as DeFi platforms continue to tokenize real-world assets, such as corporate bonds and real estate. The bank believes that the convergence of the two markets may reshape the global finance industry, currently valued at around $100 trillion, by integrating programmable money, automated lending, and 24/7 settlement.

The world of cryptocurrency investment and traditional stock markets often sees dramatic shifts, but few stories are as stark as the recent performance of KindlyMD stock . Investors are reeling from a shocking 98% plunge in the Nasdaq-listed firm’s stock price since May. This significant downturn has left many wondering about the future of a company that, interestingly, also holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin. What Caused the Dramatic Drop in KindlyMD Stock? The precipitous fall of KindlyMD stock didn’t happen in a vacuum. Cointelegraph reported that the decline was primarily triggered by a massive investor sell-off. This exodus occurred shortly after the company completed a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, raising an astonishing $563 million. PIPE Deal Impact: A PIPE typically involves institutional investors buying shares directly from a public company, often at a discount. While it injects capital, existing shareholders sometimes view it negatively, fearing dilution or perceiving it as a sign of financial distress. Investor Reaction: In KindlyMD’s case, the market reacted strongly, leading to widespread selling pressure that decimated the stock’s value. The sheer scale of the sell-off underscores a significant lack of confidence among investors following the announcement. Understanding the dynamics of such a significant financial event is crucial for anyone tracking the intersection of biotech and crypto investments. KindlyMD’s Bitcoin Holdings: A Silver Lining or Added Complexity for NAKA Stock? Amidst the turmoil surrounding KindlyMD stock , it’s essential to consider the company’s unique position as a firm that actively acquires Bitcoin. KindlyMD’s merger with Bitcoin investment firm Nakamoto Holdings was a pivotal moment, aligning its future with the volatile cryptocurrency market. Currently, KindlyMD boasts an impressive treasury of 5,765 BTC. At recent valuations, these holdings are worth approximately $653 million. This substantial Bitcoin stash raises an intriguing question: Could KindlyMD’s significant Bitcoin portfolio eventually stabilize or even boost its stock? While holding Bitcoin offers potential for future appreciation, it also introduces additional market volatility. The value of these holdings fluctuates daily with the broader crypto market, adding another layer of risk for investors in KindlyMD stock . Navigating Market Volatility: Lessons from KindlyMD’s Journey The journey of KindlyMD stock offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities at the crossroads of traditional finance and the digital asset world. The company’s recent performance highlights how even significant capital raises and substantial crypto holdings do not guarantee stability in a dynamic market. For investors, this situation underscores several key considerations: Due Diligence: Thoroughly research a company’s financial strategies, especially when mergers and large private placements are involved. Market Sentiment: Be aware that market reactions to financial events can sometimes outweigh a company’s underlying asset value in the short term. Diversification: Relying heavily on a single asset class, whether traditional stock or cryptocurrency, can expose portfolios to greater risk. KindlyMD’s stock closed at $0.85 on Thursday, a stark reminder of its peak value just months prior. This figure reflects the harsh reality of investor sentiment and market forces at play. What’s Next for KindlyMD Stock and Its Future? The path forward for KindlyMD stock appears challenging, but not without potential. The company’s significant Bitcoin reserves could, under different market conditions, become a strong asset. However, rebuilding investor confidence will be paramount. Key areas to watch include: Operational Performance: How will KindlyMD leverage the PIPE funds for its core business operations? Bitcoin Strategy: Will the company adjust its Bitcoin acquisition or holding strategy in response to market pressures? Investor Relations: What steps will KindlyMD take to communicate its long-term vision and reassure shareholders? Ultimately, the recovery of KindlyMD stock will depend on a combination of strategic execution, favorable market conditions for both its core business and Bitcoin, and a renewed trust from the investment community. The dramatic fall of KindlyMD’s stock serves as a powerful case study in the unpredictable nature of today’s markets, particularly for companies bridging the gap between traditional equity and the burgeoning world of digital assets. While the company holds significant Bitcoin, the immediate investor reaction to its PIPE deal highlights the complex interplay of financial mechanisms and market psychology. Moving forward, all eyes will be on KindlyMD as it navigates these turbulent waters. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What caused the 98% plunge in KindlyMD stock? A: The significant decline was primarily due to a massive investor sell-off following a recent $563 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, as reported by Cointelegraph. Q2: How much Bitcoin does KindlyMD currently hold? A: KindlyMD currently holds 5,765 BTC, which was valued at approximately $653 million at the time of the report. Q3: What is a PIPE deal and why did it affect KindlyMD stock? A: A PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) involves institutional investors buying shares directly from a public company. While it raises capital, existing shareholders sometimes react negatively, fearing dilution or perceiving it as a sign of underlying issues, leading to sell-offs. Q4: Does KindlyMD’s Bitcoin holdings affect its stock price? A: Yes, while the Bitcoin holdings offer potential for appreciation, they also introduce additional volatility to the company’s valuation, as the value of BTC fluctuates with the broader crypto market. Q5: What is Nakamoto Holdings? A: Nakamoto Holdings is a Bitcoin investment firm that merged with KindlyMD, aligning KindlyMD’s strategy with Bitcoin acquisition and investment.

Trading in the $2.50–$2.70 range, XRP may be in the early stages of a new upward leg driven by ETFs, treasury-flows, and structural technical setups. Related Reading: Bitcoin Technical Setup Shows Short-Term Pullback May Fuel Long-Term Upside Institutional Flows & Treasury Vehicles Spark Bullish Outlook XRP’s resurgence is supported by a sharp uptick in institutional interest. A recently launched XRP-exposure vehicle has already pulled in over $115 million in assets, while trading volumes in related futures markets have soared into the billions. This trend echoes the supply-constraint thesis that many analysts believe will fuel the next leg higher. Beyond ETF vehicles, corporate treasuries and dedicated acquisition firms are lining up behind XRP. One example is a firm planning to raise over $1 billion for a publicly-traded entity focused exclusively on XRP accumulation via its balance sheet. With such large-scale buying set to lock up supply, scarcity dynamics could increasingly favor the bulls. This institutional tailwind now places XRP in the same narrative once reserved for Bitcoin and Ethereum, but with XRP rapidly capturing mainstream investor interest. XRP Chart-Setup Resembles 2017 Bull Cycle, Targeting Double-Digits Technically, XRP’s current structure has drawn comparisons to its 2017 run. Analysts tracking Elliott Wave counts suggest XRP may be in the early phase of Wave 3, a phase that historically triggers major price moves. Under one scenario, this could propel the token from its current $2.56 level into double-digit territory. Support near the $2.50–$2.60 band remains intact, underpinning the bullish case. If XRP can break and hold above nearby resistance (circa $2.67–$2.70), momentum could accelerate. XRP's price records some losses on the daily chart. Source: XRPUSD chart on Tradingview That said, caution flags remain. Divergence between price and momentum indicators and elevated selling pressure from large holders suggest that short-term pull-backs are possible unless volume picks up decisively. Nevertheless, with the institutional backdrop strengthening and a classic bullish base forming, XRP appears positioned to follow its 2017 ‘re-accumulation to breakout’ script, potentially setting up a move toward $10, $20, or beyond, should all variables align. The Road Ahead: Key Levels & Watch-points Market watchers will be keeping close tabs on two key levels. On the upside, a sustained breakout above $2.70 could open a path to $3 and perhaps much higher if institutional flows accelerate. On the downside, a breakdown below $2.50 might signal delay and consolidation. Meanwhile, headlines around ETF approvals, corporate treasury buys, and real-world asset activity on the XRP Ledger will likely set the tone for the next major leg.

53845648,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88096,1761876010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Kaspa and ZCash’s Charts Draw Eyes, But BlockDAG’s  Coinbase–Kraken Leak Has Everyone Talking!",https://timestabloid.com/kaspa-and-zcashs-charts-draw-eyes-but-blockdags-coinbase/,"The Kaspa (KAS) price chart has shown sharp moves this week, swinging between $0.05 and $0.06 as traders search for balance after a recent drop. At the same time, the ZCash (ZEC) price performance has shocked many after rising from under $140 to almost $280 in a few days. This sudden spike has doubled attention toward privacy-focused coins. Both charts reveal a familiar pattern: funds are rotating fast, and the search for the next big opportunity for investing in crypto is heating up. So, where does this energy move next? Often, when large platforms quietly prepare for something new, it’s a sign that major change is on the way. That’s when BlockDAG (BDAG) caught the spotlight. The post that set the market talking came from That Martini Guy, hinting that @blockdagnetwork might be getting ready for listings on Coinbase and Kraken. BlockDAG: The Leak That Is Drawing Global Attention! It began with a single tweet and turned into global chatter. That Martini Guy ’s mention of possible Coinbase and Kraken listings made every crypto feed light up, and BlockDAG quickly became the most discussed project online. This wasn’t a baseless rumor. Verified reports and early-stage documents show that real talks could be taking place behind closed doors. The timing couldn’t be more perfect. BlockDAG’s presale just soared past nearly $435M, gaining more than 312,000 holders. Many now see this as more than market gossip; it feels like an early sign of something real. If these exchange discussions turn into reality, BlockDAG could shift from a presale story to one with a strong institutional presence almost overnight. Sources mention that liquidity support, trading partnerships, and marketing plans already fit Coinbase and Kraken’s typical listing models. This alignment is what’s driving the buzz that BDAG could be the best option for investing in crypto right now, as it moves from early growth to global trust. Its structure only adds strength to that claim. With Batch 32 priced at $0.005 and a confirmed $0.05 listing set for February 10, 2026, the built-in growth potential is huge. Combine that with its hybrid PoW-DAG framework, 20K+ miners already distributed, and mounting exchange talk, and it’s easy to see why many call BlockDAG the next big step in investing in crypto before headlines confirm what insiders already sense. ZCash (ZEC) Price Performance Signals Comeback ZCash (ZEC) has been one of this month’s biggest stories. In only a few weeks, its price shot from nearly $130 to close to $280, more than doubling in value. This comeback followed major updates that boosted transaction speed and cut network fees by almost 97%. The quick recovery pushed ZEC back into the spotlight, outpacing several large-cap coins and drawing new attention on exchanges. For a project that had stayed quiet for months, this rebound proved that privacy-driven assets can still make huge moves when the fundamentals and momentum align. Analysts say this surge also follows clear chart signals, like a “golden cross” on major timeframes and shrinking short-term supply on trading platforms. With global talks rising around privacy rights and data safety, ZEC’s next key resistance at $300 could decide its next direction. Whether it keeps climbing or pauses, this run has already shifted the market’s outlook, turning ZCash into one of 2025’s strongest recovery plays. Kaspa (KAS) Price Chart Shows Strength Around $0.05 Kaspa’s (KAS) chart continues to show tight movement between $0.05 and $0.06 after sliding from around $0.064 earlier in October. This pattern signals consolidation, with traders waiting for the next clear move. The $0.050 support has held firm through several tests, suggesting that buying pressure remains even with smaller trading volume. Experts view this level as the key to sustaining interest, especially after last week’s pullback from recent highs. Resistance sits near $0.060–$0.065, where selling pressure tends to appear each time the price tests higher. Models show that if Kaspa stays above the current support, a short rebound could push it beyond $0.06 again. If it slips, the next support could form around $0.042. Technical indicators like RSI and MACD show neutral energy for now. Still, Kaspa’s fast DAG-based structure keeps it appealing to analysts. BlockDAG Leads the Future of Investing in Crypto! ZCash’s price strength and Kaspa’s stable chart both show how crypto trends are shifting right now. ZEC’s fast October rise doubled its worth, while Kaspa’s steady range shows firm structure and potential for its next push. Both highlight that the strongest coins are those proving their base, either through stability or fast recovery. Yet the biggest buzz surrounds BlockDAG. With its nearly $435M presale, 312K+ holders, and rumors of Coinbase–Kraken listings, it’s become impossible to ignore. Many see BDAG as the next major story in investing in crypto, one that could reshape market rankings once the official confirmations drop.

53845626,617320,1761876012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53845626.jpeg,Old Bitcoin Supply Remains Calm: ASOL Shows No Panic Selling,https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-supply-remains-calm-asol-panic-selling/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to hold the $110,000 support level as price pressure intensifies heading into the final days of the month. Market structure remains fragile following recent volatility, and several analysts warn that BTC could still retest lower demand zones before establishing a stronger base. With liquidity pockets sitting below current price and sellers showing persistence near resistance, short-term downside cannot be ruled out as traders reassess positioning after the Federal Reserve’s policy shift. However, not all signals point to weakness. Many investors remain optimistic as macroeconomic conditions begin favoring risk assets once again. The Fed’s recent 25bps rate cut and confirmation that quantitative tightening will end by December 1st have laid the groundwork for what some view as the early phase of a new liquidity cycle — historically constructive for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. On-chain data also supports a calmer market environment. Over the past month, the activity of old coins has remained moderate, with long-term holders showing no signs of panic selling. This behavior suggests conviction among seasoned market participants, even as BTC navigates short-term turbulence. Collectively, these dynamics frame a market in transition: tactically cautious, yet strategically positioned for potential upside. Low ASOL Activity Signals Strong Holder Conviction According to on-chain insights highlighted by top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s recent spending behavior among long-term holders remains remarkably stable, underscoring strong market conviction even as price struggles to hold above key support. Adler points to the Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) — a metric that measures the average age of coins being moved on-chain — noting that while there were short-lived upticks to 245 days on October 8 and 209 days on October 21, these signals were far weaker than the heavy long-term holder activity seen in spring and June. This distinction is important: during those earlier periods, older coins moving signaled meaningful distribution events, often preceding corrective phases. In contrast, the recent mild increases indicate no widespread desire among long-term holders to exit positions. The 30-day ASOL moving average currently sits near 111 days, which Adler characterizes as a structural baseline — a zone consistent with healthy consolidation rather than distribution. In practical terms, this means seasoned holders remain patient, showing no urgency to take profits, despite macro uncertainty and short-term volatility. At the same time, incoming liquidity continues to absorb supply, as referenced in this week’s Substack commentary. This absorption dynamic is crucial: it reflects a market where available Bitcoin is gradually tightening, enabling price stability even as speculative flows remain constrained. Collectively, these on-chain conditions suggest a foundational phase rather than exhaustion. As liquidity improves and macro headwinds ease, this quiet conviction among long-term holders could form the groundwork for the next significant leg higher — once demand meaningfully re-accelerates. For now, the market remains calm beneath the surface, a posture historically associated with accumulation phases and future expansion rather than broader distribution or capitulation. Bitcoin Holds Above $110K But Faces Rejections Below Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $110,100, attempting to stabilize after another sharp rejection from the $117,500 resistance area — a level that has consistently capped upside attempts since mid-August. The 12-hour chart shows a repeat pattern: each move toward the upper range fades near the cluster of moving averages, with sellers stepping in aggressively at resistance and forcing BTC back into its mid-range support zone. BTC is currently holding above a key demand band between $108,500 and $110,000, an area that previously acted as a pivot during late-September and early-October price action. Maintaining this zone is critical for bulls. A breakdown here would expose Bitcoin to the $104,000–$106,000 region, where price wicked during the October 10 liquidation flush. On the upside, a structural shift requires BTC to reclaim the 50- and 100-period moving averages on the 12h timeframe and establish a foothold above $114,500. Only then would momentum build for another test of $117,500, with a confirmed breakout opening a path toward $120,000–$123,000. For now, Bitcoin remains range-bound, caught between macro optimism and lingering supply pressure. With volatility compressing again, the next strong move is likely to come once the market digests recent policy shifts and liquidity flows begin redirecting decisively.

53845988,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=849604,1761876372,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53845988.jpeg,Nvidia bets $1B on AI startup poolside driving its value,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-bets-1b-on-poolside/,"Nvidia Corp. commits to allocating as much as $1 billion to Poolside, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company, according to sources close to the matter. Based on their prediction, this investment plan would increase the value of the AI startup by four times its current value. The announcement leaks on the heels of Poolside’s plans to raise approximately $2 billion while being valued at $12 billion. It is essential to note that the quoted number does not incorporate prior financing. Although the sum of Nvidia’s commitment to this current round has not been revealed, a source who asked to remain anonymous stated that the tech giant would start at $500 million and increase to as high as $1 billion if Poolside meets its fundraising goals. This news follows the rise of Nvidia stock to a record closing price after the company announced new products, collaborations, and investments at its GTC event, pushing its market valuation to $5 trillion . Nvidia also revealed earlier this week that it’s teaming up with the US Department of Energy to construct seven supercomputers, including one designed with 10,000 of its Blackwell GPUs. The semiconductor firm, aiming to work on national security applications, also announced new alliances with Palantir and Oracle, as well as with telecom companies such as Cisco and T-Mobile, to support the next wave of 6G infrastructure. Big tech companies seek to offer support to a growing network of AI startups Regarding its funding round, sources have revealed that Poolside has already received more than $1 billion in commitments, with around $700 million secured from its current investors . Meanwhile, Magnetar, a money management company specializing in hedge fund investments, is also in talks to participate in this round, according to The Information. Following this announcement, Poolside’s valuation substantially increased from the $3 billion investors predicted during a funding round last year. The outcome illustrates growing investor confidence in an AI startup that introduced its first product just a year ago, as evidenced by its big commitment. Founded in 2023, Poolside focuses on coding automation for government and defense uses but seeks to establish a multipurpose artificial general intelligence (AGI). Notably, it has offices in the US and Paris, France. With AGI, the AI startup intends to remain competitive in the industry. On the other hand, Nvidia’s involvement in the funding round demonstrates a growing trend among big companies by market value seeking to support a growing network of AI startups with the perspective that these startups might become important clients. For example, one source noted that Poolside plans to utilize some of the newly raised funds to purchase Nvidia’s GB300 chips. According to the source, Nvidia has previously invested in the AI startup. This agreement also aligns with Poolside’s extensive infrastructure plans. Earlier this month, the company announced a partnership with CoreWeave Inc. to develop one of the biggest data centers in the US as part of Project Horizon. The facility is slated to be located in West Texas and is projected to have a capacity of 2 gigawatts, sufficient to supply power to approximately 1.5 million homes. Nvidia aims to remain competitive with significant investments in the AI industry Under the leadership of Jason Warner, who was a former executive at GitHub, Poolside is among several fast-growing AI firms that have caught Nvidia’s attention. According to reports from sources, Nvidia has already invested in 59 AI startups as of mid-October this year. This number has exceeded its total investments from the previous year, according to PitchBook data. Moreover, the Silicon Valley-based AI chipmaker has invested in Perplexity AI, an AI-powered search engine, and Figure AI, a company focusing on humanoid robotics. During Nvidia’s GTC conference, Jensen Huang, the company’s Chief Executive Officer, expressed his pleasure in discovering that AI startups are built on Nvidia. “There are many reasons for this. First, our ecosystem is strong. Our tools perform really well,” Huang added.

While transparency is a core tenet of blockchain, exposing personal financial history can be a major concern for users. This is where the groundbreaking collaboration between zero-knowledge (ZK) technology firm Brevis and AI-based Web3 information platform Kaito steps in, introducing a revolutionary approach to privacy-preserving on-chain verification within the InfoFi (Information + Finance) ecosystem. What is Privacy-Preserving On-Chain Verification? Imagine being able to prove your credentials or financial standing on a blockchain without revealing a single detail about your wallet address or entire portfolio. That’s the essence of privacy-preserving on-chain verification . It’s a game-changer for how we interact with decentralized applications and services. Brevis, a leader in ZK technology, has teamed up with Kaito, an innovative platform that merges information with finance. Their joint effort aims to create a more secure and private environment for Web3 participants. This means users can now verify their on-chain history in Kaito campaigns using Brevis’s sophisticated ZK proof technology, all while keeping their sensitive data under wraps. Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that allow one party to prove to another that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. In simpler terms, you can prove you meet a certain criterion without showing the underlying data that confirms it. This is crucial for maintaining user anonymity and trust in the Web3 space. Why Does On-Chain Privacy Matter in Web3? For a long time, participating in Web3 activities meant exposing your wallet address and, by extension, your entire transaction history to the public. This lack of privacy raised significant concerns for many users, ranging from potential security risks to unwanted scrutiny of their financial activities. Moreover, it hindered broader adoption by those wary of relinquishing their anonymity. The introduction of privacy-preserving on-chain verification directly addresses these issues. By enabling users to verify their status—such as being a long-term holder or an active DeFi participant—without disclosing their complete financial footprint, the collaboration fosters a more secure and equitable environment. Users gain greater control over their data, minimizing the risk of targeted attacks or unwanted surveillance. Consequently, this enhanced privacy encourages more users to engage with Web3 platforms and campaigns. When individuals feel their data is protected, they are more likely to participate, contributing to a healthier and more vibrant decentralized ecosystem. This move signifies a crucial step towards making Web3 truly accessible and safe for everyone. How Does Brevis’s ZK Proof Technology Power This Innovation? At the heart of this partnership lies Brevis’s cutting-edge ZK proof technology. This advanced cryptographic solution is what makes true privacy-preserving on-chain verification possible. Previously, users on platforms like Kaito had to directly connect their wallets, a practice that, while functional, presented clear privacy vulnerabilities. Their entire portfolio became visible, potentially exposing them to various risks. With Brevis’s technology, this changes dramatically. Instead of revealing their wallet, users can now generate a ZK proof. This proof cryptographically confirms that they meet specific criteria (e.g., holding a certain asset for a defined period) without actually disclosing their wallet address or the details of their holdings. It’s like proving you have a valid ID without showing your name or address. This innovative feature has already been successfully applied to the Brevis Yapher Leaderboard. Participants can now anonymously prove their eligibility and status. This not only enhances user privacy but also builds a stronger foundation of trust, allowing for more secure and inclusive participation in the InfoFi ecosystem. The Future of InfoFi: What Does This Partnership Mean? The collaboration between Brevis and Kaito is more than just a technical upgrade; it represents a significant leap forward for the entire InfoFi landscape. By prioritizing privacy-preserving on-chain verification , they are setting a new standard for how information and finance intertwine in Web3. This initiative is expected to unlock a wave of new possibilities and applications. For instance, imagine more secure and equitable lending platforms, anonymous governance participation, or personalized financial services that respect user privacy by default. This partnership paves the way for a Web3 where users can confidently engage in complex financial interactions without compromising their personal data. Moreover, as trust and privacy become foundational elements, we can anticipate increased institutional and mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies. The ability to verify without revealing is a powerful incentive for individuals and organizations alike to participate more actively and securely in the decentralized future. This strategic alliance underscores a clear trend: the future of Web3 is private, secure, and user-centric. Brevis and Kaito are not just building tools; they are shaping the infrastructure for a more responsible and accessible digital economy. Conclusion The partnership between Brevis and Kaito marks a pivotal moment for Web3 privacy. By introducing robust privacy-preserving on-chain verification , they are empowering users with unprecedented control over their digital identities and financial data. This move promises to foster greater trust, encourage broader participation, and ultimately accelerate the evolution of a more secure and equitable decentralized internet. It’s a testament to the innovative spirit driving Web3 towards a future where privacy and transparency can coexist harmoniously.

Her remarks illuminate the Russian stablecoin policy , indicating a cautious yet strategic approach. This move is crucial for anyone watching the global crypto landscape, especially regarding how major economies integrate digital currencies into their financial systems. What Does the Russian Stablecoin Policy Entail? The Governor’s statement, as reported by Cryptopolitan, is straightforward: stablecoins can indeed be issued within Russia. However, there’s a critical caveat. These digital assets are strictly prohibited for domestic payments. This clear directive shapes the core of the Russian stablecoin policy . Key takeaway: Stablecoins are permitted for issuance. Crucial restriction: Not for use in internal transactions. This distinction highlights Russia’s intent to leverage the benefits of digital assets without disrupting its internal monetary stability or sovereignty. Why International Use for Stablecoins Under Russia’s Policy? So, if not for domestic payments, what’s the purpose? Nabiullina emphasized two primary applications for stablecoins: international settlements and attracting foreign investment. This aspect of the Russian stablecoin policy points towards a strategic play in the global financial arena. Boosting Cross-Border Trade: Stablecoins could streamline international transactions, potentially offering faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional banking channels. Attracting Capital: By providing a regulated framework for stablecoin issuance, Russia aims to create new avenues for foreign capital inflow, potentially bypassing some traditional financial hurdles. This pragmatic approach could offer Russia a competitive edge in an increasingly digital global economy. The Drive Behind Russia’s Stablecoin Policy Discussions These recent remarks from the Central Bank Governor don’t come out of the blue. They follow a significant call from Russian Senator Artem Sheikin. The Senator advocated for the issuance of a ruble-pegged stablecoin and the establishment of a robust regulatory framework to support it. Senator Sheikin’s Vision: Aims to create a national digital asset tied to the ruble. Regulatory Imperative: Emphasizes the need for clear rules to govern these new financial instruments. This ongoing dialogue underscores a growing recognition within Russian official circles regarding the potential, and the challenges, of digital currencies. The Russian stablecoin policy is clearly a topic of active debate and development. Navigating the Challenges and Future of Russian Stablecoin Policy While the potential benefits for international trade and investment are clear, the prohibition on domestic use reflects underlying concerns. Central banks globally often worry about the impact of private digital currencies on monetary policy, financial stability, and consumer protection. Monetary Sovereignty: Preventing stablecoins from becoming an alternative currency within Russia helps maintain the central bank’s control over the national monetary supply. Financial Stability: Unregulated domestic stablecoins could pose risks to the banking system and broader financial stability. The cautious rollout of the Russian stablecoin policy demonstrates a measured approach, balancing innovation with the imperative to protect the national financial system. As global digital asset regulations evolve, Russia’s approach will be a key one to watch. The journey towards a fully integrated digital economy is complex, and nations like Russia are carefully charting their course. Elvira Nabiullina’s recent statement provides vital clarity on Russia’s approach to digital currencies. The Russian stablecoin policy is emerging as a nuanced strategy: embracing stablecoins for their international potential while firmly restricting their domestic application. This measured stance reflects a careful balance between fostering innovation in cross-border finance and safeguarding national monetary stability. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Russia’s distinctive path will undoubtedly influence global discussions on cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary directive of Russia’s central bank regarding stablecoins? A1: The primary directive is that stablecoins can be issued in Russia, but they are strictly prohibited for domestic payments. Q2: For what purposes can stablecoins be used under the new Russian policy? A2: Stablecoins can be used for international settlements and to attract foreign investment. Q3: Who is Elvira Nabiullina? A3: Elvira Nabiullina is the Governor of the Central Bank of Russia. Q4: What prompted the Central Bank’s recent statements on stablecoins?

A5: This restriction helps the central bank maintain monetary sovereignty, control over the national money supply, and safeguard financial stability within the country.

Fidelity’s FETH also contributed with $18.53 million in outflows. Notably, no Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows for the day, underscoring the collective bearish sentiment for the period. Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Losing Their Luster? Consecutive days of net outflows raise questions about the immediate appeal of Spot Ethereum ETFs .

If so, there’s a crucial announcement you need to be aware of. South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has declared a temporary Bithumb OM suspension for both deposits and withdrawals of Mantra (OM) tokens. This important change is scheduled to begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5. It is essential for all OM token holders to understand the implications of this upcoming event. Understanding the Bithumb OM Suspension Details This temporary halt is not arbitrary; it stems from a planned network upgrade for the Mantra (OM) token. Network upgrades are vital for improving blockchain efficiency, security, and introducing new features. While they are beneficial in the long run, they often require exchanges to pause transactions to ensure the safety and integrity of user funds during the transition. The Bithumb OM suspension ensures that no transactions are lost or mishandled during this technical process. This proactive measure by Bithumb helps protect users from potential issues that could arise if trading continued during the upgrade. It’s a standard practice within the cryptocurrency industry. What Does This Mean for Mantra (OM) Holders? For individuals holding Mantra (OM) tokens on Bithumb, the primary impact is the inability to move their tokens on or off the exchange starting November 5. This means you will not be able to deposit new OM tokens into your Bithumb account or withdraw existing ones. However, typically, trading within the exchange for OM tokens might continue, though it’s always wise to verify Bithumb’s specific policy regarding internal trading during such suspensions. It’s important to remember that this is a temporary situation. Once the network upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb verifies the stability of the new network, deposits and withdrawals will resume. Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact timing of the service restoration following the Bithumb OM suspension . Navigating the Temporary Halt: Actionable Steps If you need to move your Mantra (OM) tokens before the suspension, you have a limited window. Consider these actionable insights: Plan Ahead: If you intend to deposit or withdraw OM tokens, do so well before the 3:00 a.m. UTC deadline on November 5. Monitor Announcements: Regularly check Bithumb’s official website or social media channels for updates regarding the network upgrade and the resumption of services. Understand Your Options: If you require immediate liquidity for your OM tokens during the suspension, explore if internal trading on Bithumb remains active, or consider other exchanges that might not be affected (though transferring before the suspension is the only way to move off Bithumb). Being prepared is your best strategy to avoid any inconvenience caused by the Bithumb OM suspension . Why Do Exchanges Suspend Services for Upgrades? Exchanges like Bithumb temporarily suspend services for network upgrades to maintain the highest level of security and operational integrity. These upgrades often involve significant changes to the blockchain’s underlying code. During this period, transactions might not be processed correctly on an older version of the network, or new features might not be compatible with existing exchange infrastructure. By pausing services, Bithumb ensures a smooth transition to the upgraded network. This minimizes risks such as: Loss of funds during deposits or withdrawals. Incorrect transaction confirmations. Security vulnerabilities. Ultimately, these suspensions are for the benefit of the users, ensuring a safer and more robust trading environment post-upgrade. This commitment to security and functionality is a hallmark of a reliable exchange. Looking Ahead: Post-Suspension Expectations Once the Mantra (OM) network upgrade is complete and Bithumb has conducted all necessary checks, the Bithumb OM suspension for deposits and withdrawals will be lifted. Users can then expect a return to normal service. The upgrade itself might bring improvements to transaction speed, lower fees, or new functionalities for the Mantra (OM) token, potentially enhancing its utility and appeal. Staying informed through official channels is paramount. Bithumb will provide clear communication regarding when services are fully restored, allowing you to resume your usual OM token activities without any further interruptions. The upcoming Bithumb OM suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals is a temporary, yet significant, event driven by a necessary network upgrade. While it requires users to plan accordingly, it underscores Bithumb’s commitment to maintaining a secure and efficient trading platform. By understanding the reasons behind this suspension and taking proactive steps, OM token holders can navigate this period smoothly and look forward to an improved Mantra network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the exact date and time of the Bithumb OM suspension? A1: The temporary suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals on Bithumb will begin at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5. Q2: Why is Bithumb suspending OM deposits and withdrawals? A2: Bithumb is implementing the Bithumb OM suspension due to a scheduled network upgrade for the Mantra (OM) token. This is a standard procedure to ensure the safety and integrity of funds during technical transitions. Q3: Can I still trade Mantra (OM) on Bithumb during the suspension? A3: While deposits and withdrawals will be halted, internal trading of OM tokens on Bithumb may still be possible. Users should check Bithumb’s official announcements for the most precise information regarding trading activities during the suspension period. Q4: How long will the Bithumb OM suspension last? A4: The suspension is temporary and will last until the Mantra (OM) network upgrade is successfully completed and Bithumb has verified the new network’s stability. Bithumb will announce the exact resumption time. Q5: What should I do if I need to move my OM tokens urgently? A5: If you need to deposit or withdraw OM tokens, it is crucial to complete these transactions before 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5. After this time, the services will be unavailable.

53847420,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=846301,1761879610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53847420.jpeg,$780M Worth of Ethereum Pulled From Exchanges – Biggest Withdrawal Spike in Weeks,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/780m-worth-of-ethereum-pulled-from-exchanges-biggest-withdrawal-spike-in-weeks/,"Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to break above the $4,000 mark and regain a clear bullish structure, with price action tightening after several failed attempts to reclaim momentum. The market remains cautious following recent volatility, and traders are watching closely to determine whether ETH will resume its uptrend or continue drifting lower. Analysts are currently split: some argue Ethereum’s fundamentals remain strong, fueled by network activity, scaling advancements, and institutional traction, while others point to increasing downside pressure and weakening market structure that could lead to a deeper pullback. Related Reading: Ethereum ICO Whale Awakens After 8 Years – 1,500 ETH Sent to Kraken After 8 Years Despite the uncertainty in price, fresh on-chain data signals growing confidence among long-term participants. According to Santiment, more than 200,000 ETH — worth approximately $780 million — have been withdrawn from exchanges over the past 48 hours, marking one of the largest short-term outflow spikes this quarter. Such activity typically suggests accumulation, as investors move assets into self-custody rather than keeping them on exchanges to sell. This divergence between price hesitation and heavy accumulation reinforces the current market debate. With liquidity dynamics shifting, Ethereum sits at a pivotal moment, and its ability to reclaim $4,000 will likely determine whether bullish momentum re-emerges heading into November. Large ETH Withdrawals Signal Investor Conviction As Market Shifts Toward Risk-On Environment The recent wave of large Ethereum withdrawals from exchanges further reinforces a growing theme in the market: investor conviction is strengthening. With more than 200,000 ETH moved into self-custody within 48 hours, many participants appear confident in Ethereum’s medium-term outlook, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution. Historically, substantial exchange outflows have coincided with accumulation phases ahead of major market advances, especially when paired with favorable macro shifts. For many analysts, Ethereum now sits at the center of a potential bullish impulse across altcoins. Despite its recent struggle to convincingly reclaim the $4,000 level, sentiment in the broader market remains constructive. ETH continues to benefit from fundamental tailwinds, including increasing network utility, expanding Layer-2 activity, and rising staking participation. If market conditions turn decisively risk-on, Ethereum’s role as the primary settlement and liquidity hub for the altcoin ecosystem positions it to lead capital flows. Macro conditions are also aligning in ETH’s favor. With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 25 basis points and signaling the end of quantitative tightening, global liquidity is expected to gradually improve. Historically, shifts toward monetary easing have accelerated inflows into risk assets — crypto included. As traditional markets anticipate a clearer pivot, investors may increasingly seek exposure to high-beta assets with strong structural narratives, and Ethereum fits that profile.

After failing to sustain moves above the $4,200 resistance area earlier this month, ETH has drifted lower into a tightening range, reflecting indecision and reduced volatility following recent macro-driven swings. The chart shows ETH trading below both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages, which currently sit just above price and are acting as dynamic resistance. For bulls, reclaiming these levels — particularly a daily close above $4,050–$4,150 — would be a constructive sign that momentum is shifting back in favor of buyers. Such a reclaim could open a path toward retesting $4,300–$4,500, where recent supply pressure has consistently emerged.

However, the 200-day moving average (red) remains well below the price near $3,200, signaling that the long-term bullish structure is still intact.

Just recently, Bitcoin (BTC) saw its value dip below the crucial $109,000 mark, sending ripples through digital asset portfolios. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC’s trading price on platforms like the Binance USDT market briefly touched $108,992.13. This movement is more than just a number; it reflects underlying market sentiment and various contributing factors. A sudden fall like this often triggers questions about market stability and future trajectories. For many, Bitcoin’s journey below $109,000 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility within the crypto space. It underscores the importance of staying informed and prepared for rapid shifts. What Factors Contributed to This Significant Bitcoin Price Drop? Several elements can influence a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Pinpointing a single cause is often challenging, as the market is a complex interplay of various forces. However, we can identify common catalysts: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation data, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events, often spill over into risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create investor apprehension, leading to sell-offs and contributing to a Bitcoin price drop . Technical Breakdowns: When key support levels are breached, it can trigger automated selling orders and psychological panic among traders, accelerating the downward momentum. Whale Activity: Large institutional or individual holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ moving significant amounts of BTC can impact liquidity and price stability. Market Sentiment: Negative news cycles or a general shift in investor confidence can quickly turn bullish sentiment bearish, contributing to a noticeable Bitcoin price drop . These factors rarely act in isolation; instead, they often combine to create a cumulative effect, amplifying market movements. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact Your Portfolio? For current holders, a dip below a significant level like $109,000 can be concerning. However, it’s essential to consider both the short-term implications and the long-term perspective. Understanding the potential effects can help in making rational decisions. Increased Volatility: Such price movements highlight the high-risk, high-reward nature of cryptocurrency investments. Potential Buying Opportunity: Experienced investors often view significant dips as a chance to accumulate assets at a lower price, a strategy known as ‘buying the dip.’ Emotional Response: It’s natural to feel anxious during a market downturn. Maintaining a rational, long-term strategy is crucial to avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear. Portfolio Rebalancing: A price fall might be an opportune moment to review and rebalance your crypto holdings, aligning them with your risk tolerance and investment goals. It is important to remember that market fluctuations are a normal part of the crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights After a Bitcoin Price Drop Understanding market dynamics is key, especially after a significant event like this Bitcoin price drop . Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these volatile periods: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on reputable news sources and market analysis to understand the broader context. Knowledge is your best defense against market panic. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can also mitigate risks, spreading your exposure across different assets. Long-Term Vision: Bitcoin has historically recovered from significant downturns. A long-term perspective often helps weather short-term volatility, focusing on the asset’s fundamental value. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can smooth out the impact of price fluctuations over time. While the immediate news of BTC falling below $109,000 might seem daunting, it’s a typical event in the highly cyclical world of cryptocurrency. Informed decisions, coupled with a disciplined approach, are your best allies. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $109,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and the continuous interplay of various global and technical factors. While such movements can be unsettling, they also offer crucial learning opportunities for investors. By staying informed, managing risks effectively, and maintaining a long-term perspective, participants can navigate these fluctuations with greater confidence. The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and understanding these shifts is paramount for anyone involved. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when BTC falls below a key psychological level like $109,000? A: When BTC falls below a key psychological level, it often signals a shift in market sentiment, potentially triggering further sell-offs as traders react to the breach of a perceived support level. It can also lead to increased volatility. Q2: Is a Bitcoin price drop a definitive sign of a bear market? A: Not necessarily. A single Bitcoin price drop doesn’t always confirm a bear market. It could be a temporary correction or a reaction to specific news. A bear market is typically characterized by sustained downward trends over an extended period. Q3: What should I do if my Bitcoin portfolio is currently down due to this drop? A: It’s crucial to avoid impulsive decisions. Review your original investment thesis, assess your risk tolerance, and consider your long-term goals. Strategies like dollar-cost averaging or holding (HODLing) might be appropriate, depending on your individual situation. Q4: How often do Bitcoin prices experience significant drops? A: Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and significant price drops are not uncommon. Historically, it has experienced numerous corrections, sometimes by substantial percentages, often followed by periods of recovery and new highs. Q5: What is the role of market sentiment in BTC price movements? A: Market sentiment plays a huge role. Positive sentiment (greed) can drive prices up, while negative sentiment (fear) can lead to rapid sell-offs. News, social media trends, and investor confidence heavily influence this collective sentiment. Did you find this analysis helpful?

While major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum saw limited breakout momentum, risk appetite rebounded across sectors such as memecoin, GameFi, and AI, driving impressive secondary market rallies. As a global leading digital asset trading platform, HTX captured this momentum with a diversified range of listings. The week’s top 10 gainers spanned memecoin, GameFi, Base AI, DeFi, and Privacy sectors, with the leading token soaring by 222%. This strengthens the platform’s role as a hub for emerging opportunities. AI Agents on Base Blockchain Ignite Smart Economy This year, the “AI + Blockchain” narrative continues to dominate popularity in the crypto space. Base, Ethereum’s Layer 2 powerhouse, is at the center of the new AI revolution. ● GAME (GAME by Virtuals) : Up 167%. As an AI agent token within the Virtuals Protocol ecosystem, it is designed for on-chain business and generative service applications. GAME climbed from $0.013 to $0.034, fueled by Base network upgrades and renewed enthusiasm for AI narratives. ● VIRTUAL (Virtuals Protocol) : Up 80%. The native token of the Virtuals protocol, rose 80% to $1.45, benefiting from heightened attention following the Base x402 protocol announcement that reignited interest in AI-driven economies. These performances mark a clear inflection point that the Base AI ecosystem is evolving from conceptual potential to tangible opportunity. Hot Token Listing Winners——10.20-10.26 2025 Memecoin Sector: Viral Momentum Keeps the Party Going As the emotional amplifier of the crypto market, memecoins once again showcased their explosive power. ● DARK (Dark Eclipse) : It led the week with an approximate 222% rally, becoming the undisputed champion. As a Solana-based hybrid of AI and memecoin narratives, DARK’s surge was likely fueled by a mix of community hype, liquidity expansion, and speculative focus. ● GIGGLE (Giggle Fund) : Up 56%. This BSC-based memecoin gained moderate traction compared to DARK. Its growth was mainly driven by social media engagement, KOL exposure, and event-driven marketing such as airdrops. Cautionary Note: While memecoins can yield eye-popping returns, they remain highly volatile with limited fundamental support. DeFi Sector: Efficiency Boost Through Leverage and Synthetic Assets ● F (SynFutures) : Up 106%. F is the governance token of SynFutures, supporting a single-token liquidity model that enables users to freely list and trade any asset in seconds. SynFutures recently introduced the industry’s first Perp Launchpad, allowing instant listings of assets ranging from blue-chip tokens to LSTs and memecoins. ● AVNT (Avantis) : Up 51% to $0.74. Positioned as the largest RWA perpetuals DEX on Base, Avantis allows users to trade not only crypto, but real-world assets (RWAs) like FX, commodities, indices, and soon, equities. The token’s listing on Binance.US last week drove a new wave of interest, and HTX’s margin trading for AVNT has made it a preferred choice for professional traders. GameFi and Privacy: Old Themes, New Momentum ● MAVIA (Heroes of Mavia) : 167% weekly growth, ranking second among all gainers. As the governance token of the Heroes of Mavia strategy game, MAVIA enables players to earn RUBY rewards through real-time base-building battles. The price jumping from $0.09 to $0.24 was fueled by its integration with BNB Chain bridges and the launch of the game’s new season, which attracted millions of active players. ● ZEC (Zcash) : Rose 46%, a privacy token representative. Powered by zk-SNARKs, Zcash provides state-of-the-art privacy protection. Renewed attention followed Arthur Hayes’ bold “$10,000 ZEC” prediction, triggering a 20% 24-hour surge and reviving discussions on privacy as crypto’s foundational ethos. From Base’s AI agent revolution to memecoin euphoria, GameFi’s play-to-earn revival, DeFi’s efficiency breakthroughs, and Privacy’s comeback, the week of Oct 20-26 showcased a broad market rotation toward smaller projects, high-narrative assets with tangible progress potential. HTX, leveraging its strategic foresight in asset curation and sector discovery, continues to offer users early access to emerging narratives and multi-dimensional growth opportunities, empowering global traders to capture value in the next phase of the digital economy.

Powell’s indication that the latest 25-basis-point rate cut may be the last of 2025 has fueled caution across both traditional and crypto markets. As a result, the Ethereum price is at slightly above $3,900, marking a 2.2% daily decline, with Bitcoin and other major altcoins also in the red. The broader pullback saw Ethereum ETFs record $81.44 million in outflows, led by Fidelity’s FETH at $69.49 million. Only BlackRock’s ETHA fund showed resilience, posting $21.36 million in inflows. This shift follows two consecutive days of positive ETF activity, indicating profit-taking and reduced risk appetite among traders. Institutional Demand Grows Even as the Ethereum Price Weakens While the Ethereum price slipped, institutional accumulation has intensified. Data shows that institutions now hold 4.1% of Ethereum’s total supply, surpassing Bitcoin’s 3.6% for the first time. Analysts attribute this shift to the GENIUS Act, which provides a clear framework for stablecoin and on-chain finance regulation. This policy clarity has boosted institutional trust in Ethereum as the backbone of DeFi and tokenized RWAs. Despite the current weakness, many funds continue to add exposure, anticipating Ethereum’s Web3 Dominance. Technically, the Ethereum price shows mixed signals. RSI sits at 44, and the MACD line remains below the signal line, both pointing to fading bullish momentum. Analysts caution that if ETH fails to reclaim $4,000, it could revisit support zones around $3,850–$3,750. A decisive close above $4,100, however, may renew bullish sentiment toward $4,400–$4,500. On-Chain Activity Reaches Record Highs Amid Low Fees Interestingly, Ethereum’s network fundamentals remain robust even as price momentum cools. On-chain activity has surged to record highs, with daily transactions and unique active addresses breaking all-time records. Similarly, gas fees remain near historic lows, signaling improved scalability driven by Layer-2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base. This efficiency milestone showcases Ethereum’s technological evolution, from its proof-of-stake transition to the upcoming EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) upgrade. Analysts believe this combination of strong institutional demand and record network usage, despite short-term price pressure, positions the Ethereum price for a sustained recovery once macroeconomic headwinds ease.

Then you need to pay close attention to this urgent announcement. South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has declared a temporary Upbit OM suspension for both deposits and withdrawals of Mantra (OM) tokens. This critical update is due to a planned network upgrade, impacting users starting very soon. Understanding the implications of this suspension is vital for managing your assets effectively and avoiding any unexpected disruptions to your trading activities. What Exactly is the Upbit OM Suspension? Upbit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, recently notified its users about a temporary halt in services for Mantra (OM). Specifically, this affects the ability to deposit and withdraw OM tokens. The suspension is scheduled to commence at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5th. This isn’t an arbitrary decision but a necessary step to accommodate an upcoming network upgrade for the Mantra (OM) blockchain. For many crypto users, such suspensions can be a cause for concern. However, it’s important to understand that these are often standard procedures. Exchanges implement these measures to ensure the security and integrity of user funds during significant blockchain events like network upgrades. By pausing transactions, Upbit can safely transition to the new network version without risking any loss or errors during the upgrade process. This proactive approach minimizes risks for all participants. It’s also worth noting that such suspensions are common across the cryptocurrency landscape. Whenever a blockchain undergoes significant changes, exchanges that support that asset will typically halt transactions to prevent any discrepancies. This ensures that when services resume, all user balances are accurately reflected on the updated network. The Upbit OM suspension is a prime example of an exchange prioritizing asset safety during a critical technical transition. Impacted Service: Deposits and withdrawals of Mantra (OM). Start Date & Time: November 5th, 3:00 a.m. UTC. Reason: Essential network upgrade for Mantra (OM). Why is a Network Upgrade Necessary for Mantra (OM)? Blockchain networks, much like any other software, require regular maintenance and upgrades to improve their functionality, security, and scalability. A network upgrade, often referred to as a hard fork or soft fork depending on its nature, introduces new features, fixes bugs, or enhances the overall performance of the blockchain. For Mantra (OM), this upgrade signifies a step forward in its development roadmap, aiming to provide a more robust and efficient platform for its users. During such an upgrade, the underlying technology of the Mantra (OM) blockchain is being modified. If exchanges were to allow deposits and withdrawals during this sensitive period, there’s a risk of transactions being lost, incorrectly processed, or failing to reflect on the updated network. Therefore, the Upbit OM suspension acts as a protective measure, safeguarding user assets and ensuring a smooth transition to the upgraded network. It’s a sign of the exchange’s commitment to security and operational excellence. Users should always stay informed about these technical developments. They directly impact how you interact with your digital assets. Keep an eye on official announcements from both Upbit and the Mantra (OM) project team for the latest information regarding the upgrade’s progress and the eventual resumption of services. These upgrades are not just about fixing issues; they often unlock new possibilities, such as faster transaction speeds, lower fees, or new decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities that can benefit the entire Mantra ecosystem. What Should Mantra (OM) Holders Do During the Upbit OM Suspension? If you hold Mantra (OM) on Upbit, or if you were planning to deposit or withdraw tokens around the November 5th deadline, it’s crucial to adjust your plans accordingly. The primary action is to be aware of the exact timing. Any deposit or withdrawal initiated after 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 5th will likely be rejected or delayed until the services resume. It is always best practice to complete any necessary transactions well in advance of an announced suspension period. Here are some actionable insights for OM holders: Plan Ahead: If you need to move your OM tokens, do so before the suspension begins. Stay Informed: Regularly check Upbit’s official announcements page or their social media channels for updates on the network upgrade status and when services will be reinstated. Avoid New Transactions: Refrain from initiating new OM deposits or withdrawals on Upbit during the suspension period to prevent potential issues. Consider Alternatives (if urgent): If you absolutely need to transact OM during the suspension, explore if other exchanges supporting Mantra (OM) are not undergoing similar maintenance. However, always exercise caution and verify information. This temporary Upbit OM suspension is designed to protect your assets, not inconvenience you. Patience and proactive planning are key during such events in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. When Will Upbit Resume Mantra (OM) Services? The duration of the Upbit OM suspension is directly tied to the completion of the Mantra (OM) network upgrade. While Upbit’s initial announcement specifies the start time, the exact end time is typically communicated once the upgrade is successfully implemented and the network is confirmed to be stable. Exchanges usually monitor the upgraded network closely for a period to ensure everything is functioning correctly before reactivating deposit and withdrawal services. Users should anticipate that services will be restored as soon as it is safe and technically feasible. Upbit will issue another official announcement detailing the resumption of OM deposits and withdrawals. Until then, the best course of action is to monitor official communication channels. This proactive approach ensures you are among the first to know when you can once again freely move your Mantra (OM) tokens on the platform. This period of suspension, while potentially inconvenient, underscores the ongoing evolution of blockchain technology. It highlights the constant efforts by projects and exchanges to enhance security, efficiency, and user experience. The eventual return of services will signify a stronger, more robust Mantra (OM) network ready for future growth. Summary: Navigating the Upbit OM Suspension The temporary Upbit OM suspension for Mantra (OM) deposits and withdrawals, effective November 5th at 3:00 a.m. UTC, is a necessary measure for a network upgrade.

Recently, traders witnessed a significant event that sent ripples across major digital assets: massive crypto liquidations . Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) experienced substantial long liquidations, impacting numerous positions and highlighting the inherent volatility of the perpetual futures market. This event serves as a crucial reminder for all participants to understand market mechanisms and manage risk effectively. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Understanding crypto liquidations is essential for anyone involved in futures trading. Simply put, a liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when the market moves against a trader’s position, and their margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. Exchanges initiate liquidations to prevent traders from incurring further losses and to protect the solvency of the platform. For long positions, liquidation triggers when the asset’s price drops significantly, indicating a bearish market shift. Unpacking the Recent Wave of Massive Crypto Liquidations The past 24 hours have been particularly challenging for long position holders in the crypto perpetual futures market. Data reveals a stark picture of significant losses: Bitcoin (BTC): A staggering $434 million was liquidated. A vast majority, 88.08%, comprised long positions, indicating a sharp downward price movement caught many bullish traders off guard. Ethereum (ETH): Following BTC, Ethereum saw $222 million in liquidations. Long positions accounted for 86.23% of this total, underscoring similar market pressure. Solana (SOL): Solana experienced $82.42 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of long positions at 92.71%. This highlights SOL’s particular sensitivity to recent market shifts. These figures collectively paint a clear picture: a sudden downturn in prices led to a cascade of forced selling, exacerbating the market’s negative momentum. Such events are not uncommon in highly leveraged markets, but their scale always demands attention and careful analysis. Why Do Massive Crypto Liquidations Occur? Several factors can trigger such widespread crypto liquidations . Often, a significant price drop, fueled by macroeconomic news, regulatory concerns, or large sell-offs by institutional players, can initiate a chain reaction. When prices fall, leveraged long positions become vulnerable. As some positions are liquidated, it adds selling pressure to the market, causing prices to fall further and triggering more liquidations. This creates a “liquidation cascade” or “long squeeze,” intensifying the downward trend. Moreover, high leverage ratios amplify both potential gains and losses, making traders more susceptible to these sudden market movements. Navigating the Volatile Waters: Actionable Insights After Crypto Liquidations While massive crypto liquidations can be alarming, they also offer valuable lessons for market participants. For traders, understanding and managing risk is paramount. Consider these actionable insights to protect your capital: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, as it drastically increases your liquidation risk during market downturns. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically close your position if the price hits a predetermined level, limiting potential losses and protecting your margin. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your capital into highly leveraged positions on a single asset. Spread your risk across different assets or strategies. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, macroeconomic indicators, and technical analysis to anticipate potential shifts and prepare accordingly. Understand Market Cycles: Recognize that volatility is a natural part of the crypto market and prepare for both upward and downward swings. These strategies can help protect your capital and navigate the often unpredictable nature of the perpetual futures market. It’s about preparedness, not prediction. The Lasting Impact of Significant Crypto Liquidations The immediate impact of crypto liquidations is often a sharp price correction and increased market volatility. For individual traders, it means substantial losses, especially for those holding highly leveraged long positions. However, these events also serve as a “reset” for the market, flushing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for more stable price discovery in the future. While painful in the short term, they are a fundamental aspect of how leveraged markets self-correct and maintain equilibrium over time. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for long-term participation in the crypto space. In conclusion, the recent wave of massive crypto liquidations across BTC, ETH, and SOL underscores the high-stakes nature of perpetual futures trading. While these events can be unsettling, they are integral to the market’s health, flushing out overleveraged positions. For traders, the key takeaway is the critical importance of robust risk management strategies, including prudent leverage use, stop-loss orders, and continuous market education. Staying informed and disciplined is your best defense against unexpected market shocks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What causes crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations are typically caused by significant price movements against a trader’s leveraged position. Factors like major sell-offs, macroeconomic news, regulatory changes, or even a cascade of initial liquidations can trigger further forced selling. 2. How can traders avoid liquidation? Traders can reduce their risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, implementing strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts, and diversifying their trading strategies. Continuous education about market dynamics is also vital. 3. Are liquidations bad for the crypto market? While painful for individual traders, liquidations are a natural part of leveraged markets. They help to ‘reset’ the market by flushing out excessive leverage, which can lead to more stable and sustainable price action in the long run. They are a mechanism for market self-correction. 4. What is the difference between a long and short liquidation? A long liquidation occurs when the price of an asset falls significantly, closing a bullish (long) position. A short liquidation happens when the price of an asset rises sharply, closing a bearish (short) position. Both are forced closures due to insufficient margin. Did you find this article insightful?

Recently, a significant rumor surfaced regarding former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, claiming he had sold a staggering 35 million ASTER tokens. However, in a swift and definitive move, CZ himself stepped forward to address these claims head-on, dismissing them as nothing more than “fake news.” This incident highlights the crucial need for accurate information, especially when it involves prominent figures like Changpeng Zhao ASTER holdings. What Exactly Was the Changpeng Zhao ASTER Selling Rumor? The digital grapevine was abuzz with reports suggesting that Changpeng Zhao had offloaded a substantial amount of ASTER tokens. These claims quickly gained traction across various social media platforms, sparking discussions and concerns within the crypto community. Given CZ’s high profile and influence, any news related to his crypto movements naturally garners immense attention. However, CZ wasted no time in clarifying the situation. He took to X (formerly Twitter) to directly refute the allegations, unequivocally stating that the rumors were baseless. His direct communication served as an immediate counter to the circulating misinformation. Debunking the Myth: On-Chain Analysis of the ASTER Transactions To further solidify CZ’s denial, renowned on-chain analyst EmberCN provided a crucial layer of verification. EmberCN’s meticulous examination of the supposed transaction revealed a different story entirely. Instead of a sale, the activity was identified as a simple transfer between Binance hot wallets. What is a hot wallet? A hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet connected to the internet, often used by exchanges for operational purposes like facilitating user withdrawals and deposits. Why does this matter? A transfer between an exchange’s own hot wallets does not constitute a personal sale by an individual, especially not one that would impact the market as a true sell-off would. This on-chain corroboration is vital. It demonstrates how verifiable data can quickly dispel even the most persistent rumors, providing transparency in a space often clouded by speculation. The truth behind the Changpeng Zhao ASTER situation became clear: it was an internal movement, not a market event. Why Do Crypto Rumors, Like the Changpeng Zhao ASTER Story, Spread So Quickly? The speed at which rumors propagate in the crypto space is truly astonishing. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon: Decentralized Information Flow: Social media platforms allow for rapid, unchecked dissemination of news. High Volatility: The inherent volatility of crypto markets makes investors sensitive to any news, real or fake, that could impact asset prices. Prominent Personalities: Actions or perceived actions of influential figures like Changpeng Zhao can trigger immediate reactions. Lack of Centralized Verification: Unlike traditional finance, there isn’t a single regulatory body to quickly confirm or deny every piece of market intelligence. This environment creates fertile ground for misinformation, which can lead to panic selling, unwarranted FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or even missed opportunities for investors. The recent Changpeng Zhao ASTER incident serves as a stark reminder of these challenges. Navigating the Digital Noise: Actionable Insights for Investors In an ecosystem prone to rapid rumor cycles, how can investors protect themselves and make informed decisions? Verify Sources: Always cross-reference information from multiple reputable sources. Official announcements from individuals or projects are paramount. Check On-Chain Data: Learn to use block explorers or rely on trusted on-chain analysts like EmberCN to verify transactions. Be Skeptical: If something sounds too good or too bad to be true, it often is. Understand Context: Differentiate between an internal transfer and a market-impacting sale. These practices are not just good habits; they are essential tools for anyone participating in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the nuances, as seen in the Changpeng Zhao ASTER case, can prevent costly mistakes. The Undeniable Power of Truth in Crypto The swift debunking of the Changpeng Zhao ASTER selling rumor by CZ himself, backed by solid on-chain analysis, underscores a vital lesson for the cryptocurrency community. In an environment often characterized by speculation and rapid information flow, the commitment to truth and transparency is paramount. This incident serves as a powerful reminder for all participants to exercise critical thinking and to always verify information, especially when it involves significant figures or potential market movements. Trust in verifiable data remains our strongest defense against the spread of misinformation.

The ripples from movements in major currencies like the Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen can significantly influence global liquidity, stablecoin pegs, and even arbitrage opportunities in the crypto space. Today, we delve into the recent shifts in Asia’s currency markets, examining how key economic data from China and Japan are shaping the narrative and offering crucial insights for traders worldwide. Understanding the Chinese Yuan’s Muted Response to Economic Data The Chinese Yuan has recently found itself in a rather subdued state, primarily influenced by a weaker-than-expected Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) report. The PMI is a vital indicator, offering a snapshot of the health of China’s manufacturing and service sectors. When the PMI falls, it signals a contraction or slowdown in economic activity, which naturally puts downward pressure on the national currency. What is the PMI and Why Does it Matter for the Yuan? The PMI is a survey-based indicator, reflecting the sentiment of purchasing managers regarding new orders, output, employment, and inventories. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while above 50 suggests expansion. For the Chinese Yuan , a weak PMI suggests slowing economic growth, which can reduce foreign investment interest and export demand, thus weakening the currency. Recent reports have highlighted persistent challenges within the Chinese economy, including a struggling property sector and cautious consumer spending. These domestic headwinds, coupled with global demand fluctuations, have contributed to the Yuan’s muted performance. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) often intervenes to manage currency stability, but the underlying economic fundamentals remain a significant driver. Traders must closely monitor these economic data releases as they provide a clear signal of China’s economic health and its potential impact on global trade and investment flows, including those that eventually trickle down to the crypto market. The Japanese Yen’s Crucial Rebound: What’s Driving the Change? In contrast to the Yuan, the Japanese Yen has shown signs of resilience, stemming its recent losses. This turnaround is largely attributed to hotter-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from Tokyo. The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services, essentially reflecting inflation. Why is Tokyo CPI So Important for the Japanese Yen? Tokyo’s CPI is often seen as a leading indicator for national inflation trends in Japan. Higher-than-anticipated inflation puts pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to potentially reconsider its ultra-loose monetary policy. Any hint of policy tightening (e.g., raising interest rates) makes the Japanese Yen more attractive to investors seeking higher returns, thereby strengthening the currency. For years, Japan has battled deflation, leading the BOJ to maintain negative interest rates and massive asset purchase programs. However, persistent global inflationary pressures and domestic factors are finally pushing prices higher. This shift is a game-changer for the Yen. A stronger Yen can impact Japanese exports and tourism, but for investors, it signals a potential pivot from a long era of accommodative policy. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for anyone trading in the Forex market , as it represents a significant policy divergence from previous years. Navigating the Broader Asia FX Landscape: Interconnected Markets While the Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen often capture headlines, their movements inevitably ripple across the entire Asia FX landscape. The region’s currencies are deeply interconnected, influenced by trade flows, capital movements, and the economic policies of major players. For instance, a weaker Yuan can make goods from other Asian economies more competitive against Chinese exports, but it can also signal broader economic weakness that dampens overall regional demand. Key Interconnections in Asia FX: Trade Dependencies: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on trade with China, making their currencies sensitive to shifts in Chinese demand and the Yuan’s value. Interest Rate Differentials: The monetary policy decisions of the PBoC and BOJ create interest rate differentials that influence capital flows into and out of other Asian nations, affecting currencies like the Korean Won (KRW), Singapore Dollar (SGD), and Indian Rupee (INR). Global Risk Sentiment: As major global trade hubs, Asian currencies are also sensitive to global risk sentiment. During periods of uncertainty, capital often flows to safe-haven assets, sometimes including the Yen, while riskier emerging market currencies may depreciate. This intricate web of dependencies means that a holistic view is essential. Traders looking at the Forex market in Asia cannot simply focus on one currency in isolation. The interplay of economic data , central bank actions, and geopolitical developments creates a complex yet fascinating environment for currency speculation and investment. Strategies for the Forex Market: Actionable Insights for Traders Given the current dynamics in Asia FX , what are the actionable insights for traders, especially those who also dabble in cryptocurrencies? The traditional Forex market often provides leading indicators for broader financial trends, making it a valuable tool for comprehensive market analysis. Practical Steps for Navigating Current Asia FX Trends: Monitor Economic Calendars Religiously: Pay close attention to releases like PMI, CPI, retail sales, and industrial production from China and Japan. These are immediate catalysts for currency movements. Understand Central Bank Nuances: The PBoC’s stance on the Yuan and the BOJ’s potential pivot on the Yen are crucial. Interpret their statements and policy decisions carefully for future direction. Diversify and Hedge: Consider how currency movements might impact your crypto holdings. For example, a stronger US Dollar (often influenced by global risk-off sentiment that can also affect Asian currencies) might impact stablecoin valuations or your purchasing power. Look Beyond the Headlines: While headlines focus on the Yuan and Yen, remember the broader regional impact. Currencies like the Australian Dollar (AUD) and New Zealand Dollar (NZD) are often considered proxies for Chinese economic health. Implement Robust Risk Management: Volatility in FX markets can be significant. Use stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing to protect your capital. These strategies emphasize preparedness and a deep understanding of the fundamental drivers behind currency valuations. For crypto traders, this knowledge can be leveraged to anticipate shifts in liquidity or to make more informed decisions regarding international transfers and asset allocation. FAQs: Demystifying Asian Currency Dynamics Let’s address some common questions about the forces at play in the Asia FX market. Q1: What exactly is PMI and why is it so influential for the Chinese Yuan? A1: The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is an economic indicator derived from monthly surveys of private sector companies. It provides an early insight into the health of the manufacturing and services sectors. For the Chinese Yuan , a weak PMI signals a slowdown in economic activity, which can reduce demand for Chinese exports and investment, thereby weakening the currency. It reflects business confidence and production levels. Q2: How does Tokyo CPI impact the Japanese Yen, and what does “hot” CPI mean? A2: Tokyo’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation in Japan’s capital, serving as a bellwether for national trends. A “hot” CPI means inflation is rising faster than expected. This is significant for the Japanese Yen because it could prompt the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to tighten its ultra-loose monetary policy, potentially by raising interest rates. Higher rates typically make a currency more attractive, strengthening the Yen. Q3: How do these traditional Forex market movements affect cryptocurrency markets? A3: While distinct, traditional Forex market movements can indirectly influence crypto. For instance, a stronger US Dollar can put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Changes in major Asian currencies like the Chinese Yuan or Japanese Yen can affect capital flows, trade balances, and overall liquidity in the global financial system, which eventually trickles down to crypto markets. Stablecoin valuations and cross-border crypto transactions can also be impacted. Q4: What role does the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) play in the Yuan’s value? A4: The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) plays a central role in managing the Chinese Yuan’s value through various mechanisms, including setting daily reference rates, conducting open market operations, and implementing capital controls. Its primary goal is to maintain currency stability and support economic growth, often intervening to prevent excessive volatility. Q5: Are there any specific global events that could significantly impact Asia FX? A5: Absolutely. Geopolitical tensions, major trade policy shifts (e.g., between the US and China), global commodity price fluctuations (especially oil), and significant economic crises in major economies can all have profound impacts on Asia FX . These events introduce uncertainty and can trigger risk-off sentiment, leading to capital flight or safe-haven flows, significantly altering currency valuations. A Pivotal Moment for Asian Currencies The recent movements in the Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen underscore a pivotal moment in the Asia FX landscape. While the Yuan grapples with domestic economic headwinds reflected in weak economic data like the PMI, the Yen is finding renewed strength from rising inflation, potentially signaling a shift in the Bank of Japan’s long-standing monetary policy. These contrasting narratives highlight the complex and dynamic nature of currency markets. For investors and traders, particularly those with an eye on the broader financial ecosystem including cryptocurrencies, understanding these fundamental drivers is paramount. The interconnectedness of global markets means that shifts in one region can have far-reaching implications. By staying informed about key economic data , central bank policies, and geopolitical developments, you can better position yourself to navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of the Forex market . The journey through Asia’s currency markets is never dull. As we move forward, the vigilance and analytical depth applied to these traditional financial instruments will undoubtedly offer valuable foresight into the broader economic currents shaping our financial future.

Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Zcash’s Shielded Supply Hits 4.5 Million Supporting Zcash’s resurgence is a major milestone. 4.5 million ZEC are now stored in shielded addresses, representing roughly 28% of total supply. These shielded pools leverage Zcash’s zero-knowledge proof technology (zk-SNARKs), allowing users to transact privately without revealing sender, receiver, or transaction amounts. This rise in shielded coins signals growing trust in ZEC’s privacy infrastructure, especially as wallets and exchanges improve support for shielded transactions. The move also expands Zcash’s overall anonymity set, strengthening privacy for all participants while tightening on-chain liquidity. As one of the oldest and most advanced privacy blockchains, ZEC’s growth in shielded adoption reinforces its core mission of financial confidentiality in an increasingly monitored digital world. Technical Indicators Point to More Upside Zcash’s market momentum remains robust. Daily trading volume soared above $730 million, while the RSI at 71.8 and a bullish MACD crossover suggest strong buying pressure. The token’s structure continues to make higher highs and higher lows, indicating a healthy uptrend. Analysts see resistance near $370–$400, with a potential breakout opening the path toward $450–$500 in the coming weeks. ZEC’s recent surge also coincides with Arthur Hayes’ bold prediction that the coin could reach $1,000, as the market rotates into privacy-focused assets. With Grayscale’s Zcash Trust surpassing $137 million in assets under management, and whispers of a possible ETF conversion, institutional exposure could further amplify this rally. Privacy Tokens Regain Spotlight Amid Regulatory Uncertainty Zcash’s resurgence reflects a broader renewal of interest in privacy tokens like Monero (XMR) amid heightened surveillance and KYC mandates in global markets. As governments tighten oversight, traders and institutions are rediscovering ZEC’s unique role as a bridge between compliant infrastructure and privacy rights.

One such element is the reduced number of tokens stored on cryptocurrency exchanges. On the other hand, some analysts warn that the asset might be poised for an even more severe pullback in the short term. Shifting to Self-Custody? The renowned analyst on X, Ali Martinez, revealed that 200,000 ETH have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges in the past 48 hours alone. The USD equivalent of the stash is around $770 million (calculated at current rates). The development signals that investors have been abandoning centralized platforms and moving their holdings into self-custody wallets, thereby reducing immediate selling pressure. Earlier this week, the total amount of ETH stored on crypto exchanges dropped to a nine-year low of around 15.8 million coins, while today’s figure is quite close to that level. ETH Exchange Reserves, Source: CryptoQuant It is important to note that Martinez made another clarification on the matter. Just recently, he stated that 230,000 ETH tokens were moved by large holders (possibly exchanges) in the last week. The move may include withdrawals, deposits, internal transfers, or other operations that differ from the other development. Separately, Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands clearly on the bullish side (at least as of now). The technical analysis tool, which measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes, is just north of 30, which puts it close to the oversold zone and poised for a potential surge. Conversely, ratios above 70 suggest the asset is overbought and are considered bearish for the price. ETH RSI, Source: CoinGecko Do or Die for ETH As of press time, Ethereum trades at approximately $3,800, down 5% on a daily scale and 8% over the past month. The X user Ted mentioned the drop under $4,000 following the Fed’s decision to lower the interest rates in the US and the US-China trade talks , opining that this is “a classic bear trap or the crypto market is going way lower.” Kamran Asghar chipped in, too, envisioning a possible dip to $3,400-$3,500 before a renewed rally. Others, like Max Crypto, were much more optimistic, predicting an “up-only” scenario in which ETH would explode to a new all-time high of $7,000. According to the analyst, the asset’s recent performance resembles the pre-pump condition from May this year, which was followed by a substantial surge shortly after.

Recently, the topic of Coinbase political donations has become a focal point, stirring allegations of undue influence within the corridors of power. These claims suggest that the leading crypto exchange might have received political favors from the Trump administration in exchange for financial contributions. Unpacking the Allegations: Were Coinbase Political Donations Tied to Favors? The controversy ignited following claims made by Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. He suggested a direct link between Coinbase’s political contributions and specific actions taken by the Trump administration. Senator Murphy specifically alleged that a decision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to drop a lawsuit was influenced by these donations. Moreover, the Senator pointed to significant donations made to President Donald Trump’s election campaign and inauguration as evidence of a “cozy relationship.” Such accusations naturally raise serious questions about the integrity of regulatory processes and the fairness of political engagement within the burgeoning crypto industry. Coinbase’s Firm Rebuttal: Debunking Claims of Special Treatment In response to these weighty allegations, Coinbase has issued a strong and direct denial. Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, dismissed the claims as “absurd.” He emphasized that the crypto industry’s engagement in the political arena is fundamentally bipartisan. Shirzad highlighted that Fairshake, a prominent super PAC within the crypto industry, actively supports numerous Democratic lawmakers alongside Republicans. This approach demonstrates a commitment to engaging with policymakers across the political spectrum, rather than favoring a single party or administration. Furthermore, Shirzad clarified that donating to presidential inaugurations is a common and long-standing practice, observed under various administrations including those of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, underscoring that such contributions are not unique to the Trump era or indicative of special favors. These statements aim to clarify the nature of Coinbase political donations . Understanding the Landscape of Crypto Political Donations Why do companies like Coinbase engage in political donations? The reasons are multifaceted and often tied to the unique regulatory challenges faced by a rapidly evolving industry like cryptocurrency. Crypto firms often contribute to political campaigns and Super PACs to: Advocate for Clear Regulations: The crypto space is still navigating a complex and often unclear regulatory environment. Donations help fund efforts to educate lawmakers and advocate for sensible policies that foster innovation while protecting consumers. Foster Industry Growth: By supporting candidates who understand and are open to the potential of digital assets, companies aim to create a more favorable environment for growth and development. Ensure Fair Treatment: Political engagement helps ensure that the industry’s voice is heard in policy debates, aiming for fair treatment compared to traditional financial sectors. These Coinbase political donations , therefore, are often part of a broader strategy to shape a supportive legislative landscape for digital assets, rather than seeking individual favors. Ensuring Transparency in Political Engagement Transparency is paramount when discussing political donations, especially in an industry as new and transformative as cryptocurrency. For companies like Coinbase, demonstrating ethical political engagement involves several key aspects: Public Records: All political donations are, by law, publicly recorded, allowing for scrutiny and accountability. Clear Communication: Companies should clearly articulate their rationale for political engagement and how their contributions align with their broader policy goals. Adherence to Laws: Strict adherence to campaign finance laws is essential to maintain integrity and public trust. The debate around Coinbase political donations underscores the ongoing need for robust oversight and clear communication to prevent any perception of undue influence and to ensure that the crypto industry operates with the highest standards of integrity. In conclusion, while allegations of political favors are serious, Coinbase has vehemently denied any such quid pro quo, asserting that its political engagement, including its contributions, is bipartisan and aligns with common industry practices. The exchange maintains its commitment to fostering a fair and transparent regulatory environment for digital assets through legitimate means. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are the recent allegations against Coinbase regarding political favors? Democratic Senator Chris Murphy alleged that Coinbase received political favors from the Trump administration in exchange for donations, specifically suggesting that these contributions influenced the SEC’s decision to drop a lawsuit and fostered a “cozy relationship” with the former President. 2. How has Coinbase responded to these claims? Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad directly refuted the claims, calling them “absurd.” He stated that the company’s political contributions are bipartisan, supporting lawmakers from both parties through super PACs like Fairshake, and that inauguration donations are a common practice across administrations. 3. What is Fairshake, and what is its role in crypto political donations? Fairshake is a super PAC (Political Action Committee) supported by the crypto industry, including Coinbase. Its role is to make independent expenditures to support or oppose political candidates, often focusing on those who advocate for favorable cryptocurrency policies. Shirzad noted it supports numerous Democratic lawmakers. 4. Is it common for companies like Coinbase to make political donations? Yes, it is common for large companies across various industries, including tech and finance, to make political donations. These contributions are typically aimed at advocating for specific policies, educating lawmakers, and shaping a regulatory environment conducive to their business operations, rather than seeking illegal favors. 5. Why is transparency in political donations important for the crypto industry? Transparency is crucial for the crypto industry to build and maintain public trust. Given the industry’s newness and evolving regulatory landscape, clear and ethical political engagement helps prevent perceptions of undue influence, ensures accountability, and demonstrates a commitment to fair and open governance.

His analysis compared Solana’s (SOL) market reaction earlier this year with the structural design of XRP’s demand model. The comparison underscored how certain tokens experience short-term appreciation through artificial demand, while others, such as XRP, are positioned for long-term growth through utility and adoption. SOLANA’S PRICE CAN BE ENGINEERED ARTIFICIALLY WHILE XRP’S PRICE DEPENDS ON ORGANIC DEMAND AND UTILITY Many people overlook how easily certain price surges can be manufactured. In January 2025, Solana’s price jumped 63% when Trump-themed tokens launched on its network.… pic.twitter.com/UFPM18oJJV — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 29, 2025 Solana’s January Price Movement In January 2025, Solana (SOL) recorded a temporary rise of approximately 63% following the launch of Trump-themed tokens on the Solana network. These tokens could only be purchased using SOL, creating immediate demand and a brief upward push in the token’s market price. The increase, however, did not reflect broader adoption or new utility within the Solana ecosystem. Once the initial trading activity slowed, the demand that drove the spike diminished, illustrating how easily price movements can be influenced by temporary mechanisms rather than sustained network growth. SMQKE noted that this kind of market reaction represents engineered activity—demand manufactured by token dependencies rather than being generated by real-world use or technological necessity. XRP’s Demand Model and Structural Integrity XRP operates under a fixed supply of 100 billion units, and no additional tokens can ever be created. This structure eliminates the possibility of supply expansion and aligns the token’s value with its utility within the Ripple protocol . Ripple’s own documentation states that the company’s business model depends on long-term, organic demand growth, which is expected to occur as the protocol becomes more widely adopted. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Demand for XRP arises from two primary functions. It secures the network through transaction fees that prevent spam or denial-of-service attacks, and it serves as a bridge asset for cross-border payments. Each transaction consumes a small amount of XRP , ensuring consistent use of the asset as network activity expands. This utility-driven demand ties the asset’s value directly to the growth of the system. The Basis of Enduring Value SMQKE’s analysis emphasized that XRP’s design supports sustained value through adoption rather than through speculative or event-driven activity. As institutions and payment providers continue to implement Ripple’s technology, the resulting increase in transaction volume directly increases the need for XRP. While Solana’s brief price surge was engineered through token mechanics, XRP’s framework ensures that its demand is linked to operational necessity. This defines the difference between short-term speculation and lasting economic value. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

However, a recent announcement from Upbit, one of the nation’s leading crypto exchanges, has signaled a temporary pause. This crucial maintenance period for its banking partner, K-Bank, will impact South Korean won (KRW) deposit and withdrawal services, requiring users to be aware and prepared. Understanding the Upbit KRW Services Suspension Upbit has officially communicated that it will temporarily suspend specific services to facilitate essential system maintenance at K-Bank. This isn’t an unusual occurrence in the financial sector, but it’s vital for users to grasp the specifics of this upcoming downtime. Such scheduled events are standard practice for maintaining robust financial infrastructure. What’s affected? Account verification, South Korean won (KRW) deposit services, and KRW withdrawal services. This means any transaction involving the conversion of KRW to crypto or vice-versa, or the movement of KRW in or out of your Upbit account, will be halted. When is it happening? The suspension is scheduled for approximately 10 hours. It’s a concentrated window designed to minimize long-term disruption. Exact Timings: The service interruption will run from 3:00 p.m. UTC on November 8th to 1:00 a.m. UTC on November 9th. Users in different time zones should convert these UTC times to their local time for accurate planning. Why? The primary reason is essential system maintenance by K-Bank, Upbit’s crucial banking partner. This ensures the underlying banking system remains secure and efficient. During this precise period, users will not be able to perform actions related to their South Korean won holdings on the platform. This proactive measure ensures the long-term stability and security of the financial infrastructure that supports Upbit KRW services , ultimately benefiting all users. Why is This Maintenance Crucial for Upbit Users? System maintenance, while sometimes inconvenient, is a cornerstone of reliable financial operations. For a major crypto exchange like Upbit, which processes significant transaction volumes daily, relying on robust banking partners like K-Bank is paramount. These scheduled downtimes are not merely technical necessities; they are strategic investments in service quality and security. Think of it like a regular, mandatory service check for a high-performance vehicle; it prevents bigger problems down the road. This maintenance helps in several critical ways: Enhancing Security: Regular updates are vital for patching vulnerabilities, upgrading encryption protocols, and strengthening defenses against cyber threats. This protects user funds and personal data. Improving Stability: Ensuring that the banking systems can handle peak loads and operate without unexpected crashes or slowdowns. A stable system means reliable transactions for users. Optimizing Performance: Upgrading hardware and software infrastructure to process transactions more quickly and efficiently. This leads to a smoother user experience once services resume. Regulatory Compliance: Financial institutions, including their crypto exchange partners, often undergo system audits and upgrades to comply with evolving financial regulations, ensuring continued legal operation of Upbit KRW services . Users who frequently utilize Upbit KRW services for quick deposits or withdrawals should plan their transactions accordingly to avoid any disruption to their trading strategies or immediate financial needs. This foresight can prevent missed opportunities or liquidity issues. Navigating the Temporary Halt in Upbit KRW Services While KRW deposits and withdrawals will be on hold, it’s important to remember that not all Upbit services will cease. Cryptocurrency trading, for instance, typically remains unaffected during such banking partner maintenance, allowing users to continue trading crypto-to-crypto pairs. Here’s what you can do to manage your funds effectively and minimize impact: Plan Ahead: If you anticipate needing KRW funds for expenses or external transfers, process your withdrawals well before the suspension window begins. Similarly, if you need to deposit KRW to capitalize on market movements, do so in advance. Alternative Funding: Consider using crypto deposits if you need to fund your Upbit account during the downtime. Many exchanges allow direct crypto transfers from other wallets or exchanges, assuming this service remains active (always double-check Upbit’s official notice for full scope). Monitor Official Channels: Keep a close eye on Upbit’s official website, app notifications, and social media channels for any real-time updates, schedule changes, or resumption announcements. Understand Scope: Reiterate that this specifically impacts KRW-related transactions and account verification linked to K-Bank. Other crypto-related activities should generally proceed as usual. Staying informed and proactive is the best way to ensure a seamless experience, even during temporary interruptions to Upbit KRW services . Communication is key, and Upbit usually provides clear guidance. Looking Ahead: The Importance of Preparedness This temporary suspension by Upbit serves as a valuable reminder for all cryptocurrency users about the dynamic nature of digital finance. Exchanges, like any financial institution, require periodic updates and maintenance to ensure long-term operational integrity and security. These events are part of a mature financial ecosystem. Being prepared means adopting best practices that contribute to a more resilient and less stressful crypto journey: Diversifying Holdings: Avoid solely relying on one exchange for all your assets or one fiat on/off-ramp. Spreading funds across multiple reputable platforms can mitigate risks during specific service downtimes. Regularly Checking Notifications: Make it a habit to review announcements from your primary exchanges. Subscribing to email alerts or checking news feeds can keep you informed. Understanding Operational Hours: Be aware of when critical services, especially fiat gateways, might be affected by scheduled maintenance or public holidays. Maintaining Emergency Funds: Always have a portion of your funds readily accessible outside of active trading accounts for immediate needs. While the Upbit KRW services suspension is a minor, scheduled event, it underscores the need for user awareness and proactive planning in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. In conclusion, Upbit’s temporary suspension of KRW deposit and withdrawal services, necessitated by K-Bank’s essential system maintenance, is a routine but important event. Scheduled for approximately 10 hours from November 8th to 9th UTC, this pause is crucial for ensuring the ongoing stability, security, and performance of the platform. By understanding the affected services, planning transactions in advance, and staying informed through official channels, users can navigate this period smoothly. This proactive approach not only minimizes inconvenience but also reinforces the robustness of the underlying financial infrastructure supporting South Korea’s vibrant crypto market. Upbit’s commitment to these necessary updates ultimately benefits its entire user base. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What specific Upbit services will be suspended? Upbit will temporarily suspend account verification, South Korean won (KRW) deposit services, and KRW withdrawal services during the maintenance period. 2. How long will the Upbit KRW services suspension last? The suspension is scheduled for approximately 10 hours, from 3:00 p.m. UTC on November 8th to 1:00 a.m. UTC on November 9th. 3. Why is Upbit suspending KRW services? The suspension is due to essential system maintenance being conducted by K-Bank, Upbit’s banking partner. This ensures the stability, security, and performance of the financial infrastructure. 4. Can I still trade cryptocurrencies on Upbit during the maintenance? Yes, typically cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency trading services remain unaffected during such banking partner maintenance. The suspension primarily impacts KRW-related transactions. 5. What should I do if I need to deposit or withdraw KRW during the suspension? Users are advised to plan ahead and complete any necessary KRW deposits or withdrawals before the suspension window begins.

A recent MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer saw an astounding 22,704 BTC, valued at approximately $2.45 billion, shifted to a series of new digital wallets. This significant on-chain activity, first reported by Lookonchain, has naturally captured the attention of investors and market observers alike, prompting questions about its implications for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Happened with This MicroStrategy Bitcoin Transfer? Over the past nine hours, MicroStrategy executed a substantial transfer of its Bitcoin holdings. Specifically, 22,704 BTC, amounting to a staggering $2.45 billion, was moved. This action involved distributing the vast sum across several newly created wallets. Such large-scale movements are common among institutional holders. They often reflect strategic decisions related to security, operational management, or even preparing for future financial activities. However, the sheer size of this particular MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer makes it noteworthy. Why Do Large Holders Execute Such Massive Transfers? There are several compelling reasons why a corporate entity like MicroStrategy might undertake such a significant redistribution of its digital assets. These reasons primarily revolve around enhanced security and optimized operational efficiency. Enhanced Security: Moving funds to new, diversified wallets can be a proactive security measure. It reduces the risk associated with having all assets concentrated in a few locations, making them less vulnerable to potential exploits. Operational Reorganization: Companies often re-evaluate and update their internal wallet management systems. This could involve setting up new multi-signature wallets, transitioning to new custody solutions, or preparing for new accounting protocols. Preparation for Future Events: While speculative, a large transfer could also precede other strategic moves, such as a rebalancing of assets, preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or even integrating new technological solutions for asset management. It is important to understand that a MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude does not necessarily signal an intent to sell. In fact, MicroStrategy has consistently affirmed its long-term conviction in Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. MicroStrategy’s Unwavering Bitcoin Strategy: What Does It Mean? MicroStrategy, under the leadership of its co-founder Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. The company has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin since 2020, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder. This strategy reflects a deep belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value as a hedge against inflation and a superior store of value. Therefore, any significant MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer is typically viewed through the lens of their established HODL (hold on for dear life) philosophy. Their past actions and public statements consistently reinforce their commitment to accumulating and holding Bitcoin for the long term, rather than engaging in short-term trading. This commitment provides a strong signal to the market. It demonstrates institutional confidence in Bitcoin, which can positively influence broader investor sentiment and potentially encourage other corporations to consider similar treasury strategies. Implications for the Crypto Market: A Closer Look While this particular MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer is an internal corporate action, its sheer scale and the company’s prominence mean it has broader implications for the cryptocurrency market: Reinforced Confidence: The move, understood as a security or operational enhancement, can reinforce confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability among institutional investors. It suggests careful, strategic management of significant digital assets. Transparency of On-Chain Data: The fact that such a large transfer was immediately visible and reported by on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain highlights the inherent transparency of public blockchains. This transparency is a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem. Market Stability: Crucially, this transfer does not appear to be a selling event. This helps to alleviate any potential fears of a large market dump, contributing to overall market stability rather than volatility. Understanding the nuances of these large transfers is vital for market participants. They often provide insights into the sophisticated asset management strategies employed by major institutional players. The recent MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer of 22,704 BTC to new wallets stands as a powerful testament to the ongoing evolution of institutional engagement with digital assets. Far from signaling a change in strategy, this move likely underscores MicroStrategy’s commitment to robust security practices and efficient asset management for its substantial Bitcoin holdings. As the largest corporate holder, MicroStrategy’s actions continue to be a significant barometer for institutional confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. It reminds us that behind the headlines, strategic and meticulous planning is always at play in the world of large-scale crypto investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is MicroStrategy? A1: MicroStrategy is a business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services company that has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, accumulating billions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency as a primary treasury asset. Q2: How much Bitcoin did MicroStrategy transfer? A2: MicroStrategy transferred 22,704 BTC, which was valued at approximately $2.45 billion at the time of the transfer, to multiple new wallets. Q3: Does this transfer mean MicroStrategy is selling its Bitcoin? A3: No, a transfer of this nature typically does not indicate an intent to sell. Large institutional transfers are often for security enhancements, operational reorganization, or internal asset management, consistent with MicroStrategy’s long-term holding strategy. Q4: Why are large Bitcoin transfers visible to the public? A4: Bitcoin operates on a public blockchain, meaning all transactions, including transfers between wallets, are recorded and transparently visible to anyone. On-chain analytics firms like Lookonchain monitor and report these activities. Q5: What are the implications of this MicroStrategy Bitcoin transfer for the crypto market? A5: This transfer reinforces confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability by showcasing robust institutional asset management.

Just moments ago, this particular Bitcoin OG deposited an additional 200 BTC, valued at approximately $21.94 million, directly to the Kraken exchange. This crucial information comes from Onchain Lens, a reputable source that meticulously tracks significant blockchain movements. The address in question, beginning with 1E2JG2, is not new to such high-volume activity. In fact, this same address has been notably active over the past three weeks. It has sent a staggering total of 6,003 BTC—worth an incredible $671.55 million—to various exchanges. Such large-scale movements by a long-term holder, frequently referred to as a Bitcoin OG , are always under intense scrutiny by market analysts and investors alike. While the exact identity of this specific Bitcoin OG remains anonymous, their wallet address provides a clear, traceable trail of significant market participation. These “Original Gangsters” of Bitcoin are pioneers who acquired BTC when its value was negligible. Therefore, their decisions to buy, hold, or sell carry immense weight due to the sheer volume of their holdings and their perceived deep understanding of the asset. What Does a Bitcoin OG’s Deposit to Kraken Typically Imply? Historically, substantial deposits of Bitcoin to exchanges are widely interpreted as a strong indicator of an intent to sell. When a holder moves their BTC from a secure cold storage wallet to an exchange platform, it is typically done to make the assets readily available for trading or liquidation. This action prepares the Bitcoin for market entry. For the broader market, this sudden influx of supply can potentially increase selling pressure, especially if the volume is substantial. Given this particular Bitcoin OG ‘s consistent track record of offloading holdings recently, the latest Kraken deposit only adds to the prevailing speculative atmosphere. Key implications that market observers often consider include: Increased Supply: A larger quantity of BTC becoming available on exchanges could lead to lower prices if current market demand does not adequately match this increased supply. Market Sentiment Shift: Such high-profile moves by a Bitcoin OG can frequently trigger FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among other investors, leading to a broader negative sentiment. Are Bitcoin OGs Signaling a Downturn, or Simply Rebalancing Their Portfolios? It is crucial for investors to consider various perspectives when analyzing these large-scale movements. While an intent to sell is indeed the primary and most common interpretation, it is certainly not the only possible explanation. A Bitcoin OG might be engaging in these transfers for several strategic reasons: Portfolio Rebalancing: They might be strategically diversifying their assets or taking profits after a significant price rally to lock in gains. Preparing for an OTC Deal: Large transactions, especially those involving such substantial amounts, sometimes occur off-exchange through Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks to minimize direct market impact. However, the consistent pattern of offloading by this specific Bitcoin OG over the past three weeks strongly suggests a trend of profit-taking or a strategic exit. This sustained selling pressure from such a significant, long-term holder could indeed indicate a cautious outlook from some of Bitcoin’s earliest and most influential investors. Navigating Market Volatility: What Should Investors Consider After a Bitcoin OG’s Move? For individual investors, observing the actions of a prominent Bitcoin OG can offer valuable insights into market dynamics. However, it should never be the sole basis for making investment decisions. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and complex, and large whale movements represent just one piece of a much larger and intricate puzzle. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such market events: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor on-chain data, market news, and expert analyses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single asset. Diversification helps mitigate risks. Practice Robust Risk Management: Only invest capital that you are genuinely prepared to lose. Maintain a Long-Term Vision: Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition rather than reacting impulsively to short-term fluctuations driven by whale activity. The recent activity of this influential Bitcoin OG vividly highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market, where large players can significantly influence overall sentiment and short-term price action. Staying informed and maintaining a disciplined approach are paramount. The latest deposit of 200 BTC by a prominent Bitcoin OG to Kraken is undeniably a significant event that warrants close attention from the crypto community. While such moves typically suggest an intention to sell, potentially adding selling pressure to the market, it also serves as a potent reminder of the strategic decisions made by early adopters. Whether this particular action signals a broader market shift or merely a personal portfolio adjustment remains to be seen. Nevertheless, it undoubtedly adds another compelling layer of intrigue to Bitcoin’s ongoing and ever-evolving narrative, emphasizing the constant interplay between on-chain data and market psychology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Bitcoin OG? A: A Bitcoin OG (Original Gangster) refers to an early adopter of Bitcoin who acquired a significant amount of BTC during its nascent stages, often when its value was very low. These individuals typically hold large quantities of Bitcoin and their movements are closely watched for market insights. Q2: Why are deposits to exchanges interpreted as an intent to sell? A: When Bitcoin is moved from a private, secure wallet (cold storage) to an exchange, it becomes readily accessible for trading, selling, or other market activities. This makes it a strong signal that the holder intends to liquidate or utilize their assets on the open market. Q3: How much Bitcoin did this specific OG deposit to Kraken? A: The Bitcoin OG deposited an additional 200 BTC, which was valued at approximately $21.94 million at the time of the transaction. Q4: Has this Bitcoin OG made similar moves recently? A: Yes, according to Onchain Lens, this address has been quite active over the past three weeks, having sent a total of 6,003 BTC (worth around $671.55 million) to various exchanges. Q5: Does a Bitcoin OG’s selling always mean the market will crash? A: Not necessarily. While large sales can create selling pressure and impact sentiment, they don’t guarantee a market crash. Such moves can also be for portfolio rebalancing, OTC deals, or other strategic reasons. The overall market dynamics are influenced by many factors beyond a single whale’s actions.

This is part of Coinbase’s plan to become an “Everything Exchange.” The company reported $1.9 billion in revenue, up 55% year-on-year, and $432.6 million in net income, fueled by strong trading and subscription revenues. Institutional clients accounted for 80% of Coinbase’s $295 billion trading volume. Meanwhile, CEO Brian Armstrong turned heads after intentionally dropping crypto buzzwords like “Bitcoin” and “Web3” at the end of the earnings call, which instantly resolved prediction markets on Kalshi and Polymarket. Though playful, the stunt caused some debate over fairness in prediction markets and insider influence. Coinbase Grows Bitcoin Stash Coinbase greatly strengthened its position in the Bitcoin ecosystem after adding 2,772 BTC to its holdings in the third quarter as part of its attempt to evolve into what it calls an “Everything Exchange.” The company’s total Bitcoin reserves now stand at 14,548 BTC, which is valued at approximately $1.57 billion. The latest quarterly report also showed robust financial performance, with net income surging more than fivefold to $432.6 million year-on-year, while total revenue climbed 55% to $1.9 billion. The gains were largely driven by a resurgence in trading activity and growth in subscription-based revenue streams, which include stablecoin-related income and blockchain rewards. Transaction revenue reached $1.05 billion, while subscription and services revenue increased 34.3% to $746.7 million. Coinbase credited its growth to progress made toward realizing its “Everything Exchange” vision. This is an ambitious plan to offer a comprehensive suite of crypto and tokenized products under one platform. Coinbase Q3 financial results (Source: Coinbase ) The company said it made headway in Q3 by expanding its lineup of tradable spot assets, enhancing its derivatives offerings, and building the foundation for new verticals, like tokenized stocks, prediction markets, and early-stage token sales. A major component of this strategy is Coinbase’s deepening integration with Circle’s USDC stablecoin to advance stablecoin adoption globally. Institutional engagement is still a dominant force in Coinbase’s business model. In fact, institutional clients accounted for 80% of the company’s $295 billion trading volume during the quarter. Assets under custody also hit an all-time high above $300 billion. The firm’s $299 million Bitcoin accumulation also proves that Coinbase believes in BTC as a core long-term asset. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 network, Base, continued to see strong adoption across trading, payments, lending, and social applications. The company also introduced Flashblocks, a preconfirmation feature that allows for transaction speeds of up to 200 milliseconds. However, CEO Brian Armstrong declined to share updates on the potential launch of a Base token during the earnings call. Coinbase Boss Turns Prediction Markets Brian Armstrong also caused quite a stir in crypto prediction markets at the end of the company’s third-quarter earnings call on Thursday when he deliberately dropped a string of crypto buzzwords that instantly resolved two active markets to “yes.” The unexpected move impacted prediction platforms Kalshi and Polymarket, where users placed bets on whether Armstrong would mention specific terms during the call. Just as the event was wrapping up, Armstrong said, “I was a little distracted because I was tracking the predictions market about what Coinbase will say in their next earnings call, and I just want to add here, the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain, staking, and Web3, make sure we get those in before the end of the call.” His spontaneous remark instantly determined the outcomes of both markets, which left traders with mixed reactions. Some of the words that were bet on to be said during the Coinbase earnings call (Source: Polymarket ) Kalshi and Polymarket users wagered $80,242 and $3,912 respectively on the outcome, with only modest sums on the line per participant — no one on Polymarket lost more than $12 on a single bet. While some traders were delighted and praised Armstrong for his playful intervention, others were uneasy over how easily a prediction market could be influenced by insider awareness. On X, Armstrong later clarified that his comment was unplanned, and said that it happened “spontaneously when someone on our team dropped a [prediction markets] link in the chat.” The reaction across both platforms leaned largely positive, with Polymarket users calling Armstrong “the GOAT” and Kalshi traders thanking him for the surprise “gift.” Still, the incident reignited conversations about the integrity of prediction markets, which depend heavily on trust and fair play, especially when participants have insider knowledge.

53851835,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=849629,1761888626,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53851835.jpeg,Canary has submitted an updated S-1 registration statement for its XRP spot ETF,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/canary-xrp-etf-set-for-november-launch/,"The proposed XRP spot ETF is set to start trading on Nasdaq as soon as November 13, following the submission of an amended S-1 registration statement for the asset manager, Canary, to the SEC. With the update, the ETF now qualifies to take effect automatically under Section 8(a) of the 1933 Securities Act. Journalist Eleanor Terrett of FOX Business said this could allow a November 13 rollout, assuming Nasdaq signs off. On X, she commented, “CanaryFunds has filed an updated S-1 for its $XRP spot ETF, removing the ‘delaying amendment’ that stops a registration from going auto-effective and gives the SEC control over timing. This sets Canary’s $XRP ETF up for a launch date of November 13, assuming the Nasdaq greenlights the 8-A filing.” The filing follows further market expectations after Solana, Litecoin , and Hedera ETFs were approved earlier this week under the same auto-effective registration. Importantly, the ETF’s issuer added a clause in its S-1 that allows for launches if the exchange filed the 8-A. As such, the SEC did not need to approve the spot-ETFs, as no further comments were received during the review window. Terett says the government reopening may affect the Canary XRP ETF listing timeline Terett, however, noted that the government’s reopening could influence the listing schedule , with an earlier launch possible if the SEC approves promptly, or delays if more staff review is needed. Still, the SEC Chair has personally indicated openness to firms opting for the auto-effective process, according to the Fox Business journalist. She noted that Chair Paul Atkins welcomed companies like MapLight, which used the 20-day statutory waiting period to go public, proclaiming the very same provision upon which Bitwise and Canary relied to launch their recent SOL, HBAR, and LTC ETFs. With the updated submission, Canary’s XRP ETF can move forward without a formal SEC sign-off, and it appears to be more than ready to proceed once the statutory 20-day period has passed. The only potential holdup would be if the SEC issues additional comments or concerns. If an XRP spot ETF is finally launched, analysts believe it could help spark massive institutional demand. As a result, XRP’s token price could skyrocket to all-new record highs. However, traders will likely wait until the ETF officially begins trading to gauge market appetite. Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg has been increasingly optimistic about demand for XRP-spot ETFs. He recently increased his XRP-spot ETF inflow forecast, stating, “I may have been a little bearish. We’re going to hold to that number. If it hits that number, at least I’ll be right, and if it’s $10 billion, then I’m still right because we got at least $5 billion. If we saw that kind of inflow, I think it would definitely be in the top 20 ETFs of all time, if not in the top 10.” Canary XRP ETF will follow the CoinDesk XRP CCIXber Reference Rate. The Canary XRP ETF is designed to provide investors with a way to hold XRP directly in the trust, without fees and liabilities. The exchange-traded fund will be listed on Nasdaq and will follow the CoinDesk XRP CCIXber Reference Rate. The index is based on the aggregate trading volume of XRP across various platforms. The underlying assets will be placed in custody by Gemini Trust Company and BitGo Trust Company. According to its latest filing, Canary has added XRP, Solana, and HBAR ETF products to the DTCC, further broadening its offering for institutions. Now, T. Rowe Price has also submitted an ETF filing for digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, as public anticipation for investment products related to cryptocurrencies increases. ProShares has also filed for a similarly structured index ETF based on Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies. The ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca, as per the SEC filing, and will provide investors with the opportunity to invest in 5-15 individual crypto assets.

This definitive stance provides valuable insight into Strategy’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin and its unique approach to corporate treasury management, signaling a focused path forward for one of the crypto world’s most prominent institutional investors. Why Strategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Sidesteps Mergers and Acquisitions? During a recent third-quarter earnings call, Saylor elaborated on the company’s position, shedding light on the inherent complexities and uncertainties associated with mergers and acquisitions (M&A). His perspective is rooted in practical experience and a desire for optimal efficiency. Significant Uncertainty: M&A deals often come with unforeseen challenges, ranging from intricate legal due diligence to unexpected valuation discrepancies and integration hurdles. These can quickly erode the perceived value of an acquisition. Protracted Timelines: Saylor noted that even seemingly profitable deals can take over a year to finalize. This extended period ties up capital and management resources, creating a significant opportunity cost. Operational Distraction: The intricate process of integrating another company—merging cultures, systems, and personnel—can pull management’s attention away from Strategy’s core business objectives and its primary focus on Bitcoin. Dilution of Focus: Acquiring another business means inheriting its operational complexities, which could dilute Strategy’s singular mission of being a pure-play Bitcoin treasury company. While acknowledging that he wouldn’t “rule out an acquisition entirely” under truly exceptional and compelling circumstances, Saylor’s remarks strongly emphasize the company’s current, highly focused Bitcoin acquisition strategy . He prioritizes clarity and efficiency above all else. What is Strategy’s Core Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy: A Direct Path to Value? Instead of complex M&A, Strategy employs a straightforward and transparent approach designed to maximize direct exposure to Bitcoin. Saylor clearly outlined the company’s primary objectives, which have become a benchmark for institutional Bitcoin adoption: Selling Digital Bonds: Strategy effectively leverages capital markets to raise funds through the issuance of digital bonds, attracting investors interested in Bitcoin exposure through a corporate vehicle. Improving Financial Position: These funds are strategically used to enhance the company’s balance sheet, ensuring financial stability and the capacity for sustained Bitcoin purchases. Purchasing Bitcoin: A significant portion of the raised capital is then directly invested into Bitcoin, establishing it as a primary treasury reserve asset. This is done systematically and strategically. Sharing Performance with Investors: The ultimate goal is to allow investors to participate directly in the performance of Bitcoin, unburdened by the operational complexities of other businesses or the risks associated with M&A. This deliberate Bitcoin acquisition strategy allows Strategy to maintain agility and focus solely on its mission: accumulating and holding Bitcoin for the long term. It’s a strategy that has positioned Strategy as a leading corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, influencing how other companies might view digital assets and corporate treasury management. How Does This Focused Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Benefit Investors and the Market? Strategy’s clear stance sends a strong message to the market. It underscores a belief that direct exposure to Bitcoin, without the added baggage of corporate operations or the integration risks of M&A, offers the purest form of investment in the digital gold. This approach can be seen as a blueprint for other companies considering adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, offering a model of simplicity and directness that is appealing. Saylor’s philosophy views Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a superior treasury asset. By focusing purely on its Bitcoin acquisition strategy , Strategy maximizes its exposure to Bitcoin’s potential growth while minimizing operational risks associated with integrating disparate businesses. This dedication provides a clear investment thesis. For investors, this means a clear understanding of Strategy’s value proposition: a publicly traded vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin. This clarity is a significant benefit in the often-complex world of corporate finance and cryptocurrency investment. It avoids the dilution of focus that M&A often brings, ensuring that every strategic decision aligns with the core objective of Bitcoin accumulation. The transparency and single-mindedness of this strategy are key differentiators. What Does This Mean for Strategy’s Future and Its Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? Strategy’s consistent and unwavering Bitcoin acquisition strategy demonstrates a deep commitment to a singular vision. It reinforces the idea that for some companies, the most effective way to engage with Bitcoin is through direct ownership and a disciplined accumulation plan, rather than attempting to consolidate the holdings of other entities. This approach has proven highly successful for Strategy, allowing it to become a significant player in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin and continues to shape its identity in the financial landscape. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, Strategy’s focused approach serves as a compelling case study. It highlights the potential for companies to leverage Bitcoin as a treasury asset without venturing into complex corporate maneuvers. This strategic clarity offers both stability and a clear direction for investors looking to align with a company dedicated to the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Strategy’s primary goal regarding Bitcoin? Strategy’s primary goal is to accumulate and hold Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, providing investors with direct exposure to its performance without the complexities of other business operations. 2. Why does Michael Saylor avoid acquiring other Bitcoin-holding companies? Saylor avoids M&A due to significant uncertainties, protracted timelines, operational distractions, and the potential dilution of Strategy’s core focus on direct Bitcoin accumulation. 3. How does Strategy fund its Bitcoin purchases? Strategy primarily funds its Bitcoin purchases by issuing digital bonds in capital markets and improving its overall financial position. 4. What are the benefits of Strategy’s direct Bitcoin acquisition strategy for investors? Investors benefit from a clear, focused value proposition, direct exposure to Bitcoin’s performance, and reduced operational risks associated with complex M&A activities. 5. Could Strategy ever consider an acquisition in the future? While Michael Saylor hasn’t ruled out an acquisition entirely, he emphasizes that it would only be under truly exceptional and compelling circumstances, as the current focus remains on direct Bitcoin accumulation.

They’ve made a strategic move, announcing the powerful KARRAT staking of 20 million tokens on Studio Chain nodes. This isn’t just a number; it’s a bold statement about their commitment to the ecosystem and the future of decentralized entertainment. This monumental action truly unleashes a new era of possibilities for both Animoca Brands and the KARRAT community. What Exactly is KARRAT Staking, and Why Does it Matter? At its core, KARRAT staking involves locking up a certain amount of KARRAT tokens to support the operations of a blockchain network, in this case, Studio Chain. By staking these tokens, Animoca Brands is actively participating in the network’s security and governance. Think of it as putting capital to work to ensure the smooth functioning and integrity of a decentralized platform. This commitment helps validate transactions and maintain the network’s stability. Staking is a fundamental mechanism in many proof-of-stake blockchains. It provides: Enhanced Network Security: Staked tokens act as collateral, discouraging malicious behavior and ensuring network integrity.

CEO Antonio Filosa told analysts and investors that Stellantis is “monitoring day-by-day the chip situation from Nexperia” and “pushing actions and projects every day” to keep its factories running without stoppages. The global auto industry has once again been facing the risk of supply chain chaos, this time not because of a pandemic but because of politics. The Dutch government recently took control of Nexperia after Washington raised national security concerns. Nexperia, owned by China’s Wingtech Technology, was accused of posing risks in an emergency scenario. Beijing retaliated by blocking exports of the company’s finished chips, setting off alarms from Europe to North America. Automakers rush to contain chip fallout Honda Motor was the first to cut output this week, confirming that production lines at its U.S., Canada, and Mexico plants have been adjusted. The company called it an “industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue” and described the situation as “fluid.” Honda said it is “making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts.” Volkswagen said it has enough chips to maintain output through the week but expects potential disruptions soon after, while other automakers are working overtime to stay ahead. Like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who told reporters in Washington that the chip issue is “a political problem” and said he has been speaking with both U.S. and Chinese officials to avoid fourth-quarter production losses. “A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry,” Jim said. General Motors CEO Mary Barra echoed that sentiment, saying GM teams are “working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions.” Mary warned that while production could be affected, updates will continue throughout the quarter. Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius added that this is “a politically induced situation” and said the only solution lies “in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, with Europe caught in the middle.” The Dutch government’s intervention in Nexperia late last month was seen as extraordinary. Officials said they acted because the company’s chip technologies “would become unavailable in an emergency.” But that decision has backfired, leading to export restrictions that have hit automakers’ access to legacy semiconductors; the basic chips used in systems like windshield wipers, windows, and door controls. Suppliers, governments, and war rooms scramble for solutions To keep factories alive, many automakers have established their own war rooms to track the situation and search for alternative suppliers and chips sold directly on the open market, which are pretty expensive. The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA) said in an emailed statement that “suppliers across the motor vehicle industry are working to understand the potential effects on production and supply continuity.” MEMA stressed that “even the absence of a single diode or chip can disrupt the manufacture of vehicles.” The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) warned that “assembly line stoppages might only be days away.” ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries urged governments to “redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation.” Nexperia, which produces high-volume chips for automotive and consumer products, said in a statement that it is seeking an exemption from the export restrictions. A Wingtech spokesperson condemned the Dutch decision, saying the company “will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so.” The spokesperson added that restoring “full control and ownership rights to the company’s rightful shareholders and management” is essential to “repair the damage to its reputation and de-escalate international tension.” For now, the industry waits. The meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping earlier this week offered no breakthrough.

Nordea, the largest bank in Northern Europe, managing a staggering $286 billion in assets, is set to offer Bitcoin ETP services to its clients. This move, reported by Cointelegraph , represents a pivotal moment, especially given the bank’s previously cautious stance on cryptocurrencies. Beginning in December, Nordea will introduce a Bitcoin ETP from CoinShares, a renowned crypto asset manager. This development provides Nordea’s clients with a regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin, merging the world of traditional banking with the burgeoning digital asset economy. Why is Nordea Embracing Bitcoin ETPs Now? For a long time, Nordea maintained a wary approach to cryptocurrencies. Their primary concern stemmed from the unregulated nature of the broader crypto market. However, the financial landscape is constantly evolving, and client demand has proven to be a powerful catalyst for change. Client-Driven Demand: Nordea explicitly stated that its decision to offer Bitcoin ETP services is a direct response to growing client interest. Many clients are keen to diversify their portfolios with digital assets but prefer doing so through trusted, regulated channels. Evolving Regulatory Clarity: While the underlying crypto market can be complex, products like ETPs operate within established financial regulatory frameworks. This provides an additional layer of security and oversight, addressing some of Nordea’s initial concerns. Structured Exposure: An ETP offers a more structured and familiar investment vehicle for traditional investors compared to direct cryptocurrency purchases and self-custody. This strategic pivot highlights a broader trend: as the crypto ecosystem matures, traditional financial institutions are finding ways to integrate digital assets responsibly. What Does a Bitcoin ETP Offer Clients? Understanding what a Bitcoin ETP entails is crucial for investors. An Exchange Traded Product (ETP) functions similarly to an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). It is an investment vehicle that tracks the price performance of an underlying asset, in this case, Bitcoin. Here are some key benefits and considerations for Nordea’s clients: Accessibility: Clients can invest in Bitcoin through their existing Nordea brokerage accounts, simplifying the process and eliminating the need for new crypto exchange accounts. No Self-Custody Required: Investors do not need to worry about the technical complexities or security risks associated with holding Bitcoin directly. The ETP handles the custody of the underlying asset. Regulated Framework: The ETP is subject to financial regulations, offering a level of investor protection not always present in direct crypto investments. Liquidity: ETPs are traded on regulated exchanges, providing liquidity and ease of buying and selling during market hours. It is important to remember that while the ETP provides regulated access, the value of the investment will still be subject to the inherent volatility of the Bitcoin market. The Broader Impact: A Milestone for Crypto Adoption? Nordea’s decision to offer a Bitcoin ETP is more than just a new service; it is a powerful statement. As Northern Europe’s largest bank, its move sends a strong signal to other financial institutions globally. This adoption by a major player in traditional finance contributes significantly to the legitimization and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets. This development could pave the way for: Increased institutional interest and investment in crypto-backed products. Further innovation in regulated crypto investment vehicles. Greater confidence among retail investors, seeing traditional banks endorse digital assets. For clients, this means a new avenue for portfolio diversification and exposure to a rapidly growing asset class, all within the trusted environment of their primary banking relationship. It marks an exciting chapter where traditional finance and digital assets converge. In conclusion, Nordea’s introduction of Bitcoin ETP services is a landmark event. It underscores the undeniable demand for digital assets and the increasing willingness of major financial institutions to adapt and innovate. This move not only benefits Nordea’s clients but also serves as a significant milestone in the ongoing journey of cryptocurrency into the global financial mainstream. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is a Bitcoin ETP? A Bitcoin ETP (Exchange Traded Product) is an investment vehicle that tracks the price of Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning or holding the cryptocurrency itself. Why did Nordea change its cautious stance on cryptocurrencies? Nordea cited significant client demand as the primary reason for changing its stance. While previously cautious due to the unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies, the bank recognized the need to provide clients with regulated access to digital assets. Who is CoinShares, the provider of the Bitcoin ETP? CoinShares is a prominent European digital asset investment firm. They specialize in providing financial products and services for investors to gain exposure to digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. What are the main benefits of investing in a Bitcoin ETP through a bank like Nordea? Investing through Nordea offers several benefits, including accessibility through existing brokerage accounts, no need for self-custody of Bitcoin, and the assurance of investing in a product that operates within a regulated financial framework. Is a Bitcoin ETP considered a regulated investment? Yes, while the underlying asset (Bitcoin) may operate in a less regulated environment, the ETP itself is a financial product that is typically regulated by financial authorities, providing a layer of investor protection and oversight.

At 4:30 PM ET, Apple ($AAPL) reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revealed a cash reserve of over $132 billion. Just a minute later, by 4:31 PM ET, the stock fell by 5%, shocking traders who were expecting a rally. Then at 4:45 PM ET, it surged by 8% from its low, adding roughly $320 billion in market value and turning positive. Apple’s results showed it’s still battling supply issues but managing to beat Wall Street’s expectations where it counts. CEO Tim Cook gave a bullish forecast for the holiday quarter, saying iPhone sales would grow by double digits year over year, while total revenue should rise 10–12%. Analysts had estimated only 9.8% growth for iPhones and 6.6% for overall revenue. Those numbers put Apple ahead of consensus for its fiscal first quarter of 2026. Apple faces supply strain and China delays The company is racing to fulfill demand for the iPhone 17 lineup, which remains constrained even as orders pile up. Some models of the iPhone 16 are also facing delays, leaving Apple scrambling to meet demand heading into the holidays. The backlog, however, didn’t stop profit from topping expectations. Strong performance from new AI-powered AirPods, which can translate languages in real time, helped balance the weaker iPhone numbers in the previous quarter. Tim told Reuters that the delay in shipping new models to China was the main reason behind weaker sales there. He said the launch of the new iPhone Air, the thinnest device Apple has ever made and its biggest design change in years, was slowed by logistical setbacks. “However, we’re very enthusiastic about China,” Tim said. “We love the response to the new products there, and we expect to grow or to return to growth in Q1.” He added that supply limits are still a problem but one that comes from too much demand, not too little. “Currently in Q1, we’re experiencing supply constraints still on several models of the iPhone 17, and we’re filling orders just as fast as we can. It’s a good problem to have.” AI, tariffs, and the investor gap Among the Magnificent Seven tech giants, Apple’s stock gains have been slower this year as investors wait to see its big move in artificial intelligence. The company has confirmed that major Siri upgrades are coming next year, with Cook saying the team is “making good progress” on those updates. Natalie Hwang, founding managing partner of Apeira Capital, said , “The expectation of a strong holiday quarter gives Apple a runway to reaffirm demand, but it will be interesting to see how effectively it converts that momentum into a durable AI and infrastructure advantage.” Still, Apple isn’t escaping the cost of doing business in Trump’s America. The company remains exposed to the U.S.–China trade war, and executives reported $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs last quarter. Kevan Parekh, Apple’s Chief Financial Officer, said those costs could climb to $1.4 billion in the current quarter ending in December, pushing gross margins to 47–48%. Wall Street’s average estimate sits at 46.9%.

According to Rajappa, markets are still pricing in too much easing in monetary policy, despite Fed Chair Jerome Powell making it clear in December that a rate cut was not a certainty. Rajappa argued that the Fed took the last two interest rate cuts as preemptive steps in anticipation of a possible weakening in the labor market, but that there was limited room left for further action. Rajappa noted that the economy remains relatively strong, but that the inflation outlook remains stubborn. According to the analyst, this is the main message Powell is trying to convey in his recent remarks: The Fed will not act hastily and will maintain a cautious stance against persistent inflation. Related News: BREAKING: Likely Date for XRP Spot ETFs Set - Final Hurdle Cleared On the other hand, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf shared his views on the Fed's monetary policy, the necessity of interest rate cuts, and economic risks in his speech at The Economic Club of New York. Scharf praised Fed Chair Jerome Powell's transparent communication, while characterizing potential interest rate cuts as economic “risk management.” Scharf began his remarks by describing the Fed Chair's role as “ungrateful.” He noted that the assumption that decisions could have different outcomes always creates an environment open to criticism. However, Scharf considered the way Fed Chair Powell described the situation “as clear as it could be.” Addressing the further interest rate cuts the market is expecting this year, Scharf argued that risk management lies at the heart of this decision: Risk of Backsliding: “Once you fall behind on some of these risks—lower growth and higher inflation—that would be a really bad outcome and hard to recover from,” Scharf said. Protecting the Downside: Scharf noted that there is “no risk-free answer” to whether or not to cut interest rates, saying the current balance is more focused on “protecting the downside.” When asked how low interest rates would help jobs lost due to AI, Scharf noted that low rates generally benefit consumers. He argued that interest rates are especially important for the most struggling demographics. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will the Fed Cut Interest Rates in December?

The drop surprised some analysts, given that most expected the rate decision to be priced into markets. Despite the modest policy shift, risk appetite weakened as investors grew cautious about the Fed’s future trajectory and broader economic conditions. Fed Signals End of Balance Sheet Reduction The Fed’s statement confirmed that quantitative tightening would end on December 1, marking a significant policy shift after months of balance sheet contraction. This change, often viewed as supportive for markets, did little to immediately lift crypto sentiment. The central bank’s updated “dot plot” now points to three interest rate cuts in 2025, with Goldman Sachs analysts forecasting two more 25 basis point cuts by March and June 2026. If realized, the Fed’s benchmark rate would settle between 3% and 3.25%, suggesting a gradual easing cycle ahead. Analysts Expect Short-Term Volatility According to Hyblock, a crypto analytics platform, Bitcoin’s post-FOMC reactions often follow a familiar pattern: short-term declines followed by recovery. “Recent history has shown that the FOMC leads to a price drop in BTC, followed by a move up,” the firm noted. “If price does dip post-FOMC and signs of bullish confluence emerge, such as bid-heavy orderbooks, it would likely present good opportunities for investors.” Despite that, sentiment remains cautious. Traders are looking beyond the rate cuts to evaluate the broader economic landscape—especially the impact of U.S. layoffs, ongoing trade tensions under President Trump’s renewed tariff push, and questions surrounding the sustainability of the artificial intelligence boom. Broader Economic Concerns Cloud Bitcoin Outlook While Wednesday’s rate cut was fully expected, the market is now focused on Powell’s upcoming remarks at the FOMC press conference. Investors hope for clarity on how the Fed plans to navigate slowing growth, lingering inflation risks, and market liquidity conditions heading into 2026. For now, Bitcoin’s reaction underscores continued sensitivity to macroeconomic developments, particularly as the Fed transitions from tightening to a more accommodative stance.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-31 05:59:05

Analysts Say This Week’s Close Holds The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-november-rally-at-risk-week-close-holds-key/,"Despite the Federal Reserve (Fed)’s announcement of a 25-basis-point rate cut, Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, losing its local range low for the first time in a week. Some analysts have warned that this week’s close is crucial for the flagship crypto’s short-term performance. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Prepares For ‘Last Euphoric Run’ As Whales Go On $135M Buying Spree Bitcoin Price Eyes Crucial Weekly Close On Thursday, Bitcoin dropped below the recently reclaimed $110,000 area, hitting a one-week low of $106,700. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been trading within the $108,000-$120,000 price range since July, but has failed to reclaim the range highs after the early October correction. Amid this performance, Ted Pillows suggested that the market volatility was expected, as BTC has shown a similar price action since the start of Q3. The analyst explained that Bitcoin has dropped 6%-8% after the last three Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings, but it has also made a new all-time high (ATH) before the next one. According to the chart, BTC’s price reached its local bottom 5-9 days after the meeting, quickly recovering from the drop and rallying to new highs in the coming weeks. As price retests the $106,000 area, Ted predicted that a repeat of the same playbook could happen. However, he warned that Bitcoin must reclaim the $113,500 in the coming days to prevent a larger pullback. “A weekly close below that level will increase the likelihood of a bigger correction,” the analyst explained. Similarly, Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin must close the week above the $114,500 to turn this level back into support. He noted that after the recent performance, a volatile retest of this level would be “perfectly fine” as long price closes above this crucial level at the end of the week. Confirming the Range Low of ~$114k as support would confirm re-entry into the Range, kickstart consolidation within the Range again, and enable a move across it towards the Range High of ~$119000 (red) in an effort to breakout from it and challenge $120k+ once again. Is BTC’s End-Of-Year Rally Still On? Michaël van de Poppe affirmed that $112,000 is the next key area to break before a new ATH, as it has been a crucial resistance level in the daily timeframe for the past few weeks. Per the post, a breakout from this area could set the base for a retest of the $119,000-$120,000 zone. On the contrary, a rejection from this level could send the price toward the $103,000 mark or lower, he warned. “I do think we’ll see a new ATH in November,” the market watcher added.” Meanwhile, Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that BTC is “just playing ping pong” between its key levels and will continue to move within its range until one of the boundaries is successfully broken. Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Predicts Solana Staking ETF Will Be ‘Huge’ As First Day Volume Hits $56M The trader added that November is one of Bitcoin’s best months based on historical performance, which could suggest that a price rally could be near. Notably, 8 out of 12 Novembers have closed in green, with a median return of 10.82%, according to CoinGlass data. Moreover, he noted that the last two months of the year are when the three previous bull runs topped and the past two bear markets bottomed. “Whether it’s on the bullish or bearish side, volatility and big market pivots have been the theme into the end of the year,” he concluded.

The man, named Liang Ai-Bing, was found living in a three-storey house in the Wang Thonglang district, and officers recovered an unlicensed Beretta pistol with 20 rounds of ammunition at the scene. Operation And Arrest Reports have disclosed that Liang and four other suspects set up a platform called FINTOCH between December 2022 and May 2023. Authorities say the group used mobile apps to attract money from investors. Names linked to the case include Al Qing-Hua, Wu Jiang-Yan, Tang Zhen-Que and Zuo Lai-Jun. Based on reports, all five reportedly left the country except Zuo, who was arrested earlier and later released on bail pending trial. At the Bangkok residence, police noted a high monthly rent of 150,000 baht, which is about $4,645. Crypto Scam: Cross Border Cooperation Thai and Chinese officials shared intelligence that led to the arrest. Legal steps beyond the detention were not detailed in initial accounts, and it is still unclear whether extradition or formal charges will be filed in either country. Some details remain missing, such as how many people invested, the exact methods used to promise and pay returns, and whether any of the money has been tracked or frozen so far. The presence of a firearm at the property may lead to additional legal counts being considered. Evidence And Open Questions Authorities say the platform operated for roughly six months. How victims were recruited has not been confirmed. Reports have disclosed only the broad outline: an app-based scheme that promised returns and took in more than 100 million yuan. Investigators typically need to trace transfers, exchange records and crypto wallets to find out how much is recoverable. That work can take months, especially when funds cross borders and move through multiple accounts or currencies. When arrests happen, they do not always mean victims get their money back. Recovering assets requires frozen accounts, cooperation from exchanges, and court orders in several countries.

The drop stemmed from its $563 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) deals, which triggered heavy selling by investors. The Bitcoin treasury firm’s financing model sold heavily discounted shares to private investors to fund Bitcoin purchases, which massively diluted existing shareholders. The deal flopped after the launch of a large batch of PIPE shares for sale in September. Bailey seeks to fold Nakamoto with other companies The NAKA chart looks absolutely disgusting. These PIPE deals are destructive and may be impossible to come back from. It doesn't even matter how good the value proposition is, who's going to want to touch the stock after this? You must raise capital in a responsible manner.… pic.twitter.com/UxwZOJE9GY — Zynx (@ZynxBTC) October 7, 2025 The firm’s CEO, David Bailey, confirmed that sell orders flooded the market, causing the stock price to plummet and erasing billions in market value. He had also urged investors, through a letter to shareholders, to exit the stock if they were just there for a short-term flip. Bailey framed the drop as part of a long-term play. He stated in a recent interview with Forbes that people who are just looking for a trade are expensive capital to the company. The tech executive also called for long-term alignment with partners. Bailey revealed that Nakamoto Holdings plans to consolidate several of its other ventures, including Bitcoin Magazine, the Bitcoin conference, and UTXO Management, which owns the hedge fund 210k Capital, to boost cash flow. He also believes the initiative will position the firm as a Bitcoin-first conglomerate. Nakamoto Holdings holds 5,765 Bitcoin in its balance sheet, worth around $653 million, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. The Bitcoin treasury firm’s holdings make it the 19th largest public holder of BTC. The firm’s share price remains at a steep discount relative to its Bitcoin holdings. At the time of publication, Nakamoto’s stock (NAKA) is trading at around $0.9480, a drop from its May high of nearly $35. In May, Nakamoto Holdings merged with KindlyMD, a healthcare services provider, to establish a BTC treasury. Bailey revealed plans for the company to develop an ecosystem of Bitcoin-native companies, including media, advisory, and financial services, all focused on accelerating Bitcoin adoption and utility. “Traditional finance and Bitcoin-native markets are converging. The securitization of Bitcoin will redraw the world’s economic map. We believe a future is coming where every balance sheet – public or private – holds Bitcoin.” -David Bailey, CEO of Nakamoto Holdings. Bailey added that the firm aims to bring Bitcoin to the center of global capital markets by integrating into preferred shares, equity, debt, and newly hybrid structures. He also revealed that the company’s mission is to list such instruments on every major exchange worldwide. Bailey also swore in early September that he was all in on Bitcoin. Strategy reports positive Q3 Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy continues to gain momentum, reporting a net income of $2.8 billion for the third quarter of 2025. The firm has improved from a $340 million loss the previous year. The BTC Treasury firm recorded losses until the fourth quarter of 2024 due to the drop in Bitcoin’s price. Strategy also reaffirmed its full-year guidance of $34 billion in operating income and $20 billion in Bitcoin gains. The company is currently the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 640,808 BTC in its holdings, worth approximately $47.44 billion, driven by President Donald Trump’s focus on the crypto sector. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,816, representing a 1% increase for the day. The digital asset has also dropped by more than 1.2% in the last 7 days and plummeted by roughly 4.27% in the last 30 days. Saylor forecasts that Bitcoin’s price will reach $150 K by the end of the year. He argued that the surge will be driven by diminishing volatility and a clearer market structure. The Bitcoin bull also revealed that his long-term prediction is about 30% a year for the next 20 years as the firm approaches $20 million in Bitcoin.

The digital asset has now lost over 33% of its value from its all-time high of $3.65 , reached in July. This decline also pulled its market cap below $150 billion, and the asset is currently trading at $2.48, yet to recover that benchmark. The decline mirrors a broader sell-off across the cryptocurrency market following recent macroeconomic developments and a shift in investor sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors Pressure Crypto Prices The current weakness in XRP’s price coincides with a broader market downturn triggered by the Federal Reserve’s latest decisions and geopolitical developments involving the United States and China. As expected, the Federal Reserve opted for lower interest rates by 0.25% and announced that its quantitative tightening program will conclude in December. While these measures are generally supportive of risk assets, markets had largely anticipated them. As a result, investors appear to be engaging in “sell-the-news” behavior, reducing exposure after the announcements rather than increasing it. Further weighing on market sentiment was the meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit. Although the discussions reportedly went smoothly and included some concessions from both sides, the event failed to generate any new positive surprises for investors. The combination of these developments led to broad profit-taking across cryptocurrencies, including XRP, as traders looked for the next major catalyst . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Activity and Emerging Catalysts XRP’s recent decline has coincided with the reduction in speculative activity. CoinGlass data shows futures open interest has fallen to around $4.26 billion from $4.46 billion earlier this week, far below the $11 billion seen earlier this year. The drop indicates that leveraged traders are cutting exposure as volatility increases. Still, Ripple’s ecosystem remains active, with its RLUSD stablecoin supply rising 15% in the past month and the new XRPR ETF attracting over $113 million in assets, both suggesting longer-term network resilience. Technical Outlook for XRP Technically, XRP’s structure has turned decisively bearish. The token has broken below its multi-week support at $2.7, completing a descending triangle formation . This move confirmed a breakdown, followed by a failed retest that reinforced resistance at that level. Momentum indicators show continued weakness, while trading volumes remain low, confirming limited buying pressure. The 50-day moving average is converging towards the 200-day, forming a “ death cross ,” which often signals sustained downside movement. If this formation completes, XRP could slide toward the $2 support zone, where buyers may attempt to establish a short-term base before any potential recovery.

In a document dated Sept. 30, 2025, Bankman-Fried and his team contend the $8b owed to customers at the time of FTX’s Nov. 2022 bankruptcy “never left.” He writes that customers will get between 119% and 143% of what they were owed at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy, with about 98% already repaid 120%. After covering $8b in claims and $1b in legal fees, the estate still holds around $8b. The document states, “In fact, FTX was never insolvent.” “There have always been enough assets to repay all customers—in full, in kind—both in November 2022, and today,” Bankman-Fried wrote. SBF Portrays FTX Collapse As A Classic Bank Run Triggered By Panic Withdrawals He frames the collapse as a classic run on the bank. Withdrawals spiked to billions in days, the paper says, while the company sought asset sales and financing and continued to generate trading fees. The authors claim deals were in motion to bridge the shortfall by late Nov. 2022 and that customer withdrawals were resuming. [SBF says:] This is where the money went. https://t.co/HVRwEw5Z1k https://t.co/5DrA13L5YE pic.twitter.com/O6q77DvmTn — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 31, 2025 The narrative disputes the bankruptcy team’s early statements about shortfalls. It argues FTX and Alameda assets exceeded liabilities in 2021 and through mid-2022, and that the estate’s own Jan. 2023 materials showed assets roughly equal to or above customer claims as of the filing date. Further, SBF and his team blame subsequent decisions in bankruptcy for value erosion and the long delay in payouts. Solana, Sui And Anthropic Cited As Assets That Soared After FTX Liquidations Bankman-Fried’s camp points to asset sales they say were poorly timed. Stakes in tokens and private companies are listed with what the authors call materially higher estimated values today. They cite Solana, Sui and Anthropic among positions that would have been worth far more if held through the market rebound, while alleging insider-favored pricing and heavy professional fees drained the estate. They also criticize dollarized payouts. Creditors are receiving the US dollar value of their crypto as of Nov. 11, 2022, not the coins themselves. The paper argues this approach denies customers the upside from the subsequent rally, and says the years long wait compounded the gap between petition date prices and current levels. FTX Once Valued Above $30B Before Rapid Unraveling In 2022 Context matters. FTX was once valued above $30b with more than a million users. Its fall followed revelations about intertwined risk between the exchange and Alameda, a rush of withdrawals and a failed rescue. After a 2023 trial, Bankman-Fried was convicted on seven counts, and in March 2024 received a 25-year sentence with an $11b forfeiture, a judgment he is appealing. The estate has said it maximized recoveries, pointing to asset monetization and litigation wins that funded rising payout projections. Creditors, especially smaller account holders, have focused on speed and certainty of cash, even if that meant giving up crypto upside. Shareholders, by contrast, are recovering only a fraction of invested capital. FTX Recovery Sets Rare Precedent For Crypto Bankruptcies Worldwide For crypto markets, near full recovery of customer funds based on petition-date values marks a rare outcome in a major exchange collapse. The debate over whether repayments should have been made in crypto instead of dollars, and whether the estate sold assets too early, will remain a case study in how to unwind a trading platform during a volatile bull cycle. Bankman-Fried’s document seeks to recast that history. “The answer is they never left,” it says of customer funds, and it concludes that FTX could have paid everyone in 2022 if control had not shifted to external counsel and the court process. The courts will decide if that claim holds up, yet the size of the recoveries has already shifted how insolvency is understood in crypto collapses.

Are you feeling the recent dips in the crypto market and wondering if the party’s over for Bitcoin’s bull market ? Don’t hit the panic button just yet! Despite some short-term wobbles, a compelling analysis suggests that the current Bitcoin bull market is far from its conclusion. Let’s dive into why experts believe the upward journey is still very much intact, offering a fresh perspective on Bitcoin’s enduring strength. Is the Bitcoin Bull Market Truly Unstoppable? Recent market movements might have given some investors pause, sparking concerns about the longevity of the current uptrend. However, according to an insightful analysis by CoinDesk, the long-term trajectory for Bitcoin remains remarkably robust. This analysis points to historical patterns, specifically how previous Bitcoin bull markets have typically signaled their end. The key indicator? The 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA). Historically, a major bull run tends to conclude when the 200-week SMA approaches the peak of the preceding market cycle. This crucial technical metric provides a reliable long-term view, smoothing out daily volatility. Currently, the 200-week SMA stands at approximately $54,750. When we compare this figure to Bitcoin’s 2021 all-time high, which soared significantly higher, a clear and reassuring picture emerges. This substantial gap strongly suggests that the conditions typically associated with a market top are not yet present. Therefore, the long-term health of the Bitcoin bull market appears to be well-supported by both historical data and rigorous technical analysis, defying premature bearish calls. Decoding the 200-Week SMA Signal for the Bitcoin Bull Market Understanding the 200-week SMA is crucial for grasping this long-term perspective. Think of the 200-week SMA as a powerful, slow-moving trend line that filters out short-term noise, providing a macro view of Bitcoin’s price action over a four-year period. When Bitcoin’s price consistently trades above this line, it generally signifies a robust and sustained uptrend, characteristic of a healthy Bitcoin bull market . The historical pattern observed by astute analysts reveals a consistent trend: the ultimate conclusion of a major Bitcoin bull market often coincides with the 200-week SMA closing in on the previous cycle’s peak price. This convergence has historically acted as a strong exhaustion signal. Here’s what this implies: Historical Precedent: Past bull runs consistently showed the 200-week SMA gradually ascending, eventually drawing near prior cycle highs before a major reversal. Current Reality Check: The current 200-week SMA of $54,750 is still considerably below the 2021 peak, implying significant room for price appreciation within the ongoing cycle. Reliable Long-Term Indicator: This metric offers a powerful macro lens, empowering investors to filter out daily fluctuations and focus on the broader, more significant movements of the Bitcoin bull market . This technical observation serves as a powerful reminder that while daily price movements can be inherently volatile, the underlying structural support for Bitcoin’s growth phase remains firmly in place. It encourages a perspective that values patience and strategic thinking over reactive decisions. What Does This Mean for Investors in the Current Bitcoin Bull Market? For many, the burning question isn’t just “is the bull market over?” but rather, “what actionable steps should I take now?” The compelling analysis suggesting the ongoing Bitcoin bull market offers several key insights for both seasoned and new investors navigating these dynamic waters: Embrace a Long-Term Vision: This analysis powerfully reinforces the critical importance of adopting a long-term investment strategy in cryptocurrency. Focus on Bitcoin’s fundamental value. View Dips as Opportunities: Temporary price pullbacks could be viewed as strategic accumulation opportunities, rather than alarming signals to panic sell. Prioritize Informed Decisions: Continuous education about market indicators and fundamental analysis is crucial for making well-informed and confident investment choices. However, it’s equally important to acknowledge that no market analysis is entirely foolproof. Volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency market, and external factors can always influence price action. Therefore, investors should always conduct their own thorough research and carefully consider their individual risk tolerance. Navigating the Path Ahead: The Resilient Bitcoin Bull Market The current market landscape is undoubtedly dynamic, with a complex interplay of various factors, ranging from accelerating institutional adoption and new financial products like spot ETFs, to evolving macroeconomic conditions. Yet, the profound resilience indicated by the 200-week SMA analysis provides a strong, data-backed counter-narrative to bearish sentiments during periods of market weakness. The sustained and growing interest from institutional players, coupled with continuous innovation within the Bitcoin ecosystem, further bolsters the argument for a maturing, yet still vigorously expanding, asset class. Embracing a balanced and informed perspective allows investors to confidently navigate the exciting, albeit sometimes turbulent, waters of the crypto world. The foundational strength highlighted by this analysis underscores the immense potential for continued upside in the Bitcoin bull market , urging participants to look beyond the immediate horizon and appreciate the larger, unfolding narrative of digital asset adoption. Conclusion: The Enduring Power of the Bitcoin Bull Market In summary, while the exhilarating rollercoaster ride of cryptocurrency can certainly test the resolve of any investor, the data-driven insights from CoinDesk provide a compelling and reassuring argument: the Bitcoin bull market is still very much unfolding. The significant distance between the 200-week SMA and previous cycle peaks suggests that we are likely still in the midst of a powerful and sustained upward trend. This critical understanding encourages a long-term, strategic approach to investing, reminding us that patience, continuous learning, and informed analysis are the undeniable keys to successfully navigating the exciting and transformative future of Bitcoin. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and why is it important for Bitcoin? A: The 200-week SMA is a long-term technical indicator that smooths out Bitcoin’s price over 200 weeks (roughly four years). It’s crucial because historical analysis suggests that a major Bitcoin bull market often concludes when this SMA approaches the peak of the previous cycle. Q2: Has Bitcoin’s 200-week SMA reached the 2021 peak? A: No, currently the 200-week SMA stands at approximately $54,750, which is significantly below Bitcoin’s 2021 all-time high. This gap is a key reason why analysts believe the Bitcoin bull market has not yet ended. Q3: Does this analysis guarantee that Bitcoin’s price will only go up? A: No, no market analysis can guarantee future price movements. The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. This analysis provides a long-term perspective based on historical patterns, suggesting the macro trend for the Bitcoin bull market remains positive, but short-term fluctuations are always possible. Q4: What should investors consider given this analysis? A: Investors might consider maintaining a long-term perspective, viewing short-term dips as potential accumulation opportunities, and prioritizing continuous education on market indicators. Always conduct your own research and assess your risk tolerance. Q5: What other factors support the idea of an ongoing Bitcoin bull market? A: Beyond the 200-week SMA, factors like increasing institutional adoption, the launch of new financial products (e.g., spot ETFs), and ongoing development within the Bitcoin ecosystem also contribute to a positive outlook for the Bitcoin bull market .

Unlike centralized exchanges such as Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken, which act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, dYdX aims to eliminate the middleman, allowing users to transact directly on a blockchain network that underpins cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Path Ahead: 10 Indicators Converge For Market Surge, End-Of-2025 Projections The platform specializes in perpetual contracts, a form of derivative that enables traders to speculate on asset prices without ownership and without an expiration date, distinguishing it from traditional futures contracts. Since its inception, dYdX has surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume. As part of its expansion strategy, dYdX plans to introduce spot trading for Solana (SOL) and other linked cryptocurrencies, potentially including XRP and Cardano (ADA), to US users by the end of the year. This move comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s increased support for the cryptocurrency sector, which has led to the dismissal of numerous lawsuits against major crypto platforms and prompted financial regulators to develop specialized rules for digital assets. These new measures include Congress’s passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year and the potential passage of the Market Structure Bill. Together, these measures address the industry’s call for a new framework that could boost adoption and growth of the broader digital asset ecosystem in the US. Trading Fees Slashed, Prospective Offerings Awaiting Guidance Upon its entry into the US market, Reuters reports that dYdX intends to reduce its trading fees significantly, with plans to cut them by as much as half, bringing them down to between 50 and 65 basis points. However, while perpetual contracts will not be available to US users immediately, Zhang expressed hope that regulators will eventually provide the necessary guidance for decentralized platforms to offer these products. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum Dip Post Fed’s Rate Cut: What’s Next For Crypto? The US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) recently issued a joint statement indicating their willingness to consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts to trade across regulated platforms in the US, which could pave the way for dYdX’s future offerings. As of this writing, the platform’s native token, DYDX, is trading at approximately $0.30. However, the token has experienced a significant decline of nearly 68% over the past year, shedding about $1.43 billion in market cap value.

Allegations of political paybacks have emerged, particularly in light of Binance.US’s recent listing of USD1, a stablecoin linked to Trump’s family and part of the DeFi platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI). Binance’s Alleged Role In Trump Family’s Crypto Profit Senator Chris Murphy recently took to social media to express his concerns, stating , “One week after Trump pardoned Binance’s owner for a stunning array of crimes related to terrorist and sex predator financing, Binance starts promoting Trump crypto. The White House is a full-time, 24/7 corruption machine.” In response to these allegations, Binance.US issued a statement addressing Murphy’s comments. The exchange emphasized that it conducts thorough due diligence and legal reviews before listing any asset, whether it be a stablecoin or a new project. They clarified that both USD1 and WLFI are already listed on over 20 major exchanges, including US platforms like Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and Kraken. Binance.US reiterated that the decision to list these assets was purely a business one, devoid of any political motivations . “It’s unfortunate that even routine business decisions are now unfairly politicized by our elected officials,” the statement noted. Amid these developments, reports have surfaced suggesting that Binance may have had political ties with Trump, allegedly assisting the Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture in generating significant profits shortly before the pardon was granted. World Liberty Denies Involvement In Pardon Discussions According to the Independent, Binance purportedly helped World Liberty Financial make billions and even created a “high-level task force” to negotiate a deal with the Trump-affiliated venture. World Liberty has denied any discussions regarding a pardon, with its lawyer, Tom Clare, stating that the company “has never assisted in, facilitated, or influenced a decision on Mr. Zhao’s presidential pardon.” The company did express support for Zhao’s pardon, with spokeswoman Gail Gitcho mentioning, “Everyone who has been a victim of Joe Biden’s lawfare has rightfully been pardoned.” Wayne F. Dennison, a lawyer for Binance, asserted that there was “no impropriety” involved and clarified that the company “did not control the stablecoin chosen by MGX.” Last week, Trump remarked that the pardon was granted “at the request of a lot of very good people,” although the optics of the decision raised concerns among some within his administration. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also addressed the situation, stating that neither Trump nor his family has ever engaged in, or will ever engage in, conflicts of interest.

According to the document shared on the SBF_FTX account, the defunct crypto exchange did not collapse due to massive fraud or mismanagement, per the conclusion of prosecutors and jurors. “FTX was never insolvent. There have always been enough assets to repay all customers, in full, in kind, both in November 2022 and today,” the shared note read. The paper insists that when attorneys placed the company under bankruptcy protection in Delaware in 2022, as reported by Cryptopolitan, FTX “was on track to resolve” its liquidity issues before being “disrupted by external counsel.” [SBF says:] This is where the money went. https://t.co/HVRwEw5Z1k https://t.co/5DrA13L5YE pic.twitter.com/O6q77DvmTn — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 31, 2025 At its peak, over seven million customers deposited around $20 billion on the platform. When withdrawals surged in November 2022, FTX froze accounts and filed for bankruptcy with $8 billion still owed to users. For nearly two years, customers had seen little to no progress in recovering their assets. Customer payouts and the ‘in-kind’ query Bankman-Fried’s camp claims around 98% of creditors have received 120% of their claims’ petition-date value, while the estate still holds $8 billion after paying out $8 billion in claims and another $1 billion in legal fees. The reimbursement estate expects full repayments between 119% and 143%. However, FTX repayments are being made in US dollar equivalents rather than in-kind crypto assets. That means a customer owed 1 Bitcoin at the time of bankruptcy received about $17,000, the asset’s value on November 11, 2022, rather than 1 BTC itself. As of the time of this publication, Bitcoin was trading at around $109,000, higher than the repayment value by about 550%, so many creditors have lost potential gains. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche mentioned the disparity in a policy memo, explaining that digital asset investors in bankruptcies such as FTX were “unable to benefit from corresponding gains that occurred during or after the period in which they were victimized.” Bankman-Fried’s document says if FTX had not been placed into bankruptcy, the dollarization of claims would never have mattered. Customers could have withdrawn their assets or repurchased them immediately to never lose out on the crypto’s two-year rally. SBF lodges sabotage accusations against attorneys Sullivan & Cromwell The document also lays the blame on FTX’s former legal counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell (S&C). S&C became FTX’s primary external counsel in 2021 and “wrested control” of the company in November 2022 with the help of Ryne Miller, FTX US General Counsel and a former S&C partner, and Zach Dexter, CEO of FTX US Derivatives. After taking control of the firm, SBF claims, “S&C’s guy,” attorney John J. Ray III placed FTX and Alameda Research into bankruptcy and retained S&C as the firm’s own bankruptcy counsel. The filing accuses these lawyers of being “heavily incentivized” to initiate bankruptcy proceedings and to pay themselves directly from FTX’s funds. The document also lambasted S&C for going behind Bankman-Fried’s back to contact federal prosecutors while he was still their client and CEO of FTX. On November 9, 2022, S&C attorneys allegedly informed the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York about concerns over FTX’s finances. Their cooperation, per SBF’s voice, helped authorities arrest him and secure guilty pleas from former executives Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang. After supposedly orchestrating the bankruptcy, S&C launched a campaign to blame Bankman-Fried for a financial implosion they themselves triggered. Missed opportunities to cash in on gains According to the document, FTX was generating $3 million daily and $1 billion annually when it was shuttered. FTX also had stakes in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic and brokerage firm Robinhood. The Anthropic investment, which Ray reportedly dismissed as “just a bunch of people with an idea,” was sold for a $0.9 billion profit but is now estimated to be worth $14.3 billion. Also offloaded was holdings in Sui for under $100 million, an asset later valued near $1 billion at market debut and $2.9 billion today.

The blockchain platform revealed that Western Union, the world’s largest money transfer company, will be building exclusively on Solana. In collaboration with Anchorage Digital, Western Union is launching USDPT, a new stablecoin that will be integrated into its vast network spanning over 150 countries. The project aims to enhance cross-border remittances using blockchain technology, signaling a major step in traditional finance’s adoption of decentralized infrastructure. Clarifying Misconceptions About XRP’s Role Following Solana’s announcement, technical analyst Charting Guy weighed in on the growing online debate over XRP’s relevance. He pointed out that many users appeared to misunderstand the distinction between stablecoins and XRP. According to his remarks, XRP’s use case differs fundamentally from stablecoins like USDPT, and the Western Union-Solana collaboration does not diminish the importance or functionality of the XRP Ledger. While he emphasized that stablecoins have existed for years, serving a specific purpose of maintaining price stability through fiat backing, XRP operates as a bridge asset designed for liquidity and settlement efficiency. His comments were directed toward those assuming that Western Union’s move away from RippleNet or the XRP Ledger indicated an industry shift away from XRP’s core utility. a lot of uneducated people saying this is bad for $XRP and invalidates its use case guys, stablecoins have been around a long time lol $XRP’s use case is much different than stablecoins maybe read up on what the xrp ledger actually does & how xrp functions this means nothing https://t.co/yVQyglPYcl — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) October 28, 2025 Community Perspective on Competition Other users joined the discussion to provide additional perspective. One user, Maharaj, noted that industry competition should not be perceived as a threat. He argued that partnerships like Western Union’s with Solana represent normal business diversification rather than the invalidation of other blockchain projects. His comment highlighted the broader reality that financial institutions often experiment with multiple solutions to achieve efficiency and global reach. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context in the Blockchain Sector The announcement underscores the growing adoption of blockchain technology within established financial systems. However, it also reveals a recurring theme within the crypto community—confusion between distinct technological functions. Stablecoins like USDPT are primarily designed to facilitate fiat-pegged transactions with minimal volatility, while XRP’s design serves institutional liquidity and cross-border settlement processes. Charting Guy’s remarks align with this distinction, reminding market participants that developments in one blockchain ecosystem do not automatically negate the relevance of another. The rise of multiple blockchain integrations across global finance reflects a maturing sector where varied technologies coexist, each addressing unique aspects of financial infrastructure. In essence, Western Union’s partnership with Solana represents an expansion of blockchain use cases rather than a zero-sum event. XRP’s functionality within payment and liquidity systems remains unaffected, reinforcing the idea that competition and innovation can coexist in shaping the future of digital finance.

Momentum, a leading infrastructure project built on the Sui blockchain, recently unveiled its exciting Momentum growth strategy and detailed post-Token Generation Event (TGE) roadmap. This forward-thinking approach aims to redefine how we interact with both traditional and decentralized assets. What Drives Momentum’s Remarkable Growth Strategy? During a recent Bitcoin World Night Live session on October 30, Nick Lee, Momentum’s Head of Marketing, provided an in-depth look at the project’s vision. Momentum is not just another platform; it’s building a comprehensive liquidity and trading engine for decentralized derivatives and traditional assets. This engine operates on a robust three-layer ecosystem designed to handle security, regulation, and trading functions seamlessly. Momentum has quickly risen to become the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on Sui within six months of its launch. This rapid expansion is a testament to its strong foundation and innovative approach. Lee highlighted three crucial factors contributing to this success: Technical Trust: The team’s deep roots in the security firm MSafe have established a high level of technical credibility and reliability. Long-Term Reward Structure: Momentum employs the ve(3,3) token model, which incentivizes sustained engagement rather than short-term gains. Community-First Strategy: The project prioritizes genuine contributors, fostering a dedicated community over simply attracting transient liquidity providers. How Does Momentum Ensure Post-TGE Stability? A common challenge for projects after a TGE is preventing a drain in total value locked (TVL). Momentum addresses this head-on with an ingenious reward system centered around veMMT voting. This system is designed to encourage long-term commitment and active participation in governance. Here’s how it works: Users lock their MMT tokens to receive veMMT voting power. This voting power allows them to influence the allocation of liquidity pool rewards. Longer lock-up periods not only increase a user’s earnings but also amplify their influence within the ecosystem. This mechanism creates a powerful incentive for users to remain invested and engaged, ensuring the platform’s stability and continued growth. It’s a smart move that aligns user interests with the project’s long-term success, forming a core part of the Momentum growth strategy . Engaging the Community: Beyond Token Locks Beyond the veMMT model, Momentum is actively building a vibrant and committed community. They utilize a unique TITLE DEED soulbound NFT to certify early contributions, recognizing and rewarding their most dedicated supporters. This isn’t just about tokens; it’s about building a loyal user base. The project also leverages various community engagement initiatives, including: Referral programs Interactive quests Exclusive airdrops These initiatives not only attract new users but also deepen the involvement of existing ones, creating a dynamic and interactive ecosystem. When it came to its community token sale, Momentum strategically chose BeadlePad, a launch platform known for its proven security and user trust within the Sui ecosystem. This decision further underscores Momentum’s commitment to security and user confidence, integral to its overall Momentum growth strategy . What’s Next for Momentum: Expanding Beyond Sui? Looking ahead, Momentum has ambitious plans following its TGE. Nick Lee emphasized that the project intends to expand its reach beyond Sui-based initiatives. This expansion will begin with the introduction of a cross-chain liquidity module, a critical step towards broader ecosystem integration. By venturing into cross-chain capabilities, Momentum aims to play a pivotal role in the wider growth of the decentralized financial landscape. This forward-looking approach positions Momentum not just as a Sui powerhouse but as a significant player in the broader crypto space, ready to facilitate seamless interactions across different blockchains. This expansive vision truly highlights the future direction of the Momentum growth strategy . In conclusion, Momentum’s detailed growth strategy and post-TGE roadmap paint a compelling picture of a project poised for significant impact. By combining technical excellence, innovative tokenomics, a community-centric approach, and a clear vision for cross-chain expansion, Momentum is setting a new standard for DeFi and RWA trading infrastructure. Its commitment to long-term value and active user participation ensures a robust and sustainable future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Momentum building on the Sui blockchain?

The decision came after a tense call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, where Moscow refused to back down from demands tied to Ukraine. The Financial Times first reported the cancellation, saying the U.S. saw no sign that Russia was willing to negotiate. The White House is yet to publicly acknowledge the report. The original goal of the Budapest meeting was to discuss a possible framework to end the war. But Moscow insisted that any ceasefire required Ukraine to give up more territory, sharply reduce its military, and guarantee it would never join NATO. Trump had supported a ceasefire along current frontlines instead. Days after the two leaders had agreed to meet, Russia sent Washington a memo repeating the same demands, saying they address what Putin calls the “root causes” of the war. Moscow rejects compromise; summit cancelled According to the Financial Times , Rubio told Trump after the call that Russia was not moving an inch from its position. The administration then cancelled the summit plans. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine is open to talks, but it will not withdraw from additional territory first. Early in his term, Trump spoke strongly about backing Ukraine and pushing toward an end to Russia’s invasion. But over the past two weeks, his tone has changed. When Zelenskiy visited Washington, many expected Trump to approve long‑range Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine. He did not. The change continued during Trump’s meeting with Xi Jinping. Even though Trump had previously urged India to cut its purchases of Russian oil, he made no such demand of China , telling reporters that:- “We really didn’t discuss the oil.” When asked about ending the war, Trump described the situation as stalled. In his own words:- “We’re both going to work together to see if we can get something done. We agree that the sides are locked in, fighting, and sometimes you have to let them fight, I guess. Crazy. But he’s going to help us and we’re going to work together on Ukraine.” Sanctions hit Rosneft and Lukoil, but oil shipments continue Even with the softer talk, Trump did announce sanctions last week on Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft. Supporters of Ukraine see this as meaningful, saying it could tighten Moscow’s war financing. Both companies have already said they will sell international assets because of the sanctions. A European official allegedly told Fox News, “The sanctions are a step of actual consequence. European troop withdrawals are expected, but the changes seem marginal. The rest is your typical Trump pendulum.” However, new sanctions have not yet disrupted physical crude exports from Russia’s western ports. Data from LSEG shows that shipments from Primorsk, Ust‑Luga, and Novorossiisk in October are expected to total around 2.33 million barrels per day, which matches Russia’s revised plan. But traders say pressure is rising because India and Turkey, key buyers of Urals crude, are expected to follow Western restrictions. The U.S. has set November 21 as the deadline to wind down all dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil, but since it takes about four weeks for shipments from Baltic ports to reach Indian refineries, barrels loaded now may arrive after the cutoff, creating payment and financing issues. Also, banks may refuse to process payments, and Russian sellers do not want to be paid in rupees.

They are officially supporting the upcoming UXLINK token swap , a crucial migration that will see tokens move from Arbitrum One to the robust Ethereum network. This move is a game-changer for UXLINK holders, promising a more streamlined and secure experience. What is the UXLINK Token Swap and Why is it Happening? The UXLINK token swap involves a transition of UXLINK tokens from the Arbitrum One layer-2 scaling solution to the main Ethereum blockchain. This migration is a strategic decision often driven by various factors, including enhanced security, broader ecosystem compatibility, and potentially increased liquidity on Ethereum’s mainnet. Moving to Ethereum can offer UXLINK users a more direct connection to the vast decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It also aligns the token with the foundational blockchain for many leading digital assets, which can bring long-term benefits for the project and its community. Key Dates for the UXLINK Token Swap: Don’t Miss Out! Understanding the timeline is vital for anyone holding UXLINK tokens. Upbit has provided clear dates for the snapshot process, which are critical for ensuring a smooth migration of your assets. Mark your calendars for these important milestones: First Snapshot: Scheduled for 2:55 p.m. UTC on September 22. This initial snapshot will record the holdings of UXLINK tokens on the Arbitrum One network. Second Snapshot: This will occur at 6:00 a.m. UTC on November 3. This date is particularly significant as it also marks the termination of trading support for UXLINK on Arbitrum One via Upbit. It is essential for users to be aware of these dates to manage their tokens effectively. Failure to comply with the snapshot schedule might impact your eligibility for the new Ethereum-based UXLINK tokens. How Does Upbit’s Support Benefit UXLINK Holders? Upbit’s decision to support the UXLINK token swap offers substantial advantages to its users. As one of South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, its backing provides a layer of credibility and convenience that individual users might struggle to achieve on their own. Here are some key benefits: Simplified Process: Upbit will handle the technical complexities of the swap, meaning users who hold UXLINK on the exchange will likely have their tokens migrated automatically. Enhanced Security: Relying on a reputable exchange like Upbit for the migration reduces the risk of user error or exposure to scams during the swap process. Accessibility: For many, using an exchange is the easiest way to participate in such events, especially for those less familiar with self-custody wallets and manual token migrations. Navigating the Migration: Tips for a Smooth UXLINK Token Swap To ensure a seamless transition during the UXLINK token swap , consider these actionable insights: Check Your Holdings: Verify your UXLINK token balance on Upbit well before the first snapshot date. Stay Informed: Regularly check Upbit’s official announcements and UXLINK’s community channels for any updates or further instructions. Avoid Last-Minute Actions: Do not attempt to transfer or trade your UXLINK tokens close to the snapshot times, as this could lead to complications. Understand the New Token: Familiarize yourself with the specifics of the new Ethereum-based UXLINK token once details are released. Being proactive and informed is your best strategy for a successful token migration. Looking Ahead: The Future of UXLINK and Ethereum This migration signifies a strategic pivot for UXLINK, aligning it more closely with the Ethereum ecosystem. This move could potentially unlock new opportunities for integration with Ethereum-based DeFi protocols, dApps, and NFT platforms. For UXLINK, this means tapping into a larger, more established network, potentially boosting its utility and adoption. The support from a major exchange like Upbit underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market, where exchanges play a pivotal role in facilitating complex blockchain operations for their users. This is a positive development for the broader crypto space. Summary Upbit’s crucial support for the UXLINK token swap from Arbitrum One to Ethereum is a significant event for the UXLINK community. With clear snapshot dates on September 22 and November 3, users are encouraged to stay informed and prepare. This migration promises enhanced security, greater accessibility, and a stronger alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem, ultimately aiming for a more robust and integrated future for UXLINK.

Analysts Say Yes,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-this-0-035-crypto-be-the-defi-token-shaking-solanas-sol-market-dominance-analysts-say-yes/,"The DeFi market is experiencing a seismic shift and everyone is now completely obsessed with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin that currently has a market price of only $0.035 and which experts opine might just dethrone Solana’s (SOL) dominance in the next cycle. With presale Phase 6 of the project over 80% sold and more than $18.25 million of funds raised, investors are going crazy. MUTM leads the group in that it has a DeFi crypto dual-lending platform so that users may participate in Peer-to-Peer as well as Peer-to-Contract lending, with flexibility and efficiency that usually is not in the market. Analysts have labeled Mutuum Finance the next DeFi crypto giant to redefine decentralized finance through its efforts to solve liquidity inefficiencies normally affecting the industry. In spite of Solana’s constant scalability and centralization issues, MUTM’s steadily growing community along with swift presale adoption put it in the direction of the new giant rebranding the DeFi industry and perhaps the next giant altcoin story of 2025. As a new crypto coin, it’s already trending as a major disruptor in decentralized finance. Solana (SOL) Tests Major Support as Bulls Look for New Breakout Solana (SOL) is testing the major $195 support level after breaking out in recent periods, and this will be crucial in determining if the trend by the bulls is on. To stay above this level is crucial for SOL to reclaim $207 and even attempt new highs as sentiment increases in the market. The bigger picture is upbeat, and strong demand from customers continues to propel the asset into its recovery phase. The experts also think that such a support retest can serve as a springboard for the subsequent leg higher, provided buyers remain committed to maintaining the $195 floor. As Solana prepares for a potential breakout, investors are also discovering their own hidden gems in emerging DeFi crypto projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that are also exhibiting early-stage growth patterns similar to what Solana did several years ago. This new crypto coin is showing the same kind of energy that typically defines revolutionary blockchain opportunities. Mutuum Finance is Taking the Lead Towards 2025’s Top Crypto Presale Since its launch of multi-phase presale in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has seen incredible growth and investor attention. Each presale phase has provided contributors with an open door to the long-term project, providing early adopters with an opportunity to gain gargantuan profits prior to the token’s official market release. Now at Phase 6, the token price of MUTM is $0.035, three times the original Phase 1 price of $0.01, yielding nearly 3x for early investors. Mutuum Finance has raised $18.2 million, enrolled over 17,550 investors, and distributed 80% of available Phase 6 tokens. Phase 7, soon to be released, increases the token price by nearly 20% to $0.04, an undisputed indication of gaining market momentum and sustained interest. Riding this strong momentum, MUTM has become one of the top DeFi crypto projects that have appreciated substantially in the upcoming bull run. Of the entire 4 billion MUTM tokens, 1.76 billion will be kept for presale. So far, more than 760 million tokens have been sold in earlier rounds with strong and sustained buying pressure from investors. This phenomenal acceleration shows broad retail and institutional investor backing, numerous six-figure buys by large investors. Such sustained buying momentum speaks of strong belief in Mutuum Finance’s long-term DeFi crypto vision and places MUTM among the leading crypto investment opportunities for those who care about stability and growth on its own merit irrespective of speculation cycles. Stablecoin and Oracle Integration Set to Overturn DeFi Stability With Mutuum Finance about to launch its V1 protocol, the team is already gearing up for its next major milestone in the form of the release of a USD-pegged stablecoin. Underpinned by verifiable on-chain collateral, the stablecoin will form the foundation of Mutuum’s lending mechanism, which will enhance liquidity and stability within its markets. By linking borrowing and repayment behavior to an underlying asset, the new token will reduce exposure to risk from market volatility and increase the ability to predict interest accrual. The innovation grants customers a genuine edge over traditional variable-rate systems by enabling them to forecast returns more easily. Including strong oracles for live asset pricing will also ensure data integrity and strengthen the overall system resiliency of the Mutuum Finance platform, putting it at the cutting edge of the next generation of decentralized finance. Whereas Solana (SOL) is settling into public blocks, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the headlines with innovation, investor frenzy, and real-world applicability. Already oversubscribed with more than $18.25 million and publicly boasting a roadmap to a lending platform secured by a stablecoin, MUTM is not just some presale, it’s the DeFi crypto that’s about to shake the game and set the tone for decentralized finance in 2025. For investors searching for the most promising new crypto coin, this could very well be the defining opportunity.

The truce was reached just before Trump left South Korea after skipping the main two‑day summit, and it pauses new restrictions on China’s exports of rare earth minerals that had threatened to disrupt global supply chains. The talks in Gyeongju are centered on supply chain stability and lowering trade barriers, but the APEC structure is non‑binding, and reaching consensus across 21 economies has been difficult due to ongoing geopolitical tension. Xi spoke at the closed‑door opening session, telling leaders, “Changes unseen in a century are accelerating across the world.” He added, “The rougher the seas, the more we must pull together,” calling for support for multilateral trade and more economic cooperation. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attended in Trump’s place, representing the United States at the table. With Trump absent, Xi has become the main diplomatic focus, with scheduled meetings involving Japan, Canada, and Thailand. Japan meets Xi amid military buildup tension Xi is expected to meet Japan’s newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, her first direct talks with him since taking office. Reuters claimed that the meeting was being arranged for Friday. Before leaving Tokyo, Takaichi confirmed that contacts with Beijing were already underway. Relations between Japan and China have been more stable in recent years, but her sudden rise to power may introduce new strain. She has strong nationalistic positions and supports a more assertive security posture. One of her first policy actions after taking office was to accelerate Japan’s military build‑up to counter what Tokyo sees as territorial pressure from China in East Asia. Japan also hosts the largest concentration of U.S. military forces outside the United States. Several issues remain difficult between the two governments. Japanese nationals remain detained in China, and Beijing continues restrictions on Japanese beef, seafood, and agricultural products. These subjects are expected to be raised in the talks. Canada seeks to restart engagement after years of conflict Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will meet Xi at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT) with the intention of reopening diplomatic and trade channels after years of damaged relations. Canada is trying to reduce heavy dependence on the United States, its largest trading partner, while expanding into other markets. China remains Canada’s second‑largest trading partner. However, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, relations deteriorated sharply. Canadians were detained and some executed in China, and Canadian security agencies determined that China interfered in at least two federal elections. Xi also publicly criticized Trudeau before, accusing him of leaking private discussions to the press. In August, China imposed preliminary anti‑dumping duties on Canadian canola. That followed Canada’s move to apply a 100% tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles the previous year. Senior officials from both countries met earlier this month to discuss the disputes but did not signal any progress. Thailand’s Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is also scheduled to meet Xi. Bangkok’s government noted that this comes days after Thailand and Cambodia signed an enhanced ceasefire deal overseen by Trump. Trump has emphasized his role as a mediator in global conflicts. Xi told Trump on Thursday that China also supports dialogue and reconciliation efforts on key issues. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, the summit host, said, “It is clear we cannot always be on the same side, but we must work together to achieve common prosperity.” South Korea’s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said talks were ongoing regarding a joint statement, and he remained hopeful a declaration could be adopted by the summit’s close on Saturday. But diplomats from two APEC nations expressed doubt that any final document would be substantial. APEC did not produce joint statements in 2018 or 2019 during Trump’s first term. The APEC region stretches from Russia to Chile and accounts for roughly half of global trade and 61% of global GDP. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The first spot XRP exchange-traded fund, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (ticker: XRPR), is officially live on the Cboe BZX Exchange, offering structured access to the digital asset within a U.S. framework. A New Pathway for XRP Market Participation Rex Shares announced the fund’s debut on its official channels, describing it as a vehicle that “delivers spot XRP exposure by holding ~60% XRP and ~40% physically backed non-U.S. XRP ETPs.” The firm emphasized that XRPR provides “real spot exposure in an ETF structure,” positioning it as a hybrid between direct crypto holding and traditional fund management. The first spot $XRP ETF is already live. $XRPR , the REX-Osprey XRP ETF — delivers spot XRP exposure by holding ~60% $XRP and ~40% physically backed non-U.S. XRP ETPs. Real spot exposure in an ETF structure. Review the prospectus and see the fund’s complete holdings here:… pic.twitter.com/lSpu3DuHAA — REX Shares (@REXShares) October 30, 2025 The XRPR ETF began trading on September 18 , and has quickly drawn strong investor interest. As of October 23, the fund held approximately $113.5 million in total assets, with net asset value near $21.51 per share. Current market data shows XRPR trading around $19.61, with intraday highs reaching $20.71. The fund’s daily volume sits at almost 340,000 shares, signaling robust liquidity for a newly launched crypto-linked security. Why the ETF’s Launch Matters for XRP XRPR’s arrival is more than a new financial product, as it represents the formal recognition of XRP’s viability as an investable digital asset in regulated markets. The fund saw $24 million of trading activity just 90 minutes after its launch, showing the market’s desire for spot XRP ETF products. For institutional investors, it removes the barriers associated with custody, exchange onboarding, and security compliance. For retail investors, it provides an alternative to direct crypto ownership through standard brokerage accounts. The success of the ETF’s first month highlights rising institutional confidence . Accumulating over $113 million in assets so soon after launch places XRPR among the fastest-growing crypto-linked funds introduced in 2025. Its performance also indicates strong market demand for XRP exposure within traditional investment vehicles, reinforcing the token’s growing utility and acceptance in financial infrastructure. Expanding the Scope of XRP Integration As digital asset adoption accelerates globally, XRPR’s launch reflects a broader trend of token-based assets entering conventional markets. While the fund does not eliminate XRP’s price volatility or regulatory uncertainties, it demonstrates progress toward deeper integration between blockchain technology and institutional finance. By bridging on-chain exposure with regulated access, the REX-Osprey XRP ETF establishes a precedent for how XRP can evolve from a speculative token into a recognized investment asset within the U.S. market.

The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1 and has seen the value of the HINU token increase gradually. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is mixed, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading in positive territory, while altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) trade in the red. Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Move To $0.00022055 Husky Inu (HINU) has completed the latest price rise of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00021991 to $0.00022055. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, 2025, following the conclusion of its presale. The regular price rises during the pre-launch phase aim to empower the Husky Inu community and continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date approaches. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to increase the HINU token’s value every two days. This has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross key fundraising milestones. It has also helped Husky Inu raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community, rewarding early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. Official Launch Data Closing In Husky Inu has generated remarkable interest during its presale and pre-launch phases. The project’s fledgling community has grown in strength and numbers, thanks to the dedication and enthusiasm of each member. The project’s official launch date, March 27, 2026, is just over six months away. Our goal has always been long-term growth and success, not short-term hype. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open. The Husky Inu team will conduct a series of strategic meetings to assess market conditions and determine the optimal time to launch the project. The first two reviews were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025. The third review is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Cryptocurrency Markets Mixed Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has been a mixed bag over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up over 1% and has reclaimed the $110,000 mark. However, Ethereum (ETH) is trading in the red, down nearly 1% at $3,862. Ripple (XRP) is down 1.15% and Solana (SOL) is down over 3%, trading around $186. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 1.39%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 2.69%, trading around $0.614. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable losses over the past 24 hours.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-reiterates-bullish-expectations-for-bitcoin-btc-here-are-the-details/,"Brian Armstrong, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, reiterated the company's bullish outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) in a statement on social media platform X. Coinbase Boosts Confidence in Bitcoin: Company Increases BTC Holdings by 2,772 in Q3 Armstrong announced that Coinbase increased its Bitcoin holdings by 2,772 units in the third quarter of 2025 and that the company will continue to accumulate BTC in the coming periods. Armstrong stated that they believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, emphasizing that the digital asset has “become the most reliable store of value in the global financial system.” The company's strategy aims to strengthen its financial stability and generate long-term returns by regularly accumulating BTC, independent of market fluctuations. Coinbase's acquisition in the last quarter is seen as a sign of renewed institutional interest in the crypto market. Rising demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in the US, and macroeconomic conditions supporting digital assets are strengthening the exchange's strategy. Experts say Coinbase's stance could boost market confidence and serve as a positive signal for other institutional investors. This will both strengthen the company's balance sheet and contribute to the long-term growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

According to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao – CZ, more “dips are coming along the way.” Powell’s speech during the conclusion of the Wednesday Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting rattled global markets, including digital assets. The US central bank announced a 0.25 percentage point reduction to its key lending rate to between 3.75% and 4%, the lowest level in three years. Many dips along the way. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 31, 2025 Two members of the Fed’s committee dissented, with Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voting to hold rates steady and Stephen Miran, currently on leave from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, pushing for a deeper 0.5% point cut. The decision followed last month’s rate cut and was expected to fuel optimism in risk assets like Bitcoin, but it led to a hemorrhage that saw investors lose $377 million through liquidations within 24 hours, as Cryptopolitan reported . Bitcoin falls below $107,000, is the market buying the dip? The largest coin by market cap Bitcoin led the market selloff, plunging under $107,000 on Thursday in one of its steepest weekly slumps in months. The crypto hit a low of $106,993 before slightly recovering above $107,300 and moving slowly above $109,000 early Friday morning. According to market enthusiast Immortal Crypto, 2025’s October is Bitcoin’s worst-performing “Uptober” in the last 7 years, with prices dropping 6.8% overall. Ethereum also declined, slipping 1.7% to around $3,850. The broader crypto market capitalization fell 0.46% to roughly $3.69 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. First red October in 7 years $BTC pic.twitter.com/WVG4jmpsn4 — Inmortal (@inmortalcrypto) October 30, 2025 On-chain data from Binance revealed that the bulk of Bitcoin’s Thursday’s selloff came from short-term holders, not long-term investors. Over 10,000 BTC flowed into Binance wallets during the volatility spike, a signal of incoming sell orders that could prolong a bearish phase. According to CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnChain, almost all of that Bitcoin, precisely 10,009 BTC, came from coins held for less than 24 hours. “This is the signature of hot money,” the analyst said , referring to fast-moving speculative capital that reacted instantly to the Fed’s speech. Bitcoin exchange activity on Binance. Source: CryptoQuant. Long-term holders, which he referred to as “diamond hands,” showed little activity when short-term traders were selling to stop the bleeding. Coins aged over six months were reportedly largely unmoved, and the data points to a “shakeout of weak hands” rather than the start of a structural downturn. “So, is winter coming? The on-chain evidence from Binance overwhelmingly suggests no. This was a textbook shakeout of weak hands, not a loss of conviction from long-term players. The underlying structure remains strong,” CryptoOnChain surmised. Trump’s tariff threats maul Uptober trend October has been a painful month for the broader crypto market with a much larger market crash that took place on October 10. Bitcoin lost more than $19 billion in open positions during what analytics firm CoinGlass coined as the largest liquidation event on record. That crash coincided with US President Donald Trump’s announcement threatening a 100% tariff on Chinese goods, causing Bitcoin’s market capitalization to drop by more than $200 million, with prices falling nearly 10%. According to CryptoQuant, citing data from Binance, retail traders sold another 9,200 BTC on Wednesday, equivalent to about $1 billion at the time. Short-term traders using leverage are seemingly rushing to exit during downturns while long-term investors quietly accumulate. Binance’s Retail Traders Daily Buy/Sell chart has shown repeated spikes in selling activity throughout October, each corresponding with intraday drops in Bitcoin’s price. According to Arab Chain, the rise in the scarcity index could mean whales and long-term holders are withdrawing Bitcoin from Binance to private wallets. This effectively reduces the amount of BTC available for sale, which could limit future downside pressure and take the market sentiment to neutral levels.

Following the debut of Bitwise’s BSOL and Grayscale’s GSOL this week, early inflows suggest growing interest in Solana-based investment products. Analysts believe that spot Solana ETFs could replicate the success seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which have already captured billions in assets. Growing Market Participation As of October 30, Solana ETFs recorded cumulative inflows of $154.73 million and total assets of $439.97 million. Bitwise’s BSOL led the surge, registering $36.55 million in daily inflows and $343.78 million in net assets. Source: SoSoValue Grayscale’s GSOL followed with $780,500 in daily inflows and $96.19 million in assets. The strong entry comes even as both funds posted slight daily losses of around 7%, reflecting broader weakness in Solana’s price movement. According to Grayscale executive Zach Pandl, Solana ETFs could grow into multi-billion-dollar products as institutional investors diversify across crypto assets. He believes Solana’s inclusion in regulated investment products provides access to investors who prefer traditional financial platforms. Consequently, this could attract new capital into the Solana ecosystem, reinforcing its position alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Institutional Demand and Diversification US-based ETFs already manage over $10 trillion in assets, making them an effective entry point for mainstream investors. Hence, the introduction of Solana ETFs aligns with growing institutional interest in digital assets. Despite some caution from traditional asset managers, demand for crypto exposure remains strong, especially among investors seeking diversification. Moreover, the current market includes a rising number of crypto investment vehicles. New products for Hedera and Litecoin joined the list this week, signaling increasing competition. However, analysts note that many investors may prefer diversified portfolios that reduce exposure risk from individual tokens. Staking Advantage and Long-Term Outlook Solana ETFs have a distinct advantage over Bitcoin-based products by allowing staking, offering investors an additional yield opportunity. Staking rewards averaged about 5.73% annually this week, according to Solana Compass . Grayscale’s GSOL distributes most of these rewards approximately 77% to holders, creating an income stream that complements price appreciation potential. Significantly, this staking feature may enhance long-term investor interest, positioning Solana ETFs as key instruments in diversified crypto portfolios. As the market matures, analysts expect Solana’s staking yield and network adoption to drive sustained institutional participation, supporting projections of up to $5 billion in future inflows.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-31 07:48:23

The large-scale Bitcoin movement has drawn attention, given its size and potential implications for market dynamics. The move arrives hours after Strategy reported a net income of $2.8 billion for its third quarter, exceeding Wall Street expectations. It reported diluted earnings per share of $8.42 for Q3, exceeding Street estimates of $8.15. The company, being the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, holds 640,808 Bitcoins valued at $70.28 billion. The holdings are up from 597,325 at the start of the third quarter. During the Strategy earnings call , Saylor noted that the company will remain focused on purchasing Bitcoin rather than pursuing any deal, even if it is accretive. Source: Arkham Strategy BTC Transfers Trigger Market Speculation: Is Liquidation Likely? The recent consecutive mass Bitcoin transfers from the Strategy wallet to various new addresses have triggered market speculation. Crypto analyst Emmett Gallic said that the transactions could be related to a “custody switch.” Strategy tested 9 new addresses (other than change addresses). My guess is that this related to a custody switch. ScriptHash address types (starting with 3) are the same as Coinbase Prime Deposits but that is not the case here because the test funds were not swept. pic.twitter.com/bbsOQlliz1 — Emmett Gallic (@emmettgallic) October 31, 2025 Mass transfers by large holders often align with custody restructuring or internal security upgrades, and not liquidation. The clue lies in the movement patterns – if assets stay offline, it’s probably housekeeping. Besides, Saylor is betting big on Bitcoin, predicting that the asset will reach $150,000. Speaking with CNBC at the Money 20/20 fintech conference in Las Vegas, he said that the Bitcoin bull run seems optimistic for a clear market structure. “I think Bitcoin is going to continue to grind up,” Saylor noted. “Our expectation right now is [at the] end of the year it should be about $150,000.” Further, the Strategy frontman reiterated that regardless of price, the company will be “buying the top forever.” That said, the transfers confirm an internal restructuring rather than a massive selloff, at a time when the Strategy has achieved a 26.0% BTC yield in 2025 YTD and $12.9 billion BTC $ gain. “We generated BTC yield of 26% and BTC $ gain of $13 billion, year-to-date, and we are reaffirming our full-year guidance for operating income of $34 billion, net income of $24 billion, and diluted EPS of $80 per share, based on a BTC price outlook of $150,000 at the end of the year,” said Andrew Kang, Strategy’s Chief Financial Officer.

Warren: Crypto King Threatens To Take US Senator To Court,https://bitcoinist.com/cz-vs-warren-crypto-king-threatens-to-take-us-senator-to-court/,"Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao is preparing to sue US Senator Elizabeth Warren for defamation, his legal team says, after she criticized his recent pardon by US President Donald Trump. According to reports , lawyers for CZ have sent a letter demanding a retraction of a social media post that accused him of pleading guilty to money laundering and of “buying” a pardon. Legal Threat Looms Zhao’s attorney, named in coverage as Teresa Goody Guillén of Baker & Hostetler, told media outlets that a public retraction is being sought and that a lawsuit is likely if Warren does not correct her post. Based on reports, the legal notice argues that Warren’s phrasing wrongly equates Zhao’s guilty plea with a money-laundering conviction and harms his reputation. In 2023, Zhao pleaded guilty as part of a settlement tied to failures in Binance’s anti-money-laundering program. The company agreed to pay roughly $4.3 billion and Zhao served about four months behind bars, according to court records and reporting. CZ pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge and was sentenced to prison. But then he financed President Trump’s stablecoin and lobbied for a pardon. Today, he got it. If Congress does not stop this kind of corruption, it owns it. pic.twitter.com/NsWeaJcVeK — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) October 23, 2025 Trump issued a pardon for Zhao on October 23, 2025. Pardon Sparks Political Fire Senator Warren posted on X (formerly Twitter) in the wake of the pardon, writing that CZ “pleaded guilty to a criminal money laundering charge” and alleging he had used influence tied to a Trump-linked stablecoin. Her message framed the pardon as an example of corruption that Congress should oppose. Warren’s official Senate statement repeated criticisms of the pardon. SCOOP: Crypto mogul Changpeng Zhao mulls suing Elizabeth Warren, demands retraction for alleged libel after Trump’s pardon cc @SenWarren @cz_binance @teresagoody https://t.co/04blEIgRNU — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) October 28, 2025 Legal experts say defamation suits involving public figures are hard to win in the US because plaintiffs must show false statements made with actual malice — that is, with knowledge they were false or with reckless disregard for the truth. But lawyers for Zhao point out that posts made on social media by members of Congress may not always be protected by congressional immunities, opening a possible legal path. A Case Of Words Versus Records Reports quote the CZ camp insisting on a factual distinction: his plea related to lapses in compliance and the company’s failure to maintain adequate controls, not a formal money-laundering conviction. That difference matters legally and in public perception, his lawyers say. Coverage also notes that the broader settlement and sentence drew wide attention because of the size of the fine and the sensitive nature of the allegations tied to illicit activity on some parts of the exchange.

Ripple’s Plan Unveiled,https://timestabloid.com/there-are-100-quadrillion-drops-of-xrp-ripples-plan-unveiled/,"A recent post from crypto researcher SMQKE highlighted two claims: that Ripple has joined the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and that the XRP ledger’s divisibility results in 100 quadrillion “drops,” implying design intent for participation in markets of quadrillion-dollar scale. The post frames these facts as connected, arguing that the ledger’s unit structure aligns with the practical scale of global derivatives markets and suggesting a strategic positioning for institutional derivatives. THERE ARE 100 QUADRILLION DROPS OF XRP AS RIPPLE TARGETS THE QUADRILLION-DOLLAR DERIVATIVES MARKET XRP was designed with the scale of global derivatives in mind from the very beginning. pic.twitter.com/bZ7JalmTSI — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 29, 2025 What the attachments show One attached image reproduces a headline asserting Ripple’s ISDA membership, referencing a $1.2 quadrillion derivatives market. A second attachment is an excerpt describing XRP as a finite supply token with 100 billion units created at genesis and subunits (drops) down to six decimal places, producing a total of 100 quadrillion drops. Those two assertions form the basis of the researcher’s argument: ISDA membership signals access to derivatives infrastructure, while the numeric divisibility is presented as a built-in attribute that could accommodate large notional markets. Responses from the community Responses to the researcher’s post show divergent community reactions. Some contributors emphasize the practical implications, arguing that derivatives markets are the primary venue where large-scale utility and price discovery for XRP could materialize. Others stress that design characteristics alone do not guarantee adoption, urging that tangible use and integrations must follow declarations and memberships before market impact can be realized. Assessment and implications ISDA membership, if confirmed by primary sources, would be noteworthy because ISDA is a central industry body for standardized derivatives documentation and market practices. Such membership can facilitate industry engagement, but it does not, by itself, create liquidity or guarantee derivatives exposure for any specific token. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Similarly, the ledger’s divisibility is a technical fact; a high number of subunits facilitates fine-grained accounting for large notional amounts but does not equate to immediate demand from derivatives desks or institutional counterparties. The potential pathway to derivatives participation requires at least three elements: verified institutional-access arrangements, exchange and clearing infrastructure that supports XRP-denominated instruments, and demonstrated counterparty willingness to assume exposure. Each element involves regulatory, operational, and market-adoption hurdles distinct from the protocol’s numeric design. In sum, the researcher’s post brings attention to two factual anchors—ISDA membership claims and the 100 quadrillion drops divisibility—but converting those anchors into meaningful derivatives market participation requires substantive follow-through across markets, intermediaries, and regulators.

The search for the top crypto to buy in November is in full swing as traders look for breakout coins with momentum before the year closes. Timing matters, and catching the right coin early can make all the difference. Crypto memes are back, and traders are laughing their way through Discord channels while hunting the top crypto to buy in November. “Buy early or cry later” has become the new rallying cry. Toncoin and SUI are rolling out real ecosystem updates, but MoonBull’s presale is building excitement that’s turning heads fast. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Star of the Top Crypto to Buy in November MoonBull ($MOBU) has quickly become one of the most talked-about tokens among the top cryptos to buy in November . Built on Ethereum, it focuses on fairness, sustainability, and community rewards while adding humor and meme energy that Gen Z traders love. It is designed to benefit small investors who often lose to whales and bots. Two main features fuel trust and credibility. First, MoonBull passed a full audit and locked its liquidity, giving holders peace of mind about transparency. Second, at Stage 12 of its presale, community voting will go live, giving holders the power to vote on key events like token burns or marketing pushes. This puts control in the hands of real investors. MoonBull Presale Momentum: Stage 5 and Counting The MoonBull presale is now in Stage 5 at $0.00006584 per token with more than $500,000 already raised and over 1,600 holders. ROI from Stage 5 to the $0.00616 listing price is around 9,256%, while early investors already enjoy over 163% growth. The next price increase of 27.4% is right around the corner. A $20,000 investment today buys about 303,766,707 MOBU tokens. At listing, that could grow to $1,871,202. Toncoin (TON): CoinShares Launches Zero-Fee ETP & Market Cap Slips Below $6B Recently, CoinShares unveiled a new exchange-traded product (ETP) for Toncoin, offering zero management fees and a roughly 2% staking yield for investors. The roll-out on the SIX Swiss Exchange gives Toncoin institutional and retail exposure through a regulated vehicle. At the same time, Toncoin’s market cap fell below the $6 billion mark amid broader altcoin weakness, raising questions about short-term momentum. The institutional access provided by the new ETP could accelerate adoption of Toncoin via more regulated channels, yet the drop in market cap signals that investors remain cautious for now. The combination of wider access and current weakness gives a mixed picture for TON’s next move. The ETP could serve as a catalyst for renewed interest, but underlying tokenomics and supply unlocks remain material risks. SUI: Stablecoin Surge Meets Big Token Unlock and Volume Drop The SUI ecosystem saw its stablecoin market cap jump by about 19%, as new DeFi integrations and network growth spurred investor optimism. Meanwhile, SUI faced headwinds when a large token unlock event released millions of tokens, triggering a sharp price drop and volume plunge of more than 50% in recent weeks. This split signal puts SUI in a dual narrative zone: on one hand, stronger utility and stablecoin flows hint at growth; on the other hand, liquidity and price stress raise caution. For traders watching the top crypto to buy in November, SUI offers a potential turnaround play, but the environment requires patience and risk awareness. Final Thoughts MoonBull ($MOBU) delivers the hype, structure, and early access that define the top crypto to buy in November . Toncoin offers credible institutional expansion, while SUI shows growing infrastructure potential through stablecoins and new staking options. Each project targets a different risk level, but all share strong momentum heading into the new month. Based on research and market trends, this is a window worth watching. MoonBull’s presale is live and heating up as stages fill fast. Toncoin and SUI give more established investors solid options with utility and credibility. Early movers will likely benefit the most as this cycle builds up speed.

In 2025, several licensed exchanges and bridges now offer SEPA and SEPA Instant withdrawals, allowing European users to cash out securely, quickly, and without hidden costs. Here’s how SEPA crypto withdrawals work, what to look out for, and which trusted platforms handle the process most efficiently. What Is SEPA and How It Works SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) is a European banking system that standardizes euro transfers across participating countries. It connects more than 30 nations, allowing users to send and receive euros as easily as domestic payments. For crypto users, SEPA integration means: Fast euro withdrawals directly to a bank account (often within one business day or instantly with SEPA Instant). Low fees, compared to international wire transfers. Regulatory clarity, since only verified, compliant services can offer SEPA payments. SEPA is the bridge between digital assets and traditional banking, turning crypto holdings into spendable euros with minimal friction. How to Withdraw Crypto via SEPA Choose a licensed platform that supports EUR withdrawals (check for VASP or EMI registration). Verify your account through KYC, if not already done. Sell or convert crypto (BTC, ETH, USDT, etc.) to EUR. Add your IBAN bank account details. Withdraw euros using SEPA or SEPA Instant. Funds typically arrive within 24 hours, but instant options are becoming increasingly common among modern crypto bridges. Top Trusted Platforms for SEPA Withdrawals in 2025 1. Clapp — Regulated, Fast, and Fully Integrated Clapp.finance is one of the most convenient SEPA-enabled crypto platforms in Europe. Licensed as a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic, it combines crypto trading, portfolio management, and fiat conversion within a single app. Users can sell crypto for euros and withdraw directly to their bank account through SEPA or SEPA Instant. Liquidity is sourced from multiple providers, optimizing conversion rates in real time. Security is handled by Fireblocks, an institutional-grade custody provider used by leading financial institutions. Why choose Clapp: Direct crypto-to-EUR conversion Fireblocks-secured wallet Competitive real-time rates Expanding regulatory coverage (Dubai, Slovakia, Mauritius, El Salvador) User-friendly all-in-one design Best for: Investors who want a regulated, full-service bridge for portfolio management and fiat access. 2. Kraken — Transparent Fees, Proven Track Record Kraken is one of the most established names in crypto, known for its security, compliance, and deep liquidity. It offers EUR withdrawals via SEPA, with a small flat withdrawal fee of €1 and trading fees between 0.16–0.26 %. Transfers usually complete within a business day, making Kraken ideal for both retail and institutional users. Best for: Professionals and long-term investors who prioritize reliability and regulatory trust. 3. Binance — Instant Card Payouts and SEPA Transfers Binance provides both SEPA withdrawals and instant card transfers for European users.The platform’s “Sell-to-Card” feature allows users to cash out BTC, ETH, or stablecoins instantly to their debit card, while SEPA transfers offer a lower-cost alternative. Card payouts are nearly instant but come with higher fees (around 1.8–2 %). SEPA transfers, by contrast, are cheaper and typically complete within 24 hours. Best for: Active users looking for speed and convenience. 4. Bitstamp — Regulated and Europe-Focused Bitstamp is one of the oldest licensed crypto exchanges in Europe and has maintained a strong compliance record since 2011.It offers SEPA euro withdrawals with transparent fees (around €3 per transaction) and reliable processing times. Its simple interface and regulated status make it a trusted choice for investors who value consistency over flashiness. Best for: Users seeking a proven, regulation-first off-ramp. 5. Coinbase — Simple, Accessible, and Beginner-Friendly Coinbase continues to serve as a go-to off-ramp for beginners. It supports SEPA withdrawals to linked bank accounts, allowing users to convert crypto into euros within minutes through an intuitive interface. Fees are higher (around 1 % plus spread), but the platform’s accessibility, reputation, and responsive support justify the premium. Best for: New crypto investors who want a hassle-free fiat withdrawal experience. 6. OKX — Low Fees and Expanding SEPA Support OKX supports crypto-to-EUR conversions with competitive spreads and growing SEPA coverage in Europe. It’s designed for users who want flexibility — whether they prefer manual trading, passive portfolio tracking, or automated execution. Best for: Cost-conscious traders who need a balance between low fees and liquidity. 7. Revolut — Instant EUR Access for Everyday Users Revolut is a fintech app rather than a traditional exchange, but it offers instant crypto-to-EUR conversions for verified European users. Selling Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT in-app transfers euros immediately into your Revolut balance, ready to spend or send. While spreads are slightly higher, Revolut’s ease and speed make it ideal for smaller, frequent withdrawals. Best for: Everyday users seeking instant fiat access through a familiar banking app. Top Platforms for SEPA Crypto Withdrawal Platform Strengths Best For Clapp Licensed, Fireblocks-secured, real-time rates Retail investors Kraken Transparent pricing, strong security Institutional & pro users Binance Fast payouts, wide asset support Active traders Bitstamp EU-regulated, consistent Conservative investors Coinbase Beginner-friendly, simple UX New users OKX Low fees, advanced tools Cost-focused users Revolut Instant euro access Casual users Tips for Smooth SEPA Withdrawals Always verify your IBAN and ensure your bank accepts crypto-related transactions. Check if your provider offers SEPA Instant for near-immediate transfers. Monitor conversion spreads — even small differences affect large withdrawals. Withdraw during business hours for faster bank processing. Enable two-factor authentication for maximum account security. Final Thoughts In 2025, SEPA has become the gold standard for crypto withdrawals across Europe — fast, regulated, and inexpensive. Platforms like Clapp , Kraken, and Bitstamp are leading this transformation, giving users full control over how and when they move from crypto to fiat. Whether you prefer institutional-grade protection, instant access, or beginner simplicity, today’s trusted SEPA bridges make withdrawing crypto into euros more seamless than ever.

Solana’s SOL has wiped out 5% from its value in the last 24 hours, bringing its year-to-date gains to only 6%. With the current market conditions, SOL could dip lower as sellers are currently in control. Spot ETF debuts fail to boost price The first spot-based Solana ETFs began trading in the United States earlier this week. However, the launch didn’t spark a rally for SOL, as the cryptocurrency lost 5% of its value in the last 24 hours. SOL briefly dropped below $180, bringing its year-to-date gains to just 6%. The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), launched on Tuesday, recorded a $116 million net inflow across the first two sessions. Meanwhile, the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL), which was converted from a closed-end fund into an ETF on Wednesday, attracted a meagre $1.4 million inflow. However, the inflows weren’t enough to push SOL’s price higher, as it is currently 12% down from Monday’s high. Despite that, experts remain optimistic about SOL’s performance in the medium to long term. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan revealed that he’s making two bets at once when investing in Solana. He added that an investment in Solana is based on a dual bet that the stablecoin and tokenisation infrastructure market will grow, with Solana’s share of the market rising alongside. He added that, “Over time, I suspect nearly all payments will be in stablecoins and nearly all assets will be tokenized. The blockchains that facilitate this growth will be extremely valuable. It’s easy to imagine this market growing by 10x or more. If I’m right, the combination of a growing market and a growing share of that market will be explosive for Solana.

Blockchain data showed that Jump Crypto moved 1.1 million SOL (worth $205 million) to Galaxy Digital, receiving roughly 2,455 BTC ($265 million) around the same time.

Ether.Fi Community Votes on $50 Million ETHFI Buyback Plan The proposal proposes approving the use of up to $50 million worth of funds from the protocol's treasury to purchase ETHFI when the token price falls below $3. The aim of the plan was to gradually accumulate ETHFI tokens during periods of price decline and support the token value by directing a portion of the protocol's revenues to the buyback process. The buyback process will begin immediately after DAO approval is received and will end when one of the following conditions are met: the total buyback amount reaches $50 million, the Ether.Fi Foundation deems the plan complete, or the plan is changed by community vote. The proposal will be voted on over four days on the community voting platform Snapshot. If approved, the buybacks will take effect immediately once the specified price condition is met. This move is seen as part of the Ether.Fi community's strategy to support market stability and strengthen the token economy. Experts say that if approved, the proposal could positively impact ETHFI's long-term supply-demand balance. *This is not investment advice.

The move removes traditional friction points in moving between fiat and crypto, replicating the company’s decade-old approach to foreign exchange that made transparent currency conversion a standard expectation for digital banking users. Leonid Bashlykov, Head of Product Crypto at Revolut, announced the feature on LinkedIn, emphasizing that users will receive exactly $1.00 in stablecoins for every $1.00 in cash and vice versa. The service supports transfers across six blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Tron, providing fee-less on-ramp and off-ramp capabilities that eliminate the markup typically charged by exchanges and trading platforms. Source: LinkedIn Crypto Trading Drives 298% Revenue Surge Revolut’s wealth division, encompassing cryptocurrency, commodities, trading, and savings products, generated £506 million in 2024 while posting 298% year-over-year revenue growth. Source: 2024 Annual Report The surge was primarily driven by increased crypto trading activity across the industry, as well as the successful May 2024 launch of Revolut X, the company’s standalone desktop trading platform designed for professional traders. Revolut X offers trading in more than 100 tokens with fixed fees of 0% for makers and 0.09% for takers, regardless of volume, positioning it as a direct competitor to established crypto exchanges. The platform was expanded to 30 additional European countries in November 2024 , providing real-time trading tools, advanced analytics, and TradingView chart integration for users across the European Economic Area. The fintech reported record financial results for 2024, surpassing $1 billion in annual profit for the first time with net earnings reaching £1.1 billion, a 149% increase compared to the previous year. Total revenue increased 72% to £3.1 billion , with subscription services rising 74% to £423 million and the loan book expanding 86% to £979 million as the company prepared to launch full banking operations in the UK following its approval of a restricted banking license in July 2024. Platform Expansion and Strategic Partnerships The company launched Revolut Ramp in March 2024 , partnering with MetaMask developer Consensys to enable users to purchase crypto directly in their Web3 wallets. In August, Revolut partnered with Ledger , allowing customers in several EEA countries to buy cryptocurrencies using their Revolut accounts or cards through Ledger Live. Most customer funds are stored in cold storage with 24/7 encrypted chat support, while advanced risk monitoring tools prevent account takeovers. The platform integrates a Crypto Learn tool to improve crypto knowledge for retail users, particularly targeting first-time crypto buyers with educational resources alongside trading capabilities. Regulatory Progress and Global Expansion Plans Revolut Digital Assets Europe Ltd secured Crypto Asset Service Provider registration from Spain’s Bank of Spain and De Nederlandsche Bank in 2024 as the company works toward full MiCA authorization across the European Union. The regulatory progress comes as Revolut pursues banking licenses in 10 additional countries while planning over €1 billion in French investment through 2028, including the establishment of a Western European headquarters in Paris. The company is exploring the acquisition of a US nationally chartered bank to accelerate its entry into the American market, bypassing the lengthy charter application process that can take years. @RevolutApp may buy a US bank with a national charter to fast-track its American expansion and bypass the lengthy process of obtaining its own licence. #Revolut #Fintech https://t.co/xeDYK3miuI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Revolut currently serves 60 million customers globally, with 12 million based in the UK, though crypto services remain suspended in the United States since October 2023 due to regulatory uncertainty. Founder and CEO Nik Storonsky secured new investment in 2024 through a secondary share sale at a $45 billion implied valuation. Recent reports also suggest the company is in talks for a $1 billion fundraising round that would value the fintech at approximately $65 billion. The company is also reportedly considering a dual listing in London and New York , which could position it among the top 15 most valuable firms on the London Stock Exchange and make it the first company to simultaneously join the FTSE 100 and list in New York.

The temporary order was issued on Thursday by Judge David S. Jones of the Southern District of New York, mandating stablecoin issuer Circle to keep assets in three Ethereum wallets frozen and preserve the dollar reserves that back the stolen USDC. The court said the order was necessary to prevent the potential loss or misappropriation of assets while cross-border liquidation proceedings continue. US federal court takes over the case Multichain Singapore’s liquidation case was initially filed in New York state court, but was moved to federal court last week after Circle invoked the Class Action Fairness Act. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 broadened the authority of US federal courts to oversee class action lawsuits initially filed in state courts. The law permits defendants to transfer such cases to federal jurisdiction if specific criteria are met, including a minimum number of class members and a monetary threshold for the dispute. For a federal district court to hear a case, it must hold jurisdiction over both the parties and the subject matter, known as personal and subject matter jurisdiction, respectively. The transfer automatically paused a separate class action brought by a group of US investors asking courts to hand control of the same $63 million to them through litigation against Circle. That case had been proceeding in state court before the federal move changed the jurisdiction. Judge Jones’ order is provisional under Section 1519 of the US Bankruptcy Code, which allows courts to grant temporary relief to protect assets before formally recognizing a foreign bankruptcy or liquidation case. Singapore-appointed liquidators insisted to Judge Jones lifting the freeze could cause “immediate and irreparable harm,” particularly if the assets were moved or claimed outside the two jurisdiction’s coordinated legal proceedings. The next step for the liquidators will be to convince the US court to recognize the Singapore proceeding as a “foreign main proceeding” under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Singapore liquidators can act within the US jurisdiction if the recognition is granted, and will likely proceed with recovering funds under joint supervision with American courts. Multichain’s collapse led to missing funds Multichain, formerly known as Anyswap, was one of the most used cross-chain asset bridges in the crypto industry. Through the bridge, users could transfer tokens between blockchain networks Binance Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, and Ethereum, without necessarily selling or converting their holdings. As reported by Bloomberg, the entity’s chief executive officer, Zhaojun, was apprehended by Chinese authorities in July 2023. After news of his arrest broke, users almost immediately started lodging complaints of delays, failed transactions, and pending transfers. The company disclosed that approximately $121 million worth of digital assets had been “abnormally” transferred to an “unknown address” within the same month. Multichain asked users to stop using the protocol and revoke all contract approvals immediately. The Multichain hack profoundly affected several ecosystems using its bridging infrastructure, particularly Fantom, a Layer 1 blockchain now known as Sonic Labs, that had endorsed the protocol as its primary bridge. After the exploit happened, Sonic Labs estimated that the total value of assets lost had ballooned to $210 million. According to data from DeFiLlama, Multichain held about $1.25 billion worth of assets in its smart contracts at the time of the breach. Sonic Labs filed a lawsuit in Singapore against Multichain, “after months of failed communication and recovery efforts,” Cryptopolitan reported . The former accused the bridge protocol’s leadership of refusing to cooperate with victims and investigators. On May 9, the Singapore High Court ruled in favor of Sonic Labs and ordered the forced liquidation of the Multichain Foundation, alongside appointing accounting firm KPMG as the official liquidator.

The deal is part of a larger effort by Nvidia to expand AI computing infrastructure across major global technology economies, though financial details have not been released yet as of press time. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is in South Korea attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit, where he continued promoting Nvidia’s hardware as the backbone for national-scale AI systems. The South Korean government plans to build what it is calling sovereign AI infrastructure, and it will involve installing more than 50,000 Nvidia accelerator chips in public and private data centers. These include the National AI Computing Center and facilities operated by Kakao, Naver, and NHN Cloud. The plan focuses on maintaining domestic control over high‑level AI computing rather than outsourcing AI workloads to foreign cloud networks. Samsung, Hyundai, and SK deploy large GPU clusters Samsung will build a facility described internally as an AI factory, which will host over 50,000 Nvidia chips. Samsung will use the chips to train and deploy its own in-house AI models for devices and internal systems. Nvidia representatives said Samsung will also modify its chipmaking lithography platform to work with Nvidia GPUs, a change Nvidia said could increase performance efficiency by up to 20 times. Samsung will also adopt Nvidia’s Omniverse simulation software. In addition to being a customer, Samsung is also a supplier to Nvidia, producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) used alongside the GPUs. Samsung confirmed it will collaborate with Nvidia to adjust its fourth-generation HBM memory for improved AI chip compatibility. Hyundai Motor Group will use a similar number of Nvidia’s Blackwell-based processors that will support Hyundai’s development of AI models for manufacturing automation and autonomous driving systems, as well as training cycles involving telemetry, robotics workflows, and real-world navigation datasets. The allocation aligns with Hyundai’s move toward AI-driven car development and software-defined vehicle platforms. SK Group is deploying Nvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell server chips in what Nvidia described as Asia’s first industrial AI cloud, intended for robotics operations and AI-assisted physical process workflows. By putting Blackwell GPUs in industrial settings, SK Group is focusing on applying AI inside active production systems rather than only digital platforms, said Jensen. Nvidia’s expansion into South Korea comes during a period of extreme demand for high-performance AI hardware after becoming the first to exceed $5 trillion in market value and Nvidia stock is up 11% in the five trading sessions through Thursday, as Cryptopolitan reported . During a company event in Washington, Jensen said that Nvidia currently has a $500 billion business pipeline for its Blackwell GPUs and its next-generation Rubin systems. Whether Nvidia will be able to sell its Blackwell processors to China remains unresolved. U.S. export restrictions currently limit shipments of high‑end GPUs to China. President Donald Trump said he was open to discussing the issue but did not raise it during a recent meeting with President Xi Jinping. Local Korean media reported that after his speech, Jensen went out for beer in Seoul with Samsung Chairman Lee Jae‑yong and other business leaders. Check out the video below:- document.createElement('video'); https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fxc1heyX2Yf05aXb.mp4 Nvidia confirmed that SK Group and Hyundai are preparing GPU deployments in similar ranges to those previously outlined in government talks. “We’re working closely with the Korean government to support its ambitious leadership plans in AI,” Raymond Teh, Nvidia’s Senior Vice President for Asia-Pacific, said during a call with reporters.

Jump forward to 2025, and the market is once more on the lookout for that next big crypto to deliver those runaway gains. Wall Street is sure bet in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-rising DeFi project already making waves as what’s the best crypto to buy today. Currently selling at a meager $0.035 and at Stage 6 of presale, MUTM has already attained over $18.25 million, with over 80% sold out of tokens as testament to massive investor trust. At the helm is MUTM’s twin-lending protocol, the first DeFi protocol to combine Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract methods for the sake of capital efficiency catalysis and long-term sustenance. With not much time left before the subsequent phase price increase, investors are lining up, and most analysts believe that Mutuum Finance can be the next big crypto phenomenon but with quality use case and DeFi wizardry behind it instead. Dogecoin (DOGE) Loses Momentum as Whales Offload $97 Million, Is the Hype Finally Waning? Dogecoin (DOGE) has fallen by a sharp 2.88% to $0.194 in the past 24 hours, behind the overall crypto market. The weakness follows after whales dumped more than 500 million DOGE ($97 million) in a rush and causing a record 61% decline in futures open interest to $1.95 billion, an indication that traders were closing positions after anticipated heightened volatility. Apart from the bearishness, DOGE went below its 200-day EMA with a death cross prevailing, a technical indicator in the past which has been responsible for larger corrections. The present $0.19 level is a decent support, particularly because speculators are waiting for the Oct 30 Fed rate announcement, which can be responsible for DOGE’s next massive movement. While momentum seems to be wasted on Dogecoin currently, prospective growth investors already are seeking what’s the best crypto to buy in 2025. Many are turning toward newcomers such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a new DeFi token that has the potential to replicate early DOGE-style behavior but with real-world utility, strong fundamentals, and long-term sustainability as the next big crypto. Mutuum Finance Records Significant Progress and Extremely Significant Milestones Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the 2025 tokens’ fastest risers, fueled by a record-breaking presale boom that has continued to set new records. The project has been able to close six rounds of presale with $18.25 million in funds gathered from more than 17,600 investors. With Phase 6 over 80% sold out and the tokens currently trading at $0.035, now’s a good time to join before the price gets increased by 20% in the next round. For early adopters who want access to a rapidly growing DeFi name with decent fundamentals, Mutuum Finance is what’s the best crypto to buy before 2025’s major bull run. Aside from its thriving presale phase, Mutuum Finance also offers real income potential with its liquidity networks of funds, where MUTM token holders may stake tokens like USDT and earn annual percentage yields (APY) on trading volumes. For example, a first-time stake of $70,000 at 10% APY will amount to around $7,000 yearly, compounded automatically. This clean, action-based, and reproducible source of return positions Mutuum Finance in the space of long-term investors and short-term seekers of yield alike, solidifying it as the next big crypto that stands apart from pure speculation with both active and passive income opportunities. $100,000 Community Rewards Program Spurs Engagement With its traditional bid to reward its increasing user base and new admirers, Mutuum Finance is launching a captivating $100,000 giveaway contest. Ten users will be awarded $10,000 each in MUTM tokens under this offer again, reiterating the project’s mission of people-fostered expansion. It is easy to get involved, and the investors must invest a minimum of $50 in the ongoing presale phase and accomplish some little community contribution tasks on the official website of Mutuum Finance. The project represents Mutuum Finance’s vision of having a diversified, committed, and invested investor base globally in the future. Through the fusion of usability and actual returns, the project not only welcomes participants with open arms but also opens the door for the future generation of DeFi innovation. The Next Dogecoin (DOGE) Though Dogecoin (DOGE) did it all with its boom, Mutuum Finance is achieving it through innovation and real-world use. With a record-breaking presale, solid DeFi foundations, and a global community, MUTM is what’s the best crypto to buy and the next big crypto capable of turning small investments into life-changing returns. Investors looking for what’s the best crypto to buy before the next rally should act fast, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge as 2025’s next big crypto poised for exponential growth.

The senator stated that the platform had donated $46 million to support the election of individuals connected to Trump, while also making substantial payments to Trump’s inaugural fund. Murphy also stated that Coinbase was guilty of engaging in the initiative to purchase a new White House ballroom, which he called part of “Trump’s corruption factory,” according to the Washington Post. He said that since the funding source had not been disclosed, Senate Democrats had demanded a full explanation of how the alleged $300 million mega-project was being financed. Murphy’s accusations against Coinbase came amid an intensifying struggle within the Democratic Party over alleged political interference in financial policy. In addition to its spat with Coinbase, the senator has accused another prominent crypto exchange, Binance.US, of adding the USD1 stablecoin in exchange as a favor to Trump. Meanwhile, as earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , Binance.US strongly denied the allegation, stating that its connections to USD 1 were fully valid. Coinbase rejects claims and defends its conduct In his response, Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, said that the accusations made by Murphy sounded ridiculous and lacked substantiation. Shirzad noted that the claim that the President Trump administration favors Coinbase was completely unfounded. He further explained that the company’s main PAC, Fairshake, was bipartisan and had supported several Democrats, such as three of Senator Murphy’s fellow senators. Thus, it is clear that there was no reason for the accusations. Moreover, the key person emphasized that the donations made to the White House ballroom appeared to have been sent to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonpartisan corporation with which companies from various industries work. Before providing the conclusion, the Chief Policy Officer at Coinbase emphasized that it was not a political project, but rather a civic project. He concluded, urging the senator to understand the difference before making further accusations. The top executive defended the lawsuit decision, arguing further in response to the SEC’s past actions. Shirzad responded to Murphy’s claim with a new one. Specifically, he said that the prior leadership of the SEC engaged in bullying and abuse of power towards crypto companies. According to the executive, the current leadership did the right thing on the merits by dropping the case. Shirzad suggested that some lawmakers disliked it. He further claimed that it was unfortunate because his company worked to maintain the U.S. financial system’s competitiveness. Coinbase sparks new debate on crypto’s role in politics The clash demonstrates how cryptocurrency and politics have become intertwined. Since 2022, the cryptocurrency industry has invested a substantial amount of money in politics. The leading donors to Fairshake super PAC have been Coinbase, Ripple , and the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz. The investment firm is known for funding candidates who appear most favorable to world-changing digital asset innovation. After years of struggling with regulators, Coinbase now engages in American politics from an antagonistic viewpoint. The SEC’s victory in the suit filed against Coinbase allowed company executives to seek portions of straightforward, regular law regarding cryptocurrencies. But Shirzad argued Coinbase’s interest in American politics was motivated by openness rather than partiality. He claimed that the firm’s campaigning was centered on “transparency, innovation, and fairness.” Shirzad went on to say that Senator Murphy’s political blowback was predicated on falsehoods and could not change the enterprise’s dedication to those precepts.

A key political figure, poised for significant influence, unexpectedly steps down. What would be the immediate fallout? For the United Kingdom, this scenario involving a potential Reeves resignation is not just hypothetical; it’s a genuine concern that leading financial institutions like ING are actively considering. Their stark warning suggests that such a surprise departure from Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chancellor, could unleash an ‘alarming market shockwave’, sending ripples far beyond Westminster and into the pockets of investors worldwide. Let’s delve into why this political prospect carries such substantial economic weight and what it could mean for the delicate balance of the UK economy . The Weight of Rachel Reeves’ Role and a Potential Reeves Resignation Rachel Reeves stands as a pivotal figure in the current UK political climate. As the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, she is not merely an opposition spokesperson but the designated individual who would take the reins of the nation’s finances should the Labour Party win the next general election. Her role involves scrutinizing government fiscal policy, proposing alternative economic strategies, and, crucially, projecting an image of fiscal responsibility and competence. This projection is vital for market confidence. Why would a surprise Reeves resignation be so impactful? Markets thrive on certainty and predictability. When a key figure, particularly one who has meticulously crafted an economic narrative for a potential future government, suddenly exits the stage, it creates a vacuum of uncertainty. Investors, both domestic and international, rely on these established figures to provide a sense of direction and stability. Reeves has consistently aimed to reassure markets about Labour’s economic plans, emphasizing fiscal prudence and a commitment to strong public finances. Her unexpected departure would: Signal internal disarray: A sudden resignation often hints at deeper issues within a political party, suggesting instability or disagreement on core policies. Create policy ambiguity: Her successor, if not immediately apparent or equally well-regarded, might not command the same market trust, leading to questions about the future economic direction. Undermine investor confidence: Without a clear, trusted hand guiding potential future economic policy, investors might pull back, awaiting clarity. ING’s analysis underscores that it’s not just who leaves, but how and when . A surprise element amplifies the negative reaction, as markets have no time to price in the risk or adjust their expectations gradually. This sudden jolt is precisely what could trigger a disproportionate negative response. Unpacking the Immediate Market Impact of Political Uncertainty When political stability falters, financial markets are often the first to react, and rarely in a positive way. A surprise Reeves resignation would likely trigger an immediate and sharp market impact across various asset classes. ING’s warning points to a knee-jerk reaction, driven by fear and the rapid repricing of risk. Let’s break down how this immediate market impact could manifest: Equities Market Sell-Off: Investor sentiment is a powerful driver of stock prices. Uncertainty breeds caution, and caution often leads to selling. UK-listed companies, particularly those with significant domestic exposure, could see their share prices fall as investors anticipate slower economic growth or a less predictable policy environment. Bond Market Turmoil: Government bonds, or ‘gilts’ in the UK, are often seen as safe havens. However, political instability can make even these appear risky. If investors perceive a higher chance of fiscal imprudence or increased borrowing costs due to policy uncertainty, gilt yields could rise sharply (meaning bond prices fall). This was famously demonstrated during the Liz Truss mini-budget crisis, where a lack of market confidence in fiscal plans led to a dramatic sell-off in gilts. Currency Depreciation: The British Pound (GBP) is highly sensitive to political developments. A sudden Reeves resignation would almost certainly lead to immediate GBP volatility and likely depreciation against major currencies like the US Dollar and the Euro. International investors might view the UK as a less attractive destination for capital, leading to outflows and weakening the currency. Increased Volatility: Beyond just price movements, markets would likely experience a surge in volatility. This means larger, more erratic swings in asset prices as traders and investors grapple with the sudden shift in the political landscape and try to ascertain the long-term implications. The speed of information dissemination in modern financial markets means that reactions are almost instantaneous. Automated trading systems, programmed to react to news and sentiment indicators, would amplify initial movements, potentially leading to rapid and significant price adjustments before human analysis can fully catch up. Broader Ramifications for the UK Economy Beyond the immediate market gyrations, a surprise Reeves resignation could cast a long shadow over the broader UK economy . The ripple effects of political uncertainty extend far beyond trading screens, influencing everything from business investment to household confidence. Here are some key areas where the UK economy could feel the pinch: Business Investment: Companies thrive on stability and a clear policy environment. If the future direction of economic policy becomes uncertain, businesses may delay or cancel investment plans. This hesitancy can slow down innovation, job creation, and overall economic growth. Why commit capital when you don’t know what the tax regime, regulatory landscape, or growth prospects will look like in a year or two? Consumer Confidence: Households are also sensitive to economic and political stability. If news of a significant political upheaval leads to concerns about job security, inflation, or the general economic outlook, consumers might cut back on discretionary spending. This reduction in demand can further depress economic activity. International Standing: The UK’s reputation as a stable and predictable place to do business could be tarnished. International investors and trading partners might view the country with increased caution, potentially impacting foreign direct investment (FDI) and trade relationships. Fiscal Policy Uncertainty: Reeves has been instrumental in shaping Labour’s fiscal narrative. Her departure would create uncertainty around future tax and spending plans, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs for the government if lenders demand a greater premium for the perceived increased risk. The cumulative effect of these factors could be a slowdown in economic growth, potentially pushing the UK closer to or even into a recession, depending on the severity and duration of the political instability. ING’s analysis highlights that this isn’t just about party politics; it’s about the fundamental trust in the economic management of the nation. Safeguarding Financial Stability Amidst Political Shifts The concept of financial stability refers to the resilience of a financial system to absorb shocks and maintain its core functions, such as payment systems, credit provision, and capital allocation. A significant political shock, like a surprise Reeves resignation , could test this stability, though the UK’s financial institutions are generally robust. Key considerations for financial stability include: Bank of England’s Role: The Bank of England (BoE) plays a crucial role as the guardian of financial stability. In times of crisis, it can intervene to calm markets, provide liquidity, and reassure investors. However, even the BoE has limits to its influence when political uncertainty is profound. Bond Market Resilience: As mentioned, government bond markets are often the first point of stress. A sharp sell-off in gilts could impact pension funds and other institutional investors that hold large amounts of government debt. While the BoE could step in to buy bonds, as it did during the Truss crisis, such interventions are temporary and highlight underlying issues. Banking Sector Exposure: While direct exposure of banks to political resignations is limited, indirect exposure through weakened economic growth, increased corporate defaults, or a decline in asset values could pose risks. The UK banking sector is well-capitalized, but prolonged uncertainty could test its resilience. Investor Confidence and Capital Flight: A sustained loss of confidence could lead to capital flight, where investors move their money out of the UK. This would weaken the Pound further, make it harder for the government and businesses to borrow, and strain the financial system. ING’s concern isn’t necessarily about an imminent collapse of the financial system but rather about the increased stress and potential for a significant loss of confidence that would make it harder for the economy to function smoothly. Maintaining financial stability is paramount for long-term economic health, and political shocks can quickly erode it. Navigating GBP Volatility: What to Expect for the British Pound The British Pound (GBP) is notoriously sensitive to political developments, and a surprise Reeves resignation would almost certainly trigger a period of intense GBP volatility . For anyone involved in international trade, investment, or even planning a holiday abroad, understanding this potential impact is crucial. Here’s what to expect regarding the Pound: Immediate Depreciation: The most likely initial reaction would be a sharp drop in the Pound’s value against major currencies like the US Dollar (GBP/USD) and the Euro (GBP/EUR). This is because international investors would likely sell off their GBP holdings in favor of perceived safer assets or currencies, reacting to the sudden political uncertainty. Increased Trading Ranges: Beyond a simple drop, the Pound would likely experience wider trading ranges. This means bigger swings up and down as markets try to digest the news, assess the implications, and react to subsequent political statements or developments. Such volatility makes it challenging for businesses to plan and hedge their currency exposure. Impact on Inflation: A weaker Pound makes imports more expensive, which can feed into higher domestic inflation. For a country already grappling with cost-of-living pressures, this could exacerbate the situation, potentially putting pressure on the Bank of England to maintain or even raise interest rates further. Winners and Losers: A weaker Pound benefits UK exporters, as their goods become cheaper for international buyers. Conversely, it hurts importers and consumers, who face higher prices for imported goods and services. For tourists, a weaker Pound means their money buys less abroad. ING’s assessment implies that the market might struggle to find a new equilibrium for the Pound quickly. The absence of a clear economic leader for the opposition, especially one who has cultivated market trust, would leave a void that could take time to fill, prolonging the period of elevated GBP volatility . Challenges and Risks for the UK’s Economic Outlook The potential challenges stemming from a sudden Reeves resignation are multifaceted. The primary risk is a prolonged period of political and economic uncertainty. This isn’t just about a change of personnel; it’s about the potential for a shift in the perceived direction of the UK’s economic future. Other challenges include: Loss of Credibility: If the Labour Party struggles to quickly appoint a credible successor, its overall economic credibility could be damaged, irrespective of the actual policies proposed. Delayed Decision-Making: Political upheaval often leads to a paralysis in decision-making, as parties focus internally. This can delay critical economic reforms or responses to emerging challenges. Erosion of Trust: Both domestic and international investors might view the UK political system as less stable, leading to a long-term re-evaluation of investment strategies. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses Given ING’s dire warning, what can individuals, investors, and businesses do to prepare for potential political shocks and their market impact ? Diversify Portfolios: Reduce over-reliance on UK-specific assets. International diversification can help cushion the blow of domestic political events. Hedge Currency Exposure: Businesses with significant international trade or foreign currency earnings/expenditures should consider hedging strategies to mitigate the risks of GBP volatility . Stay Informed and Agile: Keep a close eye on political developments and economic indicators. Be prepared to adjust investment strategies or business plans quickly in response to evolving circumstances. Review Risk Assessments: Regularly update risk assessments for political instability and its potential impact on financial holdings and operational resilience. Historical Precedents: Learning from Past Shocks The UK has seen its share of political shocks leading to significant market impact . The most recent and striking example was the market reaction to the mini-budget under Liz Truss’s government in September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts proposed led to a dramatic sell-off in gilts, a sharp depreciation of the Pound, and an intervention by the Bank of England to restore financial stability . This demonstrated how quickly markets can react negatively to perceived fiscal irresponsibility or policy uncertainty. Similarly, the Brexit referendum in 2016 also triggered substantial GBP volatility and market uncertainty, though the nature of the shock was different. These events serve as stark reminders that political decisions and stability are deeply intertwined with economic outcomes and market confidence.

According to renowned market analyst X Finance Bull, Dimon emphasized that crypto is not merely a passing trend, it is rapidly becoming the core infrastructure underpinning global finance. Dimon’s acknowledgment marks a major shift in traditional finance, underscoring blockchain’s transformative potential to boost transparency, efficiency, and security in payments, cross-border transfers, and central banking. Dimon highlighted stablecoins, digital assets pegged to traditional currencies, as a key driver in the evolving financial ecosystem. By merging fiat stability with blockchain efficiency, they enable low-cost, seamless global transactions and could accelerate modern payment systems, especially in regions with limited or expensive banking access. Therefore, X Finance Bull sees Dimon’s remarks as a subtle green light for institutional crypto adoption. With JPMorgan recognizing crypto’s permanence, other major banks, hedge funds, and institutional investors are likely to follow, boosting liquidity, innovation, and regulatory engagement across the digital asset ecosystem. What does this mean? Well, Dimon highlights a pivotal shift that decentralized finance is merging with traditional banking. As blockchain solutions mature, they complement rather than compete with conventional finance, paving the way for a hybrid system that boosts efficiency and broadens global access to financial services. As a result, Dimon’s remarks highlight a turning point that crypto, blockchain, and stablecoins are no longer experiments, they are emerging as core pillars of the global financial system. XRP Eyes Key Technical Setup at $2.20 Support According to market analyst CryptoBull, XRP may be on the verge of forming a double bottom pattern around the $2.20 support level, signaling a potential bullish reversal in the near term. The double bottom is a classic technical indicator often associated with trend reversals, suggesting that XRP could be positioning itself for a significant upward move if the support level holds. CryptoBull notes XRP was rejected at the 55-day EMA, confirming a short-term pullback and reinforcing $2.20 as key support. This EMA rejection signals potential accumulation, offering a favorable risk-to-reward setup for buyers. On the other hand, technical indicators suggest XRP’s recent drop may be nearing its end. A potential double bottom, two lows at similar levels separated by a modest peak, could signal a bullish reversal if XRP breaks above the interim high, potentially paving the way toward higher resistance levels. XRP trades at $2.49 with $2.20 being the critical support as a 55 EMA rejection and potential double bottom signaling a key turning point for the token. Conclusion Jamie Dimon signals a financial turning point: cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and stablecoins are becoming core infrastructure. As institutional adoption grows, those who embrace these innovations will lead in the evolving global financial landscape. On the other hand, XRP is at a key juncture because a potential double bottom at $2.20, confirmed by the 55 EMA rejection, signals a possible bullish reversal, with upcoming moves likely to sway market sentiment.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-31 09:35:43

Here’s the Latest Big Update,https://cryptopotato.com/spot-xrp-etf-to-launch-on-november-13-heres-the-latest-big-update/,"Popular asset manager Canary Capital has updated its spot XRP ETF S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and removed the “delayment amendment,” which could guarantee an imminent launch of the fund in 20 days. It’s worth noting that Canary updated its SOL ETF application similarly weeks ago, and the product went live for trading earlier this week. SCOOP: @CanaryFunds has filed an updated S-1 for its $XRP spot ETF, removing the “delaying amendment” that stops a registration from going auto-effective and gives the @SECGov control over timing.

The delaying amendment essentially says to the regulator that the issuer is postponing the activation of the ETF until it explicitly confirms to the SEC that it’s ready to go live. Removing it from the filing means that Canary is prepared with all necessary structural points and expects no further objections from the watchdog. Consequently, the updated application has a 20-day period and a launch date of November 13, after which the ETF can legally start trading unless the SEC stops it from doing so or the Nasdaq fails to approve the 8-A filing. As Eleanor Terrett explained, SEC Chair Paul Atkins is reportedly supporting such filings, as companies are trying to take advantage of the auto-effective method, which could be even more beneficial during the current government shutdown. As mentioned above, Canary, as well as Bitwise, already used this approach with their SOL, HBAR, and LTC ETF filings. Bitwise’s CIO, Matt Hougan, recently claimed that the XRP Army will “smash-buy the ETF” if the financial vehicle sees the light of day. He also predicted that spot XRP ETFs will “easily” become a billion-dollar fund within the first few months of launching. The statement was echoed by Nate Geraci, the President of Nova Dius Wealth. Major XRP Sell Walls XRP had a good week in terms of price action, at least until the correction after the Fed cut the interest rates. It’s still one of the few larger-cap cryptocurrencies in the green weekly, and sits close to $2.50. Analyst CW claimed that the asset has two major selling walls on its way north. If it can manage to pass through them, it will open the door for the coveted $3 price tag. In the short term, $XRP has two selling walls. If it breaks through these, there are no specific selling walls until $3. pic.twitter.com/d11MVEkySd — CW (@CW8900) October 31, 2025 The post Spot XRP ETF to Launch on November 13?

Global economic shifts, central bank decisions, and geopolitical events profoundly influence not only fiat currencies but also the broader investment landscape, including digital assets. Recent pronouncements from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have sent ripples across the Forex market , with the US Dollar retaining its gains and the Euro experiencing a notable uplift. This article delves into the factors driving these currency dynamics, offering insights into what these shifts mean for global finance. Why is the US Dollar Showing Such Resilience? The US Dollar has demonstrated remarkable strength, a testament to its status as a global reserve currency and a safe-haven asset. This resilience is often linked to several fundamental factors: Economic Performance: A robust US economy, characterized by strong employment figures and consumer spending, tends to bolster confidence in the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: Higher interest rates or the expectation of future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve can attract foreign capital, increasing demand for the dollar. Global Uncertainty: In times of geopolitical tension or economic instability elsewhere, investors often flock to the dollar, viewing it as a secure store of value. The dollar’s ability to maintain its value, even against other major currencies, highlights the ongoing perception of the US economy’s underlying stability and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy effectiveness. This sustained strength has significant implications for international trade, commodity prices, and the valuation of global assets. Decoding the Impact of Jerome Powell’s Speech The recent address by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was a pivotal moment for the Forex market . His remarks are meticulously scrutinized for any hints regarding the future trajectory of US monetary policy. Key takeaways from Powell’s speech often revolve around: Inflation Outlook: Powell’s assessment of inflation trends provides crucial signals. If the Fed believes inflation is persistent, it might signal a tighter monetary policy. Interest Rate Path: Any indication of the Fed’s willingness to raise, hold, or cut interest rates directly impacts the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Higher rates generally strengthen the dollar. Economic Growth Projections: The Fed’s outlook on economic growth can influence investor sentiment. A positive outlook suggests a stronger economy, which typically supports the dollar. Following Powell’s speech, the market often interprets his words as either hawkish (favoring higher rates) or dovish (favoring lower rates). A hawkish stance typically reinforces dollar strength, as seen in the dollar’s recent gains. This immediate market reaction underscores the profound influence of central bank communication on currency valuations. How Did the ECB Policy Elevate the Euro? Across the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) also delivered policy announcements that significantly impacted the Euro exchange rate . The ECB’s decisions are critical for the Eurozone economy and, by extension, the global currency landscape. Factors contributing to the Euro’s recent uplift post-ECB include: Interest Rate Adjustments: Similar to the Fed, the ECB’s decisions on interest rates are paramount. A decision to raise rates or signal future hikes makes the Euro more appealing to investors seeking higher returns. Inflation Strategy: The ECB’s approach to combating inflation within the Eurozone influences market expectations. A firm stance on bringing inflation down can boost confidence in the Euro. Economic Outlook for the Eurozone: Positive projections for the Eurozone economy, including growth and employment, can strengthen the Euro. The market’s reaction to the ECB’s statements, often conveyed by ECB President Christine Lagarde , can lead to immediate appreciation or depreciation of the Euro. A clear and resolute policy direction from the ECB, particularly one that signals a commitment to price stability, often provides a tailwind for the currency. Navigating the Dynamic Euro Exchange Rate Landscape The interplay between the US Dollar and the Euro, primarily expressed through the EUR/USD pair, is a cornerstone of the Forex market . The recent developments from both central banks have created a fascinating dynamic: While the US Dollar maintained its gains, the Euro’s post-ECB rally indicates a rebalancing of market expectations. This doesn’t necessarily mean a weakening dollar, but rather a strengthening Euro relative to other currencies, and potentially a more competitive stance against the dollar. Key Factors Influencing EUR/USD: Monetary Policy Divergence: Differences in interest rate paths between the Fed and the ECB are a primary driver. Economic Data: Employment figures, GDP growth, and inflation reports from both the US and Eurozone continually shape the pair’s movement. Risk Sentiment: Global risk appetite can push investors towards or away from the dollar (a safe haven) and the Euro (a riskier asset in some scenarios). Understanding these drivers is essential for anyone tracking global financial health. The resilience of the dollar alongside a rising Euro suggests a nuanced market interpretation of central bank actions and economic realities. What’s Next for the Global Forex Market ? The immediate future of the Forex market will continue to be shaped by central bank rhetoric, economic data releases, and geopolitical developments. Investors and traders should remain vigilant for: Further Central Bank Meetings: Upcoming meetings of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will offer more clarity on their monetary policy stances. Inflation Data: Key inflation reports from both the US and Eurozone will be critical in guiding future interest rate expectations. Economic Indicators: Employment reports, GDP figures, and manufacturing data will provide insights into the health of these major economies. Geopolitical Events: Any significant geopolitical developments can quickly alter market sentiment and trigger shifts in currency flows. Actionable Insight: For those involved in global finance or cryptocurrency, monitoring these macro trends is vital. A strong US Dollar can make imports cheaper for the US but exports more expensive, affecting global trade balances. A stronger Euro can have similar effects within the Eurozone. These shifts indirectly influence investment decisions, including those in the crypto space, as investors might reallocate capital based on perceived stability and returns in different asset classes. Conclusion The recent movements in the Forex market , with the US Dollar retaining its strength following Jerome Powell’s speech and the Euro gaining ground post- ECB policy announcements, underscore the profound influence of central bank decisions on global currency valuations. These events highlight the ongoing interplay between inflation concerns, interest rate expectations, and economic outlooks. While the dollar’s resilience speaks to the enduring confidence in the US economy, the Euro’s uplift signals a renewed optimism for the Eurozone. As global economic conditions continue to evolve, staying informed about these fundamental currency dynamics remains paramount for navigating the complex world of finance.

At its peak, ZEC almost flipped Litecoin (LTC) , while expecting to move to even higher valuations and return to four-digit prices. ZEC traded at $382.51, adding another 10% to its price in the past 24 hours. The expansion happened just as BTC dipped to local lows under $107,000, while ZEC only dipped to $300. Immediately after that, ZEC resumed its climb. Open interest for ZEC also recovered fast, going back to over $434M. However, short positions now make up more than 62% of total open interest. ZEC has shown a trend for temporary dips, allowing some short traders to lock in gains. For now, the short and long liquidations for ZEC are roughly equal, at around $3.2M in the past 24 hours.

This first-of-a-kind system promises native protection against MEV (Maximal Extractable Value). With Encrypted Mempools, users can hide crucial transaction details until final execution, solving the current challenges that plague decentralized platforms, specifically censorship, order-flow exploitation, and frontrunning. Aptos Labs @AptosLabs · Follow Built-in MEV protection is coming to @Aptos .Today, every network broadcasts your next move: what you’re buying, how much, and when. That visibility powers frontrunning, censorship, and a multibillion-dollar MEV shadow market.Encrypted Mempools would change the game 🧵 4:00 am · 31 Oct 2025 57 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies Commenting on the strategic proposal, the Aptos team said : If approved by governance, Aptos will be the first L1 to offer users the option to send transactions via a native Encrypted Mempool. The new feature will deliver full transaction intent confidentiality without impacting speed/performance or transparency on-chain. Users can submit encrypted transactions with one click, fully protected from frontrunning and orderflow leakage. The move reflects Aptos’ intent to make on-chain trading safer and fairer for all by filling the visibility gap through encryption at the Mempool level. How does the new system work? The advanced Mempool enables individuals to submit ciphertexts, which are encrypted representations of their transactions, directly to validators. Notably, these payloads hide all transaction data. The details become publicly visible and recorded after final execution. The team clarified that the encryption and decryption procedures will happen on validators. That means the Aptos blockchain’s speed and high throughput will remain unaffected during the process. Precisely, the platform looks to introduce a new layer of protection and privacy while prioritising its reputation for faster transaction settlements. The approach addresses three crucial pain points facing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Firstly, it prevents frontrunning, meaning validators and bots will no longer exploit pending orders. Also, the new encryption stops third parties from selling user data. Finally, it prevents information leakage, ensuring trading amounts and strategies are confidential. Validators only see transactions after block confirmation, with all details recorded on-chain as usual. Impact for traders, institutions, and DEXs Aptos’ Encrypted Mempool guarantees traders complete privacy. Imagine a system where no one, including validators, can detect what you plan to transfer, buy, or sell, until you complete your transaction. That eliminates the risks of other participants or automated bots frontrunning your plans. Moreover, institutional investors seeking to conceal their strategies while using a public blockchain can find Aptos’ proposed feature lucrative. These players can move massive positions privately. Lastly, orderflow protection will help decentralised exchanges operate more securely, offer fairer pricing, and limit slippage caused by MEV attacks. These perks will likely improve institutional participation, which is vital for mainstream adoption. The team added: Encrypted Mempool secures intent at the protocol layer and makes it safe for large values to move freely without fear of censorship or frontrunning; This confidentiality is the precondition for true internet scale. APT price action Native token APT maintained a downbeat outlook today, mirroring the deteriorated broader market. The alt is trading at $3.22 after shedding over 6% and 30% of its value over the previous day and month. Chart by CoinMarketCap The 18% decline in 24-hour trading volume confirms bearish tendencies, hinting at further declines for Aptos. Meanwhile, the team’s dedication to building could reflect in APT’s price performance during broad-based rallies. The digital token remains poised for remarkable growth towards its all-time high of above $18.

These Levels Could Act as Magnets for BTC and ETH!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-expect-16-billion-options-quake-today-these-levels-could-act-as-magnets-for-btc-and-eth/,"Following the great crash on October 11, the fluctuations in Bitcoin and altcoins continue. Although the FED cut interest rates during the week, FED Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish statements triggered the decline. While BTC fell to the $106,000 level, altcoins also experienced significant declines. While the cryptocurrency market experienced a recovery on the last day of the week, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market came, as it does every Friday. These options are more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to weekly data, approximately $15.9 billion worth of crypto options will expire on October 31 on Deribit derivatives exchange. According to Deribit data, $13.4 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $2.5 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options are set to expire. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.7, the maximum loss point is $114,000 and the notional value is $13.4 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.7, a maximum loss point of $4,100, and a notional value of $2.5 billion. What Does Max Pain Mean for Bitcoin and Ethereum? While the put/call ratio is 0.7 for both Bitcoin and Etheruem, these ratios indicate a cautious yet optimistic outlook in the market and a slight bullish sentiment among investors. Max pain can often act as a magnet during expiration in options markets. In the options market, maximum pain is the price level at which investors incur the greatest losses and options sellers feel most comfortable. In other words, it acts as a magnet for the market as contracts expire. At this point, the maximum pain level for Bitcoin was $114,000, while the maximum pain level for Ethereum was $4,100. As a result, Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently below their maximum pain levels of $109,500 and $3,830, respectively. Analysts believe this suggests investors are anticipating limited upward movement in the short term. However, it doesn't necessarily mean a definitive rise or fall. *This is not investment advice.

A significant amount of stolen funds has resurfaced, highlighting the persistent challenges in DeFi security. This latest development serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between hackers and blockchain security experts. What’s the Latest Development in the Radiant Capital Exploit Saga? In a recent and troubling turn of events, the perpetrator behind the Radiant Capital exploit has reportedly moved a substantial sum. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, approximately 5,411 ETH, valued at an astonishing $20.7 million, was transferred to the controversial crypto mixing protocol, Tornado Cash. This move signals a clear attempt to obscure the trail of the illicitly obtained assets. The transfer of such a large amount of Ethereum to a mixer like Tornado Cash is a common tactic. It allows hackers to break the direct link between the stolen funds and their original source, making them significantly harder to trace. Consequently, this complicates recovery efforts for the affected protocol and law enforcement agencies. Understanding Tornado Cash: Why Do Hackers Use Crypto Mixers? Tornado Cash is a decentralized protocol designed to improve transaction privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. It achieves this by obscuring the link between the sender and receiver of crypto assets. Users deposit funds into a pool, and then withdraw different funds from the same pool, effectively breaking the on-chain connection. While intended for legitimate privacy-conscious users, its fungibility-enhancing features have unfortunately made it a preferred tool for cybercriminals. Radiant Capital exploit funds, and many others from various hacks, often find their way here. This raises significant ethical and regulatory questions about the use and existence of such protocols in the broader crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Anonymity: Mixers sever the direct link between sender and receiver. Difficult Tracing: Funds become harder for blockchain analytics firms to follow. Regulatory Scrutiny: Services like Tornado Cash face pressure from global regulators due to their use in illicit activities. Recalling the Original Radiant Capital Exploit: A $53 Million Loss It’s crucial to remember the context of this recent transfer. The original Radiant Capital exploit occurred in October of last year, resulting in a staggering loss of $53 million. The DeFi protocol, which facilitates cross-chain lending and borrowing, fell victim to a flash loan attack that exploited a vulnerability in its architecture. The attack vector involved a specific bug that allowed the hacker to manipulate the asset pricing mechanism within a newly activated lending market. This enabled them to drain significant liquidity from the protocol. Such incidents underscore the inherent risks associated with complex DeFi smart contracts, especially during new deployments or upgrades. What Does This Mean for DeFi Security and User Trust? The continued movement of funds from the Radiant Capital exploit sends a clear message about the ongoing threats in decentralized finance. It highlights the need for continuous vigilance and robust security measures. For users, it reinforces the importance of due diligence when interacting with DeFi protocols. The implications are far-reaching: Continuous Monitoring: Blockchain security firms like PeckShield play a vital role in tracking stolen funds. Improved Audits: Protocols must prioritize rigorous, independent security audits, especially before deploying new features or markets. Community Awareness: Users need to be educated about the risks and how to identify potential vulnerabilities or suspicious activities. Regulatory Challenges: The use of mixers complicates law enforcement efforts and fuels debates around crypto regulation. Ultimately, such events erode user trust and can hinder the mainstream adoption of DeFi. The industry must work collaboratively to enhance security standards and protect user assets. The latest transfer of Radiant Capital exploit funds to Tornado Cash is a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges within the DeFi space. While blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency, tools like crypto mixers present significant hurdles for tracing illicit funds. The ongoing battle against hackers demands continuous innovation in security, proactive monitoring, and a commitment to protecting the integrity of decentralized finance. Vigilance remains paramount for all participants in this evolving ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions Q1: What is the Radiant Capital exploit? A1: The Radiant Capital exploit was a security incident in October 2023 where a hacker exploited a vulnerability in the DeFi protocol, leading to a loss of approximately $53 million in cryptocurrency. Q2: How much ETH was recently moved to Tornado Cash? A2: Approximately 5,411 ETH, valued at around $20.7 million, was recently transferred by the hacker to Tornado Cash. Q3: Why do hackers use Tornado Cash? A3: Hackers use Tornado Cash, a crypto mixing protocol, to obscure the origin and destination of stolen funds, making them significantly harder to trace and recover. Q4: What are the implications of this incident for DeFi security? A4: This incident underscores the critical need for continuous security audits, robust smart contract development, and vigilant monitoring within the DeFi sector to protect user assets and maintain trust. Q5: Can the stolen funds from the Radiant Capital exploit be recovered? A5: While blockchain security firms continue to monitor the funds, recovery becomes significantly more challenging once assets are moved through mixers like Tornado Cash, though not entirely impossible.

Ripple CTO Says The Answer Isn’t In The Ledger,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/how-to-price-xrp-ripple-cto/,"What gives XRP its value? In an exchange on X, Ripple CTO David Schwartz – known as “JoelKatz” – tried to answer that question without pretending crypto already behaves like traditional assets. He didn’t lean on marketing language about instant settlement or global payments. He talked about power, control, censorship, incentive design, and speculation. How Does XRP Get Its Value? First, Schwartz reframed what XRP is actually for. He argued that the XRP Ledger is built for people and institutions that don’t want an intermediary sitting in the middle of their transactions. He put it in blunt terms: “Do you want to use a blockchain where people can be their own bank and no middlemen tax their transactions or do you want to be someone else’s bank and tax their transactions? If you want the latter, there are dozens of blockchains for you. If you want the former, there’s XRP.” In that framing, XRP is not just another token. It’s the only counterparty-free asset native to XRPL. Everything else on the ledger is an IOU from someone – a promise by an issuer, bank, fintech, money transmitter, or gateway. XRP is the exception. It exists on-ledger, without an issuer, and can move between any accounts without anyone else’s permission, freeze authority, or seizure authority. Related Reading: High Liquidity At This Level Could Send The XRP Price Surging Soon Schwartz made that explicit: “XRP is the only asset without a counterparty that can be accessed by every account in every jurisdiction with no risk of default, freeze, or clawback.” That point is central to how Ripple has always positioned XRP: the ledger is multi-currency, but only one asset on it is universally clean. What Schwartz is arguing is that this special status is not cosmetic. It is economic. He said: “I do think XRP’s special place on XRPL ensures that XRP will capture some of the value XRPL transactions generate.” To understand that claim, you have to understand how most blockchains try to “capture value.” The dominant 2020–2025 playbook in crypto is explicit extraction. Protocols design fee switches, burn mechanisms, staking capture, MEV capture, sequencer rent, or other tolls, and then say to the market: holding this token entitles you to a share of that toll. Schwartz is openly saying XRPL is not built like that. The XRP Ledger was not designed to tax users at the protocol layer. In his view, that’s a feature, not a bug. He described XRPL as a public good, not a rent machine. He explained it by analogy: “When you ask what eBay is good for, you normally don’t think about it being a good way to enrich the people who invest in eBay. You think of it as a way of bringing buyers and sellers together with the buyers and sellers wanting the costs to be as low as possible. The buyers and sellers shouldn’t want eBay’s investors taxing their transactions as much as they can get away with because that is mostly money the buyers have to pay but sellers don’t get.” Then he applied that logic directly to XRPL: “I think of XRPL as a public good that doesn’t tax people who want to use its capabilities. I am not arguing that it is the best design or even that it’s better than most other designs. But it is different. XRP really is about being your own bank and having no middlemen passively taxing your transactions.” XRP Price Is Driven By Speculation This is where the philosophical tension becomes an economic tension. If XRPL is designed not to skim value from users, then how does XRP appreciate? Why should holding XRP benefit from the ledger’s success? Schwartz’s answer is that XRP’s role as the only universal, non-freezable settlement asset on XRPL is itself enough to force some level of demand if XRPL becomes important infrastructure. In other words, the ledger doesn’t have to tax flow in order for XRP to matter. XRP matters if the ledger matters. But Schwartz did not pretend that this mechanism is currently driving price on its own. In fact, he went in the opposite direction and said something most executives in crypto either won’t admit or can’t afford to say in public. He said the market is still pricing the future, not the present: “The funny thing is that I think that most of the value of most cryptocurrencies comes from expected future speculation. So if what you care about future price changes, what people think will happen is much more important than what has happened.” Related Reading: XRP Chart Mirrors Gold Right Before Its Parabolic Run Then he pointed at bitcoin to make the point unavoidable: “Look at bitcoin. Most of the current investment thesis is something like, ‘Imagine if most companies start storing 1% of their treasury in bitcoin, what will that do to the price?’. What that’s saying is that in the future, more people will speculate on future price appreciation than speculate currently.” And he went even further: “It’s not even based on expected future utility, it’s based on expected future speculation! I want to believe utility matters, I really do.” That last line is probably the most revealing thing Schwartz said. He is not saying “XRP price today is purely a function of measurable payment volume today.” He’s saying that’s not how crypto is priced, period. Crypto, in his view, is reflexive: people buy because they believe other people will one day buy for the same reason, at higher size and higher urgency. That leads to the next objection: if value is driven by expectation of an “explosion scenario,” shouldn’t tokens be basically worthless until that scenario actually hits scale? Schwartz rejected that. He argued that markets continuously reprice probability, not outcomes: “There may come a day when we look at today’s cryptocurrency values as, in comparison, nothing. But the idea that values will be very low and then suddenly rise is just not how speculation works. As the probability of explosion or size of expected explosion grows, value follows.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.48.

Coinbase Refutes Banks’ ‘Inconsistent’ Claims As the stablecoin sector’s momentum grows, Coinbase CPO Faryar Shirzad has challenged the US banking industry’s concerns over potential risks associated with the emerging digital assets. In an X post, Shirzad affirmed that the ongoing narrative that stablecoins will destroy bank lending “ignores reality” and misreads the moment, as “faster, cheaper, programmable transactions aren’t a threat—they’re overdue progress.” A market note from the Coinbase Institute, cited by the CPO, stated that these arguments “echo familiar worries from earlier innovations like money market funds. Yet they fail to account for how and where stablecoins are actually used, and what they contribute to financial modernization.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the banking sector has criticized the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act for potential loopholes that could pose risks to the financial system. The landmark crypto framework, which was signed into law in July, prohibits interest payments on the holding or use of payment-purpose stablecoins. However, the prohibition only tackles issuers and could be “easily circumvented” by exchanges or affiliates providing rewards. In August, multiple banking associations across the US sent a joint letter to the Senate Banking Committee urging Congress to amend the law. The letter argued that interest payments distort market dynamics and could affect credit creation, and suggested extending the prohibition on interest payments to include digital asset exchanges, brokers, dealers, and related entities. Since then, multiple industry players, including Shirzad, have rejected these concerns, stating that the banking sector’s proposals could threaten to create an uncompetitive environment for stablecoins. Stablecoins Won’t Drain US Banks Coinbase Institute outlined multiple reasons why stablecoins won’t drain deposits from US banks and instead will strengthen the global role of the US dollar, introduce long-overdue competition in the payments sector, and support new, more efficient channels for credit formation. The market note argued that stablecoin demand is global, with most current use coming from abroad and on-chain markets. They cited a recent Atlantic Council report showing that over 80 percent of transaction volume comes from international users seeking dollar exposure. Meanwhile, around two-thirds of stablecoin transfers occur within decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms or blockchain-based payment rails. Coinbase added that USD-pegged digital assets expand dollar access worldwide and reinforce its dominance. In that sense, they are the transactional plumbing of a new financial layer that runs parallel to, but largely outside, the domestic banking system. (…) Therefore, forecasts proposing that several trillion dollars could flow into stablecoins over the next decade should be carefully scrutinized. Additionally, Coinbase highlighted that banks have excess liquidity and have put out trillions of dollars of deposits in reserves and treasuries, suggesting that the sector has enough credit slack to compete with stablecoins for a more efficient financial system. Therefore, it would be “inconsistent to claim that stablecoin growth poses a systemic threat.” The market note also emphasized that community banks are largely unaffected by the sector’s growth, arguing that stablecoin users and community bank customers rarely overlap. Lastly, Coinbase asserted that “Credit is evolving, not shrinking. Lending is shifting to private credit, fintech, and DeFi channels that don’t depend on deposits. Liquidity moves—it doesn’t vanish,” concluding that “treating this development as a threat risks misunderstanding the transformative direction of financial innovation and constraining an emerging advantage for the United States.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|coinbase|Coinbase CPO|Coinbase institute|Crypto Market|Faryar Shirzad|GENIUS Act|Stablecoin Interest payment|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoins|US Banks|Us Banks stablecoins,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-31 10:00:42

Senate Nears Crypto Bill Release as Investors Flock to Best Presales Like Bitcoin Hyper October 31, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The US Senate Agriculture Committee is finalizing an updated bipartisan draft of the Crypto Market Structure Bill that is expected to roll out in the coming days. According to the bill, CFTC will oversee digital commodities and spot markets while SEC will retain its authority over securities. The bill also proposes a new classification system where digital assets will be segregated as digital commodities, investment contract assets, and permitted payment stablecoins. The latest draft of the bill removes staking, DePIN, and airdrops from being classified as securities. This update comes after bipartisan negotiations and industry roundtables between executives from Coinbase and Ripple. Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong cited that both parties are ‘90% aligned’ on the bill’s framework. With the new bill bringing greater clarity to digital assets, investors are growing optimistic about the future of crypto. Traders are eyeing the best presales of the year to position themselves ahead of the next wave of adoption.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-were-so-ready-to-fire-on-all-cylinders-heres-why/,"A powerful technical signal has appeared in the cryptocurrency market, suggesting the potential beginning of a new phase for altcoins against Bitcoin. The chart analysis , shared by crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader and reposted by Chad Steingraber, a well-known XRP enthusiast, points to what has been described as “the rarest altcoin signal” seen in years. The chart shows a Monthly MACD bullish cross for the Others/BTC pair, a development that has historically coincided with the start of major altcoin rallies. Merlijn noted that only three such MACD crosses have occurred in the past eight years. Each one, according to his analysis, marked the early stages of an altcoin “supercycle.” The chart highlights these points in 2017, 2020, and now. The next cross is expected to define the market’s direction for the rest of 2025. The previous signals preceded periods of strong performance across altcoins , suggesting that market conditions may once again favor assets like XRP. We’re so ready to fire on all cylinders… https://t.co/NVr5gA4imI pic.twitter.com/MblFTobJTp — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 27, 2025 Historical Context and Market Cycles The captioned chart tracks altcoin performance against Bitcoin through previous cycles in 2018 and 2021. Both cycles peaked at similar trend levels, shown by a long-term resistance line connecting the highs of those years. The current setup shows altcoins trading near historical support levels, where prior reversals have occurred. Below the price chart, the MACD indicator represents the signal line crossing above the slower-moving average, forming the bullish cross. This indicator, often used to identify potential trend reversals , suggests that momentum may now be shifting back in favor of altcoins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the past, each time this cross appeared, it coincided with the start of a strong upward movement lasting several months. Steingraber reacted to the analysis by stating that the market is “ready to fire on all cylinders,” signaling his confidence that the setup could lead to renewed momentum for XRP and other altcoins. Expectations for 2025 The chart’s projection points to 2025 as the next potential peak for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, following a pattern consistent with the last two cycles. If this cycle continues as indicated, altcoins could move from current consolidation levels into an expansion phase over the next several weeks. While Steingraber did not issue specific price targets, his post says XRP, along with other major altcoins, could benefit from the same momentum that historically followed similar signals.

With a U.S. stock market that just keeps going up, why would anyone hang around in Bitcoin? It’s precisely at these times, when Bitcoin is most unloved that huge rallies can begin to form. With Bitcoin it’s always just a matter of patience. $106,000 horizontal support holds once again Source: TradingView Bitcoin surprised on the extent of the downside in this latest pullback. The $BTC price was eventually held up by the $106,000 horizontal support level again, and a bounce has materialised. No major structures were broken, so at least until further notice, the bull market is still intact. Since making the bounce, $BTC has broken through the $108,000 level and has flipped this back into support. Also, the price has pierced through the trendline (faint dotted line) for this reversal and so it might be expected that it climbs back to challenge the major trendline above (bold black line), and the all-important $116,000 horizontal resistance level. A much longer support trendline Source: TradingView Moving right out into the weekly time frame perhaps another trendline comes into play. The main trendline so far has been the 7-month trendline shown as a faint dotted line. However, below this is a much longer trendline (bold black line) that stretches back to August 2024. The issue with this trendline is the big dips in April this year that sent candle bodies through it, so it breaks the neatness of the trendline. That said, there are five other weekly touch points that vouch for the validity of the trendline. Also, if one switches to a logarithmic view, the candle bodies are perfectly inside the trendline. This trendline is more reliable for the Bitcoin price than the shorter one above, which has generally seen the price collapse below it during these last three weeks. The longer trendline can be seen to shepherd the $BTC price up to an apex formed on the other side by the 8-year ascending trendline. One of these two trendlines will have to give, and this is likely to signal a bear market, or a continuation of the bull market. An ascending wedge pattern Source: TradingView Going even further out into the 2-week time frame, the aforementioned trendline takes on perfect validity. The concern is that the pattern that is being formed by the two ascending trendlines is an ascending wedge. The majority of these patterns would tend to break to the downside, so for the Bitcoin bulls to force a continuation of this bull market will require a major effort. The main horizontal resistance level on this time frame is raised slightly to $117,000. It can be observed that several candle bodies and wicks have stopped at that level, and that three candle wicks so far have continued on up to retest the 8-year ascending trendline. One big indicator that still remains with the bulls is the Stochastic RSI. The weekly chart showed that the indicators are very near the bottom, while this 2-week chart reveals that they are on their way down. There is the chance that enough upside momentum will be generated that could take the $BTC price through the top of the wedge pattern and into a last blow-off top. Watch out for this scenario, while keeping a close eye on any hints of a rejection. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite the dip, charts suggest both tokens are merely consolidating, with their long-term bullishness still firmly intact. For investors seeking early opportunities, the best crypto presales like $BEST, $PEPENODE, and $RTX could offer explosive growth. The sell-off triggered by the latest Federal Reserve rate cut – primarily due to Powell remarking that a December rate cut is far from likely – has now well and truly seeped into hype-driven tokens, which are often the biggest losers whenever such a sell-off happens. The most notable ones are Pump.fun ($PUMP) and Virtuals Protocol ($VIRTUAL) . Pump.fun, for instance, has lost nearly 20% in the last 48 hours alone, whereas Virtuals Protocol is down 15% since its latest swing high of around $1.68. It’s worth noting that these are not isolated instances. Even the biggest meme coins in the industry, like $PENGU , $SPX , and $APE , have each lost between 10-15% in just the last week, hinting at a broader, industry-wide downturn. But before you spiral downward and sell all of your crypto holdings, it’s worth taking a good, long look at the charts, which suggest that the current downturn is most likely just a pause before the longer-term bullish momentum resumes. $PUMP, for instance, is currently retesting the $0.0044 level, which it broke out from after overcoming resistance around the same zone with a 55% rally just a couple of weeks ago. $VIRTUAL, on the other hand, looks even more positive. Last week, it broke out of a major, long-drawn downward sloping resistance line – one that had held the token down since May 2025 – and all it appears to be doing is giving a healthy pullback. All in all, the bottom line is that while the altcoin market is currently consolidating, the long-term bullish picture remains intact, especially with the USA and China now ever so close to a trade deal , effectively eliminating any major macroeconomic instability news, at least in the near future. So, how do you go about building a crypto portfolio in such a market? The obvious answer is the best crypto presales . These are low-cap tokens, meaning they’re still under the radar and carry a lot of explosive potential. Plus, they’re currently in ‘pre’-sale, meaning they’re not yet listed on exchanges, which gives them the unique ability to ward off noise from current market conditions while also positioning you ahead of the next big wave. Here are our top three suggestions. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Viral Presale Token Powering the Best Wallet Ecosystem Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has the potential to revolutionize how people buy into crypto presales. Right now, Best Wallet is the only crypto wallet that lets you purchase new projects directly within the app. Other wallets, by contrast, require you to visit external presale websites, connect your wallet there, and then return to authorize the transaction. Best Wallet’s ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section lists all these early-stage moonshot opportunities in one place, saving you the trouble of digging around to find the best investment options. Even better, the internal Best Wallet team vets every single new meme coin before making it available for purchase, adding a crucial extra layer of security that can save you from rug pulls and phishing websites. Speaking of security, Best Wallet uses state-of-the-art encryption technology and robust two-factor authentication, including biometric login. It’s also a completely non-custodial crypto wallet , meaning only you have access to your private keys. On top of that, you have the option to set up multiple Ethereum wallets, giving you the freedom to organize your crypto endeavors however you like – perhaps one wallet for HODLing, one for staking, and another for active trading. According to Best Wallet’s roadmap, it aims to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2027. That’s why buying $BEST , which has already pulled in over $16.75M in its ongoing presale, could be a smart move. Also, based on our $BEST price prediction , it could soar 170% by the end of 2030, reaching a potential high of $0.07. Ride Best Wallet’s growth – buy $BEST today for just $0.025875. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Making Crypto Mining More Accessible & Fun Right now, crypto mining is not only largely inaccessible to the general public due to its high costs and technical know-how, but it’s also extremely boring because of its tedious and repetitive nature. That needs to change, and PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is bringing that change by offering a never-before-seen gamified virtual crypto mining ecosystem that removes the barriers currently surrounding crypto mining while also offering lucrative rewards in return. When you become a $PEPENODE holder, you get access to an empty virtual server room. The next step is to go shopping and grab some meme nodes, and this is where things get exciting. Every node is unique in terms of its characteristics, mining quality, and compatibility with other nodes, meaning you’ll need to experiment and fine-tune to build the perfect mining setup for yourself. Furthermore, PEPENODE ranks its miners on a leaderboard, which ultimately determines the rewards they receive. These rewards include free $PEPENODE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN tokens, all of which are strong and explosive meme coins in their own right. Here’s our step-by-step guide on how to buy PEPENODE for just $0.0011272 and stake it for a chunky 642% APY. All you have to do is make sure your mining setup outperforms the rest, and then wait for the completion of PEPENODE’s TGE (Token Generation Event) – that’s when the rewards go live and are distributed. A $100 investment into PEPENODE today could turn into $700 by the end of 2026 – according to our PEPENODE price prediction . Join the biggest crypto mining revolution yet – grab your $PEPENODE tokens today! 3. Remittix ($RTX) – Unique PayFi Solution Bridging Crypto and Fiat There’s a reason Remittix ($RTX) has been able to attract over $27.76M from investors in its ongoing presale. After all, its mission is to transform the cross-border payments market by creating the perfect synergy between cryptocurrency and fiat. Remittix allows you to send crypto directly to fiat-based bank accounts around the world. The receiving party gets the funds in fiat currency, completely unaware that the transaction originated as crypto. By doing so, Remittix hits two targets with one arrow. It lets the receiver, who might be in a crypto-unfriendly region, safely receive fiat currency, while allowing the sender to comfortably pay using cryptocurrency. On top of that, Remittix charges zero forex fees and offers same-day transaction processing, solving two of the biggest issues that plague the current banking system. Buy $RTX today for just $0.1166 – and be part of a game-changing new cryptocurrency project . Recap : With hype-driven tokens proving remarkably resilient amid a broader market downturn, the future for emerging low-cap presale gems like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and Remittix ($RTX) look overarchingly bright.

This directive compels stablecoin issuer Circle to freeze millions in USDC directly linked to the notorious Multichain hack. This unprecedented legal action marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle against crypto theft, offering a glimmer of hope for victims and setting a new precedent for asset recovery in the digital realm. The Unprecedented Order: Why Circle Freezes USDC According to reports from The Block, the court’s directive specifically targets three distinct wallets believed to contain the stolen funds. This move means that Circle, the issuer of the popular USD Coin (USDC), must actively prevent any transactions involving these particular digital assets. It’s a direct intervention that highlights the growing willingness of traditional legal systems to engage with and regulate the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Initially, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had secured its own warrant for Circle to freeze these assets. However, that warrant was later withdrawn. Why the change of heart? Concerns arose that an immediate freeze might inadvertently tip off the perpetrators. This could potentially hinder broader efforts to track down the hackers and understand their operational methods. This demonstrates the delicate balance law enforcement agencies must strike between immediate asset protection and long-term investigative goals when entities like Circle freeze USDC . The Multichain Saga: A $210 Million Exploit The Multichain protocol, a cross-chain router service, suffered a devastating exploit in July 2023. This security breach resulted in a staggering loss of approximately $210 million across various cryptocurrencies, including a substantial amount of USDC. The hack sent shockwaves through the DeFi community, raising serious questions about the security of cross-chain bridges and the vulnerability of digital assets. For months, the stolen funds remained largely untouched, moving through various addresses in an attempt to obscure their origin. The court’s recent order for Circle to freeze USDC represents a significant breakthrough in these recovery efforts. It offers a tangible step towards justice for those affected by the exploit. It underscores the fact that even in the often-anonymous world of crypto, stolen funds can eventually be traced and potentially reclaimed. What Does This Mean for Crypto Security and Trust? This court-ordered action has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. It reinforces the idea that stablecoin issuers, despite operating in a decentralized environment, can be compelled by legal authorities to act. This dual nature presents both benefits and challenges: Enhanced Trust: For many, the ability of legal systems to intervene and recover stolen assets increases trust in the broader crypto market. It suggests a level of recourse that wasn’t always clear. Victim Recourse: It offers a pathway for victims of hacks to potentially recover their lost funds, providing a crucial mechanism for justice. Centralization Concerns: However, it also raises questions about the inherent centralization points within the crypto ecosystem, particularly concerning stablecoin issuers. If a court can order Circle to freeze USDC , what does that imply about the “censorship resistance” often touted in crypto? Regulatory Precedent: This case sets a significant legal precedent for how digital assets, especially stablecoins, are treated under existing financial regulations and bankruptcy laws. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Users While this development is positive for asset recovery, it also serves as a stark reminder for all cryptocurrency users about the importance of security. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Holdings: Avoid putting all your digital eggs in one basket. Diversify across different protocols and exchanges. Strong Security Practices: Always use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Research Protocols: Before interacting with any DeFi protocol or cross-chain bridge, conduct thorough due diligence. Understand the risks involved. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of security incidents and regulatory developments. Understanding how legal frameworks are evolving, especially when entities like Circle freeze USDC , is vital. The court’s decision for Circle to freeze millions in USDC from the Multichain hack is a testament to the evolving landscape where traditional legal frameworks are increasingly intersecting with the digital asset world. It’s a complex interplay of decentralization, regulation, and the relentless pursuit of justice. This event underscores the critical importance of robust security measures and the ongoing efforts to make the crypto space safer for everyone. While the journey to recover all stolen funds is long, this action by Circle, under court order, is a significant step forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDC? A1: USDC (USD Coin) is a popular stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, issued by Circle. It aims to maintain a stable value, making it useful for transactions, trading, and as a safe haven in volatile crypto markets. Q2: What was the Multichain hack? A2: The Multichain hack was a major security exploit in July 2023 that targeted the Multichain cross-chain bridge protocol, resulting in the theft of approximately $210 million in various cryptocurrencies, including USDC. Q3: Why did a court order Circle to freeze USDC? A3: A U.S. bankruptcy court issued the order to freeze USDC because these specific funds were identified as proceeds from the Multichain hack. The aim is to prevent the hackers from moving or liquidating the stolen assets and to facilitate potential recovery for victims. Q4: Does this mean Circle can freeze any USDC? A4: Circle, as the issuer of USDC, does have the technical capability to freeze assets at specific addresses. However, this power is typically exercised under legal compulsion, such as a court order or law enforcement warrant, to combat illicit activities like hacks or money laundering. Q5: How does this impact the decentralization of cryptocurrency? A5: While cryptocurrencies aim for decentralization, stablecoins like USDC often have centralized issuers. This event highlights that these centralized entities can be subjected to traditional legal jurisdiction, creating a tension between the ideals of decentralization and the realities of regulatory oversight and asset recovery. Q6: What should I do to protect my crypto assets? A6: Always use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Be cautious with new protocols, research thoroughly, and stay informed about security best practices and ongoing threats in the crypto space. Did you find this article insightful?

The platform also disclosed that the spot trading competition features a reward pool of no less than 1.5 million $AT, followed by a perpetual trading campaign with at least 1.5 million $AT in additional rewards, marking a continuation of strong user engagement across both markets. The first Rocket Launch event not only accelerated new user acquisition but also reactivated existing traders and token holders, significantly enhancing overall liquidity and engagement across the Aster ecosystem. This milestone demonstrates Rocket Launch’s strong driving force and long-term potential in shaping the growth of the Aster DeFi landscape. Next Rocket Launch: Nubila Debuts, Powering the Physical Oracle Layer for AI and Prediction Markets Aster announced that the next Rocket Launch will begin on October 31, 2025, at 12:00 UTC, featuring Nubila , a decentralized oracle network for AI and prediction markets. The seven-day campaign will include both spot and perpetual trading campaigns for Nubila ($NB). The event adopts a dual reward structure. The Spot campaign offers a $200,000 $ASTER prize pool alongside over 3 million $NB in rewards, while the Perpetual campaign features an exclusive pool exceeding 3 million $NB, aimed at fostering broader participation and sustained market activity. Building a Sustainable Value Cycle for Projects, Users, and the Platform Continuing its long-term vision, Aster is redefining the evolution of token launches through Rocket Launch, transforming what used to be a single market event into a continuous, growth-oriented journey. Each Rocket Launch campaign is structured to create a self-reinforcing value loop. The reward pool combines $ASTER and the project’s native tokens. Project teams contribute both capital and tokens, while Aster allocates those funds to buy back $ASTER from the open market. The repurchased $ASTER, together with the project tokens, are then distributed as rewards to participants, ensuring that users benefit directly from both trading activity and ecosystem growth. “Aster’s Rocket Launch is more than a trading campaign; it’s an engine for on-chain innovation,” said Leonard , CEO of Aster. “Every participant becomes part of the ecosystem, contributing to the process of value creation for emerging projects.” About Nubila Nubila is building the physical oracle layer for AI and prediction markets.

At this point, CZ is being talked about Aster (ASTER), the Hyperliquid rival he recently supported. In this context, it was claimed today that CZ sold 35 million ASTERs worth $34 million. However, CZ denied the claims that he had sold 35 million ASTERs, calling the rumors fake news. Former Binance CEO CZ denied rumors that he sold 35 million ASTERs in a post on X. Citing allegations that he was selling ASTER, CZ stated, “Fake news! Unfollow those who share fake news.” Lookonchain, on the other hand, stated in its post that the $34 million worth of ASTER transfer took place between Binance hot wallets and had nothing to do with CZ's wallet. 4.

Perpetual and spot crypto decentralized exchange Aster’s token is experiencing a market slump, down by almost 7% in the last 24 hours. The market downturn comes on the backdrop of an X post from well-followed crypto investor FarzadXBT late Thursday, claiming that a “CZ Linked wallet” let go of about $30 million worth of ASTER. 4. Fake news! Unfollow the guys posting fake news. pic.twitter.com/Os8dF0dSjh — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 31, 2025 Zhao himself took to X to debunk Farzad’s update , asking his followers to “unfollow the guys posting fake news.” However, the Binance CEO’s confirmation that he did not sell Aster tokens , coupled with a confirmation from Lookonchain that the transfer had nothing to do with CZ, was not enough to stop the profit shedding. Aster in free-fall mode, reasons beyond CZ rumors According to several market watchers, ASTER is in a “freefall mode” after breaching its psychological support at $1.00, aided by the whole Zhao debacle. The token is barely holding on to the $0.93 level, the lower bound of its recent consolidation range. Even though investors would like to blame the fake news brigade, ASTER has been struggling to peak $1.20 the whole of this business week. The $1.00 level has now flipped from support to resistance, a bearish signal that could invite further downside if momentum fails to recover. According to market data from Coingecko tracked during Friday’s early Asian trading sessions, the DEX token traded roughly 18.8% below its 20-day exponential moving average, treading far away from its highest level this week by about 15.7%. Aster’s price was consolidating around $0.94 at the time of this publication, after trading volumes cooled slightly after the morning’s sell-off. Traders will be holding off on making any decisions to look for signs of a loss-profit reversal towards a close above $1.00, before they can definitively act on their positions. DEX TVL over $1.5 billion amid token price bloodbath While the token’s market value suffered, DefiLlama, a DeFi analytics tracker, reported that Aster’s total value locked (TVL) has reached approximately $1.577 billion, and the total fees collected in the last month hit $131 million. Aster recorded over $71 billion in perpetual trading volume and $618 million in spot exchange transactions in the week ending Friday, per DefiLlama’s tracking. The DEX announced progress on its ongoing token buyback program in an X post last Wednesday, saying that all Series 3 (S3) buybacks are being conducted entirely on-chain. “The on-chain buyback is currently in progress and will continue daily until the target range of 70% to 80% of the trading fees generated during S3 is reached,” Aster’s official X account wrote.

Diving Into the AI Frenzy Earlier this week, Pi Network Ventures partnered with OpenMind (a company that develops an operating system for robots). The collaboration marks the first investment by the crypto project in the AI sector, aiming to enhance the utility of PI and bring the token into real-world use cases. Additionally, the two entities have teamed up on a completed proof-of-concept project where volunteer Pi Node operators run image recognition AI models for OpenMind. Other developments related to Pi Network include the renewed rumors that it has joined the ISO 20022 race and the official activation of the Testnet2 v23. These advancements could explain why PI’s price has been among the top-performing cryptocurrencies for the past week. As of this writing, it trades at just under $0.25, representing a 20% increase on a seven-day scale but a 4% decline over the last 24 hours. XRP Targets Currently, Ripple’s cross-border token is worth around $2.50, or a 12% surge for the past two weeks. Some of the factors potentially contributing to that increase are the company’s multi-billion-dollar acquisitions. Recently, Ripple announced the official conclusion of the Hidden Road deal, which equals a whopping $1.25 billion. In addition, the company spent $1 billion to acquire the software provider GTreasury. Multiple analysts believe that XRP has much more room for growth. According to EGRAG CRYPTO’s “10% Theory,” the asset’s price may explode to $5.50-$6. XForceGlobal was even more optimistic, describing a rally above $10 as “a conservative target.” ETH Pump on the Way? The second-largest cryptocurrency was among the worst-affected digital assets during the latest market correction, with its price briefly plummeting below $3,700. The bulls, though, reclaimed some of the lost ground, and now the valuation stands at well above $3,800. Several optimistic factors, such as the reduced amount of ETH tokens stored on exchanges, suggest that a more substantial rally could be on the horizon. Recently, X user Ali Martinez disclosed that 200,000 coins have been shifted from centralized platforms to self-custody methods in just 48 hours, which reduces immediate selling pressure. Shortly after, however, he made a vital clarification, stating that 230,000 ETH tokens had been moved by large holders (likely exchanges) in the past week. This may include deposits, withdrawals, or internal transfers and is not necessarily a bullish signal.

Analysts point to the renewed appetite for high-momentum projects and the comeback of social-driven trading—an atmosphere reminiscent of SHIB’s early days. Within this environment, Remittix (RTX) , a fast-rising blockchain payment platform is also gaining strong traction as investors look beyond memes for sustainable, utility-backed growth. Shiba Inu, ZCash, and Pump.fun Token Surge in Social Volume SHIBA currently trades at $0.00000964, down 5.53% in the last 24 hours, while the trading volume has jumped by 50.12% to $229.76 million, indicating restored community involvement. News forums for Shiba Inu are full of predictions of a new wave of adoption driven by upcoming blockchain developments and upgrades to the ecosystem. ZCash (ZEC) currently trades at $328.27, down 1.28% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap of $5.46 billion and trading volume of $889.42 million, up by 27.66% — signaling renewed movement from privacy advocates and long-term holders returning to the network. Pump.fun Token (PUMP) trades at $0.004316, down 9.15%, yet boasting a market cap of $1.59 billion and daily trades over $623 million, reflecting retail speculation similar to the Shiba Inu Price run in 2021. Analysts say these surges echo past market behavior before meme tokens reached mainstream headlines. Why Analysts Are Watching “The Next Utility-Driven Growth Token” Beyond the viral trends, investors are paying attention to projects solving real-world problems. The Remittix DeFi project—often tagged as “the next big altcoin 2025”—has gained attention for its cross-border crypto payment infrastructure. With over $27.7 million raised in private funding and a token price of $0.1166, Remittix bridges the gap between blockchain and traditional finance through direct crypto-to-bank transfers in more than 30 countries. Remittix’s Wallet Beta Testing Program recently expanded to iOS users, inviting the top 10 weekly purchasers to join. The initiative aims to gather community-driven feedback as part of refining its PayFi solution before full-scale launch. This expansion shows a growing effort to build a product-first ecosystem rather than a hype-driven one. The Strategy Powering Remittix’s Market Appeal: Ranked #1 Pre-Launch Token on CertiK, ensuring complete team transparency. Over 681.7 million tokens sold via private funding rounds Beta wallet live with expanded community testing $250,000 Giveaway program to reward loyal holders The Verified Future of Utility-Based Crypto Remittix’s verification by CertiK strengthens its reputation in the DeFi project space, assuring investors of audited transparency with global exposure through trusted blockchain security. While more traders continue to chase rallies among meme coins like Shiba Inu, many analysts say that projects that have tangible use cases and low gas fees have more sustainable momentum. In the speculative-driven markets, projects combining real-world adoption with scalability will define the next crypto wave.

Cardano (ADA) is still one of the top players in the altcoin space, which is currently gaining strength as it consolidates above the $0.63 support. As long as ADA is strong above its demand zone, it may be poised to break out strong and rekindle investor interest once again. As ADA continues to demonstrate its staying power, yet another new crypto is making waves in the background, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The presale success of the project and its revolutionary dual-lending DeFi model have pundits speculating that it could potentially follow the same trajectory of growth as early ADA. With MUTM presale already more than 80% sold through at $0.035, investors are scrambling to get in prior to prices rocketing even higher, making it one of the best cryptos to buy now in 2025. Cardano (ADA) Flashes Huge Macro Reversal Signal Cardano (ADA) is boasting a very strong technical configuration that may be the beginning of a huge bull reversal. Having reclaimed its vital $0.65–$0.67 support area, ADA is now seemingly in the accumulation process on behalf of astute money positioning. Several Breaks of Market Structure (BMS) after a liquidity sweep indicating fatigue among sellers and a likely change in market mood. The price is currently trading over a Bullish Order Block (OB) with rising volume of trades, a typical indication of better investor sentiment. A confirmed close and breakout above $0.75 would see a tight move to $0.95–$1.00, the next level of resistance. Keeping the current demand zone in place is necessary to maintain ADA’s positive bias. As the momentum picks up steam, early-cycle value hunters are starting to look beyond breaking altcoins such as Cardano, with growing interest now focused on innovative DeFi solutions such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are exhibiting similar early-stage vibrancy as a new crypto project that’s catching attention as one of the best cryptos to buy now. PEPE Ready to Go Parabolic? Meme Coin Momentum Picking Up Steam Quick PEPE is back in the limelight with analysts growing extremely bullish, forecasting the meme coin going vertical by 2025 end. Having corrected for a short time, PEPE is now displaying blatant signs of strength, firm accumulation, rising lows, and an increasing community now near 500,000 holders, all in favor of fresh bullish momentum. With the entire crypto universe heating up and Ethereum (ETH) moving closer to fresh highs, everyone is convinced PEPE is going to be the next one to make a huge move. The people are so hyped, and social sentiment on social media indicates there might be an enormous breakout in the near future. Mutuum Finance: Building the Next Generation of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly on its way to becoming one of the newest, hottest players in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The project has far exceeded all initial expectations, with more than 17,600 investors supporting it and accumulating more than $18.25 million in its current presale. This explosive growth has taken the eye of investors and analysts as well, making Mutuum Finance the leader among top contenders for the best cryptos to buy now during the current bull cycle. Early birds are already projecting potential returns of nearly 2x after the official launch of MUTM. The previous presale phases have seen millions of tokens sold out, reflecting high interest from investors and a guarantee of early liquidity prior to mainnet launch. This consistent demand is a belief that Mutuum Finance provides a great deal more than speculative worth, it is a new crypto project that is utility-driven, a long-term DeFi solution that could spearhead the next level of decentralized finance. Revolutionizing DeFi through a New Model of Borrowing Central to Mutuum Finance is a fresh borrowing system that aims to increase predictability and transparency of DeFi borrowing. Borrowers can pre-set repayment fees, with the interest rate being a multiple of current market conditions. Though fixed rates tend to be higher than variable rates, such a structure offers a perfectly balanced method of risk management through which lenders and borrowers both feel safe and economically sure. By embracing fixed-rate lending, Mutuum Finance shields users against rate shocks and fosters a healthier, more transparent DeFi ecosystem. Such a pioneering practice demonstrates the project’s passion for democratizing decentralized finance, making it more investor-friendly and reliable, and raising the bar for DeFi innovation.

On a year-to-date basis, the total number of Bitcoin ATMs has climbed from 37,643 at the end of 2024 to 39,586 by late October 2025, reflecting a 5.2% expansion in global deployment with 1,943 new ATMs. North America dominates global distribution North America continues to account for the overwhelming majority of all crypto ATMs, representing over 83% of global installations. Within the region, the United States added 360 new ATMs in October, bringing its total to 31,037 machines, while Canada installed 44 and now maintains one of the highest ATMs-per-capita ratios globally. In contrast, Europe’s growth remains subdued, adding just eight new ATMs across EU member states in October, for a total of 1,769. Australia saw a modest increase of 33, reflecting consistent regional adoption in the Asia-Pacific market. The data illustrates how Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure remains highly concentrated in Western markets, though emerging regions such as Latin America and Southeast Asia continue to add new installations at a gradual pace. Steady Bitcoin ATM growth is expected to continue into early 2026 as operators prepare for increased retail interest, combined with improving compliance frameworks, could push the global total above 40,000 machines before year-end 2025.

Trump has signed deals with Malaysia and Cambodia, as well as the preliminary agreement with Thailand, which commit those countries not to impose digital services taxes or restrict U.S. providers of e-commerce, cloud computing, social media, and streaming platforms. U.S. seeks permanent global ban on digital tariffs under new trade pacts According to a Bloomberg report , the U.S. plans to make permanent the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) exemption from customs duties for electronic transmissions. This was initially done through two-year renewal terms, starting in 1998. The agreement prevents countries from applying tariffs on cross-border digital services and products such as e-books, movies, and software downloads. Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand have now pledged to support the U.S. in its bid. Malaysia has promised not to require U.S. social media and cloud providers to pay into domestic digital funds. Andrew Wilson, Deputy Secretary-General for Policy at the International Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the plan counters a trend of localization requirements that has seen some nations impose rules to keep data and digital infrastructure within their borders. Wilson added that country-by-country progress is valuable, but the ultimate goal should be to lock the regulations in a new international deal. Currently, the digital services sector is valued at $33 trillion based on UN data, marking the fastest-growing area of international commerce. According to UN statistics, global exports of digital services reached $4.77 trillion in 2024. That represented a 10% year-over-year increase. Emerging technologies, such as AI, have played a role in driving the growth of digital trade by enabling automation and personalized online services. On the other hand, they have also raised concerns about data security, sovereignty, and consumer privacy. As China expands its influence across Africa, South Asia, and Latin America, the U.S. seeks to define a global “digital order” governed by American rules, technology, and platforms. Trump’s policy of reciprocal tariffs has sidelined the WTO’s dispute resolution methods, but his administration continues to engage selectively, especially on issues critical to U.S. tech interests. U.S., Europe, and emerging economies clash over control of the digital economy According to Wilson, the commitments in these U.S. deals to facilitate the free flow of data are absolutely welcome, but it’s too soon to call it a full WTO re-engagement. This appears to be selective engagement on terms that favor U.S. big tech . In Europe, Brussels has pushed for stronger data privacy and antitrust enforcement, challenging the view that such regulations hinder innovation, as opposed to Washington. France recently doubled its tax on large technology companies, drawing threats of retaliation from the White House. India and Brazil have also resisted U.S. calls for a permanent WTO moratorium. Martina Ferracane, an associate professor of international digital trade at Teesside University in the UK, said a permanent extension of the moratorium remains uncertain. Cameroon will host the 2026 WTO ministerial meeting, which is expected to intensify the battle over digital trade rules further. As of now, the United States demonstrates determination in utilizing trade leverage to foster a tariff-free digital future. The country hopes this could shape the balance between economic openness, national sovereignty, and U.S. technological power. According to a report from Cryptopolitan, the U.S. has warned the EU that its digital laws could harm trans-Atlantic relations unless they are revised. The U.S. argued that the laws impose liabilities on American tech firms, which limits free speech on the internet. For instance, the warning alert is being issued amid Europe’s crackdown via the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. The laws set by the EU to prevent powerful platforms and online creators from abusing their power are already facing backlash from U.S. tech giants, such as Apple and Meta. Get seen where it counts.

""As Much as Bitcoin and Ethereum…""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/grayscales-statement-on-solana-sol-as-much-as-bitcoin-and-ethereum/,"Altcoin ETF launches in the US have faced delays due to the government shutdown, but Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs began trading this week. While the Solana ETF has experienced large inflows compared to the LTC and HBAR ETFs, Grayscale Head of Research Zach Pandl evaluated the SOL ETFs. Speaking to DL News, Grayscale’s Zach Pandl said that the US spot Solana ETF could mirror the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and expects it to perform similarly. Pandl also predicted that SOL ETFs could attract at least 5% of Solana's total token supply over the next one to two years. At current prices, this would mean over $5 billion worth of SOL being taken up by firms like Grayscale and Bitwise. “It makes sense to compare Solana to other ETF products in the market. At this point, I think the SOL ETFs will mirror the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Within one to two years, I expect at least 5% of the Solana token to be held by these ETFs.” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the success of SOL ETFs, saying Bitwise’s BSOL ETF launched on Tuesday and saw $129 million in inflows in its first two days. Grayscale's GSOL ETF, which began trading on Wednesday, saw $4 million in inflows on its first day. As is well known, the GSOL ETF, like Grayscale's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, initially began as a trust. GSOL launched in 2021. Before converting to an ETF, the trust held $100 million worth of Solana. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Grayscale's Statement on Solana (SOL)!

Strategy turned heads by reporting a net profit of approximately $2.78B in Q3 2025 – an impressive reversal from its $340M million loss in the same period last year. The dramatic turnaround comes due to Bitcoin’s continued success, Strategy’s aggressive buying strategy, and a change in corporate accounting rules. It also underscores not only the potency of the Bitcoin narrative, but also its ripple effects across the broader altcoin market, setting the stage for the best altcoins to buy right now – like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – to soar. A Turning Point in Q3 Strategy’s Q3 2025 results are telling. With an operating income of $3.9B in Q3 out of the full-year guidance of $34B, and on top of $12.9B in Bitcoin gains this year so far, the company is doubling down on its strategic mission. Powering the impressive returns are the firm’s massive Bitcoin holdings: around 640,808 $BTC, acquired for about $47.44B for an average price of roughly $74K per bitcoin. With $BTC trading at approximately $109K, that translates into substantial unrealized gains. The Rise of the Bitcoin Treasury Model What’s driving this performance is more than just a rising crypto price. Strategy introduced the idea of a Bitcoin treasury company, one whose primary reserve asset is Bitcoin rather than cash or bonds. While the idea was originally a long-shot, under Saylor’s guidance the company has refined the model to impressive degrees, transforming its corporate treasury into a leveraged play on the world’s leading crypto. Underpinning the whole strategy is a steady drumbeat of Bitcoin purchases – whatever the weather, whatever the price; a version of dollar-cost-averaging on a corporate scale. The Strategy model works because as Bitcoin’s value climbs, Strategy’s holdings appreciate. That appreciation boosts the company’s equity value, enabling it to raise additional capital. The fresh capital is then used to buy more Bitcoin, further reinforcing the cycle in a self-reinforcing flywheel. Strategy continues to demonstrate the power of a strong Bitcoin play and inadvertently underscores the need for the next step in Bitcoin’s evolution. That’s precisely where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Expanding Bitcoin Beyond Store-of-Value with Fast, Cheap Layer-2 Transactions Bitcoin Hyper plans to unlock the full potential of Bitcoin by combining its security with the speed and programmability of modern blockchains in a dynamic Layer-2 solution. The project introduces the utility token $HYPER, which serves as the governance, staking and fee‐settlement token across the ecosystem. Traditional Bitcoin transactions can be slow and expensive. To solve the problem, Bitcoin Hyper incorporates the Solana Virtual Machine environment to deliver high throughput, low latency and advanced smart-contract capability. Final settlement is still anchored on Bitcoin’s Layer-1, preserving network security. The project has already gained substantial market traction: its presale has raised over $25.3M, including major whale buys of $379.9K and $274K . Early investors are drawn to its promise of staking rewards, token scarcity (21B token supply cap, echoing Bitcoin’s 21M), and a much-needed upgrade for Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Our price prediction indicates that $HYPER could potentially climb 1,415% from its current $0.013195, to reach $0.20 by the end of 2026. Discover how to buy $HYPER and stake it for 46% by checking out our step-by-step guide. Strategy’s report is more than just a quarterly beat; it’s a clear validation of the $BTC narrative. Bitcoin remains the primary institutional gateway into crypto, and the altcoin market may be poised to benefit as the spotlight broadens. Projects like $HYPER, which offers a critical upgrade for Bitcoin, could make massive gains as Bitcoin treasuries expand. Don’t miss the presale, on now at the official Bitcoin Hyper website.

Recently, Bybit, a leading crypto exchange, announced a significant Bybit delisting of several spot trading pairs. This move, scheduled for November 7th, 2023, at 8:00 a.m. UTC, means certain digital assets will no longer be available for spot trading on the platform. Understanding these implications is vital for managing your portfolio effectively. What’s Happening?

Verify addresses carefully. Stay informed: Check Bybit’s official announcements for deadlines and instructions. Proactive portfolio management is essential. Staying Ahead: Future-Proofing Your Crypto Strategy After a Bybit Delisting While a Bybit delisting can be inconvenient, it reminds traders to diversify and stay vigilant. Over-reliance on a single asset or exchange increases risks. Regularly reviewing holdings and understanding project fundamentals is crucial. Consider these strategies: Diversification: Spread investments across various cryptocurrencies and exchanges. Research: Conduct thorough due diligence on projects. Monitor Announcements: Keep an eye on official exchange and project team announcements. These habits help you navigate the dynamic crypto landscape.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to $13.41, with a possible maximum trading value of $14.30 in 2028. In 2031, the target price for XRP is between $21.45 and $23.24, with an average price of $22.35. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction.

The coin is currently trading at $2.48 after a recovery following four days of correction. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has gained 1.64% of its value in the last 24 hours.

The Bollinger Bands are shrinking, as the indicator’s arms are coming together, leading to low volatility in the market. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $2.68. Conversely, its lower limit, indicating support, has moved to $2.27. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has increased to index 45.16 in the past 24 hours. The ascending curve on the RSI graph reflects rising buying momentum. If the bullish momentum continues to intensify, further upside is possible. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis for the XRP coin also shows a bullish trend in the market, as price levels are increasing. The XRP/USD value recently increased to $2.48 in the past few hours, as the buying momentum is forming below the moving average line. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart.

Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $2.72, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $2.43, indicating support. The RSI indicator is trending in the neutral region, as its value has increased to 42.35 in the last four hours. This increase is represented by an upward RSI curve.

Ripple price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events, as the price movement is in an upward direction. The coin’s price has increased to a high of $2.48 over the last 24 hours. The coin has gained up to 1.64 percent of its value. Technical indicators give bearish signals, but the price charts project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as buying interest took hold, bringing the price to $2.48 during the day. The RSI increased to 45.16 at the same time and is in neutral territory. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.47 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to increase significantly. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching $20 by 2030. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. However, one’s own research is advised before making the investment decision. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $23.24 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that Ripple CTO David Schwartz is stepping back from his daily duties at Ripple Labs after more than 13 years at the firm. He also noted that he isn’t leaving the company permanently and will join the company board. He will stay as CTO Emeritus, an honorary title. XRP price prediction October 2025 According to the Ripple price prediction, in October 2025, XRP could reach a maximum price of $3.60. The average trading price is expected to be $2.92 for the month, while the lowest it can go, as per XRP cost estimation, is $2.30, considering the current XRP sentiment. Period Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) October 2025 $2.30 $2.92 $3.60 XRP price prediction 2025 The XRP price prediction for 2025 suggests that the price could reach a maximum of $5.36 by the end of the year, considering its technological utility and enhancement of cross-border payments.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October, XRP is trending near the $2.9 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-31 11:58:20

The altcoins total market capitalization has made higher highs and higher lows since the bull market began. If the most recent higher low is now in, the rally could be about to begin. $XRP and $ADA are two crowd favourites that are well set for big surges. $XRP higher lows force price against solid resistance Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $XRP does show a lower low from the crypto melt-down on the 10 October. However, that can probably be taken as an outlier, especially given how quickly the price was bought up again. Since then, the price has come up continually against the $2.65 horizontal resistance level, from where it has been soundly rejected each time. On a positive note, higher lows have continued to be set. The $XRP price has been going sideways and downwards for quite some period of time now - 15 weeks to be precise. This was after the run-up from $2 to $3.66, so a period of consolidation was probably sorely needed. We’ve had that now, so it might be expected that a breakout could occur, especially considering that the Stochastic RSI indicators have just crossed up. $XRP target over $5 Source: TradingView The 2-week chart illustrates the $XRP price action since 2018. It can be seen that a price step has formed around $2, and all price action since then has remained above, except for mostly longer wicks below. If one refers to Fibonacci extension levels, the 0.786 at $2.63 is where the price is being resisted currently. One more main level of resistance is above this at just under $3. Looking much further out, and a possible target for this bull market, is the 1.618 Fibonacci at $5.30. With the 2-week Stochastic RSI indicators also bottoming, some major upside price momentum could be just around the corner. $ADA multi-year trendline soon to break? Source: TradingView The $ADA chart is nowhere near as simple and as bullish as the $XRP chart. The daily chart above shows that the price is once more below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), where it has been for a fair bit of this bull market so far. However, the multi-year descending trendline is more likely than not to break, and if it does, this could provide plenty of upside momentum. The RSI at the bottom of the chart illustrates a downward trend. This is likely to break soon. $ADA price momentum trump card - but will it be enough? Source: TradingView Further out into the weekly time frame the challenges to $ADA become obvious. The 200-week SMA is providing support currently, but it is sloping down now, which is a concern. This last part of the descending trendline, and the horizontal support line under it, have formed a descending triangle. This is a bearish pattern, but it would be bullish should the price escape out of the top. Fairly solid resistances are above, so it just remains for the $ADA bulls to play their last trump card, which is the Stochastic RSI. The Stochastic RSI indicators are hitting the bottom now. Once they are able to cross back up, and they pass the 25.00 level, some big price momentum could help to push the price out of the triangle and above the horizontal resistances. It just remains to be seen if this will indeed happen. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The project has entered Phase 9, where TUNDRA-S trades at $0.147 and buyers receive an 11% bonus plus a free allocation of TUNDRA-X, its governance token on the XRP Ledger. With more than $2 million raised and bonuses decreasing as each stage advances, investors are recognizing that every phase delay cuts into potential returns. Listing prices — $2.5 for TUNDRA-S and $1.25 for TUNDRA-X — are already confirmed. A $1,000 position at the current rate delivers over 6,800 TUNDRA-S tokens, worth about $17,000 at listing value. As the presale moves toward its later phases, those same tokens will cost more and earn smaller bonuses, compressing the multiplier that early entrants now secure effortlessly. The Dual-Token Architecture Powering Predictable Growth XRP Tundra’s ecosystem stands on a model rarely attempted in retail crypto: a verified dual-chain structure linking Solana and the XRP Ledger. TUNDRA-S, deployed on Solana, fuels utility and staking. TUNDRA-X, operating on XRPL, governs treasury and reserves. Together, they allow investors to hold exposure across two high-throughput blockchains without juggling complex swaps. That structure is backed by comprehensive verification — Cyberscope , Solidproof , and FreshCoins have all completed audits, while Vital Block’s KYC certificate publicly verifies the founding team. Combined, these checks position Tundra among the few audited presales offering both fixed pricing and real technical infrastructure before listing. The project also prepares for Cryo Vault staking, where holders will later lock tokens through Frost Keys for up to 20% annual yield. While staking isn’t yet active, presale participants automatically qualify, turning early participation into guaranteed post-launch income eligibility. Liquidity and Price Protection Backed by DAMM V2 The presale’s credibility also comes from how it’s preparing for listing. XRP Tundra integrates Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity pools for TUNDRA-S, ensuring the token launches under strict protection against early dumping and bot manipulation. DAMM V2’s dynamic fee scheduler starts with high initial trading fees — sometimes near 50% — and decreases gradually over time. This system deters automated dumping and allows natural price discovery once trading stabilizes. All collected fees flow into Tundra’s Cryo Vault staking system, meaning the same structure protecting liquidity also funds long-term rewards. NFT-based liquidity positions, permanent lock options, and cross-chain compatibility ensure the pools remain secure while maintaining flexibility for future expansion. Together, these measures give XRP Tundra something most early projects lack — genuine defense mechanisms that survive beyond the presale hype. Arctic Spinner Converts Participation Into Profit One of the most talked-about features in the ecosystem is the Arctic Spinner, a live on-chain reward program that turns every qualifying purchase into a spin for instant bonuses. The system’s transparency has already distributed more than $32,000 in extra TUNDRA-S, with tiered mechanics ensuring fairness: smaller entries get 1 spin for up to a 10% reward, while larger entries above $1,000 receive 3 spins with potential bonuses up to 20%. The feature’s popularity has been amplified by YouTube coverage, with Crypto Volt’s review calling Arctic Spinner “a presale mechanic that finally pays in real time.” What makes it notable is that rewards are credited instantly — no vesting, no waiting, and no hidden requirements. Even users without active purchases can engage daily through the free spin mechanic, receiving one no-purchase spin every 24 hours. That dynamic has turned Tundra’s presale into an ongoing community event rather than a static token sale, creating continuous exposure during its later phases. Missing Tundra Means Missing Millions Every cycle has one project that defines the year’s presale conversation. For 2025, XRP Tundra has become that project — dual-chain verified, yield-ready, and operating within a quantified financial framework. With each new phase, the price per TUNDRA-S increases and the bonus percentage decreases, reducing the multiple that current buyers still enjoy.

Lawmakers from both parties are racing to finalize the market structure bill that could reshape oversight of digital assets before election politics stall progress. The negotiations, led by key Senate committees, have accelerated in recent weeks despite the broader gridlock. Can the CLARITY Act pass by Thanksgiving? According to the report , Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman (R-Ark.) said he and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) are working “daily” to complete their section of the legislation, which would establish a regulatory framework for digital assets treated as commodities. Boozman said he expects a committee vote “before Thanksgiving,” adding, “We’re going to get it done this year.” Booker echoed that sentiment, saying the goal was to “get the policy right” rather than rush the timeline. Their work represents one part of a broader bipartisan effort spanning multiple committees, including Banking and Finance, to define how digital assets fit within U.S. regulations and the tax code. Talks within the Senate Banking Committee have also gained momentum. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) said discussions had resumed after weeks of delay. Notably, Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said he was “encouraged” by the progress and looks forward to advancing “meaningful legislation.” Still, some members caution that the bill is not yet ready . Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said the legislation requires a public hearing and that many lawmakers still need to understand the issue. @SenJohnKennedy says “we’re not ready” on the GOP crypto bill, raising doubts about the Senate’s plan to advance market structure legislation. #Crypto #USPolitics #cryptobill https://t.co/g3VFg6LKQ3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 10, 2025 The push for progress comes amid warnings that time is running out. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said Congress must act by early 2026 or risk losing momentum as election politics take over. “I’m not optimistic about us moving much further on anything around digital assets, stablecoins, or crypto in this Congress,” he said on Monday. Longest Shutdown in History Looms — What’s Next for America? The shutdown , now stretching into its fifth week, has added further strain. The Senate adjourned Thursday without progress on a continuing resolution, guaranteeing the shutdown will last at least 34 days, tying the longest lapse in U.S. history. The Senate adjourned on Thursday and won't meet again until Monday as the government shutdown deepens, threatening military paychecks, food assistance for 41 million Americans and funding for programs like SNAP, Head Start and WIC. https://t.co/gl3Z9bVReC pic.twitter.com/MH2TVIYs6n — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) October 30, 2025 As of October 20, 25% of Polymarket bettors predict that the shutdown will last until at least November 16 and may drag on for almost another month to become the longest in American history. Funding for food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is set to expire Saturday, threatening benefits for 42 million Americans. SNAP benefits expire this Saturday.

U.S. Lawmakers Renew Crypto Talks, but Prediction Markets Cut Odds of 2025 Passage to 25% On October 20, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) hosted a closed-door roundtable with major industry figures , including Galaxy’s Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov. Armstrong told CNBC that roughly 90% of the bill’s issues had already been resolved and that Thanksgiving had been floated as a possible target for completion .

The measure defines which digital assets fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and which are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Together with the GENIUS Act, signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year , it forms the foundation of the emerging U.S. crypto regulatory framework.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $109,777. BTC slumped despite the Federal Reserve's announcement of a rate cut and a positive meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping. Meanwhile, recent jobs data and other economic indicators have pointed to a slowing economy. Strategy Unlikely To Acquire Rival Treasury Firms Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has dismissed talk about acquiring other Bitcoin treasury companies, stating that there was too much risk involved. “Generally, we don’t have any plans to pursue M&A [merger and acquisition] activity, even if it would look to be potentially accretive. There’s just a lot of uncertainty, and these things tend to stretch out six to nine months or a year. An idea that looks good when you start might not still be a good idea six months later.” However, Saylor did not entirely rule out acquiring a competing firm in the future, stating, “I don’t think we would ever say ‘we would never, never, never, ever,’ but what we would say is the plan, the strategy, the focus is to sell digital credit, improve the balance sheet, buy Bitcoin, and communicate that to the credit and the equity investors.” Meanwhile, Strategy CEO Phong Le stated that mergers and acquisitions for software companies, Strategy’s primary business focus, are difficult. “There’s always something hiding behind what you actually think you purchase. I would say the same thing about acquiring Bitcoin treasury companies.” Several analysts have stated that Bitcoin treasury companies may need to start buying each other as competition grows. Strive has become the first Bitcoin treasury company to complete a merger, acquiring rival Semler Scientific in an all-stock deal. The new entity will hold over 11,000 BTC , making Strive the 12th largest public Bitcoin holder. Strategy Shares Rise As Firm Reports Q3 Numbers Strategy shares rose nearly 6% during after-hours trading after the Bitcoin treasury company reported a net income of $2.8 billion during its third quarter, beating analyst expectations. The firm reported diluted earnings per share of $8.42 for the three months ending September 10, exceeding expectations of $8.15. The $2.8 billion income during Q3 is a significant jump from the $340 million loss posted at the same time last year. However, it is a significant drop from its record $10 billion net income recorded in Q2. Strategy is the largest public holder of Bitcoin , with its current stockpile valued at over $73 billion. BTC’s recent rally to $116,000 helped push Strategy’s income higher. However, its subsequent decline squeezed Strategy’s mNAV to 1.05x, a substantial drop from a peak of 3.89x in November. Bitcoin ETFs Register Substantial Outflows Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs registered combined outflows of $672 million on Thursday. Asset managers pulled $490 million from spot Bitcoin ETFs on October 30. BlackRock’s IBIT registered $290 million in outflows, while Fidelity, Bitwise, ARK, Invesco, VanEck, and Grayscale also reported heavy outflows. “Institutions are still trimming risk, BTC and ETH spot ETFs saw heavy outflows, led by BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA, totaling $488 million and $184 million.” The outflows come at a time when BlackRock is facing scrutiny after revelations of large-scale fraud in its private credit division, increasing investor anxiety. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) endured a difficult week, extending its decline to slip below $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $106,279 on Thursday, before rebounding to reclaim $109,000. Market sentiment turned bearish after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that rate cuts in December were not a foregone conclusion. The Fed’s hawkish stance could strengthen the dollar and impact investor sentiment around risk assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, the ongoing US government shutdown has heightened economic uncertainty, with key economic data delayed. The US-China trade talks also failed to cheer markets. US President Donald Trump announced that China will resume soybean purchases and pause export controls on rare earth minerals. BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.37% on Sunday and settling at $108,676. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose nearly 2% to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,568. BTC surged to an intraday high of $114,082 on Tuesday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.99% to $108,362. Selling pressure persisted on Wednesday as BTC fell 0.72% to a low of $106,639 before settling at $107,585. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Thursday, rising over 2% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,116. BTC continued pushing higher on Friday, rising almost 1% to $111,042. Price action remained positive over the weekend, with BTC increasing 0.56% on Saturday and settling at $111,666. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday thanks to positive macroeconomic developments, including positive trade talks between the US and China, and rising odds of a rate cut. As a result, BTC rose 2.58% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,548. Source: TradingView BTC reached an intraday high of $116,410 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at 114,087, ultimately dropping 0.40%. BTC rallied to an intraday high of $116,114 on Tuesday as bullish sentiment persisted. However, it lost momentum again and dropped over 1% to $112,906. Selling pressure intensified on Wednesday as the price fell nearly 3% and settled at $110,032. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $107,924 during the ongoing session. Volatility and selling pressure increased on Thursday as the price fell to a low of $106,279 before settling at $108,308. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $109,990. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

President Eddie Zhang confirmed the move in an interview with Reuters, adding that dYdX plans to slash trading fees by up to half across the board upon US launch. The expansion follows President Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto this year, which triggered dismissals of lawsuits against major crypto platforms and prompted financial regulators to develop specialized digital asset rules. Zhang emphasized the importance of US availability for the platform’s strategic direction going forward. DYDX TO LAUNCH CRYPTO SPOT TRADING IN THE US BY 2026 pic.twitter.com/Kn2FQjBp5b — 0xMarioNawfal (@RoundtableSpace) October 31, 2025 Lower Fees, Higher Regulatory Barriers DYdX will reduce its trading fees to between 50 and 65 basis points upon entering the US market. The San Francisco-based platform, which has recently surpassed $1.5 trillion in total trading volume since its inception, specializes in perpetual contracts. These derivatives allow traders to speculate on asset prices without ownership or expiration dates. While perpetual contracts won’t be available to US users initially, dYdX hopes regulators will eventually provide guidance for decentralized platforms to offer these products. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicated last month that they would consider allowing crypto perpetual contracts across regulated U.S. platforms. Zhang explained that, unlike centralized exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken that act as intermediaries, decentralized platforms like dYdX eliminate middlemen by allowing users to transact directly on blockchain networks. Strategic Growth Through Acquisition and Infrastructure The US expansion follows dYdX’s July acquisition of Pocket Protector , a Telegram-native trading app that attracted 50,000 users and reached $1 billion in annualized volume in under a year. Zhang joined as President through the deal, while co-founder Kaiser Kinbote became Head of Growth. Founder Antonio Juliano credited Zhang’s experience leading early Messenger development at Meta and launching consumer products as key factors in the acquisition. As platforms like dYdX adapt to social-first tools, competition could shift toward interface design and mobile accessibility. #dydx #defi https://t.co/8FDwk2Wf4L — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 “ He has strong product instincts, a track record of execution, and a rare ability to zoom between strategy and details, ” Juliano wrote in a statement announcing the deal. Pocket Protector’s core features, including Telegram-based perpetual and spot trading, are being integrated into dYdX’s leading platform. A four-person engineering team from Pocket Protector joined dYdX’s product and engineering divisions to support the integration and broader expansion efforts. Platform Enhancements and Tokenomics Evolution Beyond the acquisition, dYdX has implemented major infrastructure improvements throughout 2025. The platform resolved critical stability issues during market volatility by assigning dedicated engineers to eliminate downtime and throughput constraints affecting its Indexer system. Deposit and withdrawal times were reduced from 18 minutes to under one minute through the Skip integration. Enhanced mobile interfaces rolled out to retail investors, while the web platform added new order types, including reduce-only limit orders, scale orders, and TWAP orders alongside funding rate payment history. @dYdX updates roadmap for faster trading, enhanced UX, & expanded asset offerings. #dYdX #DeFi https://t.co/XutecDRNS9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 12, 2025 These upgrades supported $270 billion in trading volume and $46 million in net protocol fees across 150 markets during 2024 alone. The platform’s cumulative trading volume has surpassed $1.46 trillion since 2021, demonstrating sustained growth despite market fluctuations. In March, dYdX also launched its DYDX Buyback Program , allocating 25% of net protocol fees to systematically purchase and stake DYDX tokens from the open market. The community-governed initiative aims to strengthen network security and align platform growth with token value as 85% of DYDX tokens have now been unlocked. Token emissions are set to drop 50% in June 2025, with all unlocks completing by June 2026.

Despite being a long-term holder of BTC, Brandt is trading against it in the short term based on technical signals that suggest further downside is possible. Broadening Pattern Indicates Risk On the daily chart, Brandt identified a broadening formation, sometimes referred to as a megaphone pattern. It shows five distinct swings, with the most recent top near $126,000. After this high, Bitcoin moved into a sideways range between $106,000 and $116,000 before dipping below the south boundary. Source: Peter Brandt/X Currently, the price sits near $109,500, following a 2% drop in the past day and 2% over the last week. This breakdown below the range supports Brandt’s short-term bearish setup. If the move continues, potential price levels to watch include $97,000 and $84,721. Order Book Shows Liquidity Above Price Market data from Coinglass shows that most of the order book liquidity sits above the current price. The $113,000 to $116,000 range contains large clusters of limit orders and stop-losses. Rekt Fencer posted, All $BTC liquidity is sitting above the current price. Just one pump and shorts get wiped. Is the V-reversal loading right now? pic.twitter.com/57OzobYCei — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) October 31, 2025 A sudden move higher could trigger short liquidations, leading to a quick price bounce. Below current levels, there are fewer large orders, which may weaken support on the way down. Notably, Bitcoin has a history of large drawdowns after hitting the upper boundary of its long-term trend channel. Past rejections have led to drops of 84% and 77%. The latest chart shows another rejection near this same trendline, with a potential 73% decline if the pattern holds. Rekt Fencer added , “Every time Bitcoin rejects this line, it dumps 70%… Hope you are ready for $BTC at $40,000.” A move toward that zone would match the lower boundary of the multi-year channel. Source: Rekt Fencer/X Rate Cut Sparks Market Reaction The Federal Reserve’s recent 0.25% rate cut led to volatility across markets. Bitcoin briefly fell below $108,000 after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments , as traders reacted to the policy shift. Some described it as a classic “ buy the rumor, sell the news ” event. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows falling BTC balances on exchanges, suggesting reduced supply. As CryptoPotato reported , large transactions above $1 million have also reached a two-month high, which points to continued interest from large holders. However, the asset remains under pressure as short-term uncertainty persists.

Ripple (XRP) Is Everywhere In New York,https://timestabloid.com/its-happening-ripple-xrp-is-everywhere-in-new-york/,"Manhattan’s streets are no longer just walkways; they’ve become billboards for Ripple Labs. From yellow taxi toppers to subway platform posters, the company’s presence is unmistakable. The campaign isn’t subtle; it’s bold. Phil Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, shared a post on X after spotting a Ripple ad on a New York taxi , promoting the company’s payments, custody, and stablecoin services. His capture offers a ground-level confirmation of what has otherwise been a carefully orchestrated marketing push. Strategic Timing This surge in outdoor branding aligns with Ripple’s upcoming Swell 2025 conference in New York, scheduled for November 4–5. Hosting the event in Manhattan attracts financial executives, policymakers, and institutional partners, a key audience the visuals appear to target. The cityscape, then, acts as both stage and invitation. Ripple is not just advertising; it is staging its presence in the ecosystem. it’s happening. @Ripple is everywhere in new york. pic.twitter.com/5LwGNMjjrX — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) October 30, 2025 Core Messages On Display The ads channel three major offerings: payments infrastructure, institutional-grade custody, and the dollar-pegged stablecoin RLUSD (issued December 2024). The stablecoin is described as enterprise-grade and globally deployable, backed by U.S. dollar deposits and government bonds. Parallel to that, Ripple’s custody solutions are achieving marked growth, serving major banks and financial institutions globally. These elements collectively bring the visual campaign to life. Why This Matters New York is more than a big city; it’s finance central. By deploying a large-scale ad campaign here, Ripple is signaling to banks, regulators, and asset managers that it means business. With regulatory clarity improving and crypto-friendly frameworks emerging, the visuals reflect a readiness to compete and scale. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Recent milestones, such as the $1.25 billion acquisition of prime broker Hidden Road , demonstrate the significance of institutional involvement. From Street to Strategy Seeing an ad on a taxi might seem trivial at first glance. But when aligned with corporate milestones, regulatory evolution, and major product launches, it becomes part of a broader narrative. Street-level visibility confirms that Ripple’s internal strategy is now front of mind. Phil Kwok’s post provides a real-world snapshot of that shift in motion. Looking Ahead As Swell 2025 approaches , expect to hear more from Ripple on how its payments network, custody offering, and RLUSD stablecoin will integrate. The company has laid the visual foundation. Now comes the narrative. If the momentum holds, the New York blitz could yield major announcements and partnerships. For those watching the crypto payments space, the message is clear: ripple effects are imminent—and, as the ads say, they’re happening in New York.

This comes after the Federal Reserve concluded its three-year run of quantitative tightening and signaled that the central bank will resume being a major buyer of U.S. Treasuries. Chair Jerome Powell commented, “At a certain point, you’ll want . . . reserves to start gradually growing to keep up with the size of the banking system and the size of the economy.” Marco Casiraghi of Evercore ISI also noted that the Fed would begin buying Treasuries again in the first quarter of next year, aiming to expand its balance sheet by March at the latest. The Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening program, which began in 2022, aimed to reduce the central bank’s holdings of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities accumulated during pandemic-era quantitative easing. QT has been steadily reducing Fed holdings since that peak. Nearly all of the QT that has transpired this far has taken the form of eliminating the excess of cash that the firms eligible to do business with the Fed had deposited in the reverse repo facility, which peaked at $2.6 trillion at the end of 2022, and is now experiencing a nearly complete lack of activity. From now on, the Fed will move forward with a balance sheet that’s considerably more significant than the $4.2 trillion level seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. markets have eased their anxiety about the country’s supply pressures Casiraghi projected that the Fed would purchase around $35 billion worth of Treasuries per month, translating into a $20 billion monthly expansion of its $6.6 trillion balance sheet. He also noted the Fed will drop some of its mortgage-backed assets. The Fed’s actions are intended to restore confidence among investors uneasy about the government’s debt sustainability. So far, markets have calmed somewhat, with traders expecting the Fed to end its quantitative tightening. Fund managers were also optimistic that the U.S. deficit, currently at 6% of GDP, may shrink. Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America, even noted that markets seem far less anxious about supply pressures than before. He remarked, “Concerns about the deficit worsening have been cooled due to strong tariff revenues, and the expectation that the Fed will soon start buying [government debt].” The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, a bellwether for global borrowing, has already dropped from 4.8% in January to under 4.1%, thanks to a sustained rally since the summer, primarily driven by expectations that the Fed will soon lower rates. Casiraghi asserts that the Fed does not intend to extend QT at the moment The yield spread between U.S. 10-year Treasuries and interest swaps of the same maturity has narrowed sharply since April’s peak, dropping to roughly 0.16 percentage points. Typically, bond yields and swap rates remain closely aligned, as they both reflect expectations for future interest rates. But in the U.S. and U.K., yields have outpaced swaps this year as investors demanded extra yield to take on growing government debt. Yields on 30-year U.S. bonds are now just one percentage point higher than on 2-year notes, down from over 1.3 in September. Meanwhile, the gap between 10-year U.K. government bond yields and swap rates has narrowed to roughly 0.25 percentage points from almost 0.4 percentage points in April. The Fed’s decision to call off its quantitative tightening path came along when signs appeared that the central bank’s attempt to lift liquidity was destabilizing short-term funding markets The purchases indicate that banks have more than sufficient reserves. To put this into perspective, in the past, quantitative easing engaged trillions of dollars in debt buys during downturns. Casiraghi even explained that quantitative easing is designed to boost liquidity aggressively during times of crisis. In contrast, the Fed’s goal now is simply to ensure the system has enough reserves to implement policy effectively.

The world of cryptocurrency trading is constantly evolving, with new opportunities emerging for savvy investors. Binance, a leading global exchange, has just made an exciting announcement that’s set to capture the attention of many: the listing of CC perpetual futures on its pre-market. This move could significantly impact how traders engage with specific digital assets, offering both exciting prospects and new challenges. What Exactly Are CC Perpetual Futures, Anyway? Before diving into the implications, it is crucial to understand what CC perpetual futures entail. In essence, a perpetual futures contract is a type of derivatives product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, which have a set settlement date, perpetual futures can be held indefinitely, mimicking spot market prices through a funding rate mechanism. No Expiry Date: Traders do not need to worry about rolling over contracts. Leverage: These contracts typically allow for significant leverage, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Price Tracking: They aim to track the underlying asset’s spot price closely, making them a popular tool for hedging and speculation. The ‘CC’ in CC perpetual futures refers to a specific underlying asset or index, which Binance is now making available for trading in a novel way. Why Is Binance’s Move on CC Perpetual Futures a Game-Changer? Binance’s decision to list CC perpetual futures on its pre-market is a significant development for several reasons. Pre-market listings often allow early price discovery and provide an initial liquidity pool before the official trading launch. This can give early participants a unique advantage, allowing them to gauge market sentiment and position themselves accordingly. Moreover, introducing new perpetual futures contracts on a major exchange like Binance typically leads to: Increased Liquidity: Attracting more traders and capital to the specific asset. Enhanced Trading Strategies: Providing new tools for arbitrage, hedging, and directional speculation. Market Visibility: Raising the profile of the underlying asset within the broader crypto ecosystem. This listing broadens the scope for advanced trading strategies, making the crypto derivatives market even more dynamic and accessible to a global audience. Navigating the Risks of Trading CC Perpetual Futures While the opportunities presented by CC perpetual futures are compelling, it is equally important to acknowledge the inherent risks. Derivatives trading, especially with leverage, carries a high degree of risk. The volatility of cryptocurrency markets means that prices can fluctuate wildly, leading to rapid liquidation of positions if not managed carefully. Consider these points before engaging: High Leverage: Small price movements can result in substantial losses, potentially exceeding initial capital. Market Volatility: Sudden price swings can trigger stop-loss orders or lead to unexpected liquidations. Funding Rates: These rates can sometimes be significant, impacting profitability, especially for long-term positions. Therefore, a disciplined approach to risk management, including setting appropriate stop-loss levels and only trading with capital you can afford to lose, is absolutely essential. How to Access CC Perpetual Futures on Binance’s Pre-Market For traders eager to participate, accessing CC perpetual futures on Binance’s pre-market requires understanding the platform’s specific procedures. Typically, pre-market trading involves a different set of rules compared to standard spot or futures trading. Users might need to allocate specific funds or meet certain eligibility criteria to participate. Here are some actionable insights for getting started: Check Binance’s Official Announcement: Always refer to the official Binance announcement for precise details on eligibility, trading pairs, and timelines. Understand Pre-Market Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how pre-market orders are matched and settled. Start Small: Especially if new to derivatives or pre-market trading, begin with smaller positions to gain experience. Implement Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders and position sizing techniques to protect your capital. Binance often provides comprehensive guides for new listings, which can be invaluable resources for navigating these new opportunities responsibly. The introduction of CC perpetual futures on Binance’s pre-market marks another exciting chapter in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. It opens new avenues for sophisticated traders to engage with digital assets, offering the potential for significant gains through leveraged positions and strategic market timing. However, with great opportunity comes great responsibility. Traders must approach these new instruments with a clear understanding of both their mechanics and the associated risks. By staying informed, practicing diligent risk management, and utilizing Binance’s resources, you can confidently explore the potential that these new offerings bring to your trading portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a perpetual futures contract? A perpetual futures contract is a derivative product that allows traders to speculate on the price of an asset without an expiry date, unlike traditional futures. It aims to track the underlying asset’s spot price through a funding rate mechanism. What does ‘pre-market’ listing mean for CC perpetual futures? A pre-market listing allows traders to place orders for a new asset before its official launch on the main exchange. This often facilitates early price discovery and liquidity formation, giving participants a chance to trade before wider market access. What are the main benefits of trading CC perpetual futures? The primary benefits include the ability to use leverage to amplify potential returns, the flexibility of not having an expiry date, and the opportunity to engage in advanced trading strategies like hedging or arbitrage on a specific asset. What are the major risks associated with CC perpetual futures trading? Major risks include high leverage leading to amplified losses, significant market volatility that can cause rapid liquidations, and the impact of funding rates on long-term positions. It is crucial to manage these risks carefully. How can I prepare to trade CC perpetual futures on Binance? To prepare, review Binance’s official announcements for listing details, understand pre-market trading rules, and ensure you have a robust risk management strategy in place, including setting stop-loss orders and managing position sizes.
