This is reflected in the recent rise of the Fear and Greed Index, a popular tool that measures market sentiment. A higher score typically signals increased optimism, which often leads to stronger buying activity. Bitcoin has also broken through the 94000 resistance level and is moving closer to reaching its all-time high. Historically, when Bitcoin gains upward momentum, it tends to spark activity across the altcoin market. As capital shifts from Bitcoin into other tokens, altcoins begin to rise. In many past cycles, memecoins have outperformed the rest of the market, delivering some of the highest returns. With sentiment improving and Bitcoin climbing, the conditions are setting up for another potential altcoin season where memecoins may once again take the lead. A strong contender for the next 1000x token of 2025 is capturing attention as investor interest in altcoins returns. SOLAXY offers solutions to Solana’s long-standing network bottlenecks Solaxy is stepping into the spotlight with a mission to solve Solana’s most pressing issues, including congestion, low throughput, and scalability hurdles. Its goal is to deliver a faster, more sustainable blockchain environment. While the project appeals to developers and infrastructure-focused backers, another rising token is gaining serious momentum with a more narrative-driven and utility-first approach. That project is Pepeto. PEPETO rises as a top memecoin pick with real use cases and early-stage accessibility At a presale price of just $0.000000126, Pepeto presents a low-barrier entry for investors seeking high upside. With the launch of PepetoSwap, a zero-fee trading platform, and the rollout of Pepeto Exchange, the project is building an ecosystem that supports more than just memes. It’s combining functionality with cultural relevance. Pepeto also leans into its mythology. With a total token supply identical to Pepe’s 420 trillion, speculation suggests a connection to someone formerly involved with Pepe. The storyline goes that Pepe stole four foundational components, but failed to capture two critical ones: Technology and Optimization. Pepeto, on the other hand, embodies Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, a more complete vision. Pepe may have walked away thinking he took everything, but by leaving the last two keys behind, he left the true core untouched. PEPETO presale enters final phase with major exchange updates approaching Investors can still buy $PEPETO at $0.000000126 directly from pepeto.io . Purchases can be made using USDT, ETH, BNB, or with credit/debit cards via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. As PepetoSwap nears its public rollout and listing announcements continue, early holders are in line to receive staking rewards and exclusive benefits within the growing ecosystem. Pepeto is shaping up to be one of the standout tokens of the coming bull cycle.

This previously improbable recovery is now accentuated by the premier cryptocurrency’s likely return to above the important $100,000 level. However, the Bitcoin price appears to have its hands full in its quest for a six-figure valuation in the near future. The latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader’s price is currently wedged within a significant range, which could determine its movement over the next few weeks. ‘Pretty Much Blue Skies Above $100’ For BTC – Analyst In his recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Checkmate shared an interesting on-chain insight, saying that the Bitcoin price is “working its way” through the $93,000 and $100,000. This on-chain observation is based on the supply distribution heatmap, which shows the concentration of coins acquired at different price ranges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally The deep red shades on the distribution heatmap represent high volumes of coin activity, indicating that large clusters of investors have their cost bases in this price range. These cost bases clusters act as psychological and technical resistance zones, as investors are likely to sell when prices return to their purchase prices. As shown in the chart above, there is a significant supply barrier for the Bitcoin price in the $93,000 – $100,000 region. This suggests that the premier cryptocurrency faces significant potential selling pressure due to investors looking to break even after being in the red for so long. Interestingly, the distribution heatmap shared by Checkmate shows that beyond the $100,000 threshold, the Bitcoin supply significantly declines. This suggests low historical buying activity (lower coin amounts being held) above this price level, meaning relatively less significant resistance. Ultimately, a breach above the $100,000 mark could be the beginning of a strong upward rally for Bitcoin price, as Checkmate noted that “blue skies” is what lies beyond the psychological price level. However, failure to break out of the $93,000 – $100,000 region could result in another extended consolidation period. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,680, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by more than 2% on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Running Out Of Time’?

In the past few days, we have seen a consistent outflow of Ether from centralized exchanges, and that is reinforcing the bullish narrative. It seems that more and more, investors are choosing to store their assets off exchanges. Not only is this a typical sign of reduced short-term selling pressure, but it also seems to indicate increased confidence among investors in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Net outflows from centralized platforms over the past week alone have totaled nearly $380 million worth of ETH. This sizable move adds more fuel to the fire of our ongoing accumulation trend, one whose early stages resemble a bullish cycle. In historical terms, when we see large outflows from exchanges, it typically means price increases are on the way. The most likely reason for this is that holders are moving their assets either to cold storage or to staking contracts, which means they’re not planning to sell anytime soon. Ether keeps flowing out of centralized exchanges. In the last seven days alone, net outflows have topped roughly $380 million worth of ETH, adding weight to the ongoing accumulation trend pic.twitter.com/bpTmTNvSFa — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) May 2, 2025 Whales Step In as DeFi Bridges Capital for ETH Buys Several prominent whale deals have emerged that reveal just how much Ethereum is being bought up by the wealthy and, in some cases, even the super-wealthy (thanks to recent drops in the NFT markets, we’re looking at at least one DeFi platform in the very near future that will make none of us wealthy). On-chain monitoring service Lookonchain recently let the world know about a handful of big ETH buys that they figure involve some sort of leverage. In one such deal, an address known as 0xDdb4 took out a loan for 3.44 million USDC from Aave and right away used the immediately available cash to purchase 1,856 ETH. This is aggressive buying and shows that the investor has strong conviction in ETH’s near- to mid-term potential; otherwise, why not go for something safer when deploying from a leveraged position? The 0xDdb4 address didn’t just do leveraged buying—it did so with a large amount of ETH. Whales have been buying $ETH in the past 2 hours! 0xDdb4 borrowed 3.44M $USDC from Aave, then spent 3.44M $USDC to buy 1,856 $ETH . 0xf84d borrowed 1.64M $USDC from Aave, then spent 2.34M $USDC to buy 1,259 $ETH . A newly created wallet(0x69D0) withdrew 2,250 $ETH ($4.12M) from… pic.twitter.com/r3kvW8N32i — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 1, 2025 Similarly, wallet 0xf84d borrowed 1.64 million USDC but spent 2.34 million USDC to acquire 1,259 ETH — which means the investor either added their own capital to the borrowed funds or went for several rounds of borrowing. More than a hunch, these back-to-back, big-money buys signal something else: the sophisticated investors behind these wallets are positioning for an imminent upwards move in the value of ETH. On-chain drama in the crypto world intensified on December 13 as a wallet labeled 0x69D0 emerged to withdraw 2,250 ETH from the Binance exchange. That single transaction saw the new wallet take possession of a sum worth approximately $4.12 million at the time of withdrawal. It’s unusual for a freshly created wallet to handle such a large sum, and the large withdrawal serves to heighten the mystery of where all that Ethereum is actually going. A transaction of this sort, especially when coming from a wallet just set up for the occasion, could naturally invite speculation. On May 1, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $422 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the day with $351 million in net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $6.4932 million, with only Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) experiencing a net… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 2, 2025 Spot Ethereum ETFs Begin to Attract Capital From an institutional perspective, Ethereum is making strides in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) arena. The latest data from May 1 shows that spot Ethereum ETFs have seen a total net inflow of $6.4932 million, indicating a swell of interest from traditional investors who want ETH exposure without the fuss of directly holding the asset. While the amount is slight when contrasted with the influx into Bitcoin ETFs, it nonetheless establishes Ethereum as a more favored target for institutional investment than it was just a couple of years ago. Inflows into the Grayscale Ethereum Trust on the same day, by contrast, looked rather unimpressive, with the slow-moving vehicle essentially suffering from a lack of confidence. The fund’s discount to NAV and its not-so-young structure seemed to have more to do with the trust’s woeful approximation of a true investment vehicle for ETH than any sort of serious doubts about ETH itself. Spot ETFs provide a gateway into the world of cryptocurrencies that is regulated and safe. This is something we have not had up till now. And in the United States, the regulatory environment is everything but safe and certain for hedge funds, pension plans, and other large institutional investors looking to open up shop in the world of cryptocurrencies. These three types of investors—the traditional financial world in which we all live—are the ones for whom this adoption metric really matters. Conclusion: Strength Behind the Scenes Although Ethereum’s price action remains bound to shakeouts from the broader crypto market or regulatory run-ins, the signals coming from the on-chain data and institutional inflows are putting together a pretty clear bull case. From whales deploying millions in leveraged buys to on-ramping by ETFs to consistent outflows from exchanges, there’s a pattern of accumulation underway. Should these trends continue, not only might Ethereum put in a strong performance in the months ahead, it might do so on a basis that is not merely speculative. The retail and institutional players in this market might be making and might be about to make, in numbers that are way more than just a couple of punchlines in a Twitter thread, the kind of informed bets that suggest real and not just apparent moves in the market.

The video featured Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, explaining the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to drop its appeal against Ripple in the long-running enforcement action. Why did the SEC dropped its appeal against Ripple? pic.twitter.com/SbtnikhBYj — Uphold (@UpholdInc) May 2, 2025 Alderoty Raises Concerns About the SEC’s Approach In the video, Alderoty acknowledges the toll the case has taken. Rather than simply focusing on why the agency abandoned its appeal , he challenged the SEC’s rationale for bringing the lawsuit in the first place. His message emphasized that the SEC had acted without providing legal clarity, targeting crypto companies under laws that had not been clearly defined. Alderoty pointed out that the SEC had ended its action against Ripple and had “dropped every case against every crypto company in the United States.” The regulator began this trend shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration in late January, dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase , Gemini, and many other crypto companies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Alderoty said the shift reveals a fundamental flaw in the agency’s enforcement strategy: it pursued penalties without establishing clear legal standards. According to him, the law must be communicated before it is enforced. “You can’t bring enforcement actions for violating the law without first explaining what the law is,” he said. Ripple Plans to Refocus on Business and Policy With the SEC’s legal efforts concluded, Alderoty said Ripple will now focus on resuming normal operations and advocating for clear legislation. He noted the importance of stepping away from litigation and returning to business, while helping to shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. This includes working with lawmakers to promote a policy framework that protects consumers and the broader financial system while supporting innovation. Alderoty and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse have also met with Trump personally , and the community is excited about where the crypto market is heading. Alderoty stated that Ripple will “clean up the mess” caused by years of legal uncertainty and plans to contribute to crafting smart regulations that protect customers, preserve the market’s integrity, and keep bad actors out. This next phase will emphasize collaboration with Congress to develop regulatory clarity for digital assets. As attention now turns to Congress, the focus will be on enacting legislation that supports innovation while protecting consumers.

These are the projects that get attention not just from developers and enthusiasts but from entire industries. XRP and Immutable X have earned their reputations for different reasons: one reshaped global finance, the other redefined NFT infrastructure. But a new name is buzzing across Latin American circles and beyond— Qubetics . And this one isn’t just showing potential; it’s living it. From presale stats to multi-chain wallet functionality, Qubetics is checking all the right boxes for the next 100x candidate. Qubetics (TICS): Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Puts It Among Top Cryptos with 100x Potential For a crypto project to offer true breakout potential, it has to solve practical issues—not just technical ones. Qubetics is leading that charge with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet , a tool that gives users full control over their assets across different blockchains, all in one place. Picture a logistics startup in Panama working with smart contracts on Ethereum, payment systems on Solana, and supply chain data on Avalanche. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and platforms, they can now manage, move, and monitor assets securely using the Qubetics wallet. It’s designed for speed, ease, and serious control—no middlemen, no third-party risk, and no logins that compromise user sovereignty. Even for casual adopters or solo freelancers in places like Lima or Bogotá, the wallet makes crypto simple and safe. Whether it’s swapping tokens, staking, or signing contracts, everything flows through a single dashboard that supports multi-chain interaction and real-time tracking. It’s also mobile-optimized, so users aren’t tied to desktop environments that can lag or fail during high-volume periods. That blend of security, autonomy, and flexibility is why Qubetics is making waves as one of the top cryptos with 100x potential. The infrastructure is already running, and its presale performance is setting records. Qubetics Presale Details & Analyst Forecasts The Qubetics crypto presale is in Stage 32. So far, more than 510 million tokens have been sold to over 25,600 holders, raising upwards of $16.6 million. $TICS is currently available at $0.2093. Analysts across Latin America and Europe are spotlighting this early-stage momentum. If $TICS reaches $1, early adopters could be looking at a 377% ROI. If the token hits $5, returns climb to 2,288%. At $6, $10, and $15, buyers could see potential gains of 2,766%, 4,677%, and 7,066%, respectively. With a working product, growing community, and demand-driven adoption curve, Qubetics isn’t speculating. It’s building—and it’s one of the clearest contenders for a 100x breakout. XRP: The Standard for Global Payments and Institutional Integration XRP is far from a new face in crypto, but its relevance hasn’t faded. Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP is best known for its use in cross-border payments and remittance services that challenge outdated systems like SWIFT. It delivers low-cost, near-instant international transfers, with liquidity provided by its native token. Its primary appeal lies in partnerships. From major financial institutions to central banks, XRP has built relationships that many projects only dream of. In countries with complicated banking systems, like Argentina or Venezuela, XRP’s use in remittance corridors has opened access to faster, cheaper money transfers that traditional banks simply can’t match. It also runs on the XRP Ledger, which is lightweight, scalable, and designed for enterprise-grade financial movement. Unlike many proof-of-work chains, it offers high throughput and stability without sacrificing decentralization. Among Latin American community members, XRP is often viewed as one of the few cryptos that blends compliance with disruption. That makes it a staple in any conversation about infrastructure-ready projects—and a long-term contender in discussions about the top cryptos with 100x potential when factoring in scale. Immutable X: Where NFTs Meet Speed and Scalability Immutable X has positioned itself as the gold standard for NFT infrastructure—especially for high-volume, gas-free transactions. Built on Ethereum Layer-2 via zk-rollup technology, it enables creators, studios, and marketplaces to mint and trade NFTs with zero gas fees while maintaining security and immutability. Where many Layer-1 chains fumbled under NFT congestion, Immutable X thrived. Its protocol is specifically designed for scalable NFT deployment. Think about a game developer in Buenos Aires building a fantasy RPG that issues thousands of in-game NFT assets. Immutable X offers a platform where those items can be minted and traded without wrecking the user experience. From top-tier gaming partnerships to integrations with DeFi and entertainment platforms, Immutable X is more than hype—it’s infrastructure. Its commitment to environmental sustainability (carbon neutrality) and its frictionless minting model make it accessible for creators and powerful for platforms. The combination of tech and adoption means Immutable X continues to be a heavyweight in the Web3 development scene. And while it may not be as flashy as some meme tokens, its architecture, performance, and purpose land it firmly among the top cryptos with 100x potential in the near future. Final Thoughts XRP, Immutable X, and Qubetics are all bringing something powerful to the table. XRP continues to lead global financial dialogue with banks and payment systems. Immutable X is defining the rules for NFT ecosystems. But Qubetics is quietly building the glue that could connect them all. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet doesn’t just offer another way to hold tokens. It gives users, businesses, and developers real autonomy in a cross-chain world. When combined with the momentum of its presale, the technology behind Qubetics is something early adopters aren’t ignoring—they’re acting on it. For those searching for the top cryptos with 100x potential , Qubetics isn’t just in the conversation—it’s controlling the mic. And with Stage 32 still open, there’s time to grab $TICS before the window narrows.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $777 to $777K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors a chance to position early—before the spotlight finds it.

According to a damning new study by CoinGecko, these Q1 failures account for nearly half of all token deaths in the last five years. Rise and Fall of Instant Tokens The numbers captured in the report are sobering: nearly one in four tokens launched since 2021 are now considered dead. At the heart of this token extinction event is a storm triggered by a market correction following Bitcoin’s brief post-inauguration rally in January 2025 and the unchecked rise of token generators like Pump.fun. While the platform, launched in early 2024, has democratized token creation, critics argue that it has also contributed to diluting the industry’s integrity. It allows users to launch coins in mere minutes without needing any coding knowledge, fueling a meme coin gold rush that overwhelmed crypto platforms and flooded markets with short-lived speculative assets. Since mid-2021, GeckoTerminal has listed nearly 7 million tokens, but according to the report, 52.7%, amounting to more than 3.7 million cryptocurrencies, have now stopped trading and have officially been categorized as “failed.” While the sharp uptick in failures started in 2024, Q1 2025 has been particularly brutal, with at least 1.8 million tokens going dark by March 31. A Market in Crisis Historically, the rate at which crypto projects collapsed was relatively modest. Per the CoinGecko survey, out of more than 428,000 tokens listed in 2021, only 2,584 failed. The number of listed crypto assets increased to 724,706 in 2022, with failures also growing significantly to 213,075. These figures remained fairly consistent in 2023, with 835,183 created and about 245,000 dying. However, in 2024, the number of launched tokens skyrocketed, going past the 3 million mark thanks in part to Pump.fun. Such was the amount of activity on the platform that at one point it became the main driver behind Solana’s recent dominance of the decentralized exchange (DEX) market. Still, the high number of coins churned resulted in just as many deaths, hitting north of 1.3 million by the end of that year. 2025 seems to have picked up where 2024 left off. Only slightly more than 117,000 tokens out of the 1.93 million that were created in the first three months of the year have survived, meaning just under 94% fizzled out unceremoniously.

Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction as one of the most talked-about early-stage opportunities. For those working with a modest investment of $139 , these names offer a compelling blend of established performance and high-upside potential. MAGACOINFINANCE – A Rising Altcoin With Early-Stage Momentum While legacy coins anchor portfolios, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a serious early-stage contender. With a growing base of supporters and increasing visibility across media and social channels, the project is drawing comparisons to early successes in previous market cycles. Now backed by over $7.8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE is executing a deliberate strategy—building infrastructure, expanding community engagement, and preparing for its public listing. Early investors can claim a 50% token bonus by using the promo code MAGA50X at checkout. Cardano, Sei, and Optimism Reflect Broader Strength Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.67 , up over 15% in the past week. It’s gaining technical strength, crossing key moving averages and supported by a record 130,000+ smart contracts deployed across its ecosystem. Sei (SEI) , priced at $0.208 , is enjoying a 4.52% daily uptick, with 127% growth in trading volume. Its steady $415 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) signals consistent ecosystem participation and investor confidence. Optimism (OP) is navigating a scheduled token unlock of 31.34 million OP , valued above $24 million . Despite the short-term implications, the network’s core metrics show rising activity and recovery trends, positioning it well for future growth. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, Cardano, Sei, and Optimism showing solid performance, and MAGACOINFINANCE rapidly gaining attention, the market is offering diverse pathways for upside. For investors working with an entry-level allocation of $139 , a combination of established strength and strategic early positioning could generate meaningful returns.

However, the path to these highs may be gradual, as Cardano (ADA) continues to build on its methodical development approach. In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are expected to soar 1500% before ADA can reach $5. While both ADA and DOGE have their merits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention with their ambitious growth projections. Investors are currently purchasing MUTM tokens at presale for $0.025, and over $7.4 million has been raised so far. Over 9,300 participants are already onboard ahead of a 20% price jump to $0.03 in the next presale phase. Investors who join now can realize a 140% gain upon the token hitting the projected launch price of $0.06. Over 50% of phase 4 has sold out faster than expected. Investors have less time remaining before the phase closes. Mutuum Finance Ignites Its Presale: The Dawn of a New DeFi Frontier Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a top performer to reckon with in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, thanks to its innovative crypto lending products. The presale has already accumulated over $7.4 million, with more than 9,300 investors having already participated. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM tokens will transition to $0.03 in the next presale phase, and early investors stand to earn up to 140% profit when the token hits its projected launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending platform is transforming decentralized markets through disruption which solidifies the platform as one of the leading DeFi projects. The upcoming Certik smart contract audit will provide investors with extra details and security through its release. Empowering Early Backers & Growing the Mutuum Finance Ecosystem Mutuum Finance offers attractive rewards for early adopters in an attempt to build a strong, active community. Under the program, the platform is conducting a $100,000 giveaway contest, in which ten participants will be awarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Additionally, the referral program encourages users to invite others to the ecosystem, promoting organic growth. Early adopters gain exclusive access to other features like priority platform updates, making them significantly invested in the project’s development. To additionally promote price stability, Mutuum Finance is set to launch a USD-backed stablecoin. This eliminates the instability issues associated with algorithmic-backed stablecoins. Mutuum Finance’s utilization of modern lending innovations is ushering in lasting changes in the DeFi ecosystem. Two Paths, One Goal: Mutuum’s Twin-Engine Crypto Lending Model One of the features of Mutuum Finance is the double-lending model of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks. In the P2C framework, it leverages the smart contract pools to offer stablecoin lending with the option for users to earn passive income during lending. In contrast, the P2P framework removes intermediates, offering direct interaction between borrowers and lenders, giving both parties greater freedom. Auto-adjusting interest rates also make the platform more efficient, with better balance between returns for lenders and borrowing costs for users. While Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) position themselves for steady and slow gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is racing ahead with relentless momentum. With over $7.4 million already generated and more than 9,300 investors on board, Phase 4 of the presale is over 50% sold out and time is ticking. Opportunities like this don’t wait, secure your position in one of DeFi’s most explosive new projects before the door slams shut. Act now or watch from the sidelines as others ride the wave.

As May kicks off, four names are drawing renewed attention — XRP, SUI, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE — each offering a different path to potential upside. XRP Hovers at $2.19 With Resistance Ahead XRP is currently priced at $2.19 , posting a modest +0.37% gain over the last hour, but showing a -0.68% decline over 24 hours . Its 7-day chart is nearly flat at +0.01% , suggesting the asset is locked in a tight range. While XRP remains a dominant force in cross-border payments, analysts say it faces tough resistance near $2.30. Despite its global utility and institutional support, near-term momentum appears muted, leaving tactical traders searching for more dynamic setups. Solana Dips Despite Strong Network Activity Solana (SOL) trades at $147.87 , with a +0.44% move in the last hour but a -1.50% drop over 24 hours . The 7-day change of -0.54% reflects a slight downtrend despite ongoing developer activity and ecosystem growth. While Solana maintains a top-tier position among Layer 1 chains, its recent dip could indicate exhaustion following earlier rallies. With many believing Solana has already priced in most of its mid-term gains, investors are considering alternative Layer 1 plays or undervalued microcaps. SUI Slides to $3.36 With Broader Weakness Sui (SUI) is currently trading at $3.36 , posting a minor +0.06% hourly uptick but down -2.53% over 24 hours and -2.11% over the week . While it still commands attention for its unique Move-based infrastructure and scalable architecture, market confidence appears to be cooling. Technical traders note SUI’s drop below recent support levels could open up further downside if sentiment weakens. Still, its fundamentals remain strong enough to keep it on radar for a recovery play in Q2. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges With Rare Upside While top altcoins tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a focal point for those seeking serious returns. Still trading below major listings, the project is gaining traction thanks to its unique structure, early scarcity, and roadmap designed for exponential growth. Analyst buzz is growing as projections estimate 34x–35x ROI potential from current price levels. The token avoids VC influence, embraces a limited-access model, and is already capturing early community momentum. In addition to its ROI potential, what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its combination of aggressive tokenomics and a viral grassroots push. Unlike speculative meme coins or overleveraged DeFi tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a calculated growth vehicle — engineered to deliver long-term upside without early-stage dilution. It’s the kind of asymmetric setup investors look for before major listings drive mass adoption.

Among them Ruvi AI is a pioneer inspired by Cardano. While Cardano is known for scalability, sustainability and systematic innovation, Ruvi AI is taking this vision to the next level by merging AI with blockchain. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform with a dual focus on blockchain and AI designed to solve real world problems. At its core Ruvi combines the transparency of blockchain with AI tools to deliver solutions across industries. It can handle creativity, predictive analytics, fraud detection and process optimization so businesses can operate smarter and better. This unique combination makes Ruvi AI stand out in a crowded blockchain space. By addressing challenges in logistics, finance and supply chain Ruvi AI ensures its platform is not just technology driven but practical and adaptable. The goal is to have tools that work for everyone from small businesses to global enterprises. Impressive Presale Start Ruvi AI has made a strong start with the presale . Over 10 million tokens sold in just a few days and over $100,000 in investments. This is a huge trust from the blockchain community in Ruvi AI’s vision and potential. Currently priced at $0.01 per token in Phase 1 this is a great entry point for early adopters. With a 50% price increase in Phase 2 the presale window is an opportunity to maximize returns before the next phase of growth begins. Ruvi AI has delivered on its promises and launched a functional beta platform shortly after the presale. This shows Ruvi’s commitment to its roadmap and provides concrete evidence of the platform’s capabilities. The beta features showcase the full spectrum of possibilities from AI powered decision making tools to blockchain backed transparency. VIP Tier 5 Benefits For those looking to get into Ruvi AI’s ecosystem the VIP tiers are a great opportunity. VIP Tier 5 is for big investors looking to maximize returns.To get into this tier you need to hold 500,000 RUVI tokens which is an investment of $5,000 at Phase 1 presale prices. The rewards for this tier are huge. VIP Tier 5 investors get a 100% token bonus so they will have 1,000,000 RUVI tokens. These numbers are impressive. At the initial listing price of $0.07 the value of these tokens is $70,000. And at the projected valuation of $1 per token this $5,000 investment is worth $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for strategic investors who want to commit to the project and get long term benefits. Leaderboard Rewards Another great initiative from Ruvi AI is the Leaderboard rewards program designed to reward contributors across all investment levels. This is an inclusive system so everyone in the Ruvi AI community benefits from the project’s success. For example the Top 10 investors get 500,000 RUVI tokens each. At the initial listing price of $0.07 these tokens are worth $35,000. But if the token reaches its projected valuation of $1 this is worth $500,000. The Top 50 contributors get 250,000 RUVI tokens. At the $0.07 listing price this is worth $17,500 but if Ruvi AI reaches its $1 projection this is worth $250,000. These rewards not only incentivize participation but also shows Ruvi AI’s appreciation to its investor community. It’s a system to share success broadly so everyone can celebrate with Ruvi AI. Shaping the Future of Blockchain Technology Ruvi AI is not just a platform it’s a vision of how technology can transform industries and generate long term value. By combining blockchain’s transparency with AI’s analytical power Ruvi AI is building a system that solves problems and creates opportunities. Ruvi’s strong fundamentals, bonuses and focus on its community makes it a project set to become the next success story. Joining now, while the price is still at a reduced price secures a ticket for life-changing gains.

Experts Predict 9,900% Price Increase in 2025",https://timestabloid.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-steal-trons-trx-spotlight-experts-predict/,"TRON (TRX) has been catching attention this May 2025 with game-changing upgrades and bullish price movements. The recent TRON ecosystem updates, including a massive transaction milestone and a 7.2% price surge following its latest upgrade, have fueled growing optimism among investors. TRX is consolidating above $0.24, with analysts predicting further gains ahead. However, while TRON makes waves, another project is rapidly gaining traction behind the scenes. Meet Ruvi , the cryptocurrency tipped to revolutionize blockchain with AI at its core. If you’re impressed by TRON’s success, Ruvi’s potential could blow you away. With its one-of-a-kind presale bonuses and groundbreaking tech, Ruvi is the project smart investors can’t afford to ignore in 2025. TRON’s Momentum vs. Ruvi’s Rising Power TRON’s transaction record now exceeds 10 billion, solidifying its place as a leading blockchain for stablecoins and dApps. But while TRON remains focused on its current blockchain prowess, Ruvi compares by offering a futuristic twist with artificial intelligence deeply woven into its structure. Ruvi is not just about processing transactions or strengthening network activity; it aims to solve real-world problems like fraud detection, predictive business analytics, and cross-industry applications. Why Ruvi Stays Ahead of the Game Unique Use Cases Unlike TRON, which depends on its reputation in stablecoins and transactions, Ruvi creates utility in logistics, finance, and other major sectors, making its adoption broader and richer. Deflationary Token Supply Ruvi’s capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens ensures a constant scarcity factor that grows demand and price over time. TRON, on the other hand, lacks deflationary models. AI-Powered Infrastructure By utilizing artificial intelligence, Ruvi offers tools that predict market trends, prevent fraud, and optimize corporate strategies. These AI enhancements make it a one-stop destination for enterprise solutions powered by blockchain technology. Ruvi’s Exclusive VIP Presale Being able to identify future stars early is key in crypto. That’s where Ruvi offers an unbeatable edge with its VIP token presale . Here’s your chance to secure a high-growth investment before the rest of the market catches on. $500 Starter Portfolio Example Your $500 investment earns 50,000 tokens at $0.01 each. Thanks to Ruvi’s 40% bonus , you gain 20,000 additional tokens , bringing your total to 70,000 tokens . If Ruvi hits $0.85 , your stash grows to $59,500 , delivering an unbelievable 11,900% return on your initial investment! $7,000 Middle-Tier Opportunity A $7,000 investment secures 700,000 tokens at the presale price. With an 100% bonus , this leapfrogs to 1,400,000 tokens . Should Ruvi soar to $2.20 , this investment would skyrocket to $3,080,000 . Think about life-changing potential that rivals TRON’s early believers. $15,000 High-Roller Play Finally, the boldest investors can power in with $15,000, which buys 1.5 million tokens . Ruvi’s 100% VIP bonus doubles this to 3 million tokens . If Ruvi climbs to $2.50 , your portfolio explodes to a jaw-dropping $7.5 million . This isn’t just investing; it’s creating legacy wealth. Why Ruvi Outpaces TRON TRON’s popularity is anchored by its stablecoin dominance, but Ruvi rethinks blockchain utility entirely by merging predictive AI tech. TRON’s recent upgrades and heightened transaction volumes are impressive, but Ruvi delivers future-proof solutions attractive across industries. While TRON predicts marginal gains of 10-20% over time, Ruvi offers exponential returns fueled by its presale bonuses and fast-growing adoption. Its capped supply and wide range of applications drive demand that far outweighs a typical blockchain’s growth trajectory. Don’t Miss Out Opportunities like Ruvi do not come along often. With its low presale entry point and unparalleled bonus structures, early adopters have a unique chance to secure massive financial gains before the crypto project hits mainstream headlines. TRON may dominate discussions now, but Ruvi is how you dominate the future.

Solana (SOL) continues to impress with a strong long-term outlook, supported by record-breaking network activity and steady developer engagement. On the presale front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the spotlight with what many traders are calling the best deal right now at just $0.0019. With confirmed CEX listings and growing speculation of a $1 breakout, the excitement is palpable. Whether it’s gaming, infrastructure, or hot presale opportunities, traders have plenty of options and plenty to gain. SUI Price Gains Momentum with DeFi and Gaming Boost The buzz around SUI’s price prediction is growing louder after a strong recovery from its April dip. Following a 40% bounce from $1.93 to $3.60, analysts are shifting their views to a more bullish outlook. Supporters highlight key factors like DeFi growth, impressive performance metrics, and the launch of the SuiPlay 0X1 gaming platform as major catalysts for potential price gains. Many now see year-end targets between $5.05 and $6.25, depending on broader market conditions and adoption rates. If staking demand and gaming activity continue to rise, SUI’s 2025 price prediction could put it in direct competition with leading Layer 1 tokens. There’s also speculation that SUI’s gaming-first strategy might give it an edge in certain niches. SOL’s Strong Network Usage Drives Optimistic Outlook Solana’s (SOL) long-term outlook is still solid, despite some short-term fluctuations. While technical indicators are sending mixed signals, the fundamentals remain strong. Solana recently passed 400 billion transactions, a milestone that shows its scalability and growing adoption. The network’s outlook is further boosted by a 44% surge in decentralized exchange volume and new user activity surpassing expectations. Although the $145 support level is under pressure, many traders are eyeing a possible rebound to $157 and beyond. Moving forward, analysts believe Solana’s future will hinge on network stability and the ability of decentralized apps (dApps) to generate fees, fueling growth and attracting more developers. BlockDAG’s $0.0019 Presale Deal Sparks Buying Frenzy Before CEX Debut! BlockDAG (BDAG) just dropped a major update: it’s heading to centralized exchanges (CEX), and the news has the crypto world buzzing. Early backers are celebrating, seeing this move as confirmation of their wise decision to back this promising project . But it’s not just the early birds who are getting in on the action. Latecomers are rushing to secure their spot, especially with BlockDAG offering an unbeatable price of just $0.0019 until May 13. This is a dramatic cut from the current batch price of $0.0262 and far below the anticipated $0.05 launch price. With over $225 million raised and more than 19.6 billion coins sold during its presale, BlockDAG is gaining traction fast. Early supporters from batch 1 are now eyeing a 2,520% return on their investment. Many are doubling down, taking advantage of this final chance to buy before the token goes public. As BlockDAG prepares for its exchange debut, analysts predict the price will skyrocket, potentially surpassing $1 in no time as more investors gain access. For those who’ve been watching from the sidelines, this is the last opportunity to grab tokens at this incredibly low price. After the presale ends, the price will be determined by the open market, and that $0.0019 deal will be gone for good. Final Thoughts SUI’s price prediction is gaining momentum, while Solana’s long-term outlook continues to impress traders who value network strength over short-term fluctuations. But these two aren’t the only projects stealing the spotlight. BlockDAG is climbing fast in the rankings, and with confirmed exchange listings on the horizon, it’s drawing major attention. The early investors have already scored a 2,520% return, and now latecomers are jumping in, eager to secure their position at the special $0.0019 price before it’s too late. Once BlockDAG hits the open market, these presale deals will be gone for good. If you want to grab one last chance at this incredible pricing, now’s the time!

After enduring four consecutive months of sideways trading and bearish closes, technical indicators and sentiment data are flashing warning signs of an impending correction in the coming weeks. Ethereum Price Crash To $1,526 Incoming According to CoinCodex’s latest Ethereum price prediction, ETH is expected to decline by 16.47% over the coming weeks, potentially reaching $1,526.06 by June 2, 2025. This bearish projection comes amidst a turbulent market cycle in which investor sentiment and confidence have wavered due to rising macroeconomic pressures and unexpected declines in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View Notably, Ethereum’s technical outlook continues to deteriorate as it just wrapped up its fourth consecutive monthly red candle. Cryptorank’s data shows that Ethereum experienced a dip of 1.27% in January, followed by sharper losses of 32.2% in February and 18.4% in March. The downtrend continued into April, with the cryptocurrency closing the month in red with another 1.58% decline. Despite brief intra-month rallies that saw its value rise sharply, Ethereum has consistently failed to sustain gains, closing each month with rising selling pressure and leading the wider market drawdown. CoinCodex’s data further paints a grim picture, highlighting that the top altcoin has recorded 16 green days out of the last 30, signaling unstable market strength. Its price volatility, measured at 6.43%, also reflects a choppy market that lacks clear bullish conviction. Moving forward, CoinCodex not only predicts that Ethereum could break down to $1,526 but also expects a steeper price crash to $1,447.96 by August 1, 2025. This would represent a decline of approximately 20.75% from current market prices. The machine learning algorithm has declared that broader market sentiment for ETH is currently bearish, implying that traders and investors still anticipate further corrections and limited upward momentum in the near term. Overall, this indicates a cautious outlook for Ethereum’s price prospects. CoinCodex Says Now Is A Bad Time To Buy ETH Given its bearish forecast for the Ethereum price, CoinCodex suggests that now may not be the best time to buy Ethereum. Interestingly, while investor sentiment remains cautious, the Fear and Greed index is at 65, reflecting a state of “Greed” and suggesting that market optimism may be outpacing the underlying bearish fundamentals.

Recent reports reveal that a single whale purchased 30,000 ETH tokens worth approximately $54 million. With price momentum fading and macro uncertainty still high, ETH bulls may need to wait for market stabilization and clearer reversal signals before re-entering the market. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the Ethereum price is currently trading at $1,827, marking a yearly decline of over 38%.

Bitcoin and XRP are already legends in their own right. Solana continues expanding across Web3. And Ethereum (ETH) remains central to everything from smart contracts to institutional adoption. But now, one name is quietly joining that elite conversation: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Momentum is rising, and the real question now is whether one of these five tokens could deliver that rare multi-million-dollar return for those positioned early enough. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Catching Fire—and the Early Signs Are Hard to Ignore It’s easy to miss the early signals—until it’s too late. But right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing every indicator of a breakout in motion. Wallet counts are ticking upward fast. Community growth is unfolding naturally, without gimmicks. And on-chain trackers are beginning to highlight MAGACOINFINANCE as one of the few early-stage plays with meaningful activity and traction. This isn’t temporary attention. It’s foundational progress—and those entering now may be catching the inflection point before the next phase begins. Rising Players to Watch: Kaspa, Polkadot, and Their Growing Ecosystems Kaspa is gaining ground with a high-speed, proof-of-work blockDAG model that’s built for real-time payments and scalable infrastructure. Polkadot continues leading the way in cross-chain functionality, giving developers the tools to launch scalable projects across a multi-chain future. Both names have real utility—but when it comes to asymmetric upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for its early strength and rising investor activity. Final Word Could $1.9 million truly be within reach? History suggests that those who moved early on Bitcoin , Solana , Ethereum , and XRP made that a reality.

This metric is designed to gauge how investors feel about the market, and when it rises, it often signals increased trust in the market’s direction. Bitcoin has broken through a key level at 94000 and is closing in on its highest historical price. Movements like this have frequently kicked off strong altcoin rallies. As attention shifts from Bitcoin to other tokens, altcoins begin to climb, with memecoins frequently leading the charge due to their ability to capture hype and generate quick returns. One of the most talked-about potential 1000x tokens for 2025 is gaining momentum as the next altcoin season draws closer. SOLAXY takes aim at Solana’s technical shortcomings Solaxy is designed to improve the overall performance of the Solana blockchain by tackling long-standing issues such as congestion, speed limitations, and limited scalability. Its development roadmap targets sustainable network efficiency and future-proof architecture. While this technical focus resonates with developers and investors alike, another rising star is drawing attention with a unique story, strong utility, and market excitement. That project is Pepeto. PEPETO stands out as a 1000x memecoin candidate combining affordability and real functionality With its presale price set at just $0.000000126, Pepeto offers an early opportunity to join a project that’s gaining serious traction. The upcoming rollout of PepetoSwap, a zero-fee trading platform, along with the Pepeto Exchange, reflects its broader ambition to deliver a working ecosystem. Pepeto is building more than just hype — it is establishing long-term value for holders. A major point of intrigue around Pepeto is its origin story. With a token supply of 420 trillion, identical to Pepe, some speculate a former member of the Pepe team may be behind it. According to the story, Pepe took four core documents but left behind the final two — Technology and Optimization — making his version incomplete. Pepeto, built on Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, retained the full foundation. Pepe assumed he had everything to lead the memecoin space. But missing critical elements left the vision unfinished. PEPETO presale window closing as exchange debut nears Investors can still access $PEPETO tokens at $0.000000126 through pepeto.io. Supported payment methods include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. As PepetoSwap nears deployment and exchange announcements continue, early adopters are set to benefit from staking rewards and exclusive platform utilities. Pepeto is quickly shaping up to be one of the standout memecoins in this cycle. A potential 1000x breakout token for 2025 is gaining momentum as the market gears up for the next altcoin season. SOLAXY focuses on enhancing Solana’s blockchain infrastructure Solaxy is being developed to address Solana’s core challenges, including network congestion, limited scalability, and transaction bottlenecks. Its aim is to create a more robust and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike. While this mission earns it credibility among blockchain enthusiasts, another emerging project is stealing the spotlight with its distinct story, growing utility, and surging interest. That project is Pepeto. PEPETO emerges as a powerful 1000x memecoin backed by utility and early entry potential At just $0.000000126 during its presale, Pepeto provides an opportunity for early supporters to get involved before its exchange listing. It introduces more than meme hype, offering real products like PepetoSwap — a zero-fee trading platform — and the Pepeto Exchange. Together, these features aim to form a complete ecosystem that supports usability and growth. What makes Pepeto even more compelling is its background. With a 420 trillion token supply, matching that of Pepe, speculation continues that a former insider may be involved. According to the project’s story, Pepe stole four symbolic elements but missed the final two — Technology and Optimization — leaving his build incomplete. Pepeto, representing Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, is said to have kept what really mattered. Pepe thought he had taken the foundation for success, but what he left behind could prove to be the most important parts. PEPETO presale nearing completion with launch on the horizon Investors can still join the Pepeto presale at the $0.000000126 price point via pepeto.io. Payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, or card access through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. With its exchange listing approaching and PepetoSwap development advancing, early holders will benefit from staking rewards and full ecosystem participation. Pepeto continues to gain recognition as one of the most exciting upcoming memecoin launches.

Brown University filed an institutional investment manager holdings report with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing it had acquired $5 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Academic Institution Seeks Exposure to Crypto The $5 billion gives the Ivy League school up to 105,000 iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) shares, worth $4,915,050, as of March 31. This holding was stated in its recently listed 13F-HR form. VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matt Sigel pointed out that Brown University is the third academic institution to gain exposure to BTC via an ETF. The other two are Emory, which holds Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF, and the University of Austin. Brown University is gaining exposure to cryptocurrency for the first time. Its 13F-HR filings show other investments in firms like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and investments in different sectors totaling $216 million. BlackRock Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Lead Counterparts The broader spot Bitcoin ETF sector continues to record massive inflows . Launched in January 2024, IBIT is the most prominent spot Bitcoin ETF, with some $56.81 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). In Q1 2025, both BlackRock BTC and Ethereum ETFs recorded declines in inflows. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETF declined approximately 83%. Based on their stellar reputation, the dip for two crypto ETFs, leading their counterparts, was quite notable. However, Juan Leon, Senior Investment Strategist at Bitwise, believes that Q2 2025 will be better than the previous quarter. The Bitcoin ETF niche may record up to $3 billion in inflows in the second quarter . Improved Crypto Regulatory Framework in the US By several standards, the broader cryptocurrency market has seen appreciable growth since Donald Trump won the United States presidential elections. The new administration has introduced policies in favour of the burgeoning sector. The new stance has encouraged several asset management firms to request approval from the SEC to list other crypto ETFs. Various asset managers are filing to launch Dogecoin , Solana, XRP, Litecoin, Sui , Polkadot, and even Aptos ETFs. In the meantime, the Commission has not responded favorably to any of these crypto ETFs that followed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Early participants saw ATOM surge from its modest launch to triple-digit gains, turning quiet believers into headline success stories. That early window didn’t last long, and those who waited too long were forced to chase the rally — often too late to catch meaningful profits. Now, in 2025, the cycle feels eerily familiar, and another project is drawing eyes for the exact same reasons. This time, it’s Qubetics — and if you missed Cosmos, you may not want to sit this one out. Qubetics is quietly climbing its way into becoming the most popular cryptocurrency in today’s presale frenzy. It’s not just about hype; this platform is fusing long-term usability with aggressive early-stage accessibility. The Qubetics presale kicked off in September 2024, and since then, multiple low-priced stages have passed — each one giving early buyers an ROI boost. But don’t think you’ve missed your window completely. Stage 32 is still active, and the price remains affordable. With the mainnet set to go live in Q2 2025, and a 10% price increase every seven days, urgency isn’t just a feeling — it’s baked into the system. This may be your last chance to join the best crypto presale before it breaks out as the most popular cryptocurrency of the year. Qubetics Might Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency You Don’t Want to Miss The earliest supporters of Qubetics had it good — no cap. Some even locked in tokens at just $0.01 during the stealthy whitelist phase back in September 2024. There was no upfront payment required, just early conviction. Fast forward to now, and Qubetics has blown through dozens of stages. While the ultra-low entry points are gone, the project is still in reach — currently in Stage 32, priced at $0.2093 per $TICS. Over $16.6 million has already been raised, 510 million tokens sold, and more than 25,600 token holders have jumped in. Every new stage increases token price by 10%, and the stages are short — just seven days. So yeah, the window is shrinking fast. If you grab $TICS at today’s price and it hits $1 post-launch, you’re already staring at 377.76% ROI. But that’s just the conservative outlook. At $5, the return jumps to 2,288.80%. A $6 value brings 2,766.55%. And if Qubetics reaches $10 — a realistic scenario post-mainnet launch — you’re looking at 4,677.59%. That’s the kind of potential that turns $500 into over $26,000. Just check the presale projections — $500 at today’s price gives you 2,388.80% ROI if $TICS hits $5. Numbers like these are making it one of the most popular cryptocurrency opportunities right now. But it’s not just about numbers — Qubetics is built to solve real problems. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet is already getting attention. Think about this: a freelancer in the Philippines gets paid in USDT, a small business in Germany accepts ETH from global clients, and a digital nomad in Dubai holds SOL and BTC. Qubetics’ wallet unifies all these assets, allowing borderless control without giving up custody. It’s safe, smart, and simplifies cross-chain access for everyday users and businesses alike — this kind of utility is why Qubetics is being tagged as the most popular cryptocurrency project by those who know where the space is heading. And when you combine functionality with a presale this strong, it’s no surprise many are calling it the best crypto presale to join in 2025. Cosmos Proved the Power of Patience — But Only for Early Participants Back in 2019, Cosmos launched its token ATOM at around $0.10 during early phases. Most ignored it. Those who didn’t? They watched as Cosmos became a key player in the interoperability game — a chain that linked chains. By early 2021, ATOM was already climbing fast, and by 2022, it crossed the $40 mark, delivering one of the biggest ROI runs in Layer-1 history. The missed opportunity still stings for many. Cosmos’ focus on cross-chain communication made it indispensable to countless blockchain networks — it wasn’t just another smart contract platform, it was the infrastructure others began relying on. But not everyone got in early. And those who waited until Cosmos made headlines often bought the top or saw weak upside. Today, Cosmos is still a respected name, but its most aggressive gains are in the rear-view. It’s maturing — no longer the scrappy outsider, but now more of a foundation-layer tech. That makes it stable, sure, but also limits its explosive upside. If you’re the kind of participant still chasing those 10x returns, you’re probably not going to get them from ATOM anymore. That’s why newer, utility-driven projects like Qubetics are taking over the spotlight in 2025. This Might Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency You Still Have Time To Join Cosmos changed the game once — but Qubetics might be the one changing it now. The difference? You haven’t missed Qubetics yet. The current stage of the Qubetics presale offers early access at a price still low enough to capture serious upside. Those who locked in early are already on track for huge returns, but the opportunity hasn’t fully disappeared — not yet. With a system that increases prices stage-by-stage and ends each phase in just 7 days, waiting too long might mean watching this one pass you by like Cosmos did. Qubetics isn’t just gaining buzz — it’s gaining traction as the most popular cryptocurrency this cycle because of its real use case, growing community, and structured presale model. The numbers speak for themselves, and if you’re ready to make a move, now’s the time to join this best crypto presale . Because once the mainnet drops and $TICS hits those projected post-launch values, the only thing left to do will be look back and regret missing it — again.

He named five individuals allegedly involved: Christian Alexander Boehnke De Lorraine Elbouef: Head of Finance & Operations at TrueCoin, the former operator of TrueUSD (TUSD) Vincent Chok: CEO of First Digital Trust (FDT) and Legacy Trust Yai Sukonthabhund: Former CEO of Crossbridge, now a partner at Fi… The post Justin Sun Shares Major Update on $500M TUSD Reserve Misappropriation: Calls Out ARIA-FDT Scam and Dubai Banks appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Crypto Scam|First Digital USD (FDUSD)|Justin Sun,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TUSD,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-03 22:45:00

In a post on X after regaining control, the team acknowledged that hackers used the account to promote a contract address. According to the post , the hackers posted the contract address and also sent direct messages to multiple people while also following unknown accounts. The team now asked that users should ignore and delete any DM from its account on May 2. It said: “Please be reminded: TRON DAO will never post contract addresses or send unsolicited DMs. If you received a DM from our account on May 2, please delete it and consider it the work of the attacker.” The post added that the attack is due to a social engineering attack on one of the TRON DAO team members. It noted that the hackers gained control of the member’s account, allowing them to continue contacting other people and offering posts for payments even after the team regained control. TRON DAO is now investigating the incident and has already identified several addresses allegedly connected to the perpetrator on X and Telegram. It added that it has also contacted law enforcement agencies on the matter. OKX debunks Sun’s claims reporting incident Meanwhile, TRON founder and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun asked centralized exchange OKX to freeze funds connected to the address behind the hack, noting that the hackers transferred stolen funds to the wallet on the exchange. In a now-deleted post, Sun said he expected OKX to act quickly to resolve the issue and prevent the hackers from further moving the funds. Although he did not mention the sum stolen, Sun claimed that law enforcement agencies had already sent the freeze notice to OKX’s official mail and TRON had followed the exchange’s procedures for reporting such incidents. However, OKX’s CEO, Star Xu, debunked Sun’s claims, saying that the exchange had not received any official communication to confirm the freezing order. He further asked that Sun share a screenshot of the request from the law enforcement agency. He said: “Dear Mr H.E. Justin Sun, our LE cooperation team just checked the email including spam box, we haven’t received any request related with this case. Can you give us the screenshot to show when the enforcement agency sent the request to us?” It appeared that the comments were instrumental to Sun’s decision to delete his initial post requesting a freeze of the account. Tron network sees upgrade as network lead in generated fees Outside of the recent compromise of its account, TRON is actually in the middle of a positive trend. It recently released a new version of its Kant mainnet upgrade, which improves its compatibility with Ethereum and strengthens network security. According to the announcement, the upgrade made changes to the network at its underlying level and will make it more efficient. Some of the changes include the reconstruction of the contract event system and the optimization of nodes and API performance. The network stated that these upgrades, which are not obvious to everyday users, are necessary to make the blockchain a global settlement layer. Interestingly, the network has seen increased activity and recently reached the milestone of 304 million total addresses. The increased activity also reflected in the network generating the highest fees of all blockchains in April. Tron ranks as the network with most fees generated in April (Source: CryptoRank) According to CryptoRank , TRON recorded $51.7 million in fees last month, while Hyperliquid had $49.2 million. Solana was third with $36.9 million. With its fees, TRON not only surpassed Solana but also pulled more than the combined fees of Ethereum and Bitcoin, which had $21 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Meanwhile, TRX has solidified its position as a top ten crypto asset with a market cap of $23.29 billion.The token is up 4% in the last 30 days and remains a fair performer this year, with only a 3.78% decline year-to-date.

Flare is pulling back after a brief rally, while Worldcoin is still recovering from a 90% crash. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to gain ground with a presale that’s raised an impressive $225 million, selling 19.6 billion BDAG coins. Right now, the $0.0019 entry price remains available, offering a 92.34% discount compared to the current batch 28 price. However, while Flare stalls below resistance and Worldcoin’s price prediction hinges on recovery, BlockDAG is setting itself apart with rare transparency. Its newly launched podcast provides real-time updates on its roadmap and next steps, turning openness into a strategic advantage. In a market full of uncertainty, this level of clarity stands out as a valuable asset for investors. Flare’s Rally Hits a Roadblock at Key Resistance Level Flare (FLR) made a solid breakout from its descending wedge, surging nearly 10% before hitting strong resistance around $0.020. This level, also at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, has kept the price in check as buying pressure slows down. The current price action suggests Flare might be hitting a local top, with a pullback now forming. Short-term support is sitting at $0.01705, which will be key to maintaining the uptrend. If it holds, a move back to $0.02164 could be in play. However, if the support fails, we could see the price dip further toward the $0.015 range. Worldcoin’s Price Struggles After 90% Drop After hitting a high of $11.74 in early 2024, Worldcoin has dropped over 90%, now hovering around $1.10. Despite the sharp decline, some traders are taking another look as altcoin market sentiment begins to shift positively. According to CoinCodex’s latest price prediction, Worldcoin could reach $3.13 by the end of May, assuming current trends continue. While this short-term forecast is supported by a few bullish signs, the longer-term outlook is more uncertain. Predictions for 2025 vary, ranging from under $1 to over $4, and 2030 targets are even more scattered. For now, WLD remains a high-risk, high-reward asset with a lot of potential for both gains and losses. BlockDAG Drops New Podcast: Unmatched Transparency! In a world where much of the crypto space operates behind closed doors, BlockDAG is flipping the script. The team is bringing transparency to the forefront with the launch of an official podcast that gives listeners exclusive access to their thought process, strategies, and upcoming plans. It’s more than just another update; this podcast opens the curtain to BlockDAG’s vision and provides real-time insight into key decisions, including the roadmap, exchange listings, and post-launch ecosystem. This podcast is not your typical technical jargon or impersonal whitepapers. It’s about keeping communication clear and accessible, letting listeners in on the team’s plans and thoughts as they unfold. With so much happening behind the scenes, it’s refreshing to hear directly from the team about what’s coming next and how they’re positioning BlockDAG in the market. And the timing couldn’t be better. BlockDAG’s presale has already surpassed $225 million, with over 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold and more than 170,000 holders onboard. Exchange listings are fast approaching, and the current presale tier is still at an incredible $0.0019, down from the $0.0262 price of batch 28. While other projects may go silent at such a crucial stage, BlockDAG is staying ahead of the curve. With a commitment to openness and ongoing updates, this podcast is the perfect way to stay in the loop, no guessing, no cryptic updates, just real-time, straightforward communication. Final Thoughts While many cryptos are stuck in uncertainty, BlockDAG is charging forward with clarity and momentum. Flare just broke out but is now stalled under resistance at $0.020, and Worldcoin has dropped over 90% from its highs, barely finding its way back. Meanwhile, BlockDAG stands out with a solid roadmap and real traction. The newly launched BlockDAG podcast offers rare transparency in a space where most projects go quiet ahead of major milestones. With over $225 million raised and the $0.0019 entry price still live (down from batch 28’s $0.0262), BlockDAG is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in early. But hurry, this deal won’t last long; once it’s gone, the price will never be this low again!

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

The Stellar (XLM) price is stuck inside a descending channel, facing strong rejection at $0.29. Meanwhile, the SUI price prediction is climbing again after a sharp rebound, with analysts eyeing a $6.25 target if gaming momentum continues. Both have solid narratives, but neither offers early entry. That’s what sets Unstaked apart. It’s not just building another AI token, it’s building an agent economy that could automate work across DAOs, Telegram, and X. From content to community, Unstaked agents will run it all. Unstaked could this redefine redefine work in web3, and UNSD is the ticket in before the 200x wave hits. A $100 buy at batch 1 could already be worth $2700 at listing, and that’s without even counting agent utility. This might be the only early-stage entry among the cryptos to dominate the next cycle. Unstaked Builds the AI Engine for Web3 Work Unstaked is building something much bigger than just a token. It’s laying the foundation for fully autonomous AI agents that can manage entire online communities, handle DAO operations, and drive growth on platforms like X and Telegram, without needing constant human input. These agents can post updates, respond to questions, and engage users 24/7. For creators, founders, and teams, that’s a major shift in how work gets done in Web3. What makes Unstaked stand out is that none of its utility is live yet, on purpose. The platform is holding back deployment until its UNSD token launches, which means every buyer in the presale is getting in before the utility switch flips. The presale is now in stage 2 with prices at $0.006695 and has raised more than $900k so far. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are already looking at a 27x setup. That’s before any price movement from hype or demand kicks in. This positioning makes Unstaked one of the cryptos to dominate the next cycle, especially as AI and automation go mainstream in blockchain. The team isn’t promising vague features later. The AI agents are ready. The launch just unlocks them. Once they go live, demand could spike quickly, especially from DAOs, NFT communities, and DeFi projects looking to scale operations without growing headcount. If you believe that automation will define the next wave of crypto productivity, Unstaked isn’t optional, it’s early. And among the cryptos to dominate, UNSD might be the only one offering a pre-launch shot at the full upside. Will the Next Move in the Stellar (XLM) Price Be a Breakout? The Stellar (XLM) price has been trapped in a descending channel since late December, with lower highs and lows forming a tight downtrend. In April, it dropped to the key $0.22–$0.24 support zone before bouncing 15% to hit $0.2702. Right now, the price is testing the upper channel boundary at $0.28–$0.29, where it has been rejected before. A clean break above that range could shift the trend. Whether the Stellar (XLM) price moves up or down next will depend on volume and broader market momentum. If Bitcoin keeps holding above $94K and volume flows into altcoins, XLM could push toward the $0.30–$0.32 range. But without that breakout, it risks dropping back to retest $0.24. Traders are watching this level closely, because the next rejection or breakout could set the tone for May. Gaming Hype and Rebounds Fuel the SUI Price Prediction After a strong start to 2025, the SUI price prediction is back in focus. The token hit an all-time high of $5.35 in January, crashed to $1.93 in April, then rebounded over 40% to $3.60 by month-end. Much of this momentum is tied to the upcoming launch of SuiPlay 0X1, the first physical gaming device tied to a blockchain network, which could drive a new phase of growth in crypto gaming. Looking ahead, analysts put the SUI price prediction at $6.25 by year-end, with a $10.25 average forecast for 2030. Key drivers include growth in DeFi, stablecoin adoption, and tokenized gaming ecosystems built directly on the Sui network. With strong TVL growth and rising developer activity, Sui is quietly building one of the most active ecosystems among newer Layer-1 chains. Why Unstaked Could Be the Biggest Win of This Cycle The Stellar (XLM) price is facing a tough breakout zone near $0.29, while the SUI price prediction is gaining strength again with renewed momentum from SuiPlay 0X1 and rising DeFi activity. Both are well-positioned, but they’re already listed, and the upside now depends on broad market moves. Unstaked, on the other hand, is still in presale and preparing to flip the switch on its full AI agent ecosystem. It’s not just another token, it’s infrastructure for automating work across DAOs, Telegram, and X. With its cutting-edge tech, Unstaked could redefine work in web3, and the UNSD token is the ticket in before the 200x wave hits. UNSD presale price is now $0.006695 and is set to list at $0.1819, a 27x on price alone. Among all the cryptos to dominate, this might be the last one offering a shot at pre-launch gains.

He warned about the U.S. fiscal deficit , calling it “unsustainable” and highlighting the threat it poses to long-term stability. Despite concerns, Buffett remains optimistic , saying the U.S. is still the best place for investment and praising capitalism’s success. Buffett, who chaired his 60th shareholder meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, shared views on everything from investment strategy to global trade. He emphasized that balanced trade is essential and that the U.S. must remain connected to the world economically. Despite market turbulence and political challenges, he noted, “I would not get discouraged.” Reflecting on America’s economic power, Buffett called himself lucky for being born in the U.S. and stressed the strength and resilience the country has shown through wars, recessions, and historic developments. On investing, he revealed Berkshire nearly spent $10 billion recently and is open to spending even more when the right opportunity arises, admitting, “We're running a business which is very, very, very opportunistic.” He contrasted this with real estate, which he finds slow and less attractive due to complex ownership issues and long negotiations. Buffett also touched on the U.S. energy grid, saying major improvements are needed and comparing the situation to the urgency and innovation seen during World War II. He believes Berkshire’s unique capital and know-how can help reshape it. Regarding market behavior, Buffett downplayed recent volatility, advising investors to keep emotions in check and remember that building wealth doesn’t require taking unnecessary risks: “You only have to get rich once.” On global currencies, he cautioned against owning assets tied to devaluing currencies and hinted at future foreign investments being financed locally. Closing the session, Buffett reaffirmed his belief in capitalism’s success despite its flaws , acknowledging that while it's produced unmatched prosperity, it also carries the risks of turning into a ""massive casino.""",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-03 23:01:04

Bitcoin redefined digital assets as a global store of value. XRP reshaped international payments. Solana became the benchmark for fast, efficient decentralized applications. Now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering the frame with early momentum and rising credibility. With shifting market dynamics, these four projects are not just chasing recovery—they’re setting the stage to break past their all-time highs. And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find.

With the premier cryptocurrency seemingly back on the bullish track, a prominent crypto analyst has emerged with a warning of sorts for BTC investors extremely optimistic about the coin’s future trajectory. BTC Price Could Continue Upward Movement If Support Holds In a May 2 post on the X platform, crypto platform Burak Kesmeci has put forward an interesting outlook on the current Bitcoin setup, identifying a price level that may be critical to the coin’s long-term health. The online pundit dove into BTC’s price structure and its potential future movements based on the Pi Cycle Top indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally The Pi Cycle Top indicator is a forecasting tool that uses two major moving averages (a short-term 111-day moving average and the 350-day moving average) to pinpoint the peaks of Bitcoin bull cycles. Historically, a crossover of the short-term MA above the long-term MA signals a potential price top in the Bitcoin market. As it stands, these two Pi Cycle moving averages are moving in opposite directions, suggesting that the price of Bitcoin might still have some room for upward growth in this cycle. At the same time, the 111-day moving average can act as a support level, often signaling buying opportunities for investors looking to enter the market or double down. As observed in the chart below, the price of Bitcoin tends to bounce back whenever it hits the short-term moving average. According to Kesmeci, this 111-day moving average is hovering around the $91,200 level, which represents the most crucial support zone as the Bitcoin price approaches a close on the weekly timeframe. The on-chain analyst expects the flagship cryptocurrency to continue its current upward price run if it manages multiple weekly closes above the short-term moving average. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,685, reflecting a mere 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency has not replicated its previous week’s red-hot form this week, it did make a strong start to the new month.

Inspired by Ripple’s achievements, Ruvi AI is taking it to the next level with a revolutionary approach that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). Ruvi AI is going to change industries by bringing transparency, efficiency and scalability to the forefront. What Is Ruvi AI and What Does It Offer? Ruvi AI is a forward thinking platform that merges the power of AI with the transparency and decentralization of blockchain. Its mission is to provide practical tools and solutions to real world problems faced by businesses in various industries. Ruvi AI uses blockchain’s secure infrastructure to create a transparent environment for data sharing and uses AI to generate advanced insights and improve decision making. The platform is particularly useful in fields like logistics, finance and supply chain management where predictive analytics, fraud detection and operational optimization are key. By integrating AI directly into its blockchain based ecosystem Ruvi AI stands out from other projects in the crypto space. It’s committed to delivering solutions that improve efficiency and create tangible benefits for businesses worldwide. A Strong Start to the Presale Ruvi AI has got off to a flying start with its presale . Within days of launch the project sold over 10 million tokens and raised over $100,000. This is a testament to the growing confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision and its long term potential. Ruvi AI tokens are available in Phase 1 for just $0.01 per token. But time is of the essence as the price will increase by 50% in Phase 2 so get in early to maximize your returns. Ruvi AI has shown its commitment to progress by launching its beta platform just after the presale started. The beta showcases the platform’s core features including AI powered tools for data analysis and blockchain backed solutions for transparency. This is a major milestone in Ruvi AI’s roadmap and proves they are delivering results. VIP Tier 4 Benefits For serious investors looking for big returns, VIP Tier 4 is the opportunity. This tier requires investors to accumulate 200,000 Ruvi AI tokens which gets them an 80% bonus. For example, by investing $2,000 at the current token price of $0.01, investors will get 200,000 tokens as base. The 80% bonus adds another 160,000 tokens, making it 360,000 tokens. With the listing price already confirmed at $0.07, this would be worth $25,200, 12.6x return. The growth potential is even more obvious when you consider Ruvi AI’s long term target of $1 per token which would value the same investment at $360,000. Leaderboard Rewards for the Community Ruvi AI is going to share its success with its growing community and its Leaderboard rewards program is a proof of that. Designed to reward investors at all levels of contribution the program is accessible and generous to top contributors. For example the Top 10 investors will get 500,000 RUVI tokens. At $0.07 this is worth $35,000. If Ruvi AI reaches its projected token value of $1 this will be worth $500,000. Unbeatable returns for early supporters. Those in the Top 50 contributors will get 250,000 RUVI tokens. At $0.07 this is worth $17,500. But at $1 token value this will be worth $250,000. These rewards show the powerful incentives Ruvi AI is offering to its community so even smaller investors can benefit big time from the platform. Shaping the Future of Blockchain Ruvi AI is quickly becoming a leader in blockchain innovation inspired by Ripple XRP’s pioneering work. Its ability to integrate AI with blockchain sets it apart in a crowded space. By delivering real world solutions to real world problems Ruvi AI is more than just another blockchain project. With its successful presale, great VIP tier program and robust Leaderboard rewards Ruvi AI is open to a global community of investors and tech enthusiasts. Its commitment to transparency, efficiency and scalability makes it a part of the future of blockchain.Get in now.

In a new announcement, Binance says that on May 2nd, it rolled out support for the decentralized omnichain protocol StakeStone ( STO ). “Binance is excited to announce the 17th project on the HODLer Airdrops page – StakeStone, a decentralized omnichain liquidity infrastructure protocol designed to transform how liquidity is acquired, distributed, and utilized across blockchain ecosystems.” The HODLer Airdrops program, which launched in June 2024, rewards those holding Binance’s native asset BNB with crypto based on previous snapshots of their balances. News of the addition caused STO to explode, as it went from a May 2nd low of $0.118 to a peak of $0.204 just hours later. The digital asset has since retraced and is trading for $0.197 at time of writing, a 64.3% increase during the last 24 hours. The project’s whitepaper says it aims to solve the issue of liquidity fragmentation within the digital assets industry. “The fragmentation of liquidity across different chains and protocols across the blockchain ecosystem results in billions of dollars in trapped capital and missed yield opportunities, reducing value creation and ecosystem growth. Users face complex workflows and high costs when moving assets between chains, while protocols struggle to maintain deep liquidity pools. StakeStone serves as a foundational infrastructure layer that enables efficient liquidity distribution across the entire blockchain ecosystem. By providing a standardized framework for cross-chain liquidity management, StakeStone empowers both established and emerging networks to access and deploy capital efficiently.” STO was also a part of Binance Alpha, a wallet feature that started in December 2024. At the time, the crypto exchange said it was “a new platform within the Binance Wallet that shines a spotlight on early-stage crypto projects with the potential to grow within the Web3 ecosystem.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

MANTRA’s price outlook is improving after the platform confirmed a large 300 million coin burn. The move comes after a sharp 90% price decline in April. Traders see this as a positive step to help bring balance to the project. Meanwhile, PEPE has jumped 16.25%, gaining strong momentum as it nears critical resistance. Market watchers are closely tracking whether it can break through upcoming levels. BlockDAG is making waves in the presale scene, with over $225 million raised so far. A limited-time $0.0019 entry price is available until May 13. With Batch 28 priced at $0.0262 and a launch price set at $0.05, BDAG stands out as a top presale option. Keep reading to understand why BlockDAG is attracting attention from over 17,000 miner buyers. MANTRA Forecast Looks Up After Major Burn Announcement The 300 million coin burn from MANTRA is giving its price outlook a much-needed boost. The platform hopes this move can reduce sell pressure and bring long-term growth back on track. This came after a tough drop of 90% earlier this month. As of now, $OM trades near $0.4482. The coin faces resistance at $0.560 and has support at $0.517. If that support breaks, a dip to $0.505 could be next, based on recent price forecasts. While the burn may create short-term optimism, experts believe long-term gains will only come if trading volumes and market conditions improve. PEPE Surges 16.25%, Testing Resistance at $0.00001 The price of PEPE has made a strong move, rising 16.25% this week to $0.000009086. This is a bounce from its recent low of $0.000007841. With trading activity increasing, all eyes are now on the $0.00001 resistance mark. If PEPE clears this level, it could climb to $0.00001050. However, analysts expect some price swings before stability returns. PEPE has followed this pattern before, where big gains were followed by brief corrections. If the resistance breaks cleanly, the coin might be in for another rally phase. PEPE remains one of the top trending coins this week. BlockDAG Raises $225M and Offers $0.0019 Limited Entry Until May 13 BlockDAG has now raised more than $225 million, making it one of the most successful ongoing crypto presales. A major factor behind this rise is a new entry price of just $0.0019, available until May 13. This offer has created major excitement, especially since Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262 with a $0.05 launch target. The project recently held an AMA session revealing new updates. It completed audits by CertiK and Halborn, proving its commitment to security. Users also got a look at the Beta Testnet, which performs twice as fast as the earlier version. A live demo of the X1 miner further confirmed that BlockDAG is delivering real progress, not just ideas. Over 19.7 billion BDAG coins have been sold and 17,269 miners purchased, adding to the project’s growing community. With over $6.9 million in miner sales, interest is clearly strong. Analysts suggest BDAG could hit $1 this year. If that happens, the returns from the current entry point could exceed 2,520%. A major update is also expected once the offer closes, which could push the price even higher. PEPE and MANTRA Show Strength, But BDAG Grabs the Spotlight The MANTRA burn event may help its recovery, but more time is needed for a clearer trend. PEPE has momentum and could move higher if it clears the next resistance. Still, BlockDAG is the name everyone’s watching. With a confirmed $0.0019 offer live until May 13 and massive support already behind it, BDAG looks ready for a strong breakout. The price setup, product demos, and large-scale buying activity all point toward BlockDAG being one of the most watched presales right now.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.3 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

Right now, four assets are catching the attention of strategic investors: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE . While the larger caps hold steady, it’s early-phase entries like MAGACOINFINANCE that could define the next growth wave—and the window may still be open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off Spotting a strong project before the crowd is rare—but MAGACOINFINANCE is offering just that kind of window right now. Wallet growth is consistent. Community engagement is rising without artificial spikes. Developer updates are arriving on time, and early-stage capital is quietly moving in before mainstream exposure. There’s no shortcut being taken—just disciplined execution and strategic growth. For investors seeking uninflated value and authentic early-stage positioning, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the final high-upside opportunities in this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano continues to lead with its research-driven approach to secure smart contract deployment and sustainability. NEAR Protocol is accelerating adoption through its developer-friendly design and seamless onboarding for dApp builders. Kaspa appeals to performance-focused users with its proof-of-work blockDAG model—offering speed, scalability, and security. Arbitrum is dominating the Ethereum Layer-2 space, delivering efficient scaling and lower gas costs for decentralized applications. While each of these platforms is building critical infrastructure, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early-stage, undervalued momentum that is increasingly rare. Final Word Can $650 really become $800K ? For those who’ve studied crypto cycles, it’s clear: timing and early conviction matter. XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum offer enduring strength. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM offers discovery-phase growth—and that’s exactly where major wealth shifts have historically begun.

Analysts suggest that if ADA maintains its current momentum, it could rally toward $0.94. Dogecoin (DOGE), trading around $0.18, has experienced a 12.26% increase over the last week. While both ADA and DOGE exhibit potential for growth, investors are also turning their attention to emerging token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction in the crypto community. The project is currently in Phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. The price of MUTM token will climb to $0.03 during Phase 5 locking in a 20% ROI for phase 4 buyers. From its launch the project has managed to secure 9300 investors and raise more than $7.4 million. Phase 4 has already sold out over 50% of it. Investors should enter now before its over. Cardano (ADA) Struggles With Key Support at $0.65 Amid Market Correction Cardano (ADA) has corrected heavily, falling to a key support level of $0.65. This followed a general market decline that affected most cryptocurrencies. Despite the bearish momentum, some indication of possible recovery is beginning to surface. The daily time frame MACD indicator has recorded a bullish crossover, suggesting that the buying pressure is returning. If ADA remains firm at $0.65 and continues to show this resilience, it can cause a reversal to resistance levels of $0.70 and $0.80. Any failure to maintain the $0.65 level support can, however, cause further losses. Investors are also eyeing other near-future projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are popular in the present market situation. Dogecoin Targets $0.27 Break on Meme Coin Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 12% this week and stands at $0.18 currently, with analysts looking for a breakout point of $0.27. The move here is fueled by robust meme coin sentiment, but DOGE still grapples with high resistance. Even though potentially, even younger projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are drawing upside-focused investors. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance attracts major investor interest through its unique method of decentralized financing. Users can benefit from the combined Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) framework which creates a dual-lending system that provides users with adaptive control together with improved efficiency. The lending process in P2C is fully managed by smart contracts. The P2P model on the other hand gives users complete control over their loan management which provides increased privacy alongside self-directed autonomy. Mutuum Finance provides a high-yield DeFi platform through its adaptive operations alongside liquidity provider returns exceeding 10% which makes it both profitable and easy to use. Boosting Adoption Through a $100K Community Giveaway Mutuum Finance conducts a prize drive offering $100K by distributing ten $10K Mutuum Finance tokens to investors. Through motivational approaches Mutuum Finance attracts existing users to retain them while simultaneously growing their community by increasing participant numbers and membership numbers. The shift operates as a strategic enhancement that raises platform visibility through the growth of authentic user base. Security is built into Mutuum Finance by design. The system offers a fully collateralized Ethereum-backed USD-pegged stablecoin to offer long-term stability and avoid volatility common in algorithmic designs. Regular smart contract audits and offering financial transparency build trust with users and counter common vulnerabilities for DeFi protocols. In this setup, Mutuum Finance offers a sensible and trustworthy option for serious long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) claims top place in the cryptocurrency market as it advances beside ADA and DOGE. The selling rate of Phase 4 at MUTM exceeds 50% while the fundraising target surpasses $7.4M and gathers 9,300+ investors following its accelerated pace. Act now and don’t miss the run-up.

While each asset brings its own strengths, market participants are growing cautious amid mixed technical signals — and many are turning their focus to emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE for more aggressive upside potential. Ethereum Holds Above $1,830, But Struggles for Direction Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,832.06 , with a +0.48% move in the past hour, but down -0.27% over the last 24 hours. Its 7-day performance is slightly positive at +2.01% , showing modest resilience. Despite its role as the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum’s growth has slowed. With major upgrades priced in and gas fees still an issue, investors are beginning to question how much more upside remains in the short term. ETH remains a long-term pillar of DeFi, but near-term traders are now seeking sharper ROI plays. Cardano Slips Under Pressure at $0.7031 Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.7031 , gaining +0.99% in the last hour but falling -0.59% in 24 hours and -1.09% for the week. Despite ADA’s loyal base and consistent ecosystem upgrades, price action has failed to reflect long-term enthusiasm. With resistance forming near $0.72 and a lack of high-volume buying, ADA’s sideways action may continue unless a significant technical breakout occurs. Many traders are rotating capital into underexposed alternatives with higher growth ceilings. Shiba Inu Drops Sharply Despite Meme Coin Buzz SHIB is trading at $0.00001324 , with a +0.73% hourly bump, but down -1.50% over 24 hours and a steeper -7.39% on the 7-day chart. Shiba Inu remains one of the most talked-about meme tokens, but its recent performance suggests fading interest from short-term holders. With no major catalyst on the horizon and momentum waning, SHIB is under pressure as traders begin exploring fundamentally stronger microcaps. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Strength as Altcoin Rotation Intensifies While larger caps stall, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favored early-stage target among investors looking for long-term upside. Still under the radar, the project is gaining recognition for its smart release structure, clean tokenomics, and a community-led approach that avoids VC dominance. The project’s growth potential is drawing comparisons to early-stage tokens that later surged 30x or more. Forecasts point to 30x upside from current levels, with early entry still available through its official site. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its positioning before broader exchange exposure. With the crypto cycle entering a new phase and capital rotating out of fatigued majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum as a fresh, institutional play. With institutional-grade branding, real-time traction, and a growing community of over 14,000 holders, the project is quickly climbing up the 2025 altcoin watchlist.

After an extensive price correction that began in December 2024, the prominent altcoin may have finally found some bullish momentum to turn around investors’ fortunes. Interestingly, prominent crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has shed some positive light on this development. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Long-Legged Doji On Monthly Chart – Reversal Or Just A Pause? Ethereum Retail Investor Inflows Support Bullish Case In an X post on May 2, Burak Kesmeci postulates that Ethereum may be entering a prolonged price uptrend based on the short-term holders’ activity. According to the seasoned analyst, the number of ETH short-term holders or traders is headed for a particular threshold that historically signifies a long-term price rally. In the ETH market, short-term holders refer to wallets or addresses that have recently acquired ETH, usually less than 155 days. These investors are usually sensitive to market trends and price volatility, often driven by speculation and quick profit-taking rather than long-term conviction. Typically, a rising number of short-term investors indicates renewed market interest due to new market entrants. However, Kesmeci states that ETH short-term holders, presently at 3.92 million, must cross above 4 million to suggest the ETH market possesses sufficient bullish strength for a robust uptrend. Notably, Ethereum produced strong price rallies when STH numbers previously rose above 4 million, as seen in 2022 and 2024. Kesmeci states that as long as ETH short-term holders remain below this threshold, it may reflect insufficient market demand to sustain Ethereum’s current rally. Meanwhile, the number of Ethereum long-term holders has now reached 104.24 million, indicating a strong market confidence in the asset’s price appreciation prospects. A rise in LTH generally occurs due to coin maturation as short-term holders opt against selling for over 155 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confirmed Local Bottom As All Indicators Flash Bullish, Where’s Price Headed? Ethereum SMA 365 Presents Another Barrier Alongside developments in the short-term holders cohort, Burak Kesmeci notes that Ethereum remains far below its 365-day simple moving average (SMA 365), suggesting that market bulls are yet to take full control of the market. As the name implies, the SMA 365 measures the average closing price over the last 365 days. It is used to indicate price trends and often acts as a resistance in bearish markets or support in bullish markets. Despite recent market gains, ETH must move above its SMA 365 at $2,849 to confirm any intent of a strong uptrend. At press time, Ethereum trades at $1,835, reflecting a price decline of 0.80% in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 15.01%.

With top names like BlockDAG, Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos bringing unique strengths to the table, early entries could make a big difference in 2025. Whether it’s high speed, smart contracts, or presale strength, each project has something worth noting. Here’s a look at the top four crypto names that are catching attention right now across the market. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Best Crypto to Buy Now Before Exchange Listings BlockDAG has shaken up the crypto scene with its aggressive presale model, turning it into the best crypto to buy now. Currently in Batch 28, BlockDAG has raised over $224 million and sold more than 19.7 billion coins. The price is set to rise to $0.0262 soon, offering a 2,520% gain from its first batch. But right now, there’s a limited-time entry at just $0.0019, available until May 13. This steep discount is sparking a new wave of buyers eager to catch early gains. BlockDAG has also introduced Buyer Battles, a feature that allows the day’s top buyer to win any unsold BDAG from the 25 million daily allocation. If all coins aren’t sold in 24 hours, the leader takes the rest, creating daily action and extra rewards. Beyond price, BlockDAG’s milestones are making waves: over $6.9 million in miner sales and 17,269 units sold show growing interest in the project’s mining ecosystem. The upcoming launch price is fixed at $0.05, adding more incentive to get in early. With listings around the corner, BlockDAG stands out as a top presale performer and a strong candidate for those searching for the best crypto to buy now. Ethereum (ETH): Still Among the Best Crypto to Buy Now Ethereum remains one of the best crypto to buy now, backed by years of performance and trust. While network congestion and gas fees have caused concerns, Ethereum’s focus on Layer 2 upgrades continues to gain traction. These improvements are helping ETH maintain dominance in areas like DeFi and NFTs. Many of the world’s leading crypto applications still rely on Ethereum. As blockchain adoption grows, ETH’s central role in the ecosystem makes it a smart choice. Institutions are also showing increased interest, which further supports its position. With Ethereum staying strong through multiple market cycles, it’s clear why ETH remains a go-to option for those scanning the list of best crypto to buy now. The project’s evolution signals more growth ahead, especially as the next bull run takes shape. Solana (SOL): A Fast Mover Among the Best Crypto to Buy Now Solana has become a favorite among developers and NFT creators due to its unmatched speed and low costs. These strengths have helped Solana re-enter conversations about the best crypto to buy now. It has bounced back from earlier issues with stronger performance and better network reliability. Many projects are launching on Solana, increasing user activity and catching the eye of institutions. The chain’s focus on efficiency and speed makes it attractive to new users and builders looking for alternatives to Ethereum. As Solana’s daily volume and ecosystem activity continue to rise, it’s clear this platform has more room to grow. With the market shifting and projects launching rapidly, SOL makes a strong case for those hunting the best crypto to buy now before prices move higher. Aptos (APT): A Fresh Entry Among the Best Crypto to Buy Now Aptos is new but already considered one of the best crypto to buy now, especially for those eyeing the next big thing. Created by former Meta developers, Aptos stands out for its strong focus on scalability and top-level security. These features give it a solid base to grow quickly as adoption picks up. Big backing from venture firms and a strong developer community have helped Aptos take off fast. The project has already built a network of builders focused on creating secure, scalable applications on its platform. Even though it’s still early days for Aptos, it’s showing signs of real progress. With many new projects already launching on the network, APT might become a major force. If you’re scanning the market for the best crypto to buy now with long-term potential, Aptos is one to watch closely. Final Thoughts The market is moving fast, and the best crypto to buy now could shift quickly. But right now, these four projects are leading the pack. BlockDAG, with its $224M+ raise and discounted $0.0019 price, gives early access before the $0.05 launch. Ethereum’s strong foundation, Solana’s lightning speed, and Aptos’s solid tech all point to long-term value. Don’t miss the opportunity to explore these coins while they’re still in prime position for growth. Each one offers a unique edge that makes it a top contender in today’s market.

Right now, that formula may be activating again—with Ethereum , MAGACOINFINANCE , Solana , and Bitcoin all flashing signs of renewed strength. While established leaders like Bitcoin and Solana grab the spotlight, some investors are focused on a rising contender: MAGACOINFINANCE . And the window to enter early might be closing fast. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving Faster Than the Market Realizes Smart investors watch for subtle but steady signals—and MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering exactly that. Wallet numbers are increasing rapidly. The community is expanding without artificial hype. And developer updates are landing on schedule, building consistent trust. Momentum isn’t speculative anymore—it’s structural and strengthening. This setup feels familiar: similar to early Bitcoin cycles and Solana’s breakout stages. Those who enter now could find themselves ahead of the curve—before the broader market arrives. Accelerating Momentum: Watch These Additional Movers Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the smart contract world, though network congestion and high fees keep alternative chains and Layer-2s in focus. Polygon remains a leader in Ethereum scaling, with major partnerships and real-world integrations driving continued growth. Tron still commands impressive on-chain volume, particularly across stablecoin and international payment flows. Arbitrum leads Ethereum Layer-2 scaling efforts, attracting dApp developers who demand lower fees and higher performance. All are relevant—but when it comes to pure early discovery opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE stands apart with clear upside potential. Final Word Could $1,000 realistically become $3 million ? In the crypto world, it has happened before—with the right project at the right moment. With Bitcoin , Solana , and Ethereum showing strength, and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM building at speed, the ingredients are here for another transformative opportunity.

Market giants like XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , TRON (TRX) , and Bitcoin (BTC) are showing strength, but a fast-moving altcoin, MAGACOINFINANCE , is becoming harder to ignore. With growing attention from early-stage investors, the question is now being asked: which asset will define 2025’s biggest breakout? MAGACOINFINANCE – The Breakout Project Gaining Real Momentum MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just appearing in headlines—it’s becoming the conversation. With over $7.8 million raised , soaring community numbers, and rising influencer support, this altcoin is evolving into one of 2025’s top discovery-phase plays. While others have peaked, MAGACOINFINANCE is still early. It’s backed by a high-engagement user base, clear branding, and a smart rollout strategy. Analysts and traders alike are watching closely, noting its high upside positioning as the listing price of $0.007 looms.

XRP: Positioned for an Institutional Breakout Current Price: $2.24 2025 Forecast: $3.10 – $5.81 XRP’s institutional interest is climbing rapidly, driven by the possibility of U.S. ETF approvals and expanding use in cross-border transactions. Legal clarity and strategic partnerships position XRP as a frontrunner in regulated digital finance. Ethereum (ETH): Scaling with Network Upgrades Current Price: $1,729 2025 Forecast: $3,174 average, up to $10,000 Ethereum continues to dominate as the foundation of decentralized applications. Its ongoing network upgrades and staking model have brought new scalability and efficiency, setting the stage for institutional inflows via potential spot ETH ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC): Leading the Market with Renewed Strength Current Price: ~$95,000 2025 Forecast: Targets suggest a move to $132,000 by mid-year Bitcoin remains the macro anchor of the crypto market. Following a 14.5% rise in April , analysts project continued momentum as ETF inflows, institutional demand, and increasing scarcity drive long-term value. TRON (TRX): Advancing Utility in DeFi Current Price: $0.2457 2025 Forecast: $0.259 by mid-year TRON is steadily advancing with gas-free transactions, making it a reliable player in decentralized finance and payments—particularly in emerging markets. Its consistent transaction volume keeps it relevant in a rapidly evolving space. Final Thoughts XRP, Ethereum, TRON, and Bitcoin represent strong foundations and long-term utility. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers something different—early-stage momentum, structured execution, and untapped potential. For those looking to diversify into the next big altcoin, the window may not stay open long.

Bittensor (TAO) and XRP are gaining attention through their unique paths. TAO drives forward with AI-integrated functionality and a reward-based system, while XRP draws in institutional players and strengthens its futures market appeal. Yet, while both assets show potential, Cold Wallet takes a more grounded and methodical path. It is not just forecasting growth, it is actively building for it. With zero-knowledge technology already integrated, a functional MVP on track for Q3 2025, and a team known for reliable delivery, Cold Wallet is making steady progress. For those identifying the top crypto to buy 2025, it offers not hype, but tangible momentum. Can Bittensor (TAO) Beat Market Trends? 2025 Outlook The Bittensor (TAO) prediction for 2025 opens up thoughtful discussions about AI-driven blockchains in fluctuating markets. Current projections suggest TAO could range between $287 and $407 by the end of 2025, even if broader market enthusiasm fades. This expected resilience comes from TAO’s unique proof-of-intelligence model. Contributors earn through active participation, encouraging steady demand. Although short-term price swings are likely, its architecture supports continuous engagement through valuable machine learning tasks. Analysts also highlight that if TAO maintains user activity and attracts miners, a stable price between $300 and $350 could become a realistic support level. The forecast suggests TAO may offer sustainability beyond simple market speculation, positioning it as a strong contender in the search for the top crypto to buy. XRP Builds Momentum Toward $3 with Institutional Backing XRP has recently climbed to $2.11, marking a 1.54 percent increase and reinforcing its ability to hold above key support at $2.00. Meanwhile, the upcoming introduction of XRP futures trading on Coinbase Derivatives is poised to encourage greater institutional involvement and market liquidity. On the technical side, indicators like MACD and RSI point to growing bullish sentiment. This has sparked predictions of a potential rise toward $3.00, as buying interest remains firm. Still, market risks exist. Support could falter at $2.00, with possible drops to $1.96 or even $1.62 if volatility picks up. However, the increase in open interest, now at $3.24 billion, and the decline in liquidation rates suggest strengthening confidence among traders. These combined factors form a more secure environment, potentially paving the way for steady upward price movement. From Roadmap to Reality: How Cold Wallet Is Already Delivering In a market filled with lofty ambitions and stalled projects, Cold Wallet stands out as a rare example of real progress. Unlike many tokens that stay trapped in early development stages, Cold Wallet already operates on zero-knowledge infrastructure and has a working MVP slated for Q3 2025. Cold Wallet’s focus has always been delivery over marketing buzz. Its architecture is complete, the brand has been refreshed, and the path toward multi-phase expansion is clear. Privacy-centric features such as private balances and anonymous transactions are no longer concepts, but fully integrated functions. Additionally, $CWT, the network’s native coin, plays a vital role. It supports governance, unlocks core features, and drives ecosystem alignment. Presently, $CWT is available in presale stage 2 at only $0.00714 per token, significantly below its projected launch price of $0.3571. This pricing highlights its potential for substantial returns, making it an appealing option for those seeking the top crypto to buy 2025 . Cold Wallet offers more than promises. It offers confirmed progress, privacy-focused design, and scheduled exchange listings. Early participants are not chasing dreams; they are aligning with a project already in forward motion. Key Takeaways Speculation attracts attention, but steady execution builds trust. While Bittensor advances AI-powered blockchain technology and XRP strengthens its institutional presence, Cold Wallet takes a practical approach. It transforms planned ideas into active, functioning products. Priced at just $0.00714 during presale with a launch target of $0.3571, Cold Wallet offers a clear roadmap toward success. Privacy, usability, and infrastructure are not distant goals, but realities being shaped right now. For anyone considering the top crypto to buy 2025, Cold Wallet presents itself as a strong option based on achievements, not empty potential.

Leading this shift is Unstaked , a decentralized platform designed to let AI agents eventually support online communities through scalable automation. With its presale gaining attention in May, Unstaked is positioning itself as a major project in the AI crypto space, drawing interest from early buyers who are watching its development closely. This breakdown explains why Unstaked is gaining momentum, how AI agents are reshaping digital systems, and why it could become one of the most strategic presale options of 2025. AI Agents Gain Global Traction While Crypto Opens the Next Channel AI agents are becoming more than just a trend; they represent a growing shift in automation across sectors. These autonomous systems are influencing everything from content creation to operations. A recent report by McKinsey estimates that AI could contribute up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy, with AI agents playing key roles in automating tasks across multiple industries. At the same time, major venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital and a16z are investing heavily in AI agent technologies like LangChain and AutoGPT-based projects. Companies like OpenAI are advancing tools like “AutoGPT” to support bots that can make decisions and perform tasks independently. However, most of these platforms remain centralized, limiting transparency. Unstaked addresses this by applying blockchain tools to AI agent models, combining crypto incentives with decentralized infrastructure. How Unstaked Sets Itself Apart in the AI Crypto Trend Unstaked introduces a decentralized foundation for AI agents, allowing users to deploy bots that contribute to online community growth without relying on central platforms. It merges blockchain verification with generative AI, ensuring that outputs from these agents are trackable and secured on-chain. Key features include: Autonomous Community Development: AI agents created through Unstaked are expected to support growth functions such as content moderation, community engagement, and digital coordination. Decentralized Operation: Unstaked’s agents will use a node-based framework rather than central servers, improving transparency and reducing risk of control by single entities. Integrated Token Model: These AI agents are designed to earn UNSD tokens when they complete community-oriented tasks, creating an incentive-driven ecosystem. This approach places Unstaked at the intersection of two growing fields: artificial intelligence and decentralized infrastructure. As the AI crypto market matures, platforms like Unstaked may offer a different way forward by focusing on open, measurable use cases. Unstaked Presale Gains Momentum as AI Narrative Grows Unstaked’s presale is drawing strong interest in May, especially as it moves into Stage 2 with UNSD tokens now priced at $0.006695. Early participants are taking notice due to rising attention on AI crypto projects and the continued expansion of decentralized applications in 2025. Analysts suggest AI-linked crypto assets could outperform other sectors this year, particularly those tied to real-world use. CoinTelegraph recently identified the AI and crypto combination as one of the leading investment themes, and Unstaked’s structure is seen as aligned with this shift. The Unstaked presale is already generating wide discussion in crypto spaces like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. Search traffic for “Unstaked AI crypto” is climbing, and early reports show large holders acquiring presale allocations, adding to market expectations for future movement. Given its accessible pricing and growing visibility, many see Unstaked as a candidate for strong performance among AI-linked crypto assets in 2025. Early Unstaked Entry Could Offer Strategic Advantage Timing is critical in crypto cycles. Projects that align with early trends often lead in performance during market surges. For Unstaked, these factors stand out: Narrative Strength: Decentralized AI agents are a key focus for investors in 2025. Momentum Signals: Social media traction and presale volumes suggest building interest. Tech Readiness: The platform combines blockchain transparency with future AI automation, creating a foundation for scalable use. Entry-Level Pricing: At $0.006695, the presale offers a more accessible point than many AI tokens that have already reached higher post-launch prices. Examples like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat show that early-stage community-focused crypto efforts can perform well when demand, use case, and market attention align. Unstaked’s model, centered on AI agents built for community tasks, brings a functional element to that pattern. With only a limited number of UNSD tokens available in presale, attention may continue to increase as the listing date approaches. Why Unstaked Is Positioned as a Key AI Crypto in 2025 Unstaked is not just following the current AI trend in crypto, it aims to shape part of its direction. By creating an AI agent platform designed for decentralized systems, the project reflects both wider market themes and specific functionality needs. Its crypto presale activity is increasing in May, with early token pricing, clear objectives, and a plan that addresses current limitations in centralized AI structures.

These live projects offer early entry into sectors like AI, gaming, and privacy tech. Some focus on utility, while others tap into pop culture or commerce trends. But all share one thing: strong early engagement. Here are six of the most talked-about names making headlines in the 2025 crypto presale list. BlockDAG: $225M Raised and Still Going Strong BlockDAG leads the 2025 crypto presale list with over $225 million raised and more than 19.7 billion coins sold. With Batch 28 priced at $0.0262 and a confirmed launch price of $0.05, it offers a profit margin of 2,520%. However, a limited-time price of $0.0019 is available until May 13, giving new buyers a unique edge. Miner sales are also surging, crossing $6.9 million from 17,269 units sold. The project’s Buyer Battles adds more appeal, 25 million BDAG coins are up for grabs daily, and any unsold amount goes to the top buyer. This competition format has driven community participation sharply. By blending affordability, urgency, and gamified rewards, BlockDAG has claimed a prime spot on the crypto presale list and is proving hard to ignore. Web3 ai: Artificial Intelligence Tools Take Center Stage Web3 ai brings artificial intelligence to the crypto presale list. It features twelve products including portfolio optimizers, yield farming advisors, scam detectors, and more. These tools are powered by advanced AI systems built on machine learning, NLP, and deep neural networks. The platform suits both new and experienced users looking for automated insights. Its $WAI coin unlocks platform services, governance roles, and staking rewards. The project also includes subscription discounts, token burns, and staking bonuses. This mix of tech and practical incentives explains why Web3 ai stands out on today’s crypto presale list. Dragoin: Fusing Blockchain Gaming with Fantasy Worlds Dragoin ($DDGN) combines fantasy, gaming, and blockchain to earn its place on the crypto presale list. Inspired by dragon lore and epic battles, Dragoin offers a Telegram-based game with 25 levels. Players earn $DDGN as they complete stages, merging play-to-earn mechanics with engaging storytelling. Its presale structure spans 25 phases, with each stage increasing in price. Unsold tokens are burned, adding rarity and encouraging early entry. With plans for staking, governance features, and ecosystem expansion, Dragoin’s interactive format is drawing attention across the crypto presale list. Unstaked: AI Bots Powering Community Growth Unstaked enters the crypto presale list with a focus on AI-driven community tools. Through the $UNSD coin, users can deploy bots that write content, reply to users, and grow communities across Telegram and X. All actions are tracked by a Proof of Intelligence mechanism on-chain. Unlike passive projects, Unstaked delivers tangible outcomes. Its public presale has no private allocations, ensuring fairness. Governance is also community-based, giving participants a voice in the future of the platform. As a utility-first project, Unstaked is reshaping what’s expected from the crypto presale list. Cold Wallet: Privacy-First Features for Secure Storag Cold Wallet secures a spot on the crypto presale list with its focus on privacy-first storage. Unlike hot wallets, Cold Wallet offers always-on access with offline-grade security. Using zero-knowledge proofs, it keeps balances and transactions completely hidden. Its $CWT coin supports access to advanced tools like hidden balances, anonymous trading, and private dApps. Users can also join governance and earn loyalty perks. For privacy-conscious users scanning the crypto presale list, Cold Wallet delivers where it matters most. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing Online Commerce in Web3 Web3Bay finishes the crypto presale list with its decentralized marketplace solution. It supports Web3-friendly trading, low fees, and NFT support. Users can trade freely without centralized controls. AI tools also help sellers fine-tune their strategies. With the $WBAY coin, users access features, governance, and loyalty rewards. It’s designed for multi-chain use and aims to scale with the growing demand for decentralized commerce. For users watching the 2025 crypto presale list closely, Web3Bay could be an early-stage gem. Key Takeaways Each project on this crypto presale lis t taps into different needs, be it privacy, automation, gaming, or scalability. But what they share is momentum. With BlockDAG’s $225 million milestone leading the way and others following with strong use cases, this list marks the ones to watch before presales close.

Analysts like DonAlt and Peter Brandt see more upside ahead, though trading volume remains uncertain. XRP is also focused as CME prepares to launch XRP futures, adding momentum to its market activity. While these tokens make headlines, Web3 ai ($WAI) is quietly gaining ground. Its system processes live data, retrains models, and adjusts real-time strategies. With a presale price of $0.0003 and a confirmed listing at $0.005242, Web3 ai is shaping up as one of the strongest crypto presale opportunities for 2025. Solana’s Rebound Pushes Past $150 Mark Solana (SOL) has bounced back, climbing from $145.66 to above $150. This marks a 14% weekly gain after weeks of struggle. However, trading volume is still over 30% lower than usual. It signals that while price is up, many traders remain cautious. Crypto analyst DonAlt believes Solana could soon test the $200 level, partly due to potential tariff benefits in the U.S. Peter Brandt adds that Solana might even outperform Ethereum over time. This optimism is helping drive interest. Meanwhile, ETF applications focused on Solana are underway, drawing institutional eyes to the token. Still, sustained price action above $150 is needed to confirm an actual trend reversal. Solana’s rebound is encouraging, but the broader market remains watchful. XRP Futures on CME Set for May 19 Launch CME Group, the top global futures exchange, plans to introduce XRP futures on May 19, 2025, pending approval. This will give traders a new way to engage with XRP without owning it, and it is expected to increase institutional interest in the asset. Right now, XRP trades at around $2.19, close to the $2.22 breakout mark. If it crosses that level, analysts believe XRP could jump to $2.74, signaling a possible 25% price increase. Current support holds at $2.17. This move follows Ripple’s recent settlement with the SEC, which had accused it of offering unregistered securities. That legal clarity strengthens XRP’s position and adds momentum. With legal uncertainty resolved and futures launching soon, XRP’s future is getting a serious boost. Web3 ai: AI-Powered Crypto Presale Promising 1747% ROI Crypto and AI are moving fast, and Web3 ai is right in step. Instead of offering one or two tools, it brings everything together into a single AI-driven platform. From real-time charts and price alerts to sentiment analysis and scam detection, Web3 ai helps users react quickly and stay informed.

It tracks wallet activity, flags risk, and runs automated responses to sudden market shifts. No more switching between apps. Web3 ai’s presale is now live with its $WAI token priced at just $0.0003.

Built for everyone from crypto newbies to seasoned traders, the platform includes 12 real-time tools that work together. Whether you want to stay alert, manage risks, or trade smarter, Web3 ai helps you act ahead of the crowd; not after. Why Web3 ai Leads the Best Presale Crypto 2025 List Solana’s push above $150 shows its recovery has legs, and XRP’s futures debut on CME could trigger a fresh wave of activity. These are strong developments, but new opportunities are also emerging fast. Web3 ai is building something bigger than hype. With a confirmed listing price of $0.005242 and a starting price of $0.0003, its 1747% ROI potential makes it the best presale crypto 2025 .

Back in the day, Ethereum revolutionized smart contracts, Solana introduced lightning-fast transactions, and Polygon addressed Ethereum’s scaling issues. Now, the market is shifting once again, and the real question is—what’s next? Three crypto projects are leading the charge with real innovation. Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with its real-world asset tokenization marketplace and TICSScan blockchain explorer, Immutable X is dominating the NFT gaming sector, and Quant is pushing cross-chain financial transactions to new heights. But which one holds the best upside for early participants? If you’re hunting for the top cryptos to join now , let’s break down why Qubetics, Immutable X, and Quant are set to take over in 2025! Qubetics: Real-World Asset Tokenization and Blockchain Transparency Blockchain technology has transformed finance, but the next step is bridging the gap between digital assets and real-world value. That’s exactly what Qubetics is doing by introducing a tokenized marketplace for real-world assets (RWAs). Imagine fractionalized ownership of real estate, stocks, commodities, and even fine art—tradable 24/7 without the restrictions of traditional finance. This is a game-changer. A retail investor who could never afford an entire $1M rental property can now buy fractional shares of a tokenized home and earn passive income from rental revenue. Businesses can secure loans by collateralizing tokenized assets, unlocking new liquidity sources. Institutional investors can trade assets instantly across blockchains without the delays and fees associated with legacy banking. But Qubetics isn’t stopping there. It has also launched TICSScan, its native blockchain explorer that provides unmatched transparency, efficiency, and real-time data for validators, delegators, and smart contract developers. This allows anyone to track transactions, analyze blockchain performance, and verify contract security with ease. Qubetics Presale: Your Last Chance Before Prices Surge The Qubetics presale is entering an exciting new chapter with Stage 32 now live, offering $TICS tokens at a price of $0.2093. With more than $16.6 million raised, over 510 million tokens sold, and a growing community of 25,600+ token holders, Qubetics is proving itself as one of the most dynamic and well-received presales in the Web3 space. Each stage of the presale lasts just 7 days, with a 10% price hike at the end of every week—making timing a crucial factor for early adopters looking to lock in the best entry point before the next price bump. At the current price, the ROI projections are eye-popping. A simple $100 allocation could return $477 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale—a 377.76% return. But the real upside kicks in with long-term holding: if $TICS hits $5, the return skyrockets to 2,288.80%, and at $15, that $100 grows into $7,166.39, marking a staggering 7,066.39% ROI. With Qubetics aiming to revolutionize real-world asset tokenization and interoperability through its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE, many community members see this as more than a token—it’s an infrastructure play poised for explosive growth post-mainnet launch in Q2 2025. For anyone scouting the best crypto presale with serious upside and real-world utility, Qubetics stands out as a frontrunner. The numbers speak for themselves, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. Immutable X: The Future of NFT Gaming and Zero-Gas Transactions While Qubetics is redefining real-world asset tokenization, Immutable X is taking NFT gaming to a new level. As the leading Layer 2 solution for Ethereum NFTs, Immutable X eliminates gas fees while maintaining full security and decentralization. Developers love it. Major gaming titles like Gods Unchained, Illuvium, and Guild of Guardians have already adopted Immutable X to avoid Ethereum’s expensive fees while maintaining true digital ownership. One of Immutable X’s biggest innovations is batch minting—allowing developers to create millions of NFTs instantly without congestion issues. This is a game-changer for Web3 gaming and the metaverse. As the demand for high-performance, zero-fee NFTs grows, Immutable X is positioned for massive adoption in 2025. However, unlike Qubetics, Immutable X’s focus remains solely on NFTs, limiting its use cases. Quant: The Backbone of Institutional Blockchain Adoption While Immutable X dominates NFTs, Quant is revolutionizing cross-chain transactions for financial institutions. Quant’s Overledger technology allows banks, enterprises, and governments to integrate blockchain without replacing existing financial infrastructure. Think of it as the bridge between old-school finance and Web3. For example, central banks testing digital currencies (CBDCs) are leveraging Quant’s technology to connect with other global payment systems. Meanwhile, financial giants like Oracle and LACChain have partnered with Quant for cross-border transactions and smart contract automation. However, Quant’s enterprise-focused model makes it less accessible to retail users, whereas Qubetics targets both institutions and individuals, making it a stronger overall investment for community-driven adoption. Final Verdict: Which Crypto Has the Best Growth Potential? Each of these projects is pioneering a different sector: Immutable X is the top choice for NFT gaming and zero-gas transactions. Quant is leading institutional adoption and financial integration. Qubetics is revolutionizing real-world asset tokenization, cross-chain finance, and blockchain transparency, making it the top crypto to join now. With its crypto presale nearing the next price jump, Qubetics offers the highest upside for those looking to get in early before TICS explodes in 2025.

Why is Qubetics considered one of the top cryptos to join now? Qubetics is solving one of crypto’s biggest problems—real-world asset tokenization. With a secure blockchain explorer, multi-chain interoperability, and a booming presale, it’s poised for massive adoption in 2025. 2. How does Qubetics compare to Immutable X and Quant? While Immutable X focuses on NFT gaming and Quant leads institutional adoption, Qubetics is a multi-utility blockchain connecting real-world assets, cross-chain finance, and decentralized payments—all in one ecosystem.

MAGACOINFINANCE and XRP are climbing the ranks quickly, with a clear uptick in engagement and positioning. Meanwhile, names like Solana (SOL) , Kaspa (KAS) , and Injective (INJ) are gaining quiet traction, especially among technical analysts and long-horizon investors looking for sustained momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE – Smart Positioning in a Crowded Market MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t aiming to compete through hype—it’s aiming to win through precision. With over $7.8 million raised , rising pre-sale demand, and a $0.007 listing price in view, the fundamentals are aligning fast. Its message, branding, and consistency in execution make MAGACOINFINANCE stand out among early-stage contenders. Investor communities across X, Telegram, and YouTube are increasingly focused on this project—not as a trend, but as a calculated long-term position. Use code MAGA50X at checkout to unlock a 50% bonus and secure early access before the broader listing surge begins. XRP – Strong Foundation and Institutional Appeal Current Price: $2.15, XRP continues to show impressive resilience, supported by rising ETF volume and on-chain strength. Analysts are closely monitoring the $2.45 breakout level, which could trigger renewed upward movement as institutional investors deepen their positions. Solana (SOL) – Strengthening as a Scalable Leader Current Price: ~$148, Solana has regained momentum after a robust 41% surge in April , positioning itself as a core platform for high-performance decentralized apps and real-world tokenization. If buying pressure holds, SOL is likely to test resistance around the $180 mark—opening the door to new upside in Q2. Kaspa and Injective – Quiet Builders with Real Fundamentals Kaspa (KAS) continues to gain ground among proof-of-work advocates. Trading around $0.10, the project is benefiting from rising interest in blockDAG tech and scalable architecture. If demand continues, a breakout above $0.30 remains a plausible scenario. Injective (INJ) remains anchored near $35. While not making headlines daily, its developer adoption and cross-chain ecosystem give it solid long-term fundamentals. Smart money continues to accumulate INJ quietly, anticipating future infrastructure relevance. Final Thoughts In a market where timing and traction are everything, XRP and Solana offer strength backed by structure, while Kaspa and Injective quietly build. But for those looking at pure early-stage upside, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to shine through with increasing conviction.

Although XRP has spent the majority of the past two months correcting from the peak price of $3.3 in January, its 2-month candlestick is showing a strong green body, a sign that bulls are still in control in the higher timeframes despite the fluctuations on the lower timeframes. Related Reading: Code Wars: Cardano Claims The Crown From Ethereum In Core Development Interestingly, a precise signal that hasn’t appeared since XRP’s historic 2017 rally is back, and the same trigger that led to its 20x price explosion that year has just returned. Technical Pattern Shows Clear Breakout Structure On 2-Month Timeframe Technical analysis of XRP’s price action on the 2-month candlestick timeframe chart shows that the cryptocurrency is still trading in a bullish setup on a larger timeframe. This analysis, shared by crypto analyst JD on social media platform X, shows XRP breaking out from a long-term triangle pattern, which has held its price in consolidation since the 2018 peak. The structure formed by this triangle includes a flat resistance trendline at the top and a gradually rising trendline at the bottom. XRP’s price performance in late 2024 saw it break above the upper resistance trendline, much like it did in a similar setup in the first few months of 2017. Notably, the XRP price broke above this trendline with conviction, which allowed it to reach a multi-year high of $3.3. However, the ensuing price action has been corrections upon corrections, with XRP now trading close to the $2 price level. Notwithstanding, the appearance of a bullish cross on the RSI means a bullish setup is still in action, with crypto analyst JD highlighting a potential 20x surge. Stochastic RSI Cross Above 80: The Same Spark From 2017 The appearance of a cross on the Stochastic RSI above the 80 level makes the current bullish setup more convincing. JD pointed out that the last time this crossover happened was in 2017, right before XRP recorded a 20x gain within three months. His chart illustrates this visually, showing a yellow highlight at the intersection point of the SRSI lines during that historic breakout. The same cross has now been confirmed on the 2-month chart. The SRSI cross occurs when the %K line crosses above or below the %D line within the Stochastic RSI indicator. In the case of XRP, the bullish signal of the cross is examined above the 80 threshold on the 2-month chart. The last time this happened in 2017, XRP went on a rally over four months from around $0.15 until it reached its current all-time high of $3.40.

This may seem unrealistic, considering the inflows needed to reach this level. Nonetheless, a rally from the recent SRSI cross could send the XRP price to new all-time highs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.2.

Right now, four names are aligning as early movers: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the breakout contender MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As dominant players consolidate, new opportunities are taking form—and for investors seeking aggressive upside, this may be the time to pay close attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Foundation for Breakout Growth Momentum in crypto is earned—not manufactured—and MAGACOINFINANCE is earning it in all the right ways. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is showing real strength: wallet activity is up, the community is expanding organically, and development milestones are being met with precision. Rather than chasing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is focusing on structure and sustainability. It’s laying a true foundation for breakout growth—something few early-stage projects achieve. Those entering now aren’t late—they’re early, and they may be entering just as the wider market starts to notice. Other Assets on the Move: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism remains a leader in Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, drawing demand for fast, cost-effective smart contracts. Arbitrum is thriving on strong developer activity and a vibrant dApp ecosystem, pushing Ethereum usability to new levels. Sei is gaining attention with its trading-focused architecture, built for speed and reduced congestion. Litecoin continues to hold its place as a reliable peer-to-peer transfer coin, especially where simplicity and speed are essential. Each of these assets has a clear use case—but none offer the raw early-stage momentum of MAGACOINFINANCE at this moment. Conclusion The next wave of crypto wealth won’t be built by those holding yesterday’s champions—it will come from those spotting what’s quietly emerging today. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP continue to command relevance.

I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post. OKX says there is no communication in the spam box, either Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,” Xu said. Source: Star Xu In what is now an unavailable X post, but was screenshotted by Xu, Sun had earlier claimed that OKX has not responded to a “freeze notice” sent to its official email address from a “relevant law enforcement agency.” Sun said that he had no other way to contact OKX’s compliance department. “These stolen funds do not belong to me; I’m acting to protect the community,” Sun said. On May 3, Tron DAO told its 1.7 million X followers that its account had been compromised. Tron explained that during the breach, an unauthorized party posted a malicious crypto token contract address, sent direct messages, and followed unfamiliar accounts. “If you received a DM from our account on May 2, please delete it and consider it the work of the attacker.” In response to Sun’s claims of inaction, Xu publicly called on him to provide a screenshot showing when and where the law enforcement request was made. The Tron incident is one of several recent security breaches involving high-profile crypto accounts on X. Related: Over 14,500 Tron addresses at risk of silent hijacking Kaito AI, an artificial intelligence-powered platform that aggregates crypto data to provide market analysis for users, and its founder, Yu Hu, were the victims of an X social media hack on March 15. The hackers opened up a short position on KAITO tokens before posting that the Kaito wallets were compromised and advised users that their funds were not safe. Just a few weeks before, on Feb. 26, The Pump.fun X account was compromised to promote a fake governance token called “PUMP” and other fraudulent coins. Meanwhile, the X account of UK member of Parliament and Leader of the House of Commons, Lucy Powell, was hacked on April 15 to promote a scam crypto token .

While most tokens are experiencing declines, Lightchain AI has been performing well as evidenced by its presale that has raised more than $19.6 million with its tokens priced at $0.007125. The rise is not just based on luck–it is backed by its growing community support, detailed roadmap, and utility. In a market where most tokens are seeing bearish returns, Lightchain AI has shown that projects can still be stable due to their innovation. For investors looking for the crypto comeback story of 2025, this token might just be the trigger that the market needs. Broader Crypto Market Plunges Into Red Cryptocurrencies in the market have been witnessing declines, with most of the bearish performances tied to the current economic instability. Bitcoin and Ethereum have witnessed losses that have stretched across days, pulling the altcoin market in the same direction. Investors have also been losing faith as a result of economic factors like inflation, regulatory issues, and the fear of an upcoming recession. Liquidity is drying up and traders are being careful with the way they take risks across exchanges. Tokens that have been predicted to see rises are now dropping, with traders selling most of their assets. Most traders are choosing to sell off meme coins and other assets as even bigger projects are finding it hard to hold onto their support levels. With volatility on the rise, many investors are moving to stablecoins while others are leaving the crypto industry as they all wait for signs of stability. Investors Turn to Utility-Focused Tokens Amid Market Uncertainty While market volatility is on the rise, investors have started shifting their attention to tokens that provide real-world value, with Lightchain AI being one of the best in that aspect. The project has a nice AI infrastructure that is designed for practical use. The platform carries out parallel task execution, reducing latency while increasing its performance. Developers can also benefit from its APIs, SDKs, and its secure sandbox environment for straightforward testing. Gas fees are also adjusted based on how hard the task is, making the platform the best when it comes to cost efficiency. According to its tokenomics, the project shared 40% of its total supply to its presale and 28.5% to staking rewards. Aside from promoting growth, Lightchain AI rewards its community. The project also ensures its governance is carried out by its community, ensuring long-term viability. As investors continue to choose projects that provide real impact, tokens like LCAI are gaining attention because of their value and usage. Brighten Your Future with Lightchain AI – Big Brains, Bigger Gains Lightchain AI is prepared to change your future, providing the best opportunity for you to earn big. The platform uses sharding to boost its transaction speed and scalability, ensuring the best performance without issues. Its interoperability also unlocks possibilities, connecting with other blockchains for wider use and cross-chain functionality. Even when it comes to privacy, Lightchain AI goes all in.

With over $225 million raised so far, the project has become one of the most successful crypto launches in recent memory. What’s pushing fresh interest now is a limited-time offer that allows entry at just $0.0019 – available only until May 13. This gives both early adopters and hesitant buyers one last opportunity before the official price climbs toward $0.05 at launch. $225M Milestone Puts BlockDAG Among Top Crypto Projects BlockDAG’s presale journey has exceeded all expectations, now standing above $225 million raised. This huge figure places it at the top of recent fundraising efforts. Early supporters are already seeing 2,520% profit compared to the earliest batches. That number could grow further with the official launch approaching and top exchanges preparing for listing. The buzz is not just about the numbers. BlockDAG has combined perfect timing with strong delivery. The project’s Testnet is already live and handling over 800 transactions per second. The development roadmap remains on track, building confidence in its long-term potential. The CertiK and Halborn audits, now completed, add another level of trust. These updates, plus growing demand, are pulling more eyes toward the project each day. What truly separates BlockDAG is how it’s delivering on its promises. From rapid testnet deployment to high speeds, the ecosystem is already running. This is more than just an idea, it’s a working network backed by strong infrastructure and community support. Limited $0.0019 Offer Drives Urgency Ahead of Launch With rising attention and the $0.05 launch price confirmed, BlockDAG’s $0.0019 entry point has become a key attraction. Available only until May 13, this limited offer gives users a chance to access early-stage pricing one final time. It’s an opportunity that has sparked renewed interest and surged participation numbers. This pricing strategy is part of a broader plan to expand adoption. It shows the team’s goal of reaching more users while sticking to a clear vision. Instead of offering last-minute cuts, the project has created a controlled and strategic entry window. This helps keep the presale momentum strong without losing trust. The offer also reflects growing confidence. The team is aiming to close the presale strong and boost reach before the coin hits exchanges. With every batch moving fast, this limited window is seen by many as the final shot to get in before the price jumps. BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Moves Beyond Presale Metrics BlockDAG’s progress goes well beyond presale numbers. The platform has shown real utility and is already running key features. Its X1 Miner, introduced in the 7th AMA, allows mining using just a smartphone. This lowers the barrier for entry and opens up BDAG earnings to the wider public, without the need for advanced hardware. Its Beta Testnet is also live, running a powerful blend of DAG and PoW technologies. With more than 800 transactions per second and full EVM compatibility, the network shows real-world capability. These aren’t future plans, these are current achievements. The team has also passed major audit milestones with CertiK and Halborn, helping users trust the system more. It’s not just about tech, either. The BlockDAG Academy and planned meetups in places like Dubai and Panama are building strong community links and helping the project grow globally. These efforts are drawing developers and users alike into the BDAG world. Final Thoughts: Last Window to Join Before Launch BlockDAG is no longer a hopeful presale project. It has become a complete and functioning ecosystem backed by $225 million in funding and strong community support. The platform is live, tested, and growing in adoption. The limited-time $0.0019 offer, available only until May 13, presents one final chance before the official $0.05 launch. More than 19.7 billion coins have been sold so far. The project has also brought in over $6.9 million from miner sales, with 17,269 units sold. These figures show strong belief in the platform’s future. If you’ve been watching and waiting, this may be the final moment to act. The market is moving, and BlockDAG’s position is clear; it’s ready for what comes next.

Leading this shift are Cardano (ADA) , Solana (SOL) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Chainlink (LINK) —four assets showing consistent resilience and momentum. With bullish signals flashing across multiple sectors, these names are quickly becoming top contenders in the current market rotation. MAGACOINFINANCE – Rising Fast With Strategic Precision Amid this rotation toward high-conviction assets, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a powerful early-stage entry point. With over $7.8 million raised and a clear roadmap toward a $0.007 listing , MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly earning attention across Telegram groups, influencer channels, and portfolio trackers. This isn’t a fleeting meme or pump—this is calculated positioning. Backed by real branding, community traction, and a growing base of committed early holders, MAGACOINFINANCE is becoming one of 2025’s most watched altcoins. Cardano (ADA) – Quiet Progress With Expanding Ecosystem Cardano has reasserted itself as a leading Layer-1 platform. With 130,000+ smart contracts deployed and the continued rollout of Hydra scaling , ADA is positioning for long-term functionality. Analysts are noting a resurgence in user activity and institutional attention—making Cardano a serious consideration for investors seeking stability with growth potential. Solana (SOL) – High Throughput and Rising Utility Solana has regained momentum following its 41% April surge , trading between $145–$150 . It continues to dominate in NFT issuance, high-speed retail transactions, and stablecoin settlements. With improved uptime and a reinvigorated developer community, SOL is being recognized not just for speed—but for strategic impact in scalable infrastructure. Ethereum (ETH) – The Backbone of Decentralized Innovation Trading near $1,765 , Ethereum remains central to blockchain infrastructure. From Layer-2 scaling solutions to ETF momentum , ETH’s fundamentals continue to strengthen. Whales are accumulating, gas fees are stabilizing, and developer activity is reaching new highs. As institutional flows increase, many analysts forecast Ethereum breaking $2,500–$3,000 in the months ahead. Chainlink (LINK) – The Indispensable Data Layer Chainlink continues to lead the oracle space with unmatched utility. As Web3 expands across industries, LINK’s Chainlink Functions is enabling new enterprise applications in gaming , DeFi , and real-world data tokenization . For long-term holders, Chainlink’s role as a foundational middleware solution is becoming more evident with each integration. Final Thoughts Cardano, Solana, Ethereum, and Chainlink are providing structure and utility in a market seeking clarity. But for those with an eye toward early opportunity and asymmetric upside, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as one of the standout narratives of 2025.

Fresh economic figures tell a different story. Gross domestic product slid in the January‑to‑March quarter, the first contraction in three years. Economists blame a wave of imports ordered before new tariffs took effect. Beyond that, hiring continues, and inflation has cooled after last year’s jump. Surveys of household confidence, business investment plans and expectations for sales, employment and growth have dropped sharply. Analysts say the main culprit is the tariff fight that the president launched against trading partners around the world. Current financial markets reflect the tension. U.S. shares are posting the weakest return at this point of any modern presidency, and the dollar’s value has sunk further than it did under George W. Bush, Barack Obama, or Joe Biden. Voters who backed Trump largely for his economic message have begun to question that record. Trump promised to close trade gaps using import taxes Throughout the campaign and his first term, Trump promised to use import taxes to close trade gaps, lift government revenue, and bring factory jobs back to American soil. The tariffs imposed since early April represent the biggest barrier to foreign goods in more than a hundred years, even after the administration paused some of the duties announced on April 2. Those reversals, plus warnings of more levies to come, have left companies at home and abroad guessing about rules that can change overnight. Bloomberg Economics’ index of global trade uncertainty now stands well above its level during the first‑term trade clash. Trump often cites the merchandise trade deficit, built up over five decades, as proof that the United States is “getting ripped off.” Yet the first effect of the new levies was a flood of imports. Corporations rushed ahead to dodge higher prices, and the monthly trade gap hit a record at the start of 2025. That import surge was large enough to subtract from GDP and tip the economy into the first‑quarter decline. Hiring has continued in Q1 2025 Hiring continued in the opening months of the year. Employers added 456,000 positions from January through March, topping forecasters’ estimates, and the jobless rate edged up slightly. “GREAT JOB NUMBERS, FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IT’S ALREADY WORKING,” Trump wrote on social media on April 4, the day the March report appeared. Yet the forward‑looking data again diverge from the historical counts. Most private‑sector economists argue that higher import duties will lift costs for foreign and domestic products alike, feeding faster inflation. Surveys show that consumers think so too: expectations for both one‑year and five‑year price increases have risen sharply. Retailers saw a burst of spending at the end of last year and into the winter as shoppers grabbed cars, computers and other big‑ticket goods before tariffs drove up sticker prices. Now, with households bracing for steeper costs and slower growth, multiple gauges of consumer sentiment have fallen to levels last seen during the 2020 pandemic slump. Corporate leaders are equally wary. Industry polls find capital‑spending plans at their lowest level in more than two years, even though firms hold historically large cash cushions. Executives say that without clear tariff rules they cannot predict costs or map out global supply chains, so equipment orders are on hold.

Price Eyes $0.27,https://coinpedia.org/news/dogecoin-to-the-moon-price-eyes-0-27/,"The post Dogecoin To The Moon? Price Eyes $0.27 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After months of sluggish price action and sideways consolidation, Dogecoin (DOGE) may finally be on the verge of a meaningful breakout. Recent price movements, technical signals, and broader macroeconomic trends all appear to be converging in DOGE’s favor. Technical Breakout from Descending Channel According to analysis, Dogecoin has officially broken out of a descending channel, a formation that has capped price rallies since the beginning of the year. The breakout is further validated by a successful retest of prior resistance, now turned support, suggesting a bullish reversal is underway. The immediate resistance lies at $0.27, but continued bullish pressure could push DOGE toward $0.39 and even $0.43 in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, support around $0.17 provides a safety net in the event of short-term pullbacks. Short-Term Price Action and Elliott Wave Analysis Recent price behavior shows Dogecoin is in a micro-corrective phase, currently holding above a key support zone between $0.17 and $0.1777. This region was previously identified as a micro-support level, and the market has reacted accordingly, hinting that the fifth wave up in an Elliott Wave sequence may be starting. In the current wave count, analysts identify a potential three-wave move up , with Wave 3 peaking near the 138% Fibonacci extension at $0.196. If this structure holds, Wave 5 could extend toward the 161.8% level at $0.206 or the 178.6% level at $0.213. A confirmed break above $0.185 would strongly mean that the next bullish leg is underway. However, a decisive drop below $0.17 would cause a temporary delay in the anticipated rally. For now, the pullback appears corrective and shallow, which aligns with an ongoing uptrend. Macro Trends: Bitcoin, Global M2, and Dogecoin Correlation Beyond the charts, macroeconomic indicators are adding fuel to the bullish case. One emerging narrative gaining traction among analysts is the correlation between cryptocurrency prices and global M2 money supply — a measure of the world’s money supply that includes cash, checking, and easily convertible near-money. According to one user, when applying a 110-day offset, there appears to be a consistent pattern between increases in M2 and DOGE price rallies — excluding outlier events like the post-Trump-election price surge. There has been a lot of talk about the correlation between the price of Bitcoin and the Global M2 money supply. But how about Dogecoin? With a 110 day offset and ignoring the $DOGE price craziness after the Trump election, there is a pattern relationship for when money flows… pic.twitter.com/zoBVGUQHBm — KrissPax (@krisspax) May 3, 2025 If money continues flowing into assets like Dogecoin as global liquidity expands, especially during the summer, this correlation could become even more evident — reinforcing the bullish technical setup.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-04 03:19:27

Even though there are 6.4 million XRP wallets, that does not mean there are 6.4 million people holding XRP. Many users, especially experienced ones, hold multiple wallets for different purposes like trading, storage, and security. In fact, a large number of these wallets are inactive, unfunded, or belong to exchanges like Binance and Uphold. Others may contain only a small amount of XRP, often referred to as “dust” wallets. Based on blockchain data and AI analysis, it is estimated that only about 30 to 40 percent of these wallets are actually used by individual holders. As explained by Edo Farina, this means that the real number of people who hold XRP is much smaller—somewhere between 1.5 and 2 million worldwide. That’s less than 0.03 percent of the global population. To put it simply, fewer than one in every 4,000 people on the planet currently holds XRP. So, how much XRP do you need to be considered a top holder? According to the latest data, owning just 2,500 XRP places you in the top 10 percent of all XRP wallets. At current market prices, that’s about $5,000. While it’s no longer as easy as it once was, it’s still an amount within reach for many investors. There’s a common belief that if XRP ever reaches high values—say $1,000—the elites or governments won’t allow regular people to profit. But when you look at the numbers, the situation is quite different. Even if 2.5 million wallets each held 250 XRP and XRP hit $1,000, each person would make $250,000. That’s a great return, but not enough to disrupt global financial systems or draw serious attention from regulators. And realistically, most people are unlikely to hold XRP until it reaches those high prices. Many will cash out early—at $10, $50, or $100.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-04 03:28:36

There are likely to be solid opportunities to sell the market in May, but I would still caution against shorting MSTR through MSTZ. Bitcoin's technical setup actually looks quite good in my view, and that means MSTR may continue to rally despite my concerns about MSTR common stock. Despite not being bullish on Strategy common stock at this time, I would still avoid the T-Rex 2X Inverse MSTR Daily Target ETF. On April 11th, I wrote the following in my coverage of the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (SQQQ) for Seeking Alpha: If history is a guide, the performance of the Nasdaq on April 9th is potentially a strong indication that there are further declines coming in stocks, particularly the kind of high-flying tech stocks that are in the Nasdaq. To be clear, I do actually think we are likely to experience a meaningful rally in the US equity market for the remainder of April. Bold above is my emphasis for today's submission. That turned out to be a very good call, and hopefully those who were long SQQQ when that piece went live reconsidered and avoided the 26% loss that ensued since in that fund. Now, bearish ideas are getting very interesting again. In this article, we'll look at some broader market charts, the setup in the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) chart, and why despite not being bullish Strategy ( MSTR )( STRK )( STRF ) common stock at this point in time, I think the T-Rex 2X Inverse MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTZ ) is still a massive avoid. Bearish Technicals? With broader market indexes like the Nasdaq 100 having now rallied over 20% from intraday lows on April 7th, a logical question from traders might be, how do we play it from here? At this point, the large gaps lower from the early to mid-April sessions have all been filled. Rather, the one or two unresolved gaps that I see on the chart today have been on the upside: Shortable Bear Market Rally? (TrendSpider) Perhaps adding credence to the idea that these upside gaps in the Qs could be filled by sell pressure in May, the Nasdaq 100 rallied right into its 200-day moving average during the May 2nd session before modest profit-taking began into the close. As I see it, we're now in a stage of directional uncertainty for the markets and seasonality indications aren't much help: QQQ Seasonality (TrendSpider) Going back the last 26 years, the Q's have a mean return in May of 0.93% and a positive return rate of 59%. More recently, May has been a terrific month for the Nasdaq 100 and has returned an average of 2.6% over the last 10 years: QQQ Seasonality (Seeking Alpha) May 2024 returned 6.2% and May 2023 returned 7.9%. Given the surge the market was on through the end of April, I would not expect a 6 or 7% return in May to happen again. Rather, I'm of the view that this rally is already getting extended and a ticker like SQQQ could be one to explore for tactical trades in May. Yet, despite my shorter term bearishness, I don't think all short products are created equal and MSTZ is one that I would avoid entirely. MSTZ Is a Capital Incinerator Expense Ratio: 1.05% AUM: $168.8 million Inception: 9/17/2024 Issuer: Tuttle Capital Management The T-Rex 2x Inverse MSTR ETF is exactly what it sounds like; it's an actively managed fund that is designed to double the returns of MSTR stock but in the opposite direction. So if MSTR shares increase by 5% in a single session, a 2x inverse ETF would go down by 10% if structured properly. Funds like MSTZ are rebalanced daily and are absolutely not designed to be held long term. Rather, a product like MSTZ should really only be held for short periods of time; days or weeks at most. Due to the daily re-balancing, the long-term total return of the fund will be negative even if shares of MSTR decline in value. Consider the loss of capital that a shareholder of MSTZ would have experienced going back to inception - which is literally less than 8 months: Data by YCharts If a trader bought $10,000 worth of MSTZ on inception day and held it all the way through May 2nd, that person would have less than $100 left. To be sure, the 200% positive return in MSTR since the inception of MSTZ is a big contributing factor to MSTZ's 99% capital destruction. However, even over a much shorter period of time, holding MSTZ can lead to catastrophic losses: Data by YCharts The chart above shows the total return of both MSTR and MSTZ from March 25th through April 22nd - just 18 sessions. This is not an arbitrary period of time, it shows the return of MSTZ starting right before a 31% decline in MSTR that reversed higher back to the starting point of the stock. Over that time frame, MSTR is essentially flat while MSTZ is down nearly 40%. To be sure, there was a very brief period where MSTZ holders could have locked in an 80% gain, but it lasted exactly one session and was immediately erased in a single session on April 9th. The point is, these are incredibly dangerous products and should probably be avoided by most traders. Bitcoin and MSTR In spite of the obvious danger in holding the fund for an extended period of time, is there a case to be made for buying MSTZ today? I'm not bullish Strategy common stock and I made my case for that in a recent piece following Q1-25 earnings: I want MSTR shareholders/fans to actually think about this for a moment; if cash flow from the underlying business can't meaningfully fund the dividend required for STRK and STRF shareholders - and we know that it already can't - then that capital has to either come from selling Bitcoin or from raising fresh investment capital to pay previous investors. The latter sounds a lot like a Ponzi scheme Despite the clear issues I have with Strategy's approach to Bitcoin domination, I would actually still caution against buying MSTZ simply because MSTR is such a wild card. Yes, MSTR continues to trade at double the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Yes, MSTR has clear dilution risks with an additional $21 billion common stock ATM just announced. And yes, MSTR is still running an old software business at an operating loss six years running. All of that is true. But in my view, MSTR is way too dangerous to short because it's still likely going to go as Bitcoin goes. And Bitcoin actually looks pretty good right now in my view: BTC Daily Chart (TrendSpider) Bitcoin has broken out over all key MAs, broken out over 3.5-month trend-line resistance, and both broken and back-tested horizontal resistance at $93k. My biggest concern about Bitcoin at this point is any residual correlation to the Nasdaq 100. That said, we might be seeing the beginning of what, I think, will be a relatively brief rotation trade from Gold to Bitcoin. Given that, trying to short MSTR through MSTZ is still too dangerous, in my personal view. Closing Summary Funds like MSTZ are long term capital incinerators. The proof is in the pudding here, with a total return loss of over 99% in less than 8 months through MSTZ. This is not a fund that should be held for longer than a few days - weeks at most. The timing on 2x leveraged ETFs has to be impeccable to work out, and that is doubly true with leverage on stocks that are seen as leverage on something like Bitcoin. With MSTZ, traders are essentially getting leverage on Bitcoin, but they're doing it in a way that bets against BTC. There will be points when that works really well and points when it works really poorly. Could the Bitcoin bull story be closer to the end than the beginning? I'm certainly not going to say that's impossible. But it's also not something that I'd bet on either. For traders, 2x leverage ETFs can work really well, and I've used them several times in the past. There is a time and a place for them. But in my view, MSTZ is a major avoid both now and longer term.",MSTR|MSTZ,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-05-04 03:38:54

Ethereum Still Leads,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-trx-and-bitcoin-match-magacoinfinance-and-xrps-2025-outlook-ethereum-still-leads/,"As crypto markets deepen into Q2 2025, the spotlight is turning toward assets showing not just price action, but structural strength. TRON (TRX) , Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , and Ethereum (ETH) remain among the most closely tracked coins. But in the background, MAGACOINFINANCE is building serious momentum—quietly becoming a top candidate for early-stage upside this year. MAGACOINFINANCE – Strategic Growth With Sustained Momentum While leading coins grab the spotlight, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining traction for its calculated rise. With over $7.8 million raised , strong branding, and increasing investor engagement, this project isn’t reacting to trends—it’s establishing one. Community traction is growing across channels, and top analysts are beginning to recognize MAGACOINFINANCE as more than a passing opportunity. The 50% bonus offer (code: MAGA50X) is still live—providing an edge to those who act before listings go public. TRX and Bitcoin Are Holding Strong in the 2025 Rotation TRX is trading near $0.245 , maintaining long-term network reliability and steady ecosystem usage. While not always in headlines, TRON’s user base and DeFi integrations continue to expand, making it a stable presence among Layer-1s. Bitcoin (BTC) , currently hovering around $95,000 , remains the macro pillar of the crypto market. Following April’s ETF-driven growth and institutional accumulation, BTC continues to show strength. Analysts still maintain targets ranging between $120,000–$132,000 by mid-year, with many viewing it as both a hedge and a leader in capital inflows. XRP and Ethereum Continue to Anchor Market Confidence XRP , priced around $2.15 , is gaining new institutional credibility through futures ETFs and expanding real-world payment solutions. Traders are watching for a breakout above the $2.45 resistance mark, which could open the door to significant rallies through Q2. Ethereum (ETH) trades near $1,830 , sustaining strong fundamentals thanks to growing Layer-2 adoption, AI integration, and whale interest. It remains the core foundation for decentralized innovation, with analysts forecasting a potential climb above $2,700 in coming weeks. Final Thoughts Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , and TRX each present compelling stories backed by fundamentals and ecosystem leadership. But MAGACOINFINANCE is shaping a new narrative—one defined by timing, community strength, and early-stage positioning. For investors looking ahead, this could be the entry point they talk about in future cycles.

The growth in the stablecoin market cap on the Solana ecosystem in 2025 has been absolutely staggering. More details on that are below. But, these are the kind of healthy Web3 indicators that help evaluate network effects and user activity for financial risk assessment. Solana prices have been trending along with the broad crypto market over the past 12 months. But they may be on a trajectory to outperform many other altcoins in Q2 2025. Here are five reasons why: 1. Bullish Long Term SOL Cup and Handle Pattern Zooming out, #Solana $SOL appears to form a textbook-perfect cup and handle pattern! pic.twitter.com/91oYYgY0yL — Ali (@ali_charts) April 28, 2025 On Apr. 28, popular Crypto X chart technical analyst Ali Martinez (“Ali Charts”) posted an interesting observation to some 136K followers.. The Solana price chart does certainly form a bullish cup and handle pattern starting around Oct. 2022. The cup completes in Nov. 2024, and the handle forms during market panic after Trump took office. This chart pattern is a classic technical analysis signal of a bullish reversal about to begin in exchange markets. The fact that the pattern spans some two-and-a-half years does not discredit its usefulness as a price signal for Solana in May. This classically reliable pattern usually becomes more reliable the longer it takes to form. Ali added that the Bollinger Bands squeezing the middle on the 4-hour chart for SOL tokens also smelled like something is cooking in Solana markets. The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on the 4-hour chart for #Solana $SOL , signaling that a major price move could be imminent. pic.twitter.com/47Tq593su6 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 2. Solana Tokenized Stocks Announcement 1/4 @solanainstitute , @superstatefunds and @orca_so , with support from @LowensteinLLP , have submitted a proposal to the SEC – dubbed Project Open – for a pilot project to enable the issuance and trading of equity securities on public blockchain networks like @solana . — Solana Policy Institute (@SolanaInstitute) April 30, 2025 Tokenized contracts stand to transform the world even more than Bitcoin’s settlement-based finance rocked the system. One of the most abundant use cases for that would be tokenized stocks. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in his annual letter to shareholders in April that tokenizing stocks will revolutionize financial markets. In a powerful statement, Fink wrote: “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.” The Solana Policy Institute and three other organizations announced on Apr. 30 a proposal submitted to the SEC called “Project Open.” The proposal is for a product that allows Solana to issue tokens for stocks that users can trade on the blockchain. 3. Bloomberg SOL ETF Approval Odds Jump to 90% Would love to hear directly from Atkins, but all good chance of happening. Here’s our latest odds of approval for all the dif spot ETFs via @JSeyff https://t.co/nLhYJJmO9U pic.twitter.com/4AcJVwhics — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 30, 2025 Meanwhile, on Apr. 29, Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, posted the latest approval odds from Bloomberg Intelligence for active crypto ETF applications at the SEC. Bloomberg’s forecast for a Solana ETF approval from the SEC in 2025 jumped to 90%. Although there are currently more Ripple ETF applications than Solana, Bloomberg’s odds for a SOL ETF were higher, with XRP at 85%. Solana tops the odds among altcoins at 90%, but Avalanche and Cardano have a 75% chance of approval, according to Bloomberg’s current estimation. When Bitcoin’s ETFs went live in Q1 2024, its price went on a 12-month historic rally. 4. Solana Stablecoin Market Cap Is Spacewalking #Solana stablecoin supply is at all time high of $11.7 billion pic.twitter.com/tSZmWeJ8O4 — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) February 8, 2025 In addition to the technical and derivatives market signals, and Solana ecosystem development with more use cases, data from DeFiLlama shows an utterly significant increase in such stablecoins from under $5 billion a year ago to above $13 billion in May. Web3 users like stablecoins for making currency swaps convenient and sheltering their money from market volatility while having it ready to deploy to take advantage of opportunities. Having that much liquidity suddenly available for trading in under 12 months is an item of fundamental analysis for the bullish column for Solana this quarter.

While it’s unclear whether May will bring any strong price movement, some analysts believe June could mark the beginning of a new rally. Attention is now shifting to the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple. The next key date in the case is June 9, when the SEC is expected to submit a status report on settlement discussions. According to one researcher, the SEC might issue a Sunshine Act notice about a week before this date. That notice would signal an official vote to drop the appeal and lift the long-standing injunction against Ripple. For those of you who seem to still be tracking the SEC vs Ripple appeal, the next milestone is June 9, where SEC is required to submit a status report of the settlement discussions. I would anticipate SEC will issue a sunshine Act notice 1 week prior to the meeting where they… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) May 3, 2025 If this happens, it must be done before June 9 to allow the SEC enough time to finalize court documents. Based on this timeline, the next two to three weeks could be important for XRP. As for the potential impact on XRP’s price, predictions remain mixed. While some expect a rally—possibly a 20% jump followed by a pullback—others say the market could react sharply, and a sudden 3x move isn’t out of the question. XRP Price Analysis XRP continues to show weak bullish momentum, with a long-term bearish divergence still impacting its price movement. On the 3-day and daily charts, the token remains in a downward trend marked by lower highs and lower lows. While there has been some short-term relief, XRP is struggling to maintain upward movement, similar to what is happening with Bitcoin. Currently, XRP is trading near a support level between $2.15 and $2.17. If this support fails, the next key level to watch is just above $2.00, followed by a weaker support area near $1.95. Holding above these levels is important to avoid further decline. On the upside, resistance is seen around $2.35, with stronger resistance between $2.45 and $2.50.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-04 03:57:21

One emerging asset has started to capture serious attention in recent weeks — MAGACOIN FINANCE , still trading under $0.07 , and quickly developing a reputation as a high-multiple contender in 2025. Why Sub-$0.07 Pricing Matters With the current price hovering below $0.07 , MAGACOIN FINANCE sits in the early accumulation zone that seasoned crypto investors recognize from previous major breakouts like SHIB, DOGE, and early-stage DeFi plays. These were tokens that saw explosive upside — not because of hype, but because of smart timing and limited early access. For investors familiar with the wealth cycles in crypto, entry at sub-$0.07 levels could represent one of the last opportunities before MAGACOIN FINANCE moves into a more public phase via listings and broader visibility. Forecasted Growth: 34x–35x From Current Levels Analyst projections around MAGACOIN FINANCE are striking. Multiple sources estimate a return potential of 34x to 35x by year-end based on listing targets, market structure, and token supply dynamics. This is the kind of setup that has historically rewarded early entrants with disproportionate gains. Projected ROI: 3400%–3500% by 2025 Expected Returns: 34x from Entry Price Anticipated Upside: +3000% to +3500% Range Potential Return: Up to $3250% , depending on bonus structures and early-stage allocation This kind of return profile places MAGACOIN FINANCE in a unique category — not a meme play, not yet mainstream, but sitting on the edge of breakout territory. What’s Driving the Momentum? Several key factors are pushing MAGACOIN FINANCE into investor focus: No centralized exchange exposure yet, protecting early pricing Tokenomics built for scarcity, with no VC overhang Community-led acceleration backed by a rapidly growing user base Clear roadmap and milestone execution that builds long-term credibility These fundamentals set it apart from “hype-only” tokens. Instead, it’s emerging as a rare blend of early access, strong mechanics, and credible growth signals — ideal for traders seeking asymmetric return setups. Early Entry Window Remains Open — For Now As of early May 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still under the radar, but momentum is building fast. If current trends continue, the sub-$0.07 pricing may not last long. For investors seeking an opportunity before the mainstream catches on, this could be a defining entry point.

Following this recent gain, the premier cryptocurrency is experiencing a minor retracement as investors attempt to decipher the current market phase. Meanwhile, a prominent crypto analyst with the X handle IT Tech has shared some valuable insights on Bitcoin’s market structure, highlighting the key price levels that could decide the asset’s movement in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Confirmed Local Bottom As All Indicators Flash Bullish, Where’s Price Headed? Bitcoin Cools Off After Price Rally: Breather Or Bull Trap? According to IT Tech in an X post on May 2, Bitcoin appears to be catching its breath following a price rally from $93,600 to above $97,000. As market traders await to see if this will be a mere cooling period before another upswing or the start of a deeper price correction, IT Tech has shared some helpful technical and on-chain insights on potential price targets. The analyst states that the Bitcoin SuperTrend Indicator had printed a buy signal when prices hit $94,000, followed by a sell signal at $97,300. However, with market prices still above $94,000, the Bitcoin market structure and SuperTrend Indicator remain bullish. Meanwhile, liquidation data has also hinted at potential points for price volatility. Most notably, IT Tech states there are long liquidation zones between the $95,200 – $96,000 price region and another dense cluster of orders at the $93,600 – $94,000 price region. Both regions are expected to act as strong price supports in the case of an unexpected decline. In determining Bitcoin’s next move, IT Tech says that market sentiment remains cautiously bullish as long as the $96,000 support level remains valid. This is because a decisive price fall below this level would trigger a liquidation cascade pushing prices back to $94,000. Meanwhile, another price breakout above $97,400 to allow Bitcoin to trade as high as $98,500.

As earlier stated, bullish sentiment continues to ravage the market as indicated by recent developments, including the surge in Bitcoin Spot ETF inflows. Meanwhile, the US’s willingness to negotiate a new trade deal with China may signify no further negative developments on international trade tariffs.

According to official reports, coordinated efforts artificially inflated VOXEL’s market activity, leading to millions of dollars in suspect trading volumes. Bitget responded by freezing affected accounts and filing complaints across multiple jurisdictions. The platform emphasized its commitment to restoring market integrity and safeguarding its users. The incident places renewed scrutiny on centralized exchange platforms and their ability to ensure transparency. As Bitget attempts to navigate these challenges, the broader market observes how centralized trading environments continue to grapple with maintaining trust, especially when manipulation accusations surface. Ripple’s $1.25 Billion Move Signals Expansion into $16 Trillion Asset Market Ripple has captured attention with a $1.25 billion acquisition aimed at expanding its reach into the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector. Legal advisors close to the deal suggest that this strategic move positions Ripple to tap into a sector estimated to be worth $16 trillion globally. The acquisition reflects Ripple’s broader ambition to strengthen its foothold in both cross-border payments and the tokenization of traditional financial assets. However, Ripple’s growth initiatives remain shadowed by its ongoing regulatory battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite these challenges, Ripple’s approach suggests a long-term vision targeting significant segments of future blockchain-based finance, even if immediate market effects remain moderated by legal uncertainties. BlockDAG Accelerates as the Next Big Crypto Opportunity While other projects address legal and regulatory complexities, BlockDAG’s rise has been marked by consistent infrastructure delivery and community-driven momentum. With its token now priced at $0.0019 and a presale figure exceeding $225 million, BlockDAG is establishing itself through real performance milestones rather than speculative narratives. The live Beta Testnet has been a central achievement, providing real-time user feedback and demonstrating BlockDAG’s technological readiness ahead of full mainnet deployment. Complementing this rollout is a $60,000 Testnet reward campaign, designed to incentivize early community engagement and strengthen ecosystem participation. Another standout element fueling BlockDAG’s presale momentum is the Buyer Battles initiative. Through this program, 25 million BDAG tokens are distributed daily, with additional rewards going to the largest single buyer each day. This structure introduces a competitive dynamic among participants and fosters daily investment activity. Key developments from BlockDAG’s seventh AMA session further reinforced its trajectory. Updates included news of miner releases, continued audit processes through Halborn and CertiK, expansion of payment methods including upcoming credit card support, and preparations for a global customer service rollout. The upcoming Global Convention promises to bring BlockDAG to broader audiences through localized events, enhancing visibility and community strength as the project moves toward mainnet readiness. BlockDAG’s approach, focused on technical delivery, transparency, and daily engagement mechanisms, sets it apart in an environment where many projects rely heavily on future projections without clear current milestones. Key Takeaways With Bitget addressing allegations of market manipulation and Ripple pursuing ambitious but long-term RWA initiatives, BlockDAG stands out for its immediate, tangible progress. Its $225 million presale, live Beta Testnet, competitive Buyer Battles program, and strategic preparations for global expansion combine to offer a rare early-stage opportunity grounded in deliverables rather than hype. For investors evaluating what is the next big crypto, BlockDAG’s real-time execution and strong presale performance make a compelling case.

Right now, smart investors are circling four assets: Bitcoin , Solana , XRP , and the under-the-radar contender MAGACOINFINANCE . With early momentum building and the broader market gearing up for the next run, even a $400 placement today could be the key to something much larger tomorrow. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Strength Beneath the Surface Not every project needs a spotlight to grow. MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining traction where it matters most and has raised over $7.8 million—on-chain activity, steady development, and meaningful community interaction. Wallet numbers are climbing. Updates are rolling out on time. And the buzz isn’t artificial—it’s real believers showing up early. The project’s disciplined rollout is a familiar pattern to those who’ve seen how the biggest crypto success stories often start. This is still the early window—and those catching it now are the ones history tends to remember. Key Players Supporting the Ecosystem: Ethereum, Chainlink, and Sei Ethereum remains the foundation of decentralized applications, and with continued scaling, its lead looks even more secure heading into 2025. Chainlink powers essential infrastructure for price feeds, data access, and cross-chain connectivity—positioning itself at the core of real-world blockchain utility. Sei is gaining developer traction fast, thanks to its trading-first architecture and ultra-fast execution layer built for performance-focused DeFi. Each of these is shaping the crypto landscape—but none are still in the early price discovery phase like MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Take In the crypto space, $400 has changed lives—if placed early in the right project. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP have already proven themselves. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM offers the rare opportunity to act before full-scale recognition hits. The groundwork is being laid. The traction is measurable. And the potential? It’s still unfolding.

Ethereum and XRP Are Entering the Race,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-solana-overtake-magacoinfinance-com-in-growth-ethereum-and-xrp-are-entering-the-race/,"In a year defined by fast-paced development and rising on-chain metrics, 2025 has become a battleground between established layer-1 leaders and rising challengers. Solana (SOL) continues to push forward with strong price action and tech fundamentals. But with Ethereum (ETH) and XRP gaining institutional momentum—and MAGACOINFINANCE catching early-stage fire—the spotlight is shifting fast. MAGACOINFINANCE – The Political Altcoin Turning Heads While the majors grab headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly dominating the early-stage conversation. With over 12,500 holders and $7.8 million raised, the project blends political energy with crypto innovation. Its grassroots growth, bold branding, and rising visibility are building a momentum rarely seen at this phase. Now’s the time to move: early investors receive a 50% token bonus using promo code MAGA50X . This offer vanishes when listings go live—timing is everything. Solana (SOL): The Fast Layer-1 With Renewed Strength Solana is holding above $143.50 , continuing its recovery trend after gaining 41% in April. Analysts see potential for a rally toward $205–$250 , especially if resistance at $150 is broken. With high NFT activity, strong validator growth, and speculation around ETF approval building again, Solana remains a formidable contender. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP Are Reinforcing Market Confidence Ethereum , trading near $1,736 , is leading in both utility and ecosystem growth. With whale accumulation rising and more AI and data protocols deploying on its base layer, ETH could test $2,500–$2,700 in Q2. XRP , priced around $2.15 , is holding strong as futures ETFs drive institutional flows. A move above the $2.45 resistance could trigger a sharp rally. With CME Group’s futures listing imminent, XRP’s momentum remains one of the most compelling narratives this quarter. Aptos (APT): A Quiet Technological Climber APT has remained steady near $4.71 , backed by higher TVL and institutional partnerships. As a secure Layer-1 with enterprise appeal, Aptos is starting to stand out for its technical consistency. Analysts see an opportunity if APT closes above $5.10 with volume. Final Thoughts Solana, Ethereum, XRP, and Aptos are clearly leading in terms of structure and ecosystem power. But MAGACOINFINANCE is bringing something different to the table—early momentum, viral narrative strength, and community expansion that could set the stage for a major breakout in 2025.

In the past 24 hours, $PI has climbed 2.5% and is now trading around $0.60. This comes after weeks of price pressure caused by ongoing token unlocks. However, with the pace of new unlocks expected to slow down after mid-May, the selling pressure could ease, giving room for potential growth. The next major resistance lies at $0.70.

This time, four names are rising to the top of investor radars: MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP . With sentiment shifting and the market heating up, early entries into these assets could deliver transformational upside. But windows like this rarely stay open for long. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Accelerating With Real-World Traction Momentum doesn’t start with hype—it starts with proof. And MAGACOINFINANCE is stacking real progress fast: rising wallet activity, consistent roadmap progress, and community growth that’s authentic and investor-driven. There’s no flash, no gimmicks—just measured growth and recognition from those who’ve seen breakout cycles before. If early signs hold, MAGACOINFINANCE may soon move from quietly building to dominating headlines. Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP Continue to Lead the Charge Bitcoin (BTC) still serves as crypto’s core anchor, and ETF tailwinds are giving it new exposure. Solana (SOL) is pushing deeper into real-world applications—from tokenization to NFTs—with growing developer support and high-speed architecture. XRP is finally operating without legal overhang, expanding into financial markets with renewed energy and momentum. These giants offer proven resilience—but for investors seeking asymmetrical opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE remains at the center of the early-stage conversation. More Movers to Watch: Polygon, Kaspa, and Others Polygon continues to lead Ethereum’s scaling frontier, onboarding major brands and scaling dApps with ease. Kaspa is gaining a loyal following for its efficient proof-of-work design and unique DAG structure—solving speed and scale simultaneously. These are meaningful ecosystem players—but they’ve largely passed their early discovery windows. MAGACOINFINANCE , in contrast, is still in its prime entry phase. Final Takeaway The next wave of crypto wealth will come from those who are positioned ahead of the headlines. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP remain pillars—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be the overlooked asset setting up for the kind of 60,000% run that changes everything. If you’re watching the market, don’t wait for confirmation. Look for momentum. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing all the right signals.

Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , and the increasingly followed MAGACOINFINANCE.COM are capturing serious interest from both institutional and retail investors across continents. With momentum expanding and adoption growing, early engagement in these assets may offer significant strategic advantages in 2025 and beyond. MAGACOINFINANCE Gains Global Recognition with Over $7.8 Million Raised In early-stage investing, fundamentals are more valuable than headlines. MAGACOINFINANCE is demonstrating all the signals of a well-structured, globally relevant project: strong wallet growth, expanding community support, and a clear execution track record. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is scaling across major markets including North America, Europe, and Asia. This is not a speculative phase—it’s a calculated growth trajectory grounded in transparency and performance. Those entering now are doing so before full-scale global awareness is reached. Leading the Market: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Maintain Strong Positions Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the primary store of value within digital assets, now further supported by institutional investment vehicles and ETF integration. Ethereum (ETH) remains foundational to decentralized technology, with robust developer activity and enterprise adoption across smart contracts, applications, and tokenized systems. XRP has regained momentum following regulatory clarity, positioning itself as a serious contender for cross-border settlement infrastructure. While these assets reflect maturity and stability, MAGACOINFINANCE offers an early-stage opportunity that is still unfolding. Other Projects to Watch: Optimism, Kaspa, and Emerging Infrastructure Optimism is making Ethereum more scalable by lowering costs and increasing speed through Layer-2 integration—vital for onboarding the next wave of users. Kaspa is innovating with its blockDAG approach, focusing on rapid confirmation times and high-throughput decentralization. These platforms contribute meaningfully to blockchain infrastructure—but few currently offer the same early growth curve that MAGACOINFINANCE presents. Conclusion The global crypto market is evolving rapidly. While Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP remain strong pillars, MAGACOINFINANCE is building a credible case as the next high-potential entry point. With over $7.8 million raised and growing visibility, the project is transitioning from early discovery into broader adoption. The opportunity remains, but timing is critical.

This bearish structure has kept price action under pressure, with each attempt at recovery meeting resistance along the upper trendline. The pattern reflects a broader struggle between bulls attempting to defend key support zones and bears maintaining a firm grip on short-term momentum. As XRP’s price coils tighter within the confines of the channel, this suggests that a decisive move could be on the horizon. Whether the bulls can muster enough strength to flip the trend or the bears extend their dominance remains a crucial question that may define XRP’s next major move. Bears Keep Price Below Key Resistance Line Currently, XRP is showing signs of a potential bearish move after encountering strong resistance near the upper boundary of its descending channel on the daily chart. This upper trendline has acted as a formidable barrier, halting recent bullish attempts and reinforcing the overall downtrend structure. Related Reading: XRP Poised For Final Flush Before Breakout, Predicts Crypto Analyst The rejection at this level suggests that sellers are still dominating the market. If bearish momentum builds, the altcoin could revisit lower support levels within the channel, potentially retesting the lower boundary of the descending channel. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is approaching a potential bullish crossover. This pending cross between the MACD line and the signal line has caught the attention of traders, especially as it forms near a key technical zone. A confirmed crossover might indicate a possible trend reversal, hinting at growing bullish strength after a period of downside pressure. However, given recent market volatility and past failed breakouts, skepticism remains. Previous attempts in similar setups have led to fakeouts, temporary moves that fizzled out quickly. As a result, confirmed price action and volume are advised before positioning too aggressively. If accompanied by a breakout from nearby resistance, this cross could mark the beginning of a stronger upward move. Otherwise, it risks becoming just another false alarm in a choppy market. Support Zone In Focus As XRP Tests Lower Boundary XRP finds itself at a critical juncture as it moves toward the lower boundary of its descending channel. This area has served as a reliable support level in recent weeks, preventing deeper losses and providing a foundation for minor rebounds. As price action moves toward this zone, traders are watching closely to see whether buyers can defend it once again or if the bears will force a decisive breakdown. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Eyeing Another Breakout To $4: Analyst Says Watch This Level A sustained hold above this support zone may pave the way for a short-term bounce, targeting mid-channel resistance levels. However, a clean break below this lower boundary may ignite downside pressure, exposing XRP to fresh multi-week lows such as $0.9353. With sentiment currently fragile, this support test might be pivotal in shaping XRP’s next trend.

Here’s Why Cardano Whales are Excited,https://timestabloid.com/over-410-million-ada-in-february-heres-why-cardano-whales-are-excited/,"Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a prominent crypto analyst on X, recently highlighted that Cardano (ADA) whales accumulated over 410 million ADA tokens in April, signaling strong interest from large holders in the asset. This significant whale activity has contributed to a more bullish market sentiment around Cardano, as whale accumulation often indicates confidence in future price appreciation. Martinez’s observations coincide with a period where Cardano’s price showed notable upward momentum. The asset is currently up more than 7% from last month and 35.6% from its lowest point in April. Whales accumulated over 410 million #Cardano $ADA in April! pic.twitter.com/8Qa6xCaWtb — Ali (@ali_charts) May 2, 2025 The accumulation trend among wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA tokens suggests that whales view current price levels as attractive entry points, reinforcing optimism in the market. This growing demand from large investors tends to reduce available supply, fostering further price gains and encouraging retail investors to enter or increase their positions. Recent Cardano (ADA) Trading Patterns Martinez recently observed that Cardano (ADA) trades within a defined price channel , fluctuating between $0.69 and $0.77. Martinez notes that a breakout above $0.77 could be a bullish catalyst, potentially leading to upward momentum. Conversely, a drop below $0.69 may trigger bearish sentiment, putting ADA at risk of further declines. The asset is currently trading at $0.7004, and with whales accumulating, we could see a climb toward the upper resistance at $0.77 soon. Martinez has also emphasized the importance of the $0.80 to $0.66 price range as a critical support zone for ADA . He highlights that if ADA can stay above this range, it could be positioned for a significant move. This support range has historically acted as both resistance and support, indicating its significance in ADA’s price trajectory. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Potential New All-time High ADA has failed to reclaim its all-time high of $3.1 despite performing spectacularly in late 2024 and early 2025. However, this might change soon, as Martinez suggests that the asset could also rally toward $10 if it can break above $0.8, and another crucial support level at $1.2. He parallels ADA’s previous market cycles, where the cryptocurrency experienced significant gains following consolidation phases. Martinez’s projection aligns with past patterns that saw ADA surge dramatically after similar setups, and these bullish expectations have contributed to whale accumulation. This large-scale buying suggests confidence among major holders and sets the stage for potential price rallies. Retail investors must act fast so they don’t get left out when ADA’s price climbs.

Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Bitget Token, and Sei Could Lead the Charge",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-set-to-surge-ethereum-solana-xrp-bitget-token-and-sei-could-lead-the-charge/,"As mid-2025 approaches, the cryptocurrency market is showing signs of acceleration. Institutional flows, ecosystem upgrades, and bullish forecasts are spotlighting a select group of tokens: Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , XRP , Bitget Token (BGB) , and Sei (SEI) . While these high-visibility assets build traction, a strategic early-stage project— MAGACOINFINANCE —is gaining ground with a growing base of long-term investors. MAGACOINFINANCE – The Strategic Early Mover With 50% Bonus While major names command headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is building lasting relevance. With over $7.8 million raised and 12,500+ holders , this isn’t a hype-driven asset—it’s a calculated play on timing, branding, and momentum. Its narrative is gaining visibility across crypto forums, influencer circles, and Telegram groups. Investors acting early can still activate the 50% bonus using promo code MAGA50X during checkout—a reward reserved for strategic buyers before listings go live. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP Continue to Anchor Investor Confidence Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,764.03 , with analysts predicting a potential climb to $5,174 by year’s end. Network efficiency, ETF approval prospects, and sustained whale accumulation all point to strength heading into Q3. Solana (SOL) , at $142.17 , remains a leader in scalability and speed. With institutional use cases expanding and developer activity up, 2025 price targets continue to suggest a push toward $400 as sentiment improves. XRP , currently priced around $2.15 , is benefiting from strong ETF momentum. With ProShares’ product live and CME preparing its own launch, institutional flows are growing. A technical breakout above $2.45 could send XRP toward the $5 range according to analysts. Bitget Token and Sei – Infrastructure and Performance Focus Bitget Token (BGB) is priced at $4.33 , with stable platform usage supporting a projected move to $5.11 by late 2025. Its utility within Bitget’s exchange ecosystem and rising volume reflect growing demand among retail users. Sei (SEI) trades at $0.2109 , maintaining strength despite short-term fluctuations. Analysts point to potential movement above $0.2343 , especially as its high-speed architecture attracts developers building for low-latency performance. GG Final Thoughts Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Bitget Token, and Sei each offer distinct advantages for 2025 portfolios. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers something uniquely compelling—early-stage access to a movement with rising engagement and long-term structure. For forward-thinking investors, now may be the best time to get ahead of the curve.

The token was trading at $0.20, a few points below the April high of $0.2415. This article explores what to expect ahead of Monday’s Rebased upgrade. IOTA rebased upgrade is here IOTA, a distributed ledger technology network, will be in the spotlight this week as the developers launch the Rebased upgrade after months of testing. Rebased will introduce new changes that will change the network forever and make it a viable alternative to popular chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Sui. The first major part of the upgrade will be the introduction of smart contracts in the network. This will enable developers to build applications in areas like gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), and stablecoins. This will be a big change compared to the current version of IOTA. The current version uses a technology known as tangle, which uses the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach. Tangle is a network of transactions, where each transaction confirms the two previous ones. Tangle helps the network to eliminate the need for miners as users validate their transactions themselves. Dominik Schiener @DomSchiener · Follow The most important upgrade in IOTAs history And all the exchanges are supporting it. Thank you Binance 🙏I can’t wait for Monday 🔥 3:45 PM · May 3, 2025 363 Reply Copy link Read 37 replies Therefore, the rebased network will transform it from the tangle into a smart contract chain, which will be powered by the over 150 validators. These validators, including Nansen and Blockspace, are used to confirm transactions in the network. The other big change is that IOTA will now have staking, where investors are expected to earn an annual yield of between 10% and 15% over time. This is notable since these investors don’t earn anything today. Further, IOTA’s network will have Move Virtual Machine that will power its smart contracts. Eventually, the developers hope that it will handle over 50,000 transactions per second, much higher than what most blockchains have today. It will also have low transaction fees, sponsored transaction fees, and storage deposits. Rebased will also have an integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling apps created in the network to communicate with those built on the Ethereum network. Risks and opportunities The Rebased upgrade could make IOTA a better chain, boosting its price in the long term. A good example of this is Sonic , which transitioned from Fantom earlier this year. It has continued seeing a lot of traction that have pushed its total value locked to over $1 billion. The risk, however, is that IOTA will become just another chain in the crypto industry. That’s because the industry is highly saturated, with hundreds of chains that all offer unique solutions. IOTA has tried to become a better chain in the past. The most notable of this was its launch of Shimmer, a network that has struggled to gain traction among developers. IOTA price technical analysis IOTA price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the IOTA price has been in a tight range in the past few days. It peaked at $0.2415 on April 27 and then pulled back to the current $0.2055. This rebound happened after the coin formed a giant falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, there is a risk that the IOTA coin will drop after the Rebased upgrade because of a situation known as buying the rumor and selling the news. However, a jump above the key resistance level at $0.2415 will validate the bullish outlook and lead to more gains.

The global crypto market cap stood at $2.98 trillion, down 0.73% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin held steady above the $95,000 mark, while Ethereum hovered above $1,800. In this market, investors are increasingly focused on two projects with the potential for a sharp move. XRP is flashing bullish signals amid renewed whale accumulation and growing optimism over a potential spot ETF approval. Meanwhile, meme coin Bitcoin Pepe continues to garner investor attention. XRP price can rally Ripple’s XRP is showing signs of renewed strength as large holders ramp up accumulation ahead of key catalysts. On-chain data from Santiment indicates that wallets holding between 10 million and 100 million XRP added over 200 million tokens last week. The accumulation, interpreted by analysts as institutional positioning, comes amid heightened expectations of an XRP spot ETF approval. Polymarket odds for such an approval have surged to 80%, while the anticipated launch of ProShares’ XRP ETF on May 14 is fueling bullish sentiment. Currently trading around $2.20, XRP has bounced back from a brief dip to $2.15 on April 30, which triggered nearly $13.9 million in long liquidations. Despite that volatility, analysts such as Javon Marks remain optimistic. “With lower timeframes confirming bull signals, another upside move can be in the works for XRP,” he said.

Why Bitcoin Pepe is grabbing eyeballs Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself as the first project to unite two of crypto’s most powerful market forces—Bitcoin’s credibility and meme coin virality. As the team puts it: “The opportunity isn’t subtle. Meme coins hit $100B without Bitcoin. Bitcoin sits at $2T without memes. We’re the first to merge them.” Momentum behind the project is intensifying. The Bitcoin Pepe presale has raised more than $7.6 million, with demand continuing to build ahead of the transition to stage 10, which begins once contributions cross $7.78 million. The project introduces the PEP-20 token standard, which enables deployment of meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain—a first-of-its-kind infrastructure innovation. Presale stages feature roughly 5% price increases per round. BPEP has already climbed from $0.021 in its opening round to $0.031 in stage 9—a gain of over 40% for early participants. If the current trajectory holds, the token is expected to reach $0.0864 by the final stage, offering early backers potential triple-digit returns. Bitcoin Pepe isn’t shy about its mission: “We’re building the infrastructure that makes number go up forever, combining Bitcoin’s immortality with the pure, unfiltered power of memes.” With a presale structure that mirrors rising interest and a clear effort to build foundational tools for meme-based speculation, Bitcoin Pepe is shaping up to be more than just another viral play—it’s a platform built to scale with the next wave of crypto mania.

Leading this potential shift are Ethereum , Bitcoin , Solana , and the emerging early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE . While top-tier assets strengthen their positions, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly building traction and may be one of the few projects still offering early-phase entry for serious long-term upside. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Transitioning Into Visible Growth Mode Every successful crypto project moves from early groundwork to mainstream traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is now entering that crucial phase. Wallet adoption is rising. Community engagement is growing organically. Development milestones are being met consistently. These are the clear indicators of a project moving from silent build-up to broad investor recognition. Those entering now are acting on real-time progress, not speculation. Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana Maintain Market Leadership Bitcoin (BTC) remains the central asset in digital finance. With increasing institutional access via ETFs and global adoption trends, its role as a macro safe-haven is secure. Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate smart contract deployment, scaling innovation, and enterprise blockchain activity, with strong momentum from Layer-2 adoption and tokenization use cases. Solana (SOL) is gaining traction with developers and users for its low fees, fast transaction speed, and increasing relevance in decentralized applications and digital marketplaces. These projects are well-established. MAGACOINFINANCE , by contrast, offers an opportunity to enter during the growth phase—before broad market saturation. Additional Movers Supporting Market Expansion Uniswap leads the decentralized exchange space with high liquidity and a wide user base. Polkadot continues to develop scalable, interoperable blockchain environments through its parachain architecture. Litecoin remains a trusted peer-to-peer transaction asset with consistent speed and low transaction fees. These projects contribute to a strong market foundation—but MAGACOINFINANCE remains in an early discovery window where exponential returns are still possible. Final Insight May may mark a turning point in momentum. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are reinforcing their dominance—while MAGACOINFINANCE signals that it’s preparing for a significant move upward. With verifiable fundamentals and growing attention, the chance to get in early is narrowing.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said , “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.” Call for government officials who understand Bitcoin is “the future” “If she can’t outperform Bitcoin, she must buy it,” Pompliano said. Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said , “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.” Source: Julian Fahrer Wendy Rogers, who co-sponsored the bill with State Representative Jeff Weninger, also voiced her disappointment. “Politicians don’t understand that Bitcoin doesn’t need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin,” Rogers said . On May 2, Hobbs vetoed the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state officials. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs said. Source: Dr. Danish Rogers said she would refile the bill during her next session. Rogers also pointed out that Arizona’s state retirement system already holds stocks of Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR). “Which is basically a leveraged Bitcoin ETF. Arizona’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill will be back. HODL,” Rogers said. The stock price of Strategy rose 32% in April, the most significant monthly gain since November 2024 . Related: US gov’t actions give clue about upcoming crypto regulation However, well-known crypto skeptic Peter Schiff sided with Hobbs. “The government should not be making decisions to use public funds to speculate in cryptocurrencies,” Schiff said . Arizona would have become the first US state to establish a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve if it had passed. Arizona joins several other US states where similar efforts have failed. Similar proposals in Oklahoma, Montana , South Dakota and Wyoming have stalled or been withdrawn recently.

The tweet included an image showing two contrasting candlestick charts. A big red candlestick stands beside the Bitcoin logo, suggesting a significant crash. On the right, a large green candlestick and the XRP logo illustrated a bullish rally for XRP. At the center of the graphic stood a hooded figure with the label “SATOSHI’S IDENTITY REVEALED,” symbolizing the trigger for this hypothetical market disruption. This is what happens when Satoshi’s identity is revealed. $XRP BTC pic.twitter.com/oMBZLsnP1c — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 1, 2025 Underlying Assumptions and Intended Message Farina’s post assumes that the revelation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity would lead to a loss of confidence in Bitcoin, presumably due to fears over centralized control, legal exposure, or reputational damage tied to its origins. In contrast, the tweet implies that XRP, already positioned as a regulatory-compliant and utility-driven digital asset, would benefit from such a shift in sentiment. This portrayal aligns with Farina’s known support for XRP and skepticism toward Bitcoin’s origin story. The crypto community reacted to the post with a range of views. One user, CryptoScot, noted , “Hardly something to celebrate considering the whole market will follow it,” expressing concern that a collapse in Bitcoin could drag down the broader digital asset market. This reflects a common belief that Bitcoin’s price movements still influence most other cryptocurrencies due to its dominance in market capitalization and historical leadership in the sector. Community Weighs in With Mixed Reactions Another commenter, Ferny, raised doubts about institutional confidence in Bitcoin, writing , “I don’t see how any institutional investment firm could put money into Bitcoin on their client’s behalf when nobody knows supposedly who created it. We all know it was a three letter agency but the rest of the world is ignorant.” This comment underscores a longstanding concern about Bitcoin’s anonymity and potential geopolitical implications if its creator were revealed to be connected to a government intelligence agency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Some users dismissed the idea that a revelation about Satoshi’s identity would cause any significant market shift. One pointed out that claims to Nakamoto’s identity have emerged repeatedly over the years, only to be discredited, and suggested that such speculation has become a recurring cycle with little market impact. In their view, Bitcoin and XRP will likely continue growing regardless of identity disclosures, reinforcing the belief that both assets hold enduring relevance in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Speculation Highlights Ongoing Debate About Bitcoin’s Origins The post from Farina does not claim any new information regarding Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity, but hypothetically illustrates what he views as a possible redistribution of investor confidence and capital between Bitcoin and XRP. His simulation is speculative, yet it highlights a broader sentiment among XRP supporters who believe the asset is structurally and legally better positioned for long-term institutional adoption. At present, Satoshi Nakamoto remains unidentified, and the market continues to price Bitcoin and XRP according to broader macroeconomic and regulatory factors. However, as Edward Farina’s tweet illustrates, the question of Bitcoin’s origin still lingers in the minds of many and could, in theory, hold influence over the future direction of digital asset markets.

XRP holders are bracing for a potential breakout, possibly up to $12, as confidence grows on a possible spot ETF approval. Then, Dogecoin continues to direct the meme coin script, and although it’s under strong selling pressure these past few days, some analysts see a bullish momentum. XRP and DOGE may be generating plenty of bullish sentiments lately, but their price targets would potentially pale in comparison to a crypto project that’s heating up: Remittix . Built using the PayFi DNA, its devs are hoping to disrupt the cross-border payments scene by offering a crypto-to-fiat settlement solution. A new PayFi chapter emerges: Remittix improves on the XRP model Cross-border payments act as the backbone of international trade and commerce, offering enterprises and individuals a quick and easy way to pay, invest, and remit funds. Ripple was one of the OGs, with XRP acting as a bridge to complete the transfers, from fiat to XRP , then an exchange, sold for fiat again. Traditional fintech apps like Spribe and Wise boast fiat-to-fiat settlements. But Remittix offers a PayFi gamechanger: users can enjoy crypto-to-fiat transfers. Remittix’s Pay API updates the traditional cross-border payment narratives. With Remittix, you skip the high fees and slow transactions, and prep for ultra-low fees and instant settlements. The Pay API works as a crypto and fiat bridge, and you just like your wallet, and you’re good to go. XRP holders look up to $12 as the next long-term target Image: Ripple’s XRP is up 324% year-on-year per CoinGecko XRP is currently trading between $2.20 and $2.26, with $2.33 as its short-term price resistance. It’s still trading above the $2.20 support level, marked by the confluence of the 50 and the 100-day EMAs. Although the asset hasn’t made a significant price move recently, many are betting on Ripple’s XRP potential breakout above its descending trendline resistance, supported by a buy signal from its MACD indicator. There’s also bullish sentiments on XRP , with the odds of spot ETFs approval shooting to 85% from just 65%. However, discussions on Ripple’s XRP have considerably declined over the past three months. This decline in social media mentions could stall XRP’s potential surge in the short term. In the $2.20 support caves in, holders and investors may see $1.99 for potential reversal. Can DOGE breach $3? Just like XRP , Dogecoin is banking on the news and potential approval of the asset’s spot ETFs. The Thursday update from Santiment indicates increasing hype and confidence in the Dogecoin ETFs. Last month, major firms, including Bitwise and 21Shares, filed their paperwork to launch DOGE spot ETFs. These filings by established financial institutions suggest a growing mainstream acceptance not just for DOGE , but for crypto too. Image: After slipping to $0.1320 last April 7th, DOGE is back to trading above $0.1600 Currently, DOGE is trading between $0.1796 and $0.184, and while $3 is a long shot for now, analysts are keeping an eye on its price action. It also helps that DOGE’s social dominance just hit a 3-month high, suggesting accumulation and bullish momentum. Remittix reinvents PayFi, as early adopters set sights on a 13,000% rally While XRP and DOGE holders are banking on a SEC approval for spot ETFs, the long waiting times often create uncertainties. As these top altcoins face uncertain times, Remittix races to its listing date with a purpose: it’s set to revolutionize cross-border payments with its crypto-to-fiat solution. Early adopters are in for a treat: initially priced at $0.015, its ERC-20-based RTX token now sells at $0.0757, with plenty of price increases in the pipeline before its official launch. With still nearly 30% of the total supply waiting to be sold, plus a typical listing surge, a 13,000% rally can’t be ruled out.

Qubetics aims to solve practical problems that its predecessors have struggled with—namely, making the process of tokenizing real-world assets easier, more accessible, and secure for everyone, whether you’re an individual or a business. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace by Qubetics will make this process seamless, allowing for better liquidity, faster transactions, and more efficient management of assets. This will benefit not only blockchain developers and tech enthusiasts but also industries like real estate, insurance, and art, which will see tremendous value from tokenizing their assets. Astra: A Decentralized Finance Game-Changer Astra is one of the most exciting coins on the market right now. It’s making a big name for itself by focusing on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and offering users a chance to engage in secure and profitable financial transactions without intermediaries. Astra’s mission is simple: decentralize finance and put the power back into the hands of individuals. Astra operates through its AstraSwap feature, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade assets with high liquidity and minimal slippage. This functionality positions Astra as a formidable player in the space, particularly as DeFi continues to grow. With its robust smart contract capabilities, Astra’s ecosystem also supports other financial services, such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming. These features provide opportunities for users to earn returns on their digital assets while maintaining full control of their funds. In the competitive world of DeFi, Astra’s growth potential is immense, and its inclusion in the best coins to join now is certainly justified. As the space continues to mature, Astra is poised to continue expanding, attracting more users with its user-friendly interface, security features, and seamless blockchain technology. Mantra: Driving Blockchain Interoperability When it comes to blockchain interoperability, few coins have made a more significant impact than Mantra. The project’s focus on enabling seamless communication between different blockchain ecosystems is crucial as the industry continues to expand. By solving the problem of cross-chain communication, Mantra is unlocking new possibilities for decentralized applications (dApps) and making blockchain more user-friendly for everyone. At its core, Mantra operates on the Mantra Protocol, which enables developers to build decentralized applications that work across multiple blockchains. This means users will no longer be limited to a single blockchain for their decentralized services. Whether it’s through cross-chain staking, lending, or governance, Mantra is breaking down the silos between blockchains and driving the next level of blockchain adoption. The project is currently gaining momentum with new partnerships, integrations, and enhanced features that promise to improve scalability and user experience. Mantra’s value proposition lies in its ability to bridge the gap between different ecosystems, ensuring users can access a broader range of decentralized services without worrying about compatibility. For those looking for a solid coin that can help usher in the future of blockchain interoperability, Mantra is certainly one to keep on your radar. Real World Asset Tokenization: A Game-Changer for Digital Finance Understanding the concept of Real World Asset Tokenization is key to appreciating the long-term value of Qubetics. This process involves converting tangible assets—like real estate, stocks, and commodities—into digital tokens on the blockchain. These tokens represent ownership or a share in the real-world asset, enabling easier access to liquidity and more flexible asset management. Qubetics is leading the charge in this area with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This marketplace allows for the smooth integration of physical assets into the blockchain world, offering businesses, professionals, and individuals a way to interact with these assets more efficiently. Here are some key features of the Qubetics Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Increased Liquidity : Tokenized assets can be traded or transferred with ease, offering better liquidity than traditional asset classes. Security : Blockchain’s immutability ensures secure transactions, reducing the risks associated with fraud. Access to New Markets : Tokenization opens doors to a global market, where previously inaccessible assets can now be traded. Efficiency : Tokenization simplifies the management of assets, reducing costs and increasing transparency. This innovation is set to disrupt industries by offering new ways to invest, manage, and interact with real-world assets. Conclusion With Qubetics, Astra, and Mantra leading the charge in blockchain innovation, the future of digital finance looks incredibly promising. These projects are tackling real-world issues—whether it’s asset tokenization, decentralized finance, or blockchain interoperability—and offering practical solutions that the market has been waiting for. If you’re searching for the best coins to join now , these three are definitely worth watching in 2025 and beyond.

The original tweet from CoinDesk stated that Morgan Stanley is reportedly exploring the launch of cryptocurrency trading via its E*Trade platform. While this development is notable in its own right, SMQKE focuses on a documented position Morgan Stanley took in the past regarding Ripple and its distributed ledger technology. Remember, “Morgan Stanley has stated that adopting a Ripple-like payment system could ""shorten settlement periods, speed up transactions and reduce the risk of fraud.” “Morgan Stanley considers Ripple to be a leading international payment alternative to Swift.” … https://t.co/Rpmk5HOcjS pic.twitter.com/ovRTx6IYbH — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 1, 2025 Ripple’s Documented Recognition by Morgan Stanley SMQKE cited a passage from Volume 36 of the Review of Banking and Financial Law, referencing Morgan Stanley’s remarks from a 2016 report titled Global Insight: Blockchain in Banking—Disruptive Threat or Tool?. The excerpt clearly states that Morgan Stanley identified Ripple’s payment system as capable of shortening settlement periods, increasing transaction speeds, and reducing fraud. Furthermore, Morgan Stanley was documented as having considered Ripple to be “a leading international payment alternative to Swift,” the long-established global financial messaging network. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Infrastructure Considerations Behind the Trading News This context adds weight to the broader implications of Morgan Stanley’s reported crypto expansion. Although the CoinDesk tweet did not mention Ripple, the resurfaced legal and academic documentation reveals that the firm had, at least at one point, publicly acknowledged Ripple’s technology as a viable infrastructure upgrade in the global payments sector. The quote is from a reputable academic publication and directly references a Morgan Stanley-authored analysis, indicating institutional-level consideration of Ripple’s distributed ledger approach. A Broader Strategy Beyond Asset Trading Morgan Stanley’s interest in enabling crypto trading through its E*Trade platform marks an incremental step in integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. However, SMQKE’s post places this move within a broader historical context that suggests Morgan Stanley’s crypto strategy may not merely be about trading functionality but could also encompass infrastructure-level adoption and alignment with blockchain technologies acknowledged by the institution. Although Morgan Stanley has not recently reaffirmed this specific stance on Ripple, the documented record stands as part of its publicly available analysis. As institutional involvement in crypto continues to advance, references like this serve to highlight how leading financial players have been evaluating blockchain applications beyond speculative assets, including payment and settlement innovations such as those enabled by Ripple.

This move follows ETH’s significant price decline in early 2025, which prompted the firm to reassess its strategy. From Dual Lending to Bitcoin-Only Over the past 15 months, Two Prime facilitated $1.5 billion in loans using both Bitcoin and Ether. However, citing Ethereum’s instability and underwhelming performance, the firm announced on May 1 that it would now concentrate entirely on Bitcoin for both asset management and lending operations. “ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Prime stated, signaling a complete pivot. ETH’s Unpredictability a Major Concern A key reason behind the firm’s decision is what it describes as Ethereum’s loss of predictable trading behavior. As an algorithmic trading firm, Two Prime emphasizes the importance of consistent data patterns for its models. “Ether no longer trades predictably,” the firm said. “As an algorithmic trading firm, we value data more than narratives… the data suggests ETH has fundamentally changed.” The firm explained that Ether has decoupled from Bitcoin and now behaves more like a memecoin. They noted ETH experienced “several multi-standard deviation moves” during Q1 2025, in contrast to Bitcoin’s relatively steady behavior. “It trades now like a memecoin rather than a predictable asset,” the company added. “Even during the turbulence of Q1 2025, Bitcoin remained within its fundamental behavior, whereas ETH saw several multi-standard deviation moves.” Impact on Algorithmic Trading and Lending Such volatility poses serious challenges for firms like Two Prime that rely on quantitative strategies. The unpredictability of ETH’s price action not only complicates trading but also undermines ETH-backed lending practices, which rely on certain levels of price stability. The firm remarked that ETH’s behavior creates a “headache” for algorithmic trading and undermines lending reliability, “even by the high volatility expectations of digital asset markets.” Criticism Triggers Community Reaction Two Prime’s harsh assessment of Ethereum didn’t go unnoticed. Some crypto enthusiasts saw the firm’s exit as a contrarian indicator — a possible sign that ETH is nearing a price bottom. One user commented, “What a retarded essay statement,” referencing the S&P 500’s own 4.7% decline year-to-date. Others questioned Two Prime’s relevance altogether: “Never even heard of them. Seems irrelevant.” “If this isn’t a bottom signal for ETH idk what is,” another person noted, suggesting that the worst might be over for Ethereum. Weak ETH ETF Performance Adds Pressure Adding to ETH’s woes, Two Prime pointed to the underwhelming performance of Ethereum-based ETFs. While Bitcoin ETFs have attracted substantial institutional investment, ETH ETFs have lagged far behind, with BTC ETF purchases outpacing ETH by nearly 24 times. “The failure of ETH’s ETF creates a reflexive loop whereby institutions like BlackRock dedicate fewer resources to their promotion and sale. BTC has found the mainstream while ETH has floundered,” Two Prime stated. Despite this, Ethereum still dominates among altcoin ETFs in terms of assets under management (AUM). Recent data shows Ether-based exchange-traded products hold $9.2 billion in AUM, well ahead of Solana and XRP, which have $1.4 billion and $1 billion, respectively. ETF Landscape Adds to ETH Struggles Following the US SEC’s approval of spot Ether ETFs in May 2024, the asset saw a muted reception. Investor enthusiasm has waned, and some issuers have backed away — VanEck halted Ether futures ETF trading, WisdomTree withdrew its proposal, and ARK dissolved its futures ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ether in March 2025. Founded in 2019 by Alexander Blum and Marc Fleury, Two Prime had been active in both Bitcoin and Ethereum lending until this dramatic pivot. Whether their exit marks a low point for ETH or simply reflects a broader trend remains to be seen.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-04 06:40:14

Although XRP’s price has remained relatively sluggish on a weekly scale, industry experts believe whale accumulation is “insanely bullish.” As the graph below will show you, XRP whales went on a substantial buying spree after the US elections, which was somewhat expected given the anticipation for big regulatory changes in the country that could affect domestic crypto businesses, such as Ripple. After a minor hiatus in December when the total number of such investors dropped, they returned in full force at the start of 2025 and haven’t looked back since, aside from some minor deviations. Data from Glassnode shows that the number of addresses holding over 10,000 XRP has gone above 300,000, which is a record of its own. According to popular industry commentator Amonyx, this is “insanely bullish” as it serves as “absolute proof of surging investor confidence.” INSANELY BULLISH: #XRP whales are showing up BIG time! According to Glassnode, the number of addresses holding 10K+ XRP just smashed past 300K — absolute proof of surging investor confidence. The big money knows what’s coming. Do you? pic.twitter.com/u1cVJApFjg — Amonyx (@amonbuy) May 3, 2025 Recall that whales bought over 900,000,000 XRP in April alone. In USD terms, this massive fortune was worth close to $2 billion. With the SEC legal case seemingly behind Ripple, the company is now focused on expansion after the acquisition of Hidden Road and the failed attempt to take over Circle. The XRP Army, on the other hand, is anticipating the approval of a spot ETF after the recent good news on the futures ETF front. However, the US securities regulator delayed making a decision on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF applications and the new deadline is set for mid-June. ETF experts believe the summer of 2025 will see the approval of numerous such financial vehicles tracking the performance of various cryptocurrencies, including XRP. Maybe that’s what the “big money” is preparing for.

The tweet, accompanied by an image of a historical XRP chart, included the caption: “$XRP BULLSIH FLAG! Consolidation phase before the next BIG move!” The chart image, which appears to be from 2021, showcases a dramatic upward movement in XRP’s price —commonly known as the “flagpole”—followed by a descending consolidation phase bounded by two parallel trendlines. This structure is often identified as a bullish flag in technical analysis, a pattern that usually indicates the potential for continued upward momentum following a brief corrective period. $XRP BULLSIH FLAG! Consolidation phase before the next BIG move! pic.twitter.com/XoUApfCeg2 — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 1, 2025 Farina’s post was direct in its interpretation. It says that the current positioning of the price within this pattern could signify an impending surge. His “bullish flag” suggests optimism in the price action and hints at expectations for a breakout above the consolidation channel. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Adds Technical Context Other users on the X platform contributed their observations in response to Farina’s post. A user identified as Nexus Token elaborated on the nature of the bullish flag pattern using recent price action: “In the past week, XRP shot up from about $1.85 to $2.30. Then it consolidated in a $2.10–$2.30 range, sloping slightly down. Volume dropped during this pullback. That setup fits a classic ‘bull flag’: sharp pole, then a flag-shaped consolidation.” This explanation aligns with textbook definitions of the pattern, where a steep initial rise is followed by a tight, downward-sloping range and a decrease in trading volume. The implication is that a breakout from this consolidation could initiate another significant upward movement, contingent on volume and price action confirmation. Pattern Referenced from 2021 Cycle What Farina shared depicts the XRP price behavior around late 2020 to mid-2021. During that period, XRP experienced a major rally followed by several corrective phases. While this historical reference may not reflect the exact current market dynamics, it appears that Farina used the past chart to suggest a similar structural behavior could be occurring again. Using historical patterns to draw inferences about future price movements is a common practice in technical analysis. In this case, Farina’s tweet does not explicitly claim that current XRP price action is forming the same pattern, but the implication is that the past setup may offer a model for interpreting the present market.

44137793,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720351,1746342000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44137793.jpeg,"Which Looks Stronger for May ROI: Cardano, Solana, or a Rebounding XRP?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-looks-stronger-for-may-roi-cardano-solana-or-a-rebounding-xrp/,"As the crypto market begins to shift in early May 2025, traders are closely watching the price action of three major altcoins — Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and XRP — to assess which offers the best return potential in the short term. While all three show technical setups worth monitoring, a growing number of investors are eyeing a new entrant — MAGACOIN FINANCE — for its outsized upside and early-stage momentum. Here’s how each asset stacks up in terms of projected ROI this month. Cardano: Steady but Capped Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.7031 , reflecting modest strength as it hovers above key support. A bounce to the $0.78–$0.80 range remains possible if overall sentiment improves, but ADA has yet to reclaim the strong upward momentum it showed earlier in the year. Despite network growth and a loyal community, ADA’s price action remains relatively muted. Analysts forecast a +10% to +15% upside through May, assuming no major catalyst emerges. Solana: Momentum Slows Near Resistance Solana (SOL), trading around $147.87 , is facing overhead resistance that could limit near-term upside. While its Layer 1 credentials remain unmatched in terms of speed and ecosystem activity, traders say the bulk of short-term gains may already be priced in. If SOL breaks above the $155 level with volume, a move to $165 is feasible, which would reflect a +12% to +18% gain . Without that push, consolidation may continue through mid-May. XRP: Quiet Rebound in Progress XRP’s slow recovery in April sees the cryptocurrency recently trading at $2.19. If prices surpass $2.30, a technical breakout could follow as some analysts foresee a +15% to +22% upside with recovering institutional sentiment. Ripple’s ongoing regulatory developments, combined with renewed speculation on global partnerships, add to XRP’s bullish case in the short term. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Asset With Massive Upside The promise of short-term returns of a structured but limited nature is available from ADA, SOL and XRP. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as an early-stage project that is worth considering. The token is trading at sub-0.07, nonetheless; it’s gaining some traction owing the clean tokenomics, no VC dilution and road-map that is milestone driven. Analyst projections place MAGACOIN FINANCE’s potential ROI between 3000% and 3200% over the next year, with some estimates calling for a potential return up to 3250% based on entry timing and listing valuations. The token remains off major exchanges for now — a feature, not a flaw — offering early investors exclusive access before wider market recognition. Unlike saturated large caps, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for asymmetric upside, making it an attractive option for those seeking more than incremental gains. Cardano, Solana and XRP are all worth holding for a diversified portfolio. But if you’re looking for the maximum percentage ROI in the current cycle, then MAGACOIN FINANCE could the best entry. Investors are quickly repositioning themselves for imminent visibility increase amid ongoing market rotation.

The company now owns over half a million bitcoins, making it one of the biggest institutional players in the crypto market. However, the company isn’t done yet, as recent filings shows an ambitious $84 billion plan to acquire more Bitcoins. Related Reading: Strategy’s $84 Billion Bitcoin Appetite: Michael Saylor Goes All In (Again) As the Bitcoin price hovers around $97,000 in early May, the scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin plan is important, not only for its size but also for the significant role it now plays in the company’s trajectory. Strategy’s 42/42 Plan To Increase Bitcoin Holdings During its latest earnings call, Strategy introduced what it calls the 42/42 Plan, which is a roadmap aimed at raising $84 billion in capital over the next two years. The funding will be split equally between equity and fixed-income instruments, all designated to be used for further Bitcoin acquisitions. This initiative follows a $21 billion at-the-market equity offering that recently brought in over 301,000 BTC in recent months, sending the company’s share price soaring by 50%. As of April 28, 2025, Strategy holds 553,555 BTC, acquired at a total cost of $37.9 billion and an average price of $68,459 per coin. Of this total, 107,155 BTC have been bought in 2025 alone, making it the company’s most aggressive buying year to date despite only four months having passed. The firm’s internal disclosures also note an average cost of $66,384.56 per bitcoin. The latest acquisition round included 15,355 BTC purchased at an average price of $92,737 on April 28 at $1.42 billion. These aggressive purchases have positioned Strategy as the world’s second-largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, just behind BlackRock. Image from Bitbo Interestingly, Strategy’s playbook for building a BTC-heavy balance sheet is not slowing down. Even as the company reported its fifth consecutive quarterly net loss, investor sentiment is still optimistic. The company reported an unrealized $5.9 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025. However, its stock is up by approximately 32% since the beginning of the year and has outperformed the Nasdaq 100 index, which is down nearly 6% over the same period. Related Reading: HBAR To $2? Hedera Rides Real-World Asset Wave Toward Breakout How Strategy Is Doing On Its Current BTC Holdings Strategy’s market value is now deeply influenced by Bitcoin’s price direction. The company’s BTC portfolio has yielded a 13.7% return so far in 2025, generating a paper gain of $5.8 billion. Despite the crypto market volatility, the company updated its BTC yield target from 15% to 25% and a $15 billion profit goal by the end of the year. Image From Strategy.com At the time of writing, Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy continues to pay well, and the company’s stock has been rising in tandem with Bitcoin’s recent rally. MSTR is currently up by 3.35% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $394.37. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is trading at $96,500.

Four standouts— Bitcoin (BTC) , XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , and Aptos (APT) —are flashing strong signals across both technical and macro indicators. While capital rotates into assets with real-world traction, a rising early-stage name, MAGACOINFINANCE , is also gaining serious attention for its unique positioning. MAGACOINFINANCE – A Strategic Play With Explosive Potential While blue-chip coins dominate headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is making strategic moves beneath the radar. With over $7.8 million raised and a community now exceeding 12,500 holders , the project has earned credibility as a serious early-stage contender. Backed by strong branding, community alignment, and growing media mentions, MAGACOINFINANCE is climbing—on purpose and with precision. Early investors can still activate the 50% token bonus using promo code MAGA50X during the final days of its pre-sale. Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP – Institutional Tailwinds Gain Strength Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $95,000 , showing resilience following a strong April. With ETF flows continuing to rise and market confidence stabilizing, analysts forecast a move toward $132,000 if May continues on this bullish track. XRP , holding firm near $2.15 , is strengthening on the back of institutional inflows and futures ETF momentum. With CME Group’s futures product expected by mid-May, a break above $2.45 could propel XRP into a new phase of demand—especially among traditional finance players. Ethereum (ETH) and Aptos (APT) – Building on Infrastructure and Adoption Ethereum (ETH) remains a foundational pillar, trading around $1,736 . Bullish on-chain data, AI integrations, and whale activity continue to support its trajectory toward the $2,500–$2,700 range. Ethereum’s dominance across Layer-1 ecosystems remains unshaken. Aptos (APT) recently surged 18% in a single week, boosted by news of its digital wallet integration with Expo 2025 Osaka . This real-world utility is giving APT a visibility boost among institutional and retail investors alike. With support building near $9.35, momentum could carry it toward fresh 2025 highs. Final Thoughts For investors working with $684 or more, this cycle isn’t just about buying what’s familiar—it’s about identifying where growth is building. BTC, XRP, ETH , and APT bring solid upside potential. But MAGACOINFINANCE offers something different: a shot at early entry into a movement that’s just getting started .

In a new YouTube interview with Natalie Brunell, Pysh says the global financial system is fundamentally flawed because it allows governments to issue currency without a “global peg,” or a trusted asset that guarantees its value. Pysh argues that Bitcoin is the only asset capable of addressing the root cause of currency debasement and recurring market meltdowns. “The problem in the world was there was no global peg. There was no global peg that could be trusted. That was truly the problem. That’s why fiat kept expanding. That’s why you got these crazy valuations it’s because they’ll just print more money and then it just continues to blow out and create chaos because nobody can trust the underlying fundamental unit. So there was no peg. That’s what Bitcoin was solving.” Pysh also believes that Bitcoin’s primary function is to serve as a store of value, with its use as a cash-like medium being secondary. “How in the world are all these governments going to come to a collective consensus that they can trust each other when everybody is racing to debase their currency? There was no solution. People were telling me, ‘Oh, it will be the IMF and [its] special drawing rights and all this other stuff,’ which all required trust. And I was like, ‘I don’t think so. I don’t think that solves it.’ And so then I see Bitcoin like, ‘Finally, here’s something that actually solves this massive, huge engineering problem… I think that you have to first have store of value, and it has to continue to appreciate in value because of its store of value properties before people are going to want to conduct commerce and everyday payments, and it is treated as cash.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,956.

The current stage (phase 4) of MUTM stands at a price of $0.025 per token with the project filling up 55% resulting in a phase 5 rollout at $0.03 token value. Cardano on the other hand manages a 12% increase which takes its price to $0.70 yet its technical indicators show signs of warning. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is soaring at a fast rate despite Cardano investors showing signs of impatience with its slow progress. The market eyes whether DeFi initiative MUTM will scale past Cardano prices to reach $5 before ADA reaches $2. The crypto market watches closely. Cardano’s Fading Momentum ADA faces challenges to survive at its current position. The price surge to $0.70 along with increased trading volume to $723 million shows short-term market strength although ADA’s 12% rise indicates its momentum may be fading. The BBTrend indicator shows weakening volatility by moving from 13.27 to 7.55. The Directional Movement Index analysis shows conflicting signals because the ADX decreased down to 17.14 indicating an ongoing trend deterioration. The $0.69 price level which supports Cardano remains fragile against current market stresses. Market prices might drop to $0.63 or lower once the current support level breaks down. The current market reluctance to invest comes from investors who prefer faster-moving projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands in phase 4 of its total 11-stage journey. The current phase of token sales for $0.025 has reached more than half of its capacity. During phase 5 Mutuum Finance will increase prices from their current $0.025 to $0.03. All investors who purchase during phase 4 will get an immediate price boost. Tokenomics within the project establish a 140% profit opportunity for investors who buy at the presale price of $0.06. Research analysts predict $3 as the eventual market value which would result in an exceptional 11,900% profit from current prices. The MUTM dashboard ranks its leading 50 token holders to receive bonus tokens if they maintain their positions. Security and Stability in Focus Trust is the core value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is implementing as a fundamental principle. A smart contract audit from Certik is in its last stages and the team will release the results on social media platforms. MUTM continually demonstrates its dedication to transparent operations by making this strategic announcement in an industry still characterized by market volatility. The project achieves stability by using loans with excess collateral between peer-to-peer and pool-based network systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides instant practical value and has succeeded in capturing 9,400 users. The impending end of phase 4 intensifies the investor rush to buy tokens at their current low values because investors want to escape missing out on this opportunity. Mutuum’s Meteoric Potential Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) rapid growth outshines the measured implementation of Cardano. The price of ADA faces challenges at $0.746 along with potential market drops to $0.59 but Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) price model shows straight paths toward rapid return gains. The target price of $3 after post-launch launches stands significantly higher than Cardano’s current target price of $2 but phase 4’s starting price of $0.025 is diminishing rapidly. Information seekers focused on 2025’s number one investment have to decide whether to wait for Cardano’s unpredictable market gains or participate in Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale run-up to phase 5’s price escalation.

There’s seemingly a new player every day . Virtual has been grabbing headlines lately, and nobody had heard of it five minutes ago. It is certainly worth evaluating. Also new on the crypto table is Remittix , and this new token is also grabbing its fair share of the headlines for all the right reasons. But how do these new tokens stack against an established player like Cardano ? Virtual (VIRTUAL): Profitable but cynical Ask what Virtual is, and you get the response that Virtual aims to revolutionize decentralized finance by integrating autonomous AI agents with meme coin culture, enabling community-driven trading, yield generation, and innovative DeFi applications. That is a ton of word salad to say that Virtual is trying to blend all the crypto buzzwords into one product, and ironically, it’s working. Again, Virtual was a nothingburger since its inception a bit more than a year ago. In typical crypto fashion, it blew up in January, delivering more than a 100x return from a price of 3 cents in September to peaking at $5.15. An amazing yield, but in crypto, we call that Tuesday. Virtual predictably lost all its value, which is also par for the course for crypto. But now Virtual seems to be back and has delivered a 3x result since the middle of April. Can Virtual ‘s new growth be sustained? Without a clear use case and confusing word salad as a product description, one needs to be careful. New tokens often upset the old, but not all new tokens have value. Source: Coincodex Cardano (ADA): Stress-free in stability Cardano , by contrast, is not nearly as volatile. Cardano is one of the old-guard establishment tokens. While Cardano is not setting the world on fire, it is a steady platform to ride out market uncertainty. While it shows a red candle for YTD figures, out of the top-ten tokens, it is only outperformed by XRP and Bitcoin. Source: Coincodex Cardano has outpaced Solana, its fiercest competitor, and kicked sand in the face of Ethereum. Cardano could play the role of an anchor token while investors seek to build profits from other tokens. Ultimately, Cardano can still claim the most technologically advanced blockchain yet developed, which will count for something in the long term. Remittix (RTX): Predictable profits, long-term sustainability. Remittix blends the novelty of Virtual with the long-term staying power of Cardano , and this is why it has been grabbing YouTube vlogger attention and gained over $14.7 million in presale liquidity. The Reason for Remittix ‘s popularity? It is the world’s first crypto-to-fiat payment system, allowing its users to use crypto infrastructure to send money to almost any fiat-based bank account in the world. It’s cross-border payments without the delays, the high costs, or regulatory hoops to jump through. Remittix is the perfect blend of crypto’s convenience with the global acceptance of fiat. The potential for Remittix is obvious, and this token has every chance of making it among the established tokens like Cardano . Conclusion Making the right crypto decisions can be tricky. It is easy to fall into the trap of seeing the green candle spikes, as is the case with Virtual , but one needs to ask, what does it do? Virtual cannot give a clear answer to that, instead, delivering buzzwords and hype. Compare that with Cardano , which can state what it is and does in an easy-to-understand sentence. Cardano may not be as exciting, but it will still be around in 5 years. This is why many people are standing behind Remittix . It’s a solid and simple use case with universal appeal and can change how the world makes payments forever. Remittix is now available at $0.0757 directly from the website.

According to the company's report, despite the optimistic atmosphere in the market, transaction volume and the number of active addresses remain at historically low levels. According to Alphractal's findings, there are seven main reasons behind this situation: Price is driven by external factors rather than on-chain usage: The current price of Bitcoin is driven by external factors such as institutional capital inflows into spot ETFs rather than actual on-chain usage. Low volatility: Low volatility reduces the motivation of traders to trade, leading to a decline in on-chain transactions. Artificial stock market volumes: Exaggerating trading volumes on some exchanges may be hiding the true level of usage on the network. Limited practical demand: Bitcoin’s price is mostly maintained through derivatives and speculative instruments rather than daily usage on-chain. The market is in the consolidation phase: Investors tend to wait until macroeconomic developments or clear signals come in. This limits coin movements. Related News: Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Explains Why the SEC Withdrew Its Appeal in the Case Proliferation of Tier-2 solutions: Layer two solutions like the Lightning Network cause transactions to shift off-chain, which makes mainnet activity appear low. Shift of speculative activities to other networks: Networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Base are attracting transaction-intensive activities like DeFi, staking, and memecoins, which is causing the dynamism on the Bitcoin main chain to decrease. Alphractal states that the current situation reveals that Bitcoin is starting to be considered more like a “financial asset” rather than a “blockchain technology”. This indicates that the link between on-chain usage and price is gradually weakening. *This is not investment advice.

44138963,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66054,1746344362,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Are Stablecoins Replacing XRP? Expert Clarifies Roles In Digital Finance,https://timestabloid.com/are-stablecoins-replacing-xrp-expert-clarifies-roles-in-digital-finance/,"A recent post from Britto, a community dedicated to Arthur Britto, co-creator of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), offers a detailed explanation of the differing roles of XRP and stablecoins in the digital financial ecosystem. Through a straightforward comparison, the post seeks to correct misconceptions about XRP being replaced by stablecoins. XRP vs. Stablecoins: The Ultimate Showdown ""Stablecoins are replacing XRP!"" That's like saying Google Maps replaced Wi-Fi. You're confusing the app with the infrastructure. Let's dive in. https://t.co/kMc897E25K pic.twitter.com/jKCHUMd76U — Britto (@BrittoXrpl) May 1, 2025 Misunderstanding the Function of XRP and Stablecoins The tweet addresses a common claim: that stablecoins are replacing XRP. According to Britto, this view misunderstands the fundamental purpose of each asset. Comparing the situation to confusing an application with the infrastructure it operates on, Britto frames XRP as the underlying connector — the “bridge currency” — in contrast to stablecoins, which it describes as digital versions of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar or euro. Britto describes XRP as an “international translator” capable of facilitating cross-border transactions by enabling interoperability between different currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are portrayed as static stores of value, useful for holding but not designed to move value across systems. This distinction sets the foundation for the rest of the post, which explores the practical differences between the two assets. Real-World Application: XRP in Cross-Border Transactions To illustrate their point, Britto outlines a hypothetical scenario. A bank in Japan wants to send $10 million to Mexico. Using stablecoins such as USDC would require identifying liquidity partners, dealing with foreign exchange (FX) fees, and navigating compliance processes — all of which introduce friction and complexity. By contrast, Britto presents XRP, specifically when used through Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, as a more streamlined option. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The transaction would automatically convert yen into XRP and then into Mexican pesos, all without the need for pre-funded accounts or multiple intermediaries. According to the post, this demonstrates the core utility of XRP as a bridge asset : its ability to move value efficiently across borders in real time. Liquidity and Decentralization: Key Differentiators Britto further emphasizes that liquidity — the ability to convert assets quickly at low cost — is more critical than stability in cross-border transfers. While stablecoins may offer low volatility, their need for localized liquidity pairs and centralized oversight makes them less efficient in global value transfer scenarios. In contrast, XRP is described as providing on-demand liquidity through a decentralized system that carries lower counterparty risk. This decentralization, according to Britto, offers an additional layer of reliability. Stablecoins remain dependent on centralized issuers and can be subject to restrictions such as freezing or blacklisting. XRP, as part of the XRPL, is not controlled by a central authority, offering a more trustworthy alternative for moving value globally. Ripple’s Multi-Asset Strategy and Final Takeaway The post also clarifies Ripple’s broader strategic direction. Ripple’s launch of a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD , is not positioned as a competitor to XRP but as a complementary tool within its expanding suite of financial products. Britto likens this to adding a screwdriver to a toolbox with a hammer, underscoring that different assets serve different functions within a financial network. Britto reinforces the message that XRP and stablecoins are not interchangeable. Stablecoins are built for stability and storage; XRP is built for speed and transfer. Each has its place, and one does not replace the other. The post closes by rejecting binary thinking in financial innovation, asserting that the future of digital finance depends on applying the right tool for the specific task at hand.

44139085,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720532,1746344483,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44139085.jpeg,Fed chair Powell makes it clear he’s not cutting interest rates at this week’s meeting,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-powell-not-cutting-rates/,"Federal Reserve officials are meeting this Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, and Jerome Powell already spelled it out—interest rates are staying exactly where they are. He’s brushing off the mounting political heat from President Donald Trump, who wants them lowered fast, and instead sticking to the plan: hold steady and watch the numbers. Now Trump is pissed. He’s been hammering the Fed nonstop over its refusal to cut. The pressure’s coming not just from him but from members of his team who think the central bank is dragging its feet. Powell, stuck in that corner, got backup on Friday when labor data showed the US added 177,000 jobs in April. That number gave the Fed more breathing room to justify keeping rates unchanged … at least for now. Trump keeps up the attacks while Powell ignores him A week ago, Trump blasted Powell on Truth Social, writing, “There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” A few days earlier, Trump had posted, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” But by the end of the week, after stocks took a hit, Trump told reporters he wasn’t really trying to fire Powell. That didn’t stop the speculation or the heat on the Fed. Even if Trump does try to, he likely will not be able to fire Powell so easily. The law says Fed governors can only be removed for cause . Whether that rule covers the chair is still unclear. But that hasn’t stopped the administration from taking steps to limit the Fed’s independence. It’s already in a legal fight to expand White House power over agencies like the Fed, especially ones with protections that make them harder to influence politically. The difference between Trump and Powell is simple: Trump wants the key interest rate cut, and Powell doesn’t. Trump says inflation is cooling, so the Fed should make it cheaper to borrow. That would make credit cards, mortgages, and loans less expensive. Powell’s focus is keeping prices stable, even if that means keeping borrowing costs high. Trump, who spent most of his business life living off loans, has always preferred low rates and made that clear since his first term. The Fed has its eyes on inflation. Their go-to inflation gauge shows prices are easing, which normally supports a cut. But tariffs are rising. That could screw up any gains on inflation. So Powell and the rest of the board are pausing. Bloomberg Economics predicts that Powell’s going to stay firm. Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Estelle Ou, and Chris G. Collins said in a note, “We expect Powell to push back against market pricing and signal a renewed priority on price stability.” They also pointed out that Thomas Barkin, president of the Richmond Fed, and Adriana Kugler, a Fed governor, are worried that inflation expectations could be slipping. The April payroll boost only gives them more confidence to resist any rate cuts. Global banks react while the Fed holds still Other central banks are doing the opposite. The European Central Bank has started cutting rates again. They’re trying to stay ahead of slowing growth tied to US tariffs. But their most recent inflation report showed prices didn’t drop. One of the core measures actually went up. Over in Canada, things are just as messy. The Bank of Canada ditched its usual forecast in April and put out two separate economic scenarios. They couldn’t even pick one baseline. Both paths depend on how the US-Canada tariff fight plays out, which shows how unpredictable the whole situation is right now. This week doesn’t have a lot of big US economic reports coming. On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its April services index. After that, attention will shift to jobless claims. The numbers for the week ending April 26 hit the highest mark since February, though that’s mostly because of New York’s spring recess messing with the stats. The White House is also pushing ahead with efforts to reduce how much oversight the Fed has. That’s part of a broader strategy to give the presidency more control over independent regulators. They’ve already launched legal action targeting the protections that keep those agencies free from political pressure. And that includes the Fed.

The negotiations ended Thursday. The statement from Taiwan’s Office of Trade Negotiations described the discussions as “frank and cordial,” with both sides agreeing to keep talking. The island, known for building chips and selling more to the US than it buys, was about to be hit with a 32% import tax from the Trump administration. But last month, President Donald Trump paused all his “reciprocal tariffs” for 90 days. That decision gave Taiwan some breathing room. During that window, Taiwan offered to lift all tariffs and start buying more US goods while also boosting investments across key sectors. Both sides plan to continue talks after Washington meetings The talks, which Taiwan called “substantive,” didn’t include a full list of who sat at the table on the American side, but both governments want to keep the momentum going. The trade office said both countries were “actively seeking consensus” and want to “explore further steps” that would strengthen their economic relationship. The island wants more stability with the United States as pressure from China builds. The US has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but acts like an ally. It supplies weapons, gives support, and responds quickly whenever Beijing turns up the heat. On April 2nd, the US State Department said America would keep standing by Taiwan even as China continued massive military drills along the coast. “In the face of China’s intimidation tactics and destabilizing behavior, the United States’ enduring commitment to our allies and partner, including Taiwan, continues,” said Tammy Bruce, a State Department spokesperson. The same day, the department accused China of stoking tension in the region. “China’s aggressive military activities and rhetoric toward Taiwan only serve to exacerbate tensions and put the region’s security and the world’s prosperity at risk,” the department said. The department also warned that the US was “against any unilateral changes to the status quo, including through force or coercion.” China holds drills while Taiwan ramps up defense and trade China’s military admitted it had been running blockade drills and target assaults, saying it was testing joint combat systems. Military experts say that’s just Beijing showing Taiwan what it’s capable of. David Silbey, a military historian at Cornell University, said the exercises were part of China’s long-term strategy to prepare for war with Taiwan, if it comes to that. He said the drills also act as a warning, aimed at making Taiwanese people feel surrounded. Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te didn’t stay silent. Last month, he called China “foreign hostile forces” and rolled out a new set of laws and economic tools to stop Chinese infiltration in the island’s institutions. His words didn’t go unnoticed. But instead of an instant reply, Beijing held off on reacting. Analysts at Eurasia Group believe that the delay had nothing to do with diplomacy. They said China wanted to finish its two-week business summit in Beijing, where Chinese officials were hosting foreign CEOs. Doing military drills while executives were in town would have scared off investment. Once the summit ended, the People’s Liberation Army went back to its routine. That shift didn’t go unnoticed either. Eurasia analysts warned that China is less interested in cooling things down, and the chances of a real crisis this year between China and Taiwan are going up. China still says Taiwan belongs to it. That claim has been around for decades. Taiwan disagrees and continues to function as its own government. China, though, keeps repeating that it will take back the island by any means necessary, including and especially using military force. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Investors watching current market movements are focusing on MAGACOINFINANCE , XRP , Ethereum , and Bitcoin —three names that reflect both long-term strength and emerging potential. With fundamentals aligning and institutional interest expanding, these assets are becoming central to discussions about the next phase of growth in the crypto market. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Establishing Real Traction at the Early Stage Unlike projects that rely on short-term speculation, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining attention for the right reasons: structure, execution, and growth. The project has already raised over $7.8 million , reflecting growing confidence among early investors. Wallet numbers are increasing. Developer milestones are being met. And community engagement is building steadily across multiple regions. This is the kind of momentum that often precedes widespread market recognition. For those looking to enter at a critical point in a project’s trajectory, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out. Market Foundations: Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Leading Protocols Ethereum (ETH) remains the backbone of decentralized innovation. With rapid Layer-2 scaling and increasing real-world integrations, its ecosystem continues to expand across finance, gaming, and enterprise use. Bitcoin (BTC) holds its role as a digital store of value. Its acceptance among institutional investors, along with new ETF vehicles, reinforces its long-term position in the global financial landscape. Together, these assets provide a level of stability and scale that’s essential for overall market growth—but the outsized return potential lies in identifying earlier-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE. Ecosystem Builders to Watch: Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Polygon continues to serve as a key infrastructure layer for Ethereum scalability and real-world adoption. Tron leads in transaction volume across many regions, especially for high-throughput, cost-effective use cases. Arbitrum is the frontrunner in Ethereum Layer-2 development, driving innovation across decentralized applications and financial protocols. While these protocols support broad adoption, MAGACOINFINANCE offers a rare chance to participate in an early-stage project before mass exposure. Final Insight Can an investment today grow toward $1.1 million ? In digital markets, timing and conviction remain the key drivers of transformative outcomes. Ethereum and Bitcoin are solidifying leadership—but MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one quietly building toward that kind of exceptional return. With $7.8 million raised and growing visibility, the project is no longer a secret—yet the full upside may still be ahead.

44139920,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66061,1746346178,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"ChatGPT Predicts XRP Price for May 31, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/chatgpt-predicts-xrp-price-for-may-31-2025/,"XRP is currently trading at $2.21, reflecting a modest increase of 0.16% from yesterday. It has spent most of 2025 trading above the $2 mark, outperforming the expectations of many investors and analysts. To see if the asset can perform better this month, we consulted ChatGPT for insight into the digital asset’s price by May 31, 2025 XRP Price Prediction ChatGPT says XRP could trade between $3.5 and $5 by the end of May, suggesting the asset could hit a new all-time high this month. This represents an increase ranging from 58.3% to 126.2%, and the AI tool gave multiple reasons why the asset could reach this target range. Post-Lawsuit Momentum ChatGPT stated, “We’re in a different environment,” as regulatory clarity has transformed XRP into a more accessible asset for U.S. institutions, enabling listings on additional exchanges and the development of related investment products. This new environment has contributed to broader adoption and improved investor sentiment, which drives price growth. The end of legal uncertainty allows institutions to participate with greater confidence , which may increase demand and create favorable conditions for upward price movement. Investor Confidence Reflected in Price Action ChatGPT stated, “Sustained price action above $2 suggests strong investor confidence and demand,” indicating that the digital asset could experience a stable upward trend. Under these conditions, a price range of $3.5 to $5 becomes a realistic expectation, provided the market remains steady and no major disruptions occur. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional and Utility-Driven Growth Institutional interest also contributes to the optimistic forecast. Ripple’s partnerships with central banks and major remittance platforms may progress, expanding XRP’s role in cross-border payments and financial infrastructure. This utility-driven demand distinguishes XRP from purely speculative assets and adds credibility to its long-term valuation. Many experts believe utility will help XRP’s price grow , and if institutional adoption accelerates, this could further support higher price targets. Broader integration into financial systems may also influence liquidity demand, creating sustained upward pressure on the asset’s value. Market Conditions Higher Targets Market sentiment across the broader crypto landscape remains an important variable. XRP has historically followed bullish trends during altcoin surges, and ChatGPT suggests this pattern may continue. “If broader crypto market sentiment remains bullish, XRP typically follows or even outperforms in surging altcoin environments,” it noted. It noted that the current forecast is conservative relative to speculative bull cases, indicating that higher targets such as $10 or more could be explored under more bullish market scenarios.

The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico. Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made. Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March. The bill, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty , is formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Related: Fed’s Powell reasserts support for stablecoin legislation Senate prepares to vote on stablecoin bill The Senate is expected to begin floor consideration of the bill in the coming days, with the first vote potentially taking place next week. The bill has been championed by the crypto industry as a landmark step toward regulatory clarity. However, the Democrats’ about-face reflects growing unease within the party. Although revisions were made to the bill after its committee approval to address Democratic concerns, the lawmakers said the changes fell short. They called for stronger safeguards related to Anti-Money Laundering, national security, foreign issuers, and accountability measures for noncompliant actors. The statement was also signed by Senators Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez Masto, Ben Ray Luján, John Hickenlooper and Adam Schiff. A copy of the statement. Source: Alex Thorn Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Angela Alsobrooks were absent from the list, who co-sponsored the bill alongside Hagerty. Despite their objections, the Democratic senators emphasized their commitment to shaping responsible crypto regulation. They reportedly said they “are eager to continue working with our colleagues to address these issues.” Related: US banks are ‘free to begin supporting Bitcoin’ Crypto needs a stablecoin bill On April 27, Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, criticized the US Federal Reserve for quietly maintaining a key anti-crypto policy that favors big-bank-issued stablecoins , despite relaxing crypto partnership rules for banks. Long explained that while the Fed recently rescinded four prior crypto guidelines , a Jan. 27, 2023, statement was left intact in coordination with the Biden administration. The guidance, according to Long, blocks banks from engaging directly with crypto assets and prohibits them from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains. However, Long noted that once a federal stablecoin bill becomes law, it could override the Fed’s stance. “Congress should hurry up,” she urged.

Let’s break down the facts behind the speculation and what’s actually happening. The Viral Tweet — Outdated and Misleading A tweet from Eleanor Terrett has been making the rounds again, suggesting that the SEC would likely address the Ripple case dismissal at a closed-door meeting scheduled for a Thursday. However, what many people may not realize is that tweet is from March. The date isn’t new, and it was relevant to the SEC’s internal scheduling at that time. What’s Actually Happening with the Ripple vs SEC Case? To recap, Ripple and the SEC reached a partial resolution some time ago, with Ripple agreeing to a civil penalty for earlier institutional sales of XRP, while the court ruled that XRP is not a security on secondary markets. However, the final paperwork, formal withdrawal, and an official SEC statement remain pending. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, recently reiterated that the case is effectively over, pending final formalities. But there’s still no official sign-off from the SEC Commission. Why This Matters for XRP and Crypto Markets Many analysts believe that once the final paperwork drops and legal clarity is fully established for Ripple, it could bring new institutional adoption opportunities and potentially fuel XRP’s price rally. Some even speculate that XRP ETFs could be on the horizon. But until the SEC officially publishes the dismissal, it’s premature to declare victory. Verdict: False Alarm for Now The claim that Ripple vs SEC will end this Thursday is based on an old tweet and ongoing speculation. As of now, there’s no confirmed date for the final case dismissal announcement.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-04 08:26:46

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing how a $500 bet on XYZVerse in presale could grow if the project’s ambitious roadmap and listing plans play out in a favorable market. Table of Contents Step 1: Purchasing at the current presale price Why a post-listing surge possible for XYZVerse How to Buy XYZ Final thoughts The volatile nature of cryptocurrencies implies that early-stage investments come with both high risks and high potential rewards. Investors who identify promising projects early can realize significant gains. Bitcoin’s early days offer a compelling illustration. When BTC first launched in 2009, it was virtually worthless. Early adopters could acquire thousands of BTC for a few dollars — or even mine them on home computers. Laszlo Hanyecz famously bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC in 2010. At Bitcoin’s all-time high of around $109,114, those coins would have been worth nearly $1.09 billion. As the first of its kind, Bitcoin paved the way for diverse cryptocurrency projects, each aiming to bring something unique to the table. One such case is XYZVerse (XYZ) — the first all-sports memecoin running an ICO ahead of listing on major exchanges. While XYZVerse has garnered growing attention for its unique concept and roadmap, it’s important to assess what potential returns could look like for early participants — and also to understand the underlying risks. Let’s break down a hypothetical investment scenario where an investor commits $500 at the current presale price. Step 1: Purchasing at the current presale price Current token price: $0.003333 per XYZ A $500 investment at this rate would buy approximately 150,015 XYZ tokens. For convenience, the project has placed a calculator on its website: Listing at the target price The project’s presale plan anticipates a listing price of $0.10 when XYZVerse reaches exchanges. If XYZ successfully lists and holds that price, the investor’s 150,015 tokens would be worth around $15,001.50. Further growth scenario: $0.2+ price targets If XYZVerse gains more traction after the listing, it could eventually climb to $0.20 or higher. In crypto, exchange listings often act as powerful catalysts. Increased visibility, new liquidity, and a surge in public awareness can cause sharp price rallies following a major listing. For example, Arbitrum , initially priced at $1.30, spiked nearly 550% following its listing. Anticipation was sky-high for Arbitrum’s airdrop and its token launch. Listings on multiple top exchanges at once, a large existing user base (thanks to Arbitrum’s dominance among Ethereum Layer 2s), and speculative momentum fueled one of the wildest launches of the year. You might also like: Trader predicts XYZVerse will hit $5, surpassing Dogecoin, XRP with 15,000% returns Why a post-listing surge possible for XYZVerse Several factors are working in XYZVerse’s favor that could potentially drive its post-listing ascent. Unique concept XYZVerse is the first memecoin built around the sports industry — a massive global market that connects millions of fans. Strong roadmap The project is building a broader sports-focused ecosystem, including play-to-earn elements, NFT integration, and staking rewards. Recently, XYZVerse has partnered with bookmaker.XYZ, a fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook. This partnership allows for free bets and other bonuses for XYZ holders. Growing community support The crypto community has expressed bullish views about XYZVerse as indicated by the sentiment on its CoinMarketCap page. XYZVerse has already raised over $13 million in the presale, showing early investor trust. Security and credibility The project has passed audits by Pessimistic and SolidProof, providing an additional layer of security reassurance for investors. Bullish market timing If the next crypto bull market arrives in 2025, high-potential low-cap projects like XYZVerse could attract major attention. How to Buy XYZ XYZ tokens can be bought directly through the official XYZVerse website by following these easy steps: 1. Set up a wallet Download and install a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. If no wallet is available, create one following the app’s instructions. 2. Add a network Navigate to the wallet settings and select “Add Network.” Choose from supported networks, such as Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Tron, Solana, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Alternatively, XYZ can be purchased directly using a Visa or Mastercard. 3. Connect the wallet Go to the official XYZVerse dApp and click “Connect Wallet” to link the wallet to the platform. 4. Choose the payment token Click the token icon and select which cryptocurrency to use for the purchase. Options include USDT, ETH, BNB, and others. 5. Enter the amount Decide how much XYZ to buy or how much to spend. Enter the amount in the purchase window. 6. Confirm the purchase Click “Buy XYZ,” approve the transaction in the wallet, and wait for confirmation. Once complete, the XYZ balance will appear in the wallet. Final thoughts Early entry into promising crypto projects like XYZVerse can offer significant rewards, particularly when participating at discounted presale prices. However, success hinges not just on securing a low entry point, but also on the project’s ability to meet market expectations, maintain community interest, and navigate the competitive landscape. For investors considering joining XYZVerse, the opportunity for significant growth exists — but only time will tell how the project performs once it reaches the open market.

This rebound follows a period of volatility, with price movements fluctuating between $1,740 and $1,847 over the past seven days. Related Reading: Strategy’s $84 Billion Bitcoin Appetite: Michael Saylor Goes All In (Again) Amid the uncertainties in the wider crypto market, Ethereum’s ability to reclaim higher ground appears to align with shifting investor behavior, especially on centralized exchanges, where a noticeable number of Ether have been withdrawn in the past seven days. $380M In ETH Pulled From Exchanges As Accumulation Trend Increases According to IntoTheBlock, the past week saw over $380 million worth of Ethereum withdrawn from centralized trading platforms. This net outflow shows an increasing wave of accumulation among crypto investors. These investors are moving their assets into self-custody, which is often a sign of long-term conviction. The accompanying data chart underscores this momentum, highlighting five consecutive days of negative exchange netflows across aggregated platforms spanning 19 crypto exchanges. Notably, the last time these exchanges saw a positive inflow of Ethereum was on April 27, with $50 million worth of ETH. Interestingly, just 24 hours prior, these aggregated exchanges witnessed a negative 166.68 million worth of Ethereum flows. Such an exchange flow dynamic brings forth the idea that Ethereum investors may be preparing for a rally. Significant exchange outflows are known to precede notable bullish advances, and current the behavior mirrors previous price action where decreasing exchange balances acted as a precursor to sustained rallies. Notably, the current withdrawal trend coincides with the Ethereum price pushing back above the $1,800 mark. Image From X: IntoTheBlock Crucial Ethereum Support Zone At $1,770 The ongoing accumulation is further supported by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who recently pointed out a crucial Ethereum support level. According to Martinez, the $1,770 region is currently the most significant level for Ethereum in the short term, citing data from IntoTheBlock’s “In/Out of the Money Around Price” model. The In/Out of the Money Around Price model shows a high concentration of wallets (roughly 4.5 million addresses) having acquired 6.36 million ETH between $1,772 and $1,824. These holders are now “in the money” following Ethereum’s return to $1,845, which makes this zone a psychological stronghold. The implication of this support zone is clear. If Ethereum sustains above this demand cluster, the probability of further upward movement increases. However, any retracement below $1,770 could invalidate the current bullish structure and expose Ethereum to downside volatility. Image From X: @ali_charts For now, the net flows from exchanges indicate that Ethereum might be able to hold its ground around this $1,770 level. The less Ethereum available on exchanges, the less selling pressure. On the other hand, the next resistance cluster to get above in the short term is at $1,881. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Infinity?

His chart shows the digital asset following a descending trendline that has acted as resistance since early 2025. He also acknowledged that those who entered at lower prices made the right move, as a major breakout may be on the horizon. The next #XRP breakout is close now, if we break this trend we are flying. BIG HAND FOR THOSE WHO BOUGHT THE DIP. pic.twitter.com/C6trnAxbOs — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 2, 2025 Technical Indicators Support Bullish Outlook The chart shared shows XRP trading at $2.2211, slightly above the 50-day EMA ($2.2057), the 100-day EMA ($2.2197), and well above the 200-day EMA ($1.9902). This positioning indicates growing bullish momentum. The digital asset is also approaching the Supertrend resistance at $2.36, which lines up with the trendline Xaif highlighted. A breakout above this area could confirm a shift in trend. The digital asset just escaped a death cross on the one-hour chart, and its volume stood at 15.24 million at the time of Xaif’s analysis, reflecting continued interest in XRP at this level. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, with green histogram bars indicating increasing bullish momentum. The Supertrend indicator issued a buy signal in March, and price action has respected that call since, holding above the 200-day EMA and forming higher lows. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Resistance Levels and Potential Upside Xaif’s chart shows a potential breakout target above $2.80, should XRP close above the long-standing trendline. Some analysts are confident that XRP can hit a new all-time high soon , and while the chart includes an upward arrow pointing toward $2.8, this could be a precursor for a bigger price surge. Intermediate resistance levels include $2.36 and $2.5095. If XRP clears those, the conditions could support a broader move higher. The downtrend that started earlier this year has seen multiple lower highs, but recent price action suggests that bearish momentum is weakening. The asset is now consolidating tightly beneath resistance, setting up for a possible move in either direction. Buying the Dip Before XRP’s Rally Those who entered on recent dips may get in a favorable position if the breakout materializes. Xaif commended everyone who bought the dip, as XRP has struggled in recent months while prominent experts called on the community to accumulate tokens. One expert recently described current price levels as a blessing from above , and those who buy in early will gain the most when these predicted surges start materializing.

He added that gold trading on MT5 would now have 500x leverage. Some believe that Bybit’s move still invites the risk of North Korea’s Lazarus group Responding to the news, one X user, a blockchain and crypto researcher going by the name Po La, claimed that Bybit was planning to expand into other sectors and the 500x leverage could help draw in a lot of traditional traders. Another X user, a bit more skeptical about Bybit’s plan, commented , “Feels like the lines between TradFi and crypto are getting blurrier by the day. Let’s see how much volume this actually pulls in.” One user, however, argued that this was bound to happen, saying the convergence of TradFi and crypto is “inevitable,” especially under Trump’s administration. Another user pointed out the risk of the North Korean Lazarus group , seeing how Bybit had previously fallen victim to their attacks. On February 21, 2025, the Lazarus Group siphoned roughly $1.5 billion worth of Ether (ETH) from Bybit, marking the largest digital heist in cryptocurrency history. The hackers allegedly accessed Bybit’s cold wallets and rerouted an approved ETH transaction to their wallets. Moreover, the group quickly moved to launder the stolen money; according to an analysis by TRM labs, they got all the money out through illicit means within 48 hours. TRM suspects by February 26 the group had been using multiple intermediary wallets to launder the funds, converting them into various cryptocurrencies and leveraging decentralized exchanges and cross-chain bridges to obscure the trail. Bybit introduced the Copy Trading Gold&FX feature, its venture into Gold and Forex markets Earlier this year, Bybit launched Copy Trading Gold&FX to enable users to mirror institutional-level Gold and Forex trading strategies in their MT5 accounts using USDT as collateral . According to Joan Han, Sales and Marketing Director at Bybit, the service allows users to explore the complexities of Gold and Forex markets. Additionally, she claimed the service enhances portfolio diversification, improves risk management, and creates opportunities for optimized trading outcomes within the MT5 platform. She added, “It’s a gateway to smarter, more efficient trading in traditional asset markets. It represents a bold step forward in Bybit’s mission to empower every trader with the tools, resources, and opportunities they need to succeed.” Ben Zhou agreed to work with Vietnamese authorities on their crypto sandbox program Ben Zhou recently met with the Vietnamese Minister of Finance, the State Securities Commission Chairman, and the Minister of Foreign Trade. In the meeting, the Vietnamese Minister of Finance, Nguyen Van Thang, explained they wanted to protect users and blockchain technology. He said the government would launch a pilot sandbox mechanism for regulators to test issuance and crypto asset trading, which he believes will enhance investor protection. On the other hand, Bybit pledged to help the Vietnamese Ministry of Finance promote the new sandbox framework. Zhou agreed to work with Vietnamese authorities on system architecture design, transaction oversight, and implementing international best practices in AML/KYC.

Solana has seen a 22.21% price increase in the past month. The current price ranges from $145.64 to $153.71. This suggests a growing interest in the coin. Adding to the bullish sentiment, SOL Strategies, a Canadian investment company, issued $500 million in convertible notes to buy and stake Solana tokens. This large-scale investment highlights the increasing institutional confidence in Solana. If the current momentum continues, SOL could reach its resistance level at $169. This would be an increase of nearly 15% from the lower end of its current range. The nearest support level is $123.24. A fall below this point could signal a downturn. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 54.23, indicating SOL is neither overbought nor oversold. This suggests that the price could rise or fall. Given the recent positive performance and notable institutional investment, SOL may continue upward toward the resistance level. However, caution is advised due to current volatility. Conclusion The move from established coins like SOL to emerging projects highlights a quest for higher short-term gains. While SOL and similar assets have delivered growth, their immediate potential appears limited compared to newer opportunities.

MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and XRP are now among the names gaining serious traction—each offering a unique mix of credibility, community strength, or early-stage upside. MAGACOINFINANCE – Quiet Momentum, Loud Potential MAGACOINFINANCE has now raised over $7.8 million , with 12,500+ holders joining early. Unlike headline-driven hype tokens, MAGACOINFINANCE is building a deliberate, focused narrative—centered on strategic branding, investor alignment, and long-term expansion. Early-stage buzz continues to rise across Telegram, forums, and X. With a 50% bonus still available (promo code: MAGA50X ), early buyers are locking in allocations ahead of the $0.007 listing. Bitcoin (BTC) – Still the Market Anchor Bitcoin is holding steady near $95,000 , showing renewed strength following a 14.5% April gain . Institutional adoption remains high, driven by ETF flows and macro uncertainty. Analysts are forecasting a potential move toward $132,000 in May. As capital returns to large caps, BTC continues to set the tone for overall market momentum. Solana (SOL) – Dominance in Speed and Scale Solana maintains its position between $145 and $150 , fueled by strong NFT activity and the recent approval of a Canadian SOL ETF. With bullish sentiment and rising DeFi volume, SOL is poised for a potential run toward $180+ , supported by its growing appeal to developers and traders alike. XRP – Institutional Momentum Accelerates XRP , priced near $2.15 , continues to benefit from ETF-driven optimism. CME Group’s plans to launch XRP futures by May 19 could push XRP beyond its $2.45 resistance. With regulatory clarity strengthening and cross-border adoption on the rise, XRP remains one of 2025’s most credible contenders. Final Thoughts Whether it’s the foundational power of Bitcoin , the scalability of Solana , the institutional wave behind XRP , or the early-stage appeal of MAGACOINFINANCE , these assets are setting the tone for crypto’s 2025 cycle.

Most altcoins are also in the red on a daily scale, led by a substantial price decline from SUI of 5% that has pushed it down to $3.2. BTC Slips Beneath $96K The primary cryptocurrency spiked above $90,000 last Tuesday and hasn’t looked back. It kept climbing in the following days to a local peak of $96,000 reached on April 25. Consolidation ensued for the next week or so as BTC remained stuck in a tight range between $93,000 and $95,000. The lower boundary was tested on a couple of occasions, but it helped maintain BTC’s price. The last unsuccessful attempt was on Wednesday, after which the cryptocurrency went on the offensive and broke above the upper boundary. This resulted in a price surge to $97,500 on Thursday and to $98,000 on Friday. The latter became the asset’s highest price point in over two months. However, it failed to breach that level and challenge $100,000 as the bears pushed it south by over two grand despite some positive on-chain developments that suggest another rally is around the corner. As of now, BTC struggles below $96,000 after a minor daily correction. Its market cap has dropped to $1.9 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is up to 61.7%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView TRUMP Keeps Dumping As mentioned above, most alts are slightly in the red today. XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, TRX, and LINK have lost traction with price declines of up to 3%. SUI and AVAX lead the adverse trend, with price drops of 5.6% and 4.2%, respectively. Consequently, SUI is down to $3.22, while AVAX struggles to remain above $20.

The post went up just days after Pope Francis died, and it set off a full-blown wave of backlash from Catholic groups, politicians, and media across the U.S. and Europe. But Vance didn’t flinch. He treated the whole thing as a joke and fired back at people calling it disrespectful. “As a general rule, I’m fine with people telling jokes and not fine with people starting stupid wars that kill thousands of my countrymen,” Vance wrote on X, replying to a direct question from Bill Kristol, editor-at-large at The Bulwark. Kristol asked if Vance was really okay with “this disrespect and mocking of the holy father.” The image Trump posted showed him in full papal garb — white robes, gold cross, pointed bishop’s hat — standing like he was running the Vatican. The joke post came shortly after Trump had made comments about wanting to lead the Catholic Church. “I’d like to be Pope. That would be my number one choice,” Trump said, speaking to reporters. He also named Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who is based in New York, as someone he’d nominate for the job. No American cardinal has ever been elected Pope, but that didn’t stop Trump from posting the image or recommending a name. He said he would be his own “number one choice” for the papacy, even though he’s not Catholic and has been married three times. Catholic leaders slam Trump post while Vance defends it The New York State Catholic Conference released a public statement through its official X account. The same post was reposted by the White House X account. “There is nothing clever or funny about this image, Mr. President,” they wrote. “We just buried our beloved Pope Francis and the cardinals are about to enter a solemn conclave to elect a new successor of St. Peter. Do not mock us.” The Vatican will begin its papal conclave on May 7, and the period of mourning is still active. The Church has not had to elect a new Pope since Francis replaced Benedict XVI over a decade ago. Vance, who is Catholic, was one of the final visitors who met with Francis before his death. The 88-year-old Pope died on Easter Monday, sparking formal ceremonies across Italy and the Catholic world. The image of Trump dressed as Pope became the topic of several questions at the Vatican’s daily press briefing on Saturday. Italian and Spanish media outlets attacked it. They said it was “offensive” and “distasteful” given the timing. The front page of La Repubblica, a left-leaning Italian paper, featured the image with commentary describing Trump’s post as “pathological megalomania.” Former Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, also on X, slammed the image. “This is an image that offends believers, insults institutions and shows that the leader of the right-wing world enjoys clowning around,” he said. Renzi added, “Meanwhile, the U.S. economy risks recession and the dollar loses value. The sovereignists are doing damage, everywhere.” The Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni declined to make a comment about the matter, according to Bloomberg. Trump allies lean into joke as conclave approaches While most religious figures condemned the post, some Republicans leaned into the joke. Senator Lindsey Graham joined the mock campaign, writing on X: “Glad to report there is very positive reception and strong momentum for President Trump to be the next Pope. But I will be first to admit there has been some resistance! Must keep your head down and plow forward — can’t let the naysayers win the day. Next week is crucial as the papal conclave convenes… More updates to come!” Reporters asked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt for a response. She said, “President Trump flew to Italy to pay his respects for Pope Francis and attend his funeral, and he has been a staunch champion for Catholics and religious liberty.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

In a new interview with independent journalist David Lin, Mallers says that the US has been running unsustainable trade deficits for far too long and is slowly running out of demand for its debt. Moving forward, Mallers says global markets will likely witness a realignment and a “trade flow reordering” – one in which scarce and fixed-supply assets like BTC and gold shine. “The reality is this is not a very sustainable practice. Printing pieces of paper out of thin air in exchange for real goods and services is not a relationship that is to be sustained. It actually was a reaction to a decimating World War, and so what I think we’re living through is the unwind of that. When you see President Trump say things like ‘we need to fix our deficits, we need to bring back the middle class, we need to bring back the manufacturing class, we need to be able to produce our own stuff, it’s because there is a global trade imbalance happening where China is running a trade surplus of something to the tune of a trllion dollars a year, and the US, given this economic alignment globally, has racked up over $35 trillion worth of debt. And there are no marginal lenders to the United States anymore, we’re on the brink of a sovereign debt crisis. And so I think there’s a lot of volatility and a lot of trade flow reordering that we’re living through today, and investors trying to predict when these things are liquidity positive and liquidity negative, how the volatility is going to impact certain structural markets, it’s a very dangerous game to play. I think investors were probably caught offside for the first three months of Trump’s inauguration because he’s been so pro-business, so pro-growth, so pro-deregulation, that they probably got ahead of their skis. But now we’re starting to really understand how the world needs to realign, the impacts of that, and just the true power that a fixed-supply asset like a gold or a Bitcoin can have in a portfolio.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

They’re making it dramatically easier for liquidity providers to shift their funds from the older Uniswap v2 and v3 platforms to Uniswap v4 on Unichain with the launch of a novel, one-click migration tool. The big promise is that it eliminates all of the hassles and worries of moving funds across decentralized networks. Enso says it has ambitions to orchestrate what could become one of the most consequential asset transfers in the history of Ethereum, potentially facilitating the transfer of more than $3.5 billion worth of crypto that’s currently deployed in Uniswap’s liquidity pools. They’re trying to encourage LPs on Uniswap v2 and v3 to move their capital to Uniswap v4 on Unichain , which launched its testnet in October, but has struggled to attract the kind of funds it’s designed to handle. Uniswap is expecting big things from Unichain, as the L2 has been specifically optimized to handle the insane transaction volumes seen on the world’s most popular decentralized exchange. Billed as a “Superchain L2”, it’s capable of processing thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality and ultra-low costs, making it ideal for the demands of big-money DeFi traders. Unichain promises to lower transaction costs by up to 95% while providing an additional finality layer to eliminate the risk of conflict. Novel features include its 250 millisecond “sub-blocks” and improved transaction ordering transparency, enabling almost instantaneous swaps to boost market efficiency and stave off pesky MEV attacks. Unlocking Liquidity The performance benefits of Unichain are clear, but the vast majority of Uniswap users are yet to enjoy them, because the difficulty of moving their funds to Ethereum is off-the-scale. Some users have reported having to go through nine separate steps to complete the process of moving liquidity to Unichain – it’s a major operation, and not surprisingly, the vast majority of LPs simply haven’t bothered. With Enso’s new migration solution, all of that complexity is being stripped away, with users able to migrate, bridge and redeploy their funds on Unichain with just a single click. Creating this solution was the perfect challenge for Enso, which sees itself as a kind of middleware provider that brings a low-code-like experience to Web3 users. It’s a leader in the emerging discipline of intent-based architectures, abstracting away all of the hassles of step-by-step smart contract interactions, so users can just do what they wanna do, securely, quickly. It works by translating user’s intents into automated actions, processing them under the hood. Enso says it couldn’t have come up with its one-click liquidity migration tool without the assistance of Stargate and LayerZero . Stargate has built a seamless, easy-to-use bridge that integrates with LayerZero’s blockchain communication protocol to facilitate simple and secure messaging between decentralized networks and unify liquidity across them. It eliminates the need to wrap tokens and provides immediate finality for all transactions. Enso co-founder Connor Howe said the collaborators have built the “missing piece of the puzzle” for Unichain to finally start getting real traction, giving liquidity providers the ability to redeploy funds with minimal hassle. “Uniswap LPs are about to trigger one of the largest liquidity migration events in Ethereum’s history,” he promised.

Melania Trump prefers SOL over MELANIA, the meme coin named after her. Massive TRUMP and MELANIA selloffs put meme coin investors on their toes. Crypto whales are dumping TRUMP, the meme coin associated with the President of the United States of America. Following the latest developments, the Lookonchain crypto analysis platform spotted multiple transactions involving massive selloffs of the famous crypto asset. Lookonchain’s latest post on X showed that two whales lost $2.34 million after selling 765,128 TRUMP worth $8.58 million. The first whale gained $196,000 from TRUMP purchases before selling 337,560 TRUMP for $3.81 million early Sunday morning, losing $1.38 million.

44142242,https://cryptonews.com/?p=357261,1746350819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/44142242.jpeg,OKX CEO Defends Exchange Amid Justin Sun Freeze Dispute,https://cryptonews.com/news/okx-ceo-defends-exchange-amid-justin-sun-freeze-dispute/,"OKX CEO Star Xu has responded to accusations from Tron founder Justin Sun, who claimed the exchange failed to act on a law enforcement request to freeze stolen funds linked to a hack of Tron’s official X account. Sun alleged that OKX ignored a “freeze notice” from law enforcement following the May 3 breach, during which Tron’s X account was compromised. The attacker reportedly posted a malicious smart contract address, sent direct messages, and engaged with unfamiliar accounts. Justin Sun Says OKX Ignored Freeze Request In a now-deleted post, Sun stated that the exchange had been contacted via official email but had not responded, leaving him with “no other way” to reach OKX’s compliance team. “These stolen funds do not belong to me; I’m acting to protect the community,” Sun claimed. Star Xu dismissed the allegations. “OKX has a consumer protection policy governed by law,” Xu wrote on X . “We can’t freeze a customer’s funds based on your personal X post or oral communication. As the CEO of HTX, I think you should understand this.” Dear Mr H.E. Justin Sun, our LE cooperation team just checked the email including spam box, we haven’t received any request related with this case. Can you give us the screenshot to show when the enforcement agency send the request to us? @justinsuntron https://t.co/QIPFUbOqbi pic.twitter.com/lkHZWvk6fm — Star (@star_okx) May 3, 2025 Xu added that OKX’s law enforcement (LE) cooperation team reviewed its email accounts, including spam folders, and found no official request related to the case. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,” he said. Xu also posted a screenshot of Sun’s original deleted message and challenged him to share evidence of the alleged freeze notice, including the time and source of the request. The incident adds to a growing list of social media hacks in the crypto space. On March 15, Yu Hu, founder of crypto AI platform Kaito, had his account hijacked to spread false warnings about compromised wallets—shortly after attackers opened a short position in KAITO tokens. Similarly, on Feb. 26, the Pump.fun X account was compromised to promote a fake governance token. In another instance, UK MP Lucy Powell’s X account was hacked on April 15 to promote a scam token. Crypto Hacks Surge in 2025 as Losses Top $1.74 Billion in Four Months Hackers stole over $92.4 million from crypto projects in April 2025 alone, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi . The figure represents a 27.3% year-over-year increase and more than double the losses reported in March. April’s attacks occurred across 15 incidents, with two major exploits accounting for the bulk of the damage. UPCX, an open-source platform, lost $70 million in a single attack, while decentralized exchange KiloEx was hit for $7.5 million. Other affected projects included Loopscale, ZKsync, Term Labs, and Bitcoin Mission, each experiencing losses exceeding $1 million. Cumulatively, the first four months of 2025 have already seen $1.74 billion in crypto losses—more than all of 2024, which totaled $1.49 billion. Immunefi previously noted that Q1 2025 was the worst quarter for hacks in crypto history, driven largely by massive breaches of centralized exchanges Phemex and Bybit.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a notable match in phase 4 of its presale by attracting $7.5 million in investments which were distributed into 438 million tokens held by 9,400 participants. Investors currently accelerate their acquisition of tokens because the launch value of $0.06 is projected to offer a 140% profit from $0.025 today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents investors with a quicker opportunity to experience dramatic growth while maintaining robust market investment potential along with Cardano. Cardano’s Steady Ascent The price of Cardano (ADA) maintains $0.70 support which stands essential for its continuous growth. The forward vision of Hoskinson relies on contributive community work along with technical advancements that scale operations. The Bitcoin bridge has become an essential DeFi feature of Cardano by providing financial asset movement capabilities without interruptions. The continued accumulation of ADA by Grayscale together with the possibility of a public ETF launch by August 2025 demonstrates increasing investor trust in ADA cryptocurrency. The path forward for Cardano remains uncertain because it faces financial stability issues alongside leadership controversies. Future success for Cardano may lead to a $0.864 mark followed by the possibility of reaching $1. The price level drops below $0.674 which creates a bearish market trend. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge At present during phase 4 of its 11-stage presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has achieved 55% token sellout at its current pricing of $0.025. To date MUTM has gained 9,400 investors who have invested $7.5 million. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a 20% price increase from $0.03 to deliver existing investors a 20% profit. Initial tokenomics position will provide investors with a 140% return when MUTM tokens start trading at $0.06 during launch. Analysts predict $2.75 as the future valuation of the project, which would deliver investors a 10,900% return on investment. $250 invested today will generate a total of $27,500 at launch. The team finishes the CertiK smart contract audit which will soon be presented to social platforms to enhance confidence in the platform. Structured expansion generates urgency from the investment market. Leaderboard Sparks FOMO The MUTM (Mutuum Finance) platform unveils its new dashboard containing a list of top 50 token holders which has increased user ardor. The system rewards rank sustainability through bonus token distribution to encourage sustained membership. FOMO intensifies during the presale due to its speed which is nearing completion in phase 4. The immediate project utility that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings to users stems from its combination of peer-to-peer and peer-to-contract lending systems and results in immediate functionality. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands among high-yield opportunities because it implements practical peer-to-peer solutions for decentralized finance, whereas Cardano pursues a slower expansion path. Many investors hurry to purchase tokens because they want to benefit from potential price appreciation. Seizing High-Yield Potential Cardano (ADA) stands at the threshold of a $3.50 price break because of both institutional partnerships and system enhancements. The presale speed of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) coupled with its projected 10,900% ROI makes the platform stand out in the market. Venturing into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with just $250 leads to $27,500 in value while Cardano maintains more gradual growth. The crypto market gives its highest rewards to early investors who participate during Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 where users can purchase $0.025 tokens. New investors are joining the platform because they want to convert their modest funds into substantial gains. Act now to explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s potential before phase 5 begins.

The move would mark a significant return to form for one of fintech’s most highly anticipated public debuts. IPO Delay Triggered by Trump’s Tariffs Originally planning to go public earlier this year, eToro hit pause following President Trump’s sweeping tariff announcement on April 2. The move triggered a sharp increase in market instability and raised fears of a global trade war, forcing companies like Klarna, StubHub, and Medline to rethink their IPO timelines. eToro, which offers access to stocks, ETFs, and digital assets, was among them. But with markets now showing signs of stability, the path to its IPO appears clear again. $5 Billion Valuation Targeted According to the Financial Times, eToro confidentially filed for a US IPO with backing from investment banks Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Jefferies. The company is aiming for a $5 billion valuation and plans to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “ETOR.” The filing outlines strong growth metrics, with the company reporting $931 million in total commission revenue for 2024 — a significant increase from the $639 million earned the previous year. Net income surged as well, jumping from $15 million in 2023 to $192 million in 2024. No Final Decision Yet on Launch Timing Despite the momentum, eToro has not yet finalized its IPO timing . Sources familiar with the matter suggest that while the company is prepared to move forward next week, plans could still change if the market outlook shifts again. Even so, the recent stabilization in financial markets provides a favorable backdrop, especially for a company with exposure to both equities and cryptocurrencies. Crypto-Friendly Regulatory Environment Helps Another key factor supporting eToro’s IPO ambitions is the shifting regulatory environment in the US. The appointment of Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto figure, as SEC Chair has led to a more favorable outlook for firms in the digital asset space. This change has reignited interest in crypto-adjacent listings, with other big names like Circle, Kraken, and Gemini also advancing plans to go public. These companies have benefited from recent regulatory settlements that have cleared long-standing hurdles. What Comes Next for eToro? With a renewed focus on expanding its US footprint, eToro appears well-positioned to take advantage of the evolving landscape. If successful, the IPO could open the door for further growth and solidify its role as a leading global platform for retail trading. Should the firm proceed with its Nasdaq listing, it would mark a significant milestone not just for eToro but for the broader fintech and crypto sectors — both of which are looking to rebound in 2025 after a rocky start.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-04 09:38:00

The founder and CEO of the platform Star Xu has defended the exchange after Sun accused it of failing to act after a recent hack of Tron’s official X account. The back and forth is coming after the TRON DAO page suffered an attack, with the hacker using unauthorized access to publish a post with a contract address. According to the TRON DAO handle, the hacker sent direct messages to several accounts while following some prominent profiles on the platform. In relation to the attack, Sun asked OKX to freeze funds believed to be linked to the exploit in a post via X. OKX fires back at Sun’s allegations In a recent X post, the founder of OKX Star Xu mentioned that users have consumer protection laws, which every exchange follows. “OKX also has a consumer protection policy according to law, we can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to your personal X post or oral communication. I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said. Previously, Xu had said that the exchange had not received any related correspondence on their official channels, noting that Sun wanted the exchange to freeze funds belonging to some of its users by word of mouth. He added that its team checked the company’s email, including its spam box, but hadn’t received any request related to the case. Xu mentioned that the OKX LE cooperation policy mandates victims to provide preliminary evidence through its reporting channels which would lead to a temporary urgent freeze according to the evidence provided. He added that if Sun wants the freeze to continue, he would have to provide legal documents to that effect. In response to the post, Justin Sun mentioned that he was going to send a private message to Xu, a post that Xu replied to saying, “So your team or the enforcement agency hasn’t sent the request to okx so far?,” showing that Sun did not indeed make an official complaint about the issue. The development has left members of the crypto community furious, with most users blasting Sun over the incident. Crypto-related account hacks on X are on the rise Meanwhile, there has been a huge climb in account breaches involving high-profile crypto accounts on X. While the Tron incident is one of the most recent breaches. The Kaito AI account also suffered a breach not long ago. Kaito AI, an artificial intelligence-powered platform that aggregates crypto data to provide analysis for its users, and its founder, Yu Hu, suffered a breach of their accounts on March 15. The attackers opened up a short position on KAITO tokens before alerting the public that Kaito wallets were compromised, highlighting that their funds were not safe. Before then, the Pump.fun X account was hacked on February 26, with the attackers promoting a fake governance token called PUMP and other fraudulent tokens. On-chain investigator ZachXBT warned users to stay away from the page and refrain from interacting with any links posted by the social media account. He tied the hack to the hacks of Jupiter DAO and DogWifCoin X accounts in previous months, noting that the teams were not fully at fault for the breach. The spate of hacked accounts has increased dramatically since the beginning of the year and even non-crypto entities have been suffering. On April 15, X account belonging to a UK member of Parliament and Leader of the House of Commons, Lucy Powell was hacked to promote a scam token. While those posts have since been deleted, the hacker shared a link to a House of Commons Coin (HOC), saying it is a community driven digital currency.

A new class of blockchains like Berachain, Story (IPfi), Unichain, Monad, and MegaETH are leading a wave of specialized blockchain launches designed to serve increasingly diverse decentralized finance applications. But these chains aren’t just niche alternatives—they’re breaking users free from the constraints of the general-purpose status quo. This approach challenges the long-standing notion that a handful of general-purpose networks can support all use cases—and declares that the future isn’t one monolithic chain to rule them all, but a unit of optimized environments competing, collaborating, and coexisting. You might also like: 2025: The year intents revolutionize blockchain infrastructure | Opinion Institutions are entering with expectations shaped by decades of traditional finance, and the demand is clear. They want performance-optimized platforms that cater to high-speed trading, tokenized intellectual property, and sophisticated real-world asset markets. As these ecosystems grow, questions around cross-chain interoperability, institutional adoption, and competitive dynamics in DeFi infrastructure become increasingly relevant. The game is changing under our feet, and those who cling to general-purpose chains could be left behind. Breaking free from general-purpose bottlenecks General-purpose blockchains are beginning to show their cracks as financial institutions start stepping into DeFi. Proponents of specialization rightly argue that tailored infrastructures deliver more than technological advances, providing stronger security guarantees, improved scalability, and compliance features that appeal to institutional participants. For financial institutions exploring on-chain finance, predictable execution environments, regulatory-friendly frameworks, and reduced counterparty risk are especially mission-critical. These areas where specialized chains offer an edge, with these features already embedded to meet real-world demand, where general-purpose chains would require retrofitting to adapt. Some critics warn that a highly fragmented landscape could dilute liquidity and create inefficiencies, making it harder for assets to flow seamlessly across different platforms. Even though cross-chain solutions such as trust-minimized bridges and universal liquidity layers aim to mitigate these risks, their effectiveness remains a critical factor in whether specialization can scale without introducing friction. Thus, the trillion-dollar question remains: can we build this connective tissue fast enough to pace specialization? Nevertheless, emerging data from beta deployments indicates that specialized networks can attract robust ecosystems, offering developers more freedom to innovate in areas like algorithmic credit scoring, IP rights management, and tokenized commodities. Specialization may struggle in theory, but it’s already working in practice. DeFi’s future isn’t simpler—It’s smarter Recent traction in venture funding reinforces this shift, with projects integrating advanced data-validation methods and cross-chain bridges that facilitate rapid asset movement. Institutions aren’t watching from the sidelines. Adoption is soaring, driven by firms seeking on-chain access to structured financial products and real-world assets on their terms, creating further demand for the compliance-friendly environments that specialized blockchains increasingly provide. Experiments in liquid staking, real-world asset tokenization, and hybrid on-chain/off-chain data verification further validate the need for these chains as key infrastructure layers for the next wave of institutional DeFi. However, skeptics argue that increased complexity in managing assets across multiple chains may hinder mainstream adoption. While hurdles are to be expected, UX problems like these can be solved. And in a rapidly diversifying DeFi ecosystem, fragmentation is often a sign of progress. The challenge lies in developing seamless user interfaces and robust interoperability mechanisms that abstract away technical friction. To many investors, this fragmentation is an opportunity to diversify risk and foster a more competitive market, where specialized chains drive innovation without relying on monopolistic blockchain networks. In other words, it’s not fragmentation for fragmentation’s sake, but strategic and competitive modularity. The end of blockchain maximalism Competing networks such as Berachain and Unichain may redefine how DeFi applications are built and adopted, fostering a more mature market structure where specialized blockchains thrive alongside established platforms. If these emerging networks can sustain liquidity, seamlessly integrate with existing ecosystems, and maintain institutional trust, they could unlock a new era of on-chain finance—one with highly tailored solutions that don’t rely on a one-size-fits-all approach. This isn’t just a technical shift, but a philosophical one. The long-term viability of this multi-chain paradigm will depend on whether interoperability frameworks can facilitate frictionless asset movement and whether institutions gain confidence in the governance and security of specialized chains. Whether this shift leads to a more efficient DeFi landscape or a web of isolated networks remains uncertain, but specialization is already reshaping the blockchain industry’s trajectory. What is sure is that the future of blockchains is not monolithic. It’s modular, specialized, and taking off.

The MoU was formalized during the inaugural meeting of the Council for the Development of Digital Assets, attended by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, the exchange said in a May 4 press release. As part of the agreement, Binance will introduce Binance Pay to Kyrgyzstan, enabling crypto-based transactions for visitors and residents. The partnership also focuses on educational collaboration. Binance Academy will work with Kyrgyz government agencies and financial institutions to develop blockchain-focused learning programs. “Binance is excited to partner with the National Agency for Investments of the Kyrgyz Republic to drive forward the development of crypto-assets in the region,” Kyrylo Khomiakov, Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, said. On April 4, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said he would begin advising Kyrgyzstan on blockchain and crypto-related regulation after signing an MOU with the country’s foreign investment agency.

Notably, Kyrgyzstan has a track record in cryptocurrency mining. The country’s abundant hydroelectric resources have made it an attractive location for crypto miners seeking low-cost energy. Over 30% of Kyrgyzstan’s total energy supply comes from hydroelectric power plants, but only 10% of the country’s potential hydropower has been tapped, according to a report by the International Energy Agency.

These Altcoins Could Lead the Next 5x Rally Before June,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-these-altcoins-could-lead-the-next-5x-rally-before-june,"The crypto market is always full of excitement, and one of the biggest thrills for investors is finding altcoins that could deliver huge returns quickly. With May 2025 underway and signs of growing optimism in the market, people are starting to wonder: which altcoins could potentially lead a massive rally – maybe even a 500% gain – before June arrives? Trying to predict such fast moves is incredibly difficult and very risky, but it doesn't stop investors from looking for the best crypto to buy now that might have that explosive short-term potential. In this article we will explore the potential of some altcoins to go up soon and what exactly could fuel this pump , as well as a short review of the most promising newcomer Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) and few more! Too fast to track.⚡Too loud to miss.🌩️ pic.twitter.com/cNLSia6F6r — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 18, 2025 What Could Fuel a 5x Pump Before June 2025? Certain things could potentially spark a broader altcoin rally or boost specific coins before June 2025: Narrative Shifts: If a particular trend suddenly captures the market's attention (maybe a breakthrough in AIcrypto, renewed interest in DeFi, or a specific blockchain ecosystem gaining traction), related tokens could rally hard. The AI narrative seems particularly strong right now. Technical Breakouts: If major altcoins break through important price resistance levels on the charts, it can trigger more buying from technical traders, adding fuel to a rally. ETF Developments: While BlackRock seemed focused on Bitcoin for now, any positive hints or actual filings for altcoin ETFs could cause significant short-term excitement for those specific coins. It's important to note that many analysts, while optimistic for 2025 overall, see major catalysts like potential interest rate cuts happening later in the year, suggesting a massive, widespread rally before June isn't guaranteed. Best Crypto to Buy Now for a Potential Short-Term Rally? Keeping the high risks in mind, which altcoins might have characteristics that could spark trader’s interest before June 2025? 1. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): High Potential AI Meme Coin Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) is a promising candidate for significant short-term gains, especially as it transitions from its highly successful presale phase - $3.4M+ raised so far at low prices of $0.004. Why? Post-Presale Momentum: Often, tokens experience volatility and potential pumps shortly after listing on decentralized exchanges as awareness grows and pent-up demand is met. Getting in early, right after the presale or during initial listings, offers the highest potential for capturing early gains. Powerful Narratives: $DAGZ combines the extremely popular AI trend with the viral potential of meme coins. If either of these narratives catches fire in the short term, $DAGZ could benefit due to its unique positioning. Low Starting Point: Coming from a penny crypto presale price gives it a huge runway for percentage gains. Even a move to a few cents would represent a massive return for early buyers. Utility + Hype: Unlike pure meme coins, the planned AI utility gives $DAGZ a fundamental story that could attract more sustainable interest beyond just short-term hype, potentially supporting price action. 2. Ripple (XRP): The Coin of the Banks XRP remains a major altcoin focused on cross-border payments. Its short-term rally potential before June seems heavily tied to specific events: Legal Case Developments: Any positive news or steps towards resolving the long-running SEC lawsuit could cause a significant relief rally. The community closely watches dates related to court filings. ETF Speculation: While BlackRock seems cool on altcoin ETFs now, continued speculation or any hint of progress towards an XRP ETF could ignite short-term buying pressure from its large community. Technical Breakouts: Recent analysis suggests XRP is consolidating but showing bullish signs. A breakout above key resistance levels (like $2.50 or $2.75) could trigger a quick rally towards higher targets like $3.00. 3. Sui (SUI): High-Speed L1 Sui (SUI) is a newer Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed and scalability using the Move language . Factors that could drive short-term interest include: Ecosystem Growth: Recent reports mention rising Total Value Locked in Sui's DeFi ecosystem and a focus on gaming like the upcoming SuiPlay 0X1 device. Significant growth or a hit game could attract attention. Technology Narrative: Its unique object-based model and parallel processing offer high performance, which could become a talking point if it leads to noticeable advantages over competitors. Price Action & Unlocks: SUI has experienced volatility, including sharp rallies and corrections. Upcoming token unlocks create uncertainty but also drive trading activity and discussion, potentially leading to short-term price movements that traders try to capitalize on. Sui's short-term potential likely depends on continued ecosystem growth and positive reactions to events like token unlocks or new launches. Conclusion: Balancing Opportunity and Risk The search for the best crypto to buy now for a potential quick 5x rally before June 2025 is filled with high hopes but even higher risks. While market sentiment seems to be improving and certain altcoins show promise, predicting such massive short-term gains is extremely difficult. Our watchlist highlights diverse options: Sui pushes technological boundaries, and XRP holds event-driven potential. Among these, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) presents perhaps the most compelling narrative for near-term explosive potential due to its recent emergence from a successful presale, its potent blend of AI utility and viral meme appeal, and its low starting price point. However, investors must approach this space with extreme caution, prioritize thorough research over hype, strict risk management, and understand that quick, large gains are never guaranteed in crypto. FAQ Section : How can I spot an altcoin with short-term rally potential? Look for a combination of factors: strong recent momentum breaking resistance levels, alignment with a hot market narrative (like AI), upcoming catalysts (like exchange listings or major updates), and growing social media buzz. Projects like Dawgz AI showing strong presale interest and tapping into trends like AI often attract attention for potential rallies. What are the biggest risks of chasing short-term crypto rallies? The main risks are buying at the top right before a sharp price drop (FOMO), getting caught in a ""pump-and-dump"" scheme, choosing a project that fails to deliver, and suffering large losses due to extreme volatility. Even promising projects like Dawgz AI carry risks, especially in the short term. What's the best strategy to buy crypto for a potential short rally? Strategies often involve using technical analysis to find entry points, setting tight stop-losses to limit losses, taking profits quickly when targets are hit, and staying highly informed about news. Dollar-Cost Averaging is generally safer for long-term investing than trying to time short-term pumps in volatile altcoins like Dawgz AI.

44143392,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=720353,1746352800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44143392.jpeg,Why XRP and Cardano Holders Are Quietly Accumulating MAGACOIN FINANCE After $7.6M Raised and a 35x Forecast,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-xrp-and-cardano-holders-are-quietly-accumulating-magacoin-finance-after-7-6m-raised-and-a-35x-forecast/,"Seasoned Investors Are Rotating Early — Here’s Why As the crypto market recalibrates for a potentially explosive second half of 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-conviction altcoin among early movers. Surprisingly, it is not just retail traders entering — a growing number of seasoned XRP and Cardano (ADA) holders are beginning to reposition into this fast-rising asset. With $7.6 million already raised , MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured market attention not through hype, but through a disciplined rollout, transparent tokenomics, and a roadmap that analysts are beginning to take seriously. In contrast, while ADA and XRP remain in consolidation zones, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining ground — offering a fresh alternative with clear upside and short-term actionability. The Context: What’s Going On With XRP and Cardano? Both XRP and Cardano remain headline tokens in May 2025, but for different reasons: Cardano (ADA) is showing bullish reversal patterns, fueled by speculation over a possible Cardano ETF , and a growing list of real-world partnerships ahead of the LAOS protocol upgrade . However, despite recent gains, ADA is still trading between $0.70–$0.72 , with resistance levels at $0.81 and $1.17 yet to be broken. XRP sits near $2.22 , following recent volatility tied to ETF filing delays and a dip in trading volume. Bloomberg analysts still give an 85% chance of a 2025 XRP ETF approval, but market sentiment remains mixed due to the SEC’s postponed decision and lack of a spot ETF approval. Both tokens are still seen as high-potential assets — but limited short-term catalysts and broader market fatigue are driving capital to emerging high-ROI alternatives . That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the equation. 3,000%+ Upside and 50% Bonus Fuel Early Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently offering what many analysts view as a rare early-stage setup, especially when compared to saturated Layer 1 ecosystems: Over 3,000% ROI potential projected from current entry to listing 50% bonus tokens available during the current round A fixed supply of 100 billion tokens , with 45% allocated to presale Bonuses decreasing and pricing rising hourly as demand accelerates This disciplined structure — with no vague promises or open-ended timelines — is what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from the typical meme-driven noise. MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Positioned for 25x–35x Returns by Year-End Current projections suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could reach its target listing price of $0.007 , which would represent a 25x to 35x return from today’s levels — making it one of the most potentially lucrative early altcoin plays of 2025. Backing this forecast is more than speculation: A global marketing campaign is set to launch Agency partnerships are confirmed Exchange listing discussions are already underway Unlike traditional presales that offer little more than ambition, MAGACOIN FINANCE is executing on all fronts — drawing attention from crypto analysts, early-stage investors, and now, capital rotation from ADA and XRP whales. Why Analysts Say MAGACOINFINANCE Could Outperform in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being referred to as a strategic early entry , particularly for investors who missed prior runs in Ethereum , SHIBA INU , or DOGE . While ADA and XRP continue to trade within structured ranges, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in a price discovery phase — and momentum is building fast. With institutional-grade branding , real-time traction , and a growing community of over 14,000 holders, the project is quickly climbing up the 2025 altcoin watchlist. This is not a question of potential anymore — it’s a question of timing . The window to secure the 50% bonus and enter before mass exposure begins is rapidly narrowing.

After weeks of stagnation and volatility, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is attempting to solidify a bottom. Currently, ETH remains stuck in a tight range between $1,750 and $1,850—a zone that could soon determine its next major move. Bulls are in control of the short-term price action, but a breakout above resistance is essential to confirm a true trend reversal. Related Reading: $380M In Ethereum Leaves Exchanges In 7 Days – Accumulation Trend Accelerates Top analyst Daan shared a detailed breakdown revealing that Ethereum’s recent reclaim of the $1,750 level marks a meaningful shift in market dynamics. According to Daan, this is the first successful retake of a former support level since Ethereum lost the $4,000 zone in December. That event was a turning point in the bear cycle, and this move could be the start of a larger reversal if momentum holds. However, he cautions that failing to push forward from here could undermine the momentum already established. With the broader market heating up, Ethereum’s next move will likely have implications across the altcoin space. All eyes are now on whether ETH can maintain its strength and climb above the $1,850 mark in the coming sessions. Ethereum Trapped In Key Range As Bulls Struggle To Build Momentum Ethereum is currently trading around a pivotal zone, with bulls attempting to shift the trend but failing to establish a clear breakout. Despite signs of a potential reversal, ETH remains over 55% below its December highs, underscoring the uphill battle for sustained recovery. Price action has tightened between $1,750 and $1,850, forming a compressed structure that reflects both caution and anticipation in the market. On shorter timeframes, Ethereum is beginning to show early signs of bullish structure. Higher lows have emerged, suggesting that buyers are defending key levels. However, each push higher has met resistance, as selling pressure continues to cap upside potential. The broader environment remains fragile, with macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility across markets keeping investors cautious. Daan shared a technical insight emphasizing the importance of the recent $1,750 break. According to Daan, this is the first time ETH has reclaimed a previously lost support level since falling from $4,000 last December. This signals a potential shift in market dynamics. But he warns that holding and building from this point is essential as failure to continue higher could stall the rally and erase recent progress. The $1,750 to $2,100 range is now the critical zone to monitor. A decisive break above $2,100 could trigger a broader altcoin rally, while losing $1,750 may expose ETH to deeper corrections and renewed bearish pressure. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Accumulated 410 Million ADA In April – Breakout Coming? ETH Price Analysis: Breakout After Holding Key Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $1,833 and remains in a tight consolidation just below the $1,850 resistance level. As shown on the 4-hour chart, ETH has been steadily recovering since mid-April, forming higher lows while holding above both the 200-period EMA ($1,780) and SMA ($1,702). This structure suggests growing bullish momentum in the short term. The recent move above the 200 EMA and 200 SMA marks a significant shift in trend direction, as these levels previously acted as dynamic resistance throughout April. Now that ETH is trading above them, they may serve as strong support in the case of a pullback. However, price continues to face resistance near $1,850, a level that has rejected several intraday attempts to break higher. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Long-Legged Doji On Monthly Chart – Reversal Or Just A Pause? If bulls manage to clear this barrier, the next key level to watch is the psychological $2,000 mark. On the downside, failure to hold $1,800 could lead to renewed selling pressure and a possible drop toward the $1,700 zone. Volume has remained relatively low, which could suggest that a larger move is imminent.

The initiative is part of a newly signed agreement with a government agency that seeks to advance the Central Asian nation’s growing digital economy while also putting an emphasis on crypto education. Crypto payments coming to Kyrgyzstan through Binance Pay Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, announced it’s going to bring crypto payments to Kyrgyzstan through its Binance Pay service. The latter allows users to spend a variety of cryptocurrencies at merchants that employ it to accept digital cash. The move will be facilitated by a new partnership with the country’s National Investment Agency, a body under the president of Kyrgyzstan tasked to promote foreign investments and assist international companies in finding business opportunities in the former Soviet republic. The exchange and the agency signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate in advancing Kyrgyzstan’s growing crypto sector during the first meeting of its recently formed National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies. The meeting took place with the participation of Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov. His press service also posted photos of him and Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) who arrived on a working visit to the country.

I’m confident that our… pic.twitter.com/Q7iuPN5S01 — Sadyr Zhaparov (@sadyrzhaparovkg) May 3, 2025 The agreement will underpin joint efforts in several areas. Binance said it will help simplify transactions for visitors and provide cross-border payment solutions across the region of Central Asia and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) of which Kyrgyzstan is a member. “The goal is to facilitate faster, simpler, and more inclusive financial flows across borders,” the exchange stressed in a press release. The collaboration “highlights the importance of embracing digital transformation in today’s global economy,” the investment agency was quoted as stating. Binance and Bishkek to collaborate on crypto education The two sides are also planning to launch crypto educational initiatives utilizing the expertise of Binance Academy in the field. The platform will help authorities in Bishkek to design programs promoting digital finance literacy. The crypto exchange elaborated: “These initiatives will target not only government agencies and financial institutions but also Kyrgyz citizens at large. The goal is to support the country’s Web3 entrepreneurs and equip people with the skills needed to thrive in a fast-evolving financial landscape.” “Together, we aim to create a robust framework that supports the development of crypto-assets, enhances financial literacy, and opens new avenues for cross-border payments,” the head of Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency, Farhat Iminov, added in a statement. Binance and Kyrgyzstan share a vision of improving financial inclusion and advancing freedom of money, according to Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and Africa, Kyrylo Khomiakov, who believes crypto tech creates new economic opportunities. The Binance executive emphasized: “We look forward to working closely with our partners on all levels of the Kyrgyz government to implement innovative solutions and educational initiatives that will empower individuals and institutions alike”. Binance’s latest move in Kyrgyzstan comes after earlier in April CZ signed a separate memorandum of understanding with the National Investment Agency to develop the country’s Web3 and blockchain ecosystem. The Kyrgyz republic has gradually embraced innovation that comes with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Last month it approved the launch of a prototype of its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital som, by the end of this year. Similar developments have been seen elsewhere in the region of Central Asia. Also in April, the central bank of Kazakhstan proposed to establish a state-run crypto exchange and issue a stablecoin pegged to the national fiat, the tenge, to be used as a settlement instrument and a store of value.

Today, smart investors are evaluating MAGACOINFINANCE , Bitcoin , and Ethereum as assets that could turn a small position into something significant over time. With traction building and the market gaining broader momentum, early-stage engagement in the right projects remains one of the most effective paths to scaling returns. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Groundwork for Strategic Expansion The strongest digital asset trends typically begin with fundamentals—not fanfare. That’s precisely the path MAGACOINFINANCE is following. Wallet adoption is increasing steadily. Product development is progressing on schedule. Community activity is growing across key channels—and notably, without reliance on promotional hype. This level of organic traction signals a maturing project. For investors seeking early exposure to a structured and scalable asset, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a candidate worthy of close attention. Established Ecosystem Drivers: Ethereum and Bitcoin Remain Key Ethereum (ETH) continues to serve as the backbone of decentralized innovation. With scaling solutions accelerating adoption and enterprise interest expanding, its long-term viability remains strong. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its role as a digital macro asset. Institutional adoption is rising, and global sentiment is increasingly shifting toward BTC as a foundational component of diversified portfolios. While these two assets represent market leadership, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the type of entry-stage opportunity that has historically delivered the most dramatic percentage returns. Additional Assets Gaining Momentum: Polkadot and Sei Polkadot is advancing multi-chain connectivity through its parachain model, supporting a wide range of use cases in the growing Web3 ecosystem. Sei is optimizing blockchain architecture for speed and trading functionality, attracting developers building next-generation financial tools. Both are strong in their own categories, but MAGACOINFINANCE stands out for its early-phase potential and the room it offers for meaningful price discovery. Conclusion A $150 investment might seem small—but placed early in the right project, it can produce results far beyond expectations. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide long-term value, but MAGACOINFINANCE represents something rarer: a structured, early-stage asset entering its growth phase with strong fundamentals. Those watching closely now may be positioning ahead of broader recognition.

An agreement made with investment firms MAG and Multibank Group will see $3B of tokenized real estate issued on Mavrk Network, giving serious momentum as the Layer 1 chain gets up to speed.The deal is a coup for Mavryk given the number of RWA ecosystems that would be only too happy to take on the sort of premier properties that MAG and Multibank Group oversee. The $3B package includes properties pertaining to the Ritz-Carlton luxury hotel chain as well as Ketura Reserve, which specializes in new-build apartments in Dubai. RWA Moves Up a Gear The saying “Slowly, then all at once” seems the best way to describe what’s happening in the RWA sector at present. Having spent the last three years developing the onchain infrastructure for real-world assets to be tokenized and compliantly traded, web3 developers are now starting to witness the fruits of their labors as major players bring their business to the blockchain world. And they don’t get much bigger than MAG and Multibank Group. While the deal was concluded between Mavryk Group and the two investment firms in question, the assets themselves will be issued on MultibankIO’s new platform for real estate, which operates on Mavryk Network. Mavryk Dynamics, meanwhile, will assist with the technical side of tokenization and will help with the construction of any secondary financial markets that are derived from the underlying RWAs. Mavryk Makes Its Mark Mavryk is a rising star of the RWA sector, despite having been comparatively late to the game. Since arriving, however, it’s wasted no time in making a name for itself, with the headline-grabbing $3B RWA tokenization deal following a string of other newsworthy events. In February, Mavryk Dynamics revealed that it had secured more than $5M in private funding. VCs including Big Brain, MetaVest Capital, and Cluster Capital all wrote checks after concluding that they were aligned with the company’s vision for supercharging RWA tokenization.Mavryk is also believed to be making plans for a forthcoming token generation event (TGE) that will enable the public to acquire the native asset of its Layer 1 chain. While trading RWAs requires user verification for compliance purposes, Mavryk is eager to make the assets on its chain available to as many DeFi users as possible. It’s thus intent on ensuring that the products issued on its L1 are not just accessible, but also composable, allowing them to form the backbone of other DeFi primitives such as lending and stablecoin issuance.

The company stated that Solana had managed to break the long-standing downtrend, but certain levels needed to be overcome for the uptrend to be sustainable. The following statements were included in the MakroVision analysis: “Solana has entered a pause period after making a strong breakout above the red downtrend line. The price is currently trading just below the critical resistance zone located at around $159. This level will be decisive for future price action.” According to the analytics firm, Solana has dynamically broken out of a months-long downtrend, with recent price action pointing to a potential trend reversal with higher lows and higher highs.

If this level is broken, the price is expected to rise to the $170 to $188 range. According to analysts, the $146 level stands out as a significant support level in the short term and is currently being tested. Below this level, $136 is considered the next support area to be defended. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What’s the Latest on Solana (SOL)?

Solana was one of those sleeper coins. Back in 2020, it wasn’t even on most people’s radar. Fast forward to its $250 all-time high, and suddenly everyone wished they’d paid attention when it was trading at just a couple of bucks. This is the brutal reality of crypto — hesitation kills potential gains. And while most are late to the party, those who keep their eyes open for low-key, utility-driven projects tend to make smarter plays before the hype kicks in. This brings us to Qubetics — a project that’s currently operating under the radar but packing heavyweight potential. Built as a full-scale Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is solving a real pain point in blockchain: interoperability. Its native token $TICS is still in presale, but don’t mistake that for early noise — the foundation has been solid from day one. The Qubetics presale has entered a critical stage, and those who delay might find themselves priced out completely. With strong tokenomics, a fair launch model, and upcoming mainnet deployment in Q2 2025, Qubetics is making a serious case to be one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025. You Missed $0.01 $TICS — But This Best Crypto Presale Is Now One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in May 2025 Back on September 29, 2024, the Qubetics presale launched quietly, giving whitelist participants the chance to secure $TICS at just $0.01 — no upfront payment required. Since then, it’s been a consistent climb across 31 stages, each one disappearing faster than the last. Right now, the presale has reached Stage 32, pricing $TICS at $0.2093. With over 510 million tokens already sold and $16.6 million raised from more than 25,600 holders, this thing isn’t staying low-key for much longer. The clock’s ticking — every new stage means a 10% price jump, and with just seven days per stage, delays are expensive. The FOMO is real because the Qubetics presale still gives people access to one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 — while the entry price is still within reach. Let’s break it down with real numbers. A $2,000 buy-in today gets you about 9,556 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits just $1, you’re looking at $9,556. If it reaches $5, that turns into $47,780. At $10 after the mainnet launch, that’s $95,560. And if $TICS climbs to $15, you’re staring at $143,340 — a wild 7,066% ROI. This is the kind of setup early buyers chase — real utility, a roadmap that’s unfolding fast, and enough upside to matter. The Qubetics presale isn’t some hype trap — it’s the best crypto presale right now with serious legs. With its strong fundamentals and real-world use case, Qubetics is now one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 , and your window to join in early is still open — for now. Solana’s Rise Was Wild — But Most Missed Its Beginnings In early 2020, Solana barely got a second glance. It launched with an ICO price of around $0.22 — and for a long time, it just hovered. But those who understood its high-speed, low-fee architecture didn’t wait around. They jumped in, quietly stacking $SOL before it caught mainstream attention. By 2021, Solana exploded past $50, then $100, eventually touching an all-time high of around $250. The real gains? Already made by those who took early positions. What’s interesting about Solana is how underestimated it was — even though it was solving a clear issue in scalability. Yet the bulk of the community only joined after the early believers had already seen a 1,000x return. Its growth has since put it in the upper ranks of smart contract platforms, with strong adoption across NFTs, gaming, and DeFi. But the biggest lesson here? It wasn’t always a sure thing — and those who understood the tech before the hype cashed in big. Just like Solana in 2020, Qubetics in 2025 is shaping up to be one of those rare early moments that most people overlook… until it’s too late. Missed Solana? Don’t Miss This — Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in May 2025 In the world of crypto, there’s always a “next big thing.” Solana once filled that role — and if you missed it, you’re not alone. But new doors open fast. Qubetics is checking every box for early community members in 2025: a working use case, real-world relevance, and strong fundamentals. And right now, it’s still early enough to make a strategic move. Whether you’re new to the space or someone who’s been through multiple cycles, this is a chance worth paying attention to. The Qubetics presale is still live, but it won’t be for long. With a mainnet launch just around the corner and a wallet designed to make cross-chain interaction finally functional, $TICS could be the best crypto win of the year. If you’re serious about getting into the top cryptos to invest in May 2025, then it’s time to stop waiting and join this best crypto presale before the next price jump.

44145118,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-meme-coin-to-buy-after-pepes-volatility-newcomers-to-watch,1746354113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44145118.jpeg,Best Meme Coin to Buy After PEPE's Volatility: Newcomers to Watch,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-meme-coin-to-buy-after-pepes-volatility-newcomers-to-watch,"The world of meme coins is never boring! We often see explosive price pumps followed by sharp drops, and coins like Pepe (PEPE) are famous for this kind of action. While recent news around May 2025 shows PEPE trying to build momentum again after earlier consolidation, its well-known volatility reminds investors both of the huge potential profits and the significant risks in the meme coin space. When a popular meme coin like PEPE makes big moves, it often gets people asking: what is the best meme coin to buy now? Should you jump onto the trending coin, or look for new projects – the ""newcomers"" – that might be the next ones to have their moment? Today we'll put a special spotlight on the most promising newcomer Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , which brings powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) to the meme coin world, and also look at other relatively new but established viral sensations. The Meme Coin Rollercoaster Before deciding which meme coin to buy, it helps to understand why their prices swing so wildly, like we often see with coins such as PEPE, Dogecoin, or Shiba Inu. Unlike crypto projects based on complex technology or specific business uses, meme coins usually get their value from: Community Power & Hype: This is the absolute biggest driver. Meme coins rely on their online communities – fans on X, Telegram, Reddit, Discord, etc. – to create buzz. When the community is excited and actively promoting the coin , it attracts new buyers and can push the price up fast. Going Viral: Meme coins are built to spread online. Funny names, relatable memes (like Pepe the Frog or the Shiba Inu dog), or even mentions by celebrities (Dogecoin and Elon Musk!) can make a coin suddenly become famous, leading to a buying frenzy. Why Look for Newcomers After Established Meme Coins Move? When a well-known meme coin like PEPE has a significant price swing (either up or down), it often gets investors thinking about what's next. Why look for newcomers instead of just sticking with the famous ones? Capital Rotation: Sometimes, investors who made profits from a big pump in an established coin (like PEPE or Dogecoin) will take that money and look for the next potential big winner. Seeking Higher Gains: Established meme coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu already have huge market caps. While they can still go up, it's mathematically harder for them to multiply in price by 100x or 1000x compared to a brand new coin starting with a tiny market cap. Finding the ""Next Version"": Sometimes, new projects try to improve upon older ones. For example, Shiba Inu called itself the ""Dogecoin killer"" and added features like its own exchange. Newer meme coins like Dawgz AI are adding AI utility, trying to offer more than just the meme. Investors might bet that these ""upgraded"" versions will be the next big hits. Best Meme Coin to Buy: Newcomers on the Radar in May 2025 So, if you're looking beyond PEPE after its recent activity, which meme coins are worth watching in May 2025? Here's our list of top contenders, led by a project bringing AI into the mix: 1. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): The Most Promising New AI-Powered Meme Coin Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) leads our watchlist as the most promising newcomer in the meme coin space right now. While still in a very successful presale raising over $3.4 million, it is perfectly positioned as a fresh project soon entering the market. What makes Dawgz AI arguably the best meme coin to buy among newcomers is its unique approach: it is blending the viral fun of meme culture with the powerful utility of Artificial Intelligence . Here's why Dawgz AI stands out: AI Utility - More Than a Meme: This is its biggest advantage. Unlike most meme coins, Dawgz AI plans to offer real usefulness through AI. This includes access to smart trading bots (""Blackbox"" tech) and market analysis tools, giving $DAGZ holders actual benefits beyond just the hype. Meme Energy + Community: It still fully embraces the meme coin playbook by building its ""Dawgz Army"" community through social media, contests, and fun branding. This gives it the potential to go viral like other successful meme coins. Strong Foundation: Completing a security audit with SolidProof before launch adds a layer of trust. Its clear token plan includes rewards for staking, which encourages investor loyalty. Early Stage Potential: As a new project just entering the market post-presale, $DAGZ likely has a much smaller total value than established meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or even Pepe. This means it has significantly more room to potentially grow 10x, 100x, or more if it captures market attention. 2. Dogwifhat (WIF): Solana's Viral Hit Dogwifhat (WIF) gained explosive popularity relatively recently, making it a key ""newcomer"" to watch, especially on the Solana blockchain. Its concept is pure meme simplicity: based on a picture of a Shiba Inu dog wearing a distinctive pink hat. WIF captured the sometimes absurd, purely culture-driven side of the meme coin world perfectly. Launched in late 2023, WIF saw a massive price surge early in 2025, becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins. It has a fixed supply of around 998.9 million tokens and, according to most sources, no specific utility, staking, or burning plans – its value comes almost entirely from its strong brand recognition within the Solana community, social media trends, and speculative trading.It's a prime example of a pure community and culture play in the meme coin space. 3. Bonk (BONK): Solana's Ecosystem Meme Coin Bonk (BONK) was the first really big dog-themed meme coin to launch on the Solana blockchain, arriving in late 2022. It became famous through a large airdrop to people already involved in the Solana world (developers, artists, users). This smart move created an instant large group of holders and strong ties to the Solana Community. Unlike WIF, Bonk has tried to build some usefulness within its ecosystem. It has integrations with various Solana projects, launched its own BonkSwap decentralized exchange. It also has a token burn mechanism to slowly reduce the supply. Because it is governed by its community through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, holders can have some say in its future. Bonk represents a meme coin that started with strong community roots and is trying to build lasting value within its chosen blockchain ecosystem, making it an interesting contrast to pure hype coins. 4. Floki Inu (FLOKI): Building an Ecosystem Beyond the Meme Floki Inu (FLOKI) , named after Elon Musk's Shiba Inu dog, launched back in 2021 but continues to be relevant as it tries to build out a larger ecosystem, positioning itself as more than just a meme. Calling itself ""The People's Cryptocurrency,"" FLOKI aims to provide real utility for its holders. The project is working on several key parts: Valhalla: An ambitious NFT-based Metaverse game. FlokiFi: A suite of DeFi tools, including ways to lock up digital assets. FlokiPlaces: A marketplace for NFTs and merchandise. University of Floki: A platform for crypto education. This focus on building actual products makes Floki different from many meme coins. It has a large, dedicated community (the ""Floki Vikings""). While still influenced by meme trends and hype, its efforts to create a functional ecosystem give it potential for more sustainable growth if these products become successful. 5. Brett (BRETT): Base Chain's Cultural Meme Brett (BRETT) is another relatively new but already very popular meme coin, finding its home on the Base blockchain (the Layer 2 network from Coinbase). Like Pepe, Brett originates from the ""Boy's Club"" comic by Matt Furie, where he is Pepe's best friend. This strong cultural link is a major part of its appeal within crypto circles. As the unofficial mascot of the Base network, Brett's success is closely tied to the growth and popularity of Base itself. It operates primarily on community excitement, meme sharing, and cultural relevance. It features standard meme coin elements like a large fixed supply and security measures like a renounced contract. Like WIF, Brett represents a pure meme culture play, making it highly volatile and dependent on continued online attention and the health of the Base ecosystem. Investors are essentially betting on the power of its brand and community. Conclusion: Beyond the PEPE Pump – Finding the Next Winner The excitement around meme coins like PEPE shows that this wild corner of the crypto market is still very much alive in 2025. When one coin pumps, investors immediately start searching for the next one to catch fire. Looking at newcomers is a key strategy for finding potentially massive returns before the next crypto bull run truly takes hold. While established viral hits like Brett, WIF, Bonk, and Floki continue to draw attention, new projects that learn from the past often offer the most compelling opportunities. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out precisely because it is a newcomer that blends the essential ingredients of meme coin success – strong community building and viral potential – with the forward-looking integration of valuable AI utility. Too fast to track.⚡Too loud to miss.🌩️ pic.twitter.com/cNLSia6F6r — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 18, 2025 This unique combination makes it arguably the best and most promising newcomer meme coin to buy for investors seeking substance alongside excitement. As always, the key is thorough research and understanding the high risks involved in chasing the next big meme coin winner. FAQ Section : What makes a meme coin the ""best"" one to buy now? The best meme coin to buy often has a strong, active online community, viral potential, and ideally, some unique feature or utility beyond just the meme. Projects like the most promising Dawgz AI are gaining attention because they mix meme fun with useful AI technology. Are new meme coins safe to invest in? No, new meme coins are extremely high-risk investments. Many fail quickly or turn out to be scams (""rug pulls""). While Dawgz AI adds credibility with a security audit and planned utility, you should only invest money you are fully prepared to lose in any new meme coin. How does AI help meme coin? The AI features like in Dawgz AI, like potential trading tools or market insights for holders, makes it more than just a joke token and could attract more serious investors, potentially giving more staying power than meme coins based only on hype, making them one of the most promising tokens. After a coin like PEPE pumps, is it better to buy it or look for new coins? Buying a coin after a huge pump is often very risky as it might be due for a correction (price drop). Many traders prefer to look for new, undiscovered coins with strong fundamentals and potential, like Dawgz AI, hoping to catch the beginning of the next big move rather than chasing one that has already happened.

The flagship cryptocurrency has not ceded ground to the bears, maintaining its position above key levels as it eyes a move to $100,000 and beyond. BTC is trading at around $95,900. Analysts believe the asset is approaching a significant breakout point, with on-chain data and trading volumes indicating an imminent surge. Bitcoin A Matter Of National Security The CIA is increasingly integrating Bitcoin as a tool in its operations, and working with the asset is a matter of national security, according to Michael Ellis, the agency’s deputy director. Ellis made the comments during an appearance on Anthony Pompliano’s The Pomp Podcast, stating that the CIA works with law enforcement agencies to track BTC , adding that it is a point of data collection in counter-intelligence operations. Ellis stated, “Bitcoin is here to stay cryptocurrency is here to stay. As you know, more and more institutions are adopting it, and I think that is a great trend. One that this administration has obviously been leaning forward into.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin Fund Holds 607,685 BTC Worth $58.5 Billion Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs amassed nearly $700 million during Friday’s trading session, ending the week on a high. Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $674 million, while Ethereum ETFs notched up inflows of $20 million, according to data from SoSoValue. BlackRock’s IBIT captured nearly all inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, while others ended relatively flat. Friday’s inflows pushed IBIT’s trove to a staggering 607,685.49 bitcoin, valued at about $58.5 billion. Bitcoin ETFs have registered over $40 billion in net inflows since January 11. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs registered a similar pattern, with $20.10 million flowing almost exclusively to BlackRock’s ETHA. The remaining Ethereum ETFs registered neither gains nor outflows. Analysts Bullish On Strategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Plans Analysts are upbeat about Strategy and its Bitcoin acquisition plans despite the company reporting a per-share decline of $16.49 in Q1. Equity analysts from Benchmark and Bernstein reiterated their buy ratings. They set lofty price targets for Strategy a day after the firm reported a $5.9 billion loss on its Bitcoin holdings in the first quarter of 2025. The analysts highlighted Strategy’s plans to acquire more Bitcoin. Strategy pivoted to BTC from software development around five years ago. Mark Palmer, Benchmark Senior Research Analyst, Fintech and Digital Assets, stated, “The number of companies that have sought to replicate Strategy’s (MSTR) Bitcoin acquisition strategy has continued to grow rapidly, with more than 70 public companies following its lead by adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Yesterday, MSTR issued a reminder of the extent of its first-mover advantage and how its ability to accelerate its accumulation of Bitcoin has continued to increase as its platform has scaled.” Strategy reported a decline of $16.49 per common share in the first quarter of 2025 thanks to BTC’s steep decline. The firm also experienced macroeconomic headwinds impacting crypto and tech firms. However, it outlined its intention to purchase more Bitcoin during Thursday's earnings call. Strategy pivoted from software development to Bitcoin in 2020 and owns 554,000 BTC , valued at a staggering $53 billion at current prices. Strategy purchased its BTC at an average cost of $68,459 as of April 28. Meanwhile, Tyson’s Corner, a Virginia-based company, is completing an initiative announced last October. The firm announced plans to purchase $42 billion worth of Bitcoin and unveiled an ambitious 42/42 Plan to acquire an additional $42 billion worth of Bitcoin through 2027. “It intends to raise a total of $84 billion of capital ($42 billion in equity and $42 billion in fixed income) through 2027 to fund Bitcoin purchases. MSTR’s audacious $84 billion capital-raising target includes the $42 billion targeted by its initial plan, which is now 65% complete with ~$14.7 billion remaining.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis BTC is oscillating around $96,000, registering a marginal decline to slip below this key level and move to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency has been unable to stay above $96,000 as it faces a final resistance hindering a move to $100,000. Analysts believe the $100,000 level is crucial in dictating BTC’s price trajectory and could act as a springboard for bullish momentum or trigger profit-taking that could lead to a substantial spike in selling pressure. The flagship cryptocurrency has lost momentum over the weekend despite rising to an intraday high of $97,996 on Friday. BTC was bullish the previous week, rising nearly 3% on Monday and rallying almost 7% on Tuesday, surging past $90,000 and settling at $93,373. The rally stalled on Wednesday as it faced selling pressure and volatility. Despite this, BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $93,749. The price fell to an intraday low of $91,693 on Thursday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to claim $94,000 and settle at $94,009. BTC continued to push higher on Friday, increasing nearly 1% to $94,776. Price action turned bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday and fell almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $93,802. Source: TradingView The current week started on a bullish note as BTC rose 1.29% to claim $95,000 and settle at $95,010. Despite the positive start, the price dropped on Tuesday, falling 0.70%, slipping below $95,000 and settling at $94,341. BTC faced volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC registered a marginal decline and dropped to $94,160. Bullish sentiment returned on Thursday as BTC rose 2.43% to surge past $96,000 and settle at $96,452. BTC continued to push higher on Friday, reaching an intraday high of $97,996 before losing momentum and settling at $96,939. However, the rally lost momentum on Saturday as the price fell almost 1%, slipping below $96,000 and settling at $95,988. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Buyers will look to establish control and push towards $100,000. Meanwhile, sellers will look to test support levels, driving the price towards $90,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The arrival and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have brought big money and institutional investors into Bitcoin like never before. We're seeing ""mega-buys"" from large players and, as BlackRock noted at the recent TOKEN2049 event, ETF flows are increasingly driven by these institutions. While this is fantastic news for Bitcoin and the overall legitimacy of crypto, it also creates an interesting dynamic: where do investors looking for potentially much larger percentage gains go next? Finding the best crypto presale is becoming a key strategy for those seeking exponential returns. Among the new launches capturing attention, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stands out as a most promising example, perfectly positioned to attract investors looking beyond the ETF headlines. The ETF Effect: How Mainstream Success Fuels the Hunt for the Next BigThing The launch and success of Bitcoin ETFs, especially in the US, has been a game-changer for crypto. It provides an easy, regulated way for traditional investors and large institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This mainstream acceptance is great for Bitcoin's price and reputation. However, it also has a knock-on effect: Potentially Lower Percentage Gains for BTC: As Bitcoin becomes a multi-trillion dollar asset held by huge institutions, the possibility of it going up 50x or 100x from current levels naturally decreases. While still volatile, its growth trajectory might become more measured compared to its early explosive days. Search for ""Alpha"": Sophisticated investors are always looking for ""alpha"" – returns that beat the general market. If Bitcoin becomes more like a standard part of a portfolio, those seeking much higher though riskier returns need to look elsewhere. Early-stage projects, like those found in crypto presales, become logical targets for this risk-seeking capital. Best Crypto Presale Finding a truly great crypto presale requires careful digging. You need to look past flashy marketing and assess the core potential. Here's why Dawgz AI stands out as a top example for 2025, and a brief look at the types of other projects often found in presales: Dawgz AI ($DAGZ): The Most Promising AI Presale Gem Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) perfectly illustrates what is the best crypto presale opportunity in the current market, especially appealing to investors looking beyond the Bitcoin ETF narrative. What makes Dawgz AI the best presale example to watch? Strong Narrative Alignment: It combines two of the hottest trends: Artificial Intelligence and Meme Coins. Utility Focus: Unlike many purely speculative presales, Dawgz AI has a clear plan to offer real utility through AI-powered tools, like trading bots and market analysis. This substance provides a stronger foundation than hype alone and fits the market's growing demand for useful projects. Early Stage Potential: Getting involved right after the presale still offers the chance to buy in at a potentially very low market capitalization compared to established coins. Security Verification: Completing a smart contract audit by SolidProof before the main launch adds a layer of trust and demonstrates a commitment to security. Dawgz AI represents the kind of opportunity many investors seek when looking beyond established assets like Bitcoin– an innovative project with AI focus, tapping into popular culture, with strong early indicators , available at an accessible price point. Other Types of Promising Presale Projects While Dawgz AI is a standout example, investors hunting for presales often look across various sectors where innovation is happening: New Layer 1/Layer 2 Blockchains: Presales sometimes launch for entirely new blockchain networks promising faster speeds, lower costs, or unique features compared to existing ones. These are bets on new infrastructure gaining adoption. Innovative DeFi Protocols: New decentralized finance projects offering unique lending, borrowing, trading, or yield-generating strategies often use presales to launch their governance or utility tokens. Web3 Gaming/Metaverse Platforms: Presales are common for tokens associated with new blockchain-based games or virtual worlds, allowing early players/investors to get involved. Infrastructure Projects: Projects building fundamental infrastructure for the decentralized web, like data oracles or decentralized storage/compute networks, might also offer presale opportunities. The key is to evaluate each presale project on its own merits – does it have a real purpose, strong technology, a good team, and sensible tokenomics? – rather than just buying because it is in presale. Conclusion: Great opportunities Beyond ETFs The success of Bitcoin ETFs and the influx of institutional ""mega-buys"" are undeniably positive developments for the crypto market's maturity and mainstream acceptance in 2025. However, this very success is also pushing smart money and retail investors to look towards earlier-stage opportunities like crypto presales in search of potentially much higher returns. Finding the best crypto presale involves careful navigation through a field filled with both immense potential and significant risk. Projects like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) stand out in this landscape. By completing a successful presale while offering a compelling blend of cutting-edge AI utility, viral meme coin appeal, strong community focus, and essential security measures, it represents exactly the kind of innovative, high-potential opportunity that investors seek beyond the established ETF platform. Too fast to track.⚡Too loud to miss.🌩️ pic.twitter.com/cNLSia6F6r — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) April 18, 2025 As the market gears up for its next major cycle, looking towards well-researched, fundamentally sound presale projects like Dawgz AI could be a key strategy, but one that must always be approached with thorough diligence and a clear understanding of the risks involved. FAQ Section : Why look at crypto presales if Bitcoin ETFs are doing well? Bitcoin ETFs offer easy access to BTC, but its massive size limits future percentage gains. Presales allow investment in brand new projects at the lowest possible price, offering potentially much higher returns if successful, like the most promising Dawgz AI aiming to capture the AI trend early. How can I find the best crypto presale projects? Research projects featured on crypto launchpads or news sites, but verify everything on official channels. Look for clear utility, transparent teams (if possible), strong tokenomics, community engagement, and crucially, a security audit – factors that made Dawgz AI a promising example. What are the biggest risks of investing in crypto presales? The main risks are scams (like rug pulls where the team vanishes with money), the project failing to launch or gain adoption, extreme price volatility after listing, and lack of security. Always do deep research and only invest what you can afford to lose in any presale, even promising ones like Dawgz AI. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

With its presale crossing $1,542,503 in early May, CartelFi is positioning itself as a decentralised finance (DeFi) layer built for meme tokens—assets often known more for their volatility than their utility. Instead of selling these tokens, CartelFi allows holders to stake them and earn yield through a native token called CARTFI. The platform’s pitch is clear: if meme tokens have value, they should work harder for their holders. The project runs on Ethereum and offers staking rewards up to 1000% annual percentage yield (APY), far above typical DeFi returns. While the platform is still pre-launch, the three-month presale format with fixed price increases and structured burns is gaining traction. In a landscape dominated by speculative meme tokens like Bonk or Dogwifhat, CartelFi’s approach combines meme-driven virality with mechanisms usually found in more serious DeFi protocols. Not just a meme: DeFi mechanics for idle tokens Unlike PEPE or WIF, which trade purely on market sentiment, CartelFi introduces staking as its primary use case. Users can deposit meme coins into fixed-term pools and earn rewards in CARTFI, which is then bought back and partially burned using protocol fees. This model blends deflationary supply with redistributive rewards—both features aimed at increasing long-term token value. The project has three staking tiers. The highest-yield option is a six-month lock at a 1000% APY. Four-month and three-month pools offer 250% and 150% APYs, respectively. Though aggressive, the model is structured to incentivise long-term holding while driving transaction volume through burns. Platform fees are used to buy CARTFI off the market, and 50% of those tokens are destroyed permanently—reducing supply as usage grows. A fixed cap and rising presale CartelFi’s token supply is capped at 1 billion CARTFI. Twenty-five percent is reserved for presale investors, with another 25% earmarked for liquidity and trading incentives post-launch. The rest is split between ecosystem development, community marketing, staking rewards, and treasury. The presale began on 8 April 2025 and will end in July. Every 72 hours, the token price rises by 5%—a model intended to reward early entrants. Buyers can use ETH, SOL, BNB, USDC, or USDT to purchase CARTFI. At the time of writing, CartelFi has already moved through multiple pricing stages and raised over $1.5 million, with further interest expected as centralised exchange listings and staking pools go live in Q3. How CartelFi compares in today’s market CartelFi’s entry comes as the memecoin market faces saturation. Coins like Bonk and Dogwifhat exploded in popularity in late 2024, but offered no built-in yield. WIF remains speculative, and Bonk, despite its community strength, lacks a deflationary supply or utility. CartelFi instead targets that gap—building on the assumption that meme assets are here to stay, and that holders will eventually want more than price speculation. Compared to traditional DeFi tokens like AAVE or COMP, CartelFi’s model is narrower in scope but more aggressive in its design. Where blue-chip DeFi platforms offer single- or double-digit APYs, CartelFi makes high-yield staking central to its protocol, with fees recycled into rewards and buybacks. Whether this translates into long-term sustainability will depend on adoption post-presale, but for now, it presents a novel approach in a crowded market.

According to Ajit Jain, the vice chairman of the insurance operations at Berkshire Hathaway, it is beyond doubt that artificial intelligence is going to be a game-changer in the insurance industry. It will dramatically change the way “we assess risk, we price risk, we sell risk, and then the way we end up paying claims,” he said at the Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting this weekend. However, Jain confirmed that Berkshire has a habit of being in the “wait and see” mode until the opportunity “crystalizes” – and, therefore, “conscious big-time effort in terms of pouring a lot of money into this opportunity.” Jain’s remarks suggest he’s convinced that AI is a huge opportunity that will continue to evolve and transform industries not just in the next few months but over the next few years instead. That’s what makes AI-focused investments like the up-and-coming PepeX and exciting investment opportunity for 2025. PepeX has an AI story behind it PepeX advertises itself as the “world’s first AI-powered tokenization launchpad”. It’s a crypto platform that enables users to tap into the magic of artificial intelligence to launch new memes with greater ease and efficiency than ever before. More importantly, the use of artificial intelligence lets you automate meme marketing as well and enhances the chances of it going viral. Eliminating the need for coding skills, PepeX wants to make meme coin launches more accessible, fair, and efficient. It’s a powerful narrative that’s been driving significant interest into the native PepeX meme coin in recent weeks. PepeX presale has raised more than $1.9 million already. If you’re interested in learning more about PepeX and its native meme coin, click here to visit the project website now. PepeX may be warming up to an explosive rally It’s believable that PepeX price will unlock significant further upside moving forward since the meme coin is even yet to list on a crypto exchange. Once coins go live on an exchange, access to them improves drastically, which historically drives massive interest that ultimately translates to a higher price tag. Knowing that meme coins, especially ones that have a story behind, tend to offer explosive initial returns, it’s likely that PepeX will rally post-listing in the coming months. Plus, there are broader crypto tailwinds, including a sharp potential rally in BTC and a further decline in interest rates that could end up benefiting PepeX as well in 2025.

Specifically, Bitcoin recorded 925,914 unique active addresses within 24 hours as of May 3, according to on-chain data shared by cryptocurrency analytics platform Glassnode. The data indicates that BTC price has steadily climbed from mid-April lows, closely tracking the rise in network participation. Bitcoin number of active addresses chart.

Bitcoin key price levels to watch Bitcoin is currently consolidating in a narrow range just below a key resistance level. According to cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez, who shared insights in a May 3 post on X, the critical resistance to watch is $98,290. A breakout above this level could pave the way for a move toward the highly anticipated $100,000 milestone. On the flip side, $96,160 serves as a crucial support level. With the price oscillating between these two markers, Bitcoin is trading within a tight band that appears poised for a decisive breakout in either direction.

He didn’t back down when pressed days later in a follow-up interview with analyst Kyle Chassé, instead laying out a roadmap for how global financial chaos will make it inevitable. The $1 Million Thesis In a series of posts on X, Chassé unpacked Hayes’ thought process, revealing the Maelstrom CIO’s prediction envisions a radical scenario where BTC is no longer just a speculative asset, but the ultimate hedge against a global financial system possibly teetering on collapse. According to Hayes, the world is splitting into economic blocs, with the U.S. and China locked in a slow-motion decoupling. If traditional systems falter, the crypto investor expects the ensuing Treasury buybacks , bond market panic, and what he calls “monetary detonation” will nudge institutions to flee to BTC. “Bitcoin isn’t risk-on anymore,” Chassé echoed. “It’s system-off.” In his post, the crypto influencer explained that Hayes’ estimations will possibly play out in two phases: a surge to $250,000 by late 2025 as liquidity floods markets, followed by a moonshot to seven figures triggered by “ballooning deficits, debasement, and unstoppable digital scarcity.” Corporate Forecasts While some may consider the BitMEX co-founder’s view too ambitious, it’s not entirely disconnected from where parts of the traditional financial world see Bitcoin heading. Several firms have recently upgraded their BTC price targets amid strong demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, reduced post-halving supply, and favorable macro backdrops. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee and H.C. Wainwright both land near Hayes’ interim target, forecasting $225,000 to $250,000 for 2025. BlackRock and Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya come closest to Hayes’s million-dollar prediction at $700,000 and $500,000, respectively. Meanwhile, Standard-Chartered and Matrixport have lifted their year-end targets to $200,000, while VanEck sees the possibility of a cycle top that reaches as high as $250,000. While the projections fall far short of the $1 million mark, they are finally recognizing BTC’s potential to move well beyond its previous all-time highs.

Here’s why MUTM is gaining investor attention,https://invezz.com/news/2025/05/04/will-bitcoin-btc-reach-a-new-all-time-high-next-month-heres-why-mutm-is-gaining-investor-attention/,"The crypto market is once again nearing a pivotal point. With Bitcoin (BTC) hovering near $95,000, discussions about a possible return to all-time highs are heating up. But while BTC remains a central focus, many investors are quietly turning their attention toward new, utility-driven projects that could outperform in the months ahead. One such project gaining notable momentum is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi protocol steadily positioning itself as a serious contender in the space. Could Bitcoin break records in May? Bitcoin has shown strong signs of recovery this year, and its recent climb toward the $100K mark has analysts debating whether a new all-time high (ATH) is imminent. Some forecasts suggest that BTC could breach its previous record of $108,000 as early as next month, supported by institutional accumulation and favorable technical indicators. Analysts at Standard Chartered have recently noted a shift of capital from US equities into cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin emerging as one of the main assets benefiting from this trend. Technicals are also aligning, with BTC trading above its 200-day moving average and the RSI signaling continued strength. If momentum holds, a break above $110K could quickly follow, placing Bitcoin into uncharted territory once again. That said, many market participants are already looking beyond Bitcoin—not because it’s losing value, but because the next wave of growth is often found in projects still in early stages. And that’s where Mutuum Finance enters the picture. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol designed for lending, borrowing, and earning yield across a variety of digital assets. What makes it stand out isn’t just the standard DeFi functionality—it’s how the entire system is structured to generate real value for participants, not just early hype. Mutuum’s platform is built around two main pillars: adaptable lending systems and a stablecoin backed by excess collateral. The lending system allows users to earn passive income by supplying crypto assets to shared liquidity pools. Interest is paid by borrowers, with rates that adjust dynamically based on pool utilization. This setup gives users access to reliable yield opportunities, while maintaining full control over their deposited assets. One of the protocol’s most ambitious components is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which is issued when users deposit collateral into Mutuum. This stablecoin operates without centralized control and is fully supported by on-chain collateral. Each unit minted is supported by more than its equivalent value in crypto, and the system automatically burns stablecoins when loans are repaid or liquidated—ensuring a tight supply model that reinforces stability. What makes this stablecoin especially appealing is that the interest paid on stablecoin loans goes straight to the protocol’s treasury, strengthening Mutuum’s reserves over time. This structure is built for sustainability, not short-term inflation, giving the ecosystem a self-reinforcing economic layer that many DeFi platforms still lack. Mutuum’s presale has already crossed significant milestones, with over $7.4 million raised and a growing holder base now exceeding 9,270 wallets. The current price of $0.025 still places it in accessible territory, but rising demand and phase-based price increases are making it one of the top crypto to buy now before listings begin. What’s also drawing attention is the kind of capital that’s moving into MUTM. A number of early supporters come from projects like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polkadot—a strong sign that experienced holders are recognizing Mutuum’s potential as the next big DeFi crypto. These aren’t hype-driven entries; they’re strategic plays by those who understand how to spot scalable models with real utility. Unlike many presale tokens that launch without a working product, Mutuum Finance is planning to roll out a beta version of its platform by the time MUTM hits the market. This timeline aligns functionality with market access, making it easier for users to experience the protocol firsthand from day one. Token utility also plays a central role in Mutuum’s strategy. The project features a smart revenue-sharing mechanism, where a portion of protocol earnings is used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to engaged users. This design encourages participation while supporting the token’s long-term value. Whether or not Bitcoin sets a new ATH next month, the broader takeaway is clear: investor interest is expanding beyond the major players. As attention shifts toward functional, early-stage protocols with clear use cases, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a standout. With passive income features, a built-in stablecoin model, a clear token economy, and growing adoption from seasoned crypto holders, MUTM is gaining traction as one of the best cheap cryptocurrencies to buy now, and its story is only just beginning.

According to a report by Point Daily, crypto voters’ political significance has grown as Bitcoin’s market capitalization in Korea now exceeds 2,600 trillion won. This has rivaled the combined value of KOSPI-listed companies. As Point Daily notes , these 16 million investors account for a substantial portion of the country’s approximately 44.25 million eligible voters from the previous general election. Major parties are using crypto-specific strategies to attract these voters. The Democratic Party has brought Professor Kim Yong-jin of Sogang University, a token securities expert, into their campaign team. Representative Min Byeong-deok of the same party has introduced a draft Basic Digital Asset Act that includes provisions for a stablecoin authorization system linked to legal tender.

This includes abolishing the restrictive one-exchange-one-bank system, institutionalizing virtual asset trading for corporations, allowing spot ETF trading within the year, and establishing South Korea as a global virtual asset hub. People Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo specifically addressed the frustration of investors. He stated that about 16 million people, or one-third of the population, are participating in the virtual asset market, but virtual asset investors are being left without even the minimum protection measures. Separately, Joseilbo reported that the Financial Services Commission announced that non-profit organizations and virtual asset exchanges will be permitted to sell their virtual assets starting in June, provided they establish internal review mechanisms and strengthen anti-money laundering protocols.

44145186,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65806,1746356427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"While Everyone Watches Bitcoin (BTC), One Quiet Protocol Is Preparing for Its First 10x",https://timestabloid.com/while-everyone-watches-bitcoin-btc-one-quiet-protocol-is-preparing/,"Bitcoin may be on the verge of another major milestone, but not every breakout starts at the top. While most of the market keeps its eyes locked on BTC’s push toward six figures, a smaller, quieter protocol is building momentum beneath the surface — and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is starting to stand out as one of the few projects quietly preparing for what could be its first 10x move. The token hasn’t launched yet, but the pace of development, increasing investor engagement, and smart platform design suggest it won’t stay under the radar much longer. For those asking what crypto to invest in this cycle, MUTM is beginning to enter the conversation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike many projects that rely on hype, Mutuum Finance has taken a different route. It’s kept a low profile while developing a decentralized protocol that emphasizes functionality over flash. No celebrity backers. No buzzword-heavy whitepapers. Just clear mechanics that serve real users in the DeFi space. At its core, the platform is being built to support seamless lending and borrowing between users through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. This gives it flexibility — users can contribute assets to pooled contracts or negotiate terms directly with others, depending on their needs. More importantly, the protocol includes support for a wide range of tokens, including those not typically available in traditional lending markets — even popular assets from top cryptocurrencies. But perhaps the most underappreciated part of Mutuum’s design is how it creates value through usability, not speculation. For anyone seeking the best crypto to buy now, that distinction makes all the difference. One feature that deserves more attention is the use of mtTokens, which are issued when users deposit assets into the platform. These tokens aren’t just placeholders — they represent a growing share of the protocol’s liquidity and can be held, transferred, or redeemed based on the value they’ve accumulated. Every mtToken passively tracks earnings from interest paid by borrowers. This setup makes it possible to remain liquid while still earning — something not many early-stage protocols offer. It’s especially appealing for those exploring crypto investment options that prioritize real yield over short-term speculation. To scale further, Mutuum is also integrating a Layer-2 solution that will increase transaction efficiency and lower fees. This infrastructure upgrade positions the project to handle larger volumes and sustain long-term demand — key for any DeFi crypto hoping to grow in a competitive environment. A lot of tokens draw attention after listings. MUTM, however, is already generating strong traction during its presale. Over 430 million tokens have already been sold, with more than 9,300 holders joining the ecosystem so far. That growing community has helped push total raised funds to $7.4 million, and the number continues to rise. It’s not just retail investors getting involved. Wallet activity shows increased interest from addresses that previously held major cryptocurrencies — including ETH, ADA, and XRP — suggesting that experienced holders see Mutuum as more than just another presale opportunity. Many are now watching closely for signs that this could be the next big crypto to invest in for serious upside. Currently available at $0.025, MUTM is still accessible for early participants. With the beta version of the platform expected to go live at launch and listings projected to follow, crypto predictions suggest a potential move to $0.25 in the near term, which would represent a clean 10x return from its current presale value. For context, a simple $500 investment now would turn into $5,000 when that price target is reached — and that’s before considering more ambitious year-end projections, which place MUTM somewhere between $2 and $4, depending on adoption and platform growth. Unlike tokens that rely on staking emissions or artificial inflation, MUTM’s growth potential is tied directly to platform activity. As usage increases, so does the token’s utility, which could drive sustained interest long after the presale ends. That’s what separates it from many new crypto coins entering the space. Mutuum Finance is part of a broader shift happening in the DeFi space — a move away from hype-driven launches and toward protocols that offer lasting value. By combining a clean user experience with smart token mechanics, and backing it all with a structured rollout plan, MUTM is quietly doing everything right. While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, early investors are already turning their attention to where the next wave of growth might come from — and they’re finding it in places like Mutuum Finance, a contender for one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in before the next major crypto breakout.

As the backbone of smart contracts, Ethereum remains a long-term cornerstone for decentralized innovation.

Its blockDAG architecture offers fast, secure transactions and is attracting more developers and long-term holders as network growth accelerates. Sei (SEI) is trading at approximately $0.213 , with a projected short-term target of $0.232 . A recent 25% increase in quarterly operating income reflects the strength of Sei’s business model and infrastructure design.

At last check Sunday, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) was trading at $0.1743, a range it has remained stuck at in the past few days. This price is about 36% above the lowest level this year. On-chain data compiled by Santiment shows that large investors have continued to accumulate the coin. DOGE holders with between 1 million and 10 million coins have increased their holdings from 10.3 billion in March to 10.5 billion today, a 200 million increase. Similarly, larger holders with between 100 million and 1 billion coins have increased their positions from 23.4 billion in March to 25.52 billion. Whale accumulation, especially in a bear market, is seen as a positive catalyst for an asset. These whales have bought the coin, potentially anticipating a spot DOGE ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The odds of that approval are high because Dogecoin is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency, and the agency is not concerned that it is a security. You might also like: 21Shares seeks SEC approval for spot Dogecoin ETF DOGE whale accumulation | Source: Santiment Dogecoin price has stalled for two main reasons. First, there are signs of a rotation from traditional memecoins to newer ones on the Solana ecosystem. Its sluggish performance happened as top Solana meme coins like Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) and Popcat ( POPCAT ) surged. Second, Elon Musk has hinted that he will scale back his work for the Department of Government Efficiency as the Tesla stock has crashed. Exiting the DOGE project will not have a direct impact on Dogecoin. However, it may hurt sentiment among investors. Dogecoin price technical analysis DOGE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart reveals that the DOGE price has moved sideways in the past few weeks. It has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern whose two lines are about to converge. This triangle is happening after the coin crashed from $0.4815 in December. As such, there is a risk that it has formed a bearish pennant pattern. Therefore, the Dogecoin price may soon have a bearish breakdown, potentially to support at $0.10, which is down 43% from the current level. This bearish outlook will be invalidated if it moves above the 50% retracement level at $0.2796. Dogecoin was created in December 2013 by Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. The two software engineers were reportedly inspired by the popular “Doge” meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog. The coin, formed using Litecoin’s codebase, has seen surges in popularity thanks in part to endorsements from Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

Here Are 2 Cryptos That Could Grow It Into $74,000 in 23 Weeks",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/got-1000-here-are-2-cryptos-that-could-grow-it-into-74000-in-23-weeks/,"At present the crypto market offers substantial profit potential to investors who deposit $1,000 which can specifically benefit from Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Dogecoin maintains its position at $0.1757 while investors anticipate a market boost after the SEC approves Dogecoin ETF launches in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully gathered $7,500,000 through its presale and has sold over 438 million tokens. The tokenomics structure of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently at its phase 4 price of $0.025 supports investors to earn a 140% profit at the expected $0.06 listing price. The two tokens present separate investment approaches through which someone can grow $74,000 from an initial small deposit within 23 weeks. Dogecoin’s ETF-Driven Potential The digital currency Dogecoin remains very close to initiating its impending price jump. The currency is presently trading at $0.1757 before reaching its latest peak of $0.1926 with Bitcoin exceeding $95,000. The planned approval of a Dogecoin Exchange-Traded Fund during 2025 shows a 57% chance for success which would drive prices to $0.4336 while delivering a 145% gain for investors. If invested at its current price of $500 the funds would increase to $1,234 in 23 weeks due to this surge. The price movement of Dogecoin depends heavily upon Bitcoin’s market trends and stock value fluctuations since altcoins typically follow Bitcoin in their market performance. The risk? ETF investors show preference for Bitcoin funds while contributing only $2.5 billion to Ethereum instead of the $38 billion poured into Bitcoin. The unpredictable nature of Dogecoin involves risks yet its potential profitability is found enticing to investors. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge The DeFi space shows growing fascination for the platform offered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM). During Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025 both buyers and holders have reached 9,400 buying 55% of the available tokens in this phase. The rush to obtain Mutuum Finance tokens during their phase 5 presale period will generate a 20% profit from the current price of $0.03 because they rise to $0.03. Tokenomics during the project launch will generate 140% ROI that allows investors who put $500 today to achieve $1,200 at the $0.06 listing price. After the token launches analysts expect the value to reach $2.50 which will deliver a predicted return on investment of 9,900% from $500 to $50,000 and boost the token from 0.025 dollars to its target price of 2.50 dollars. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks, further fueling demand. Mutuum Finance’s Security Focus The MUTM team places trust at the forefront of their operations. The project has partnered with Certik to perform a smart contract audit which will be publicly released on social networks. Their dedication to open communication has been reinforced through this step which strengthens relationships with stakeholders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions differently than Dogecoin since it implements a lending structure that delivers passive income through mtTokens bringing real utility. Currently in Phase 4 indicates an investor rush because market prices are descending so quickly. The current $500 investment in Mutuum Finance has the potential to grow into $50,000 dollars during late 2025 while Dogecoin may remain limited to its current value. Pathway to $74,000 Dogecoin along with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers investors an extremely strong pair that will yield a $1,000 investment. By distributing $500 between DOGE and MUTM you could obtain $1,234 with DOGE and achieve $50,000 if MUTM reaches its $2.50 target price. The combination of these investments would generate profits worth $74,000 to be received within 23 weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates superior expansion structure as its system performs better than DOGE by depending solely on outside triggers. The current phase which investors need to act quickly is disappearing rapidly. Analysis of both projects should be complete to grab this temporary chance.

Price reached $97,500 before dipping slightly lower to $97,000, and the markets are abuzz. Sellers anticipating Bitcoin’s upswing might be in for trouble. Figures reveal over $3 billion worth of short positions potentially being erased should Bitcoin move over the coveted $100,000 threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Infinity? Venture Capitalist Says Crypto’s Value Vs. Dollar Has No Ceiling Massive Short Positions Clustered Below $100K According to Coinglass, there’s a heavy concentration of short positions across major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit between the $97K and $100K range. That cluster of bets against Bitcoin is now on shaky ground. A move past $100K could lead to a wave of liquidations totaling about $3.04 billion. If Bitcoin goes even further—to approximately $105,000—liquidations may rise to almost $3.73 billion. At the last all-time high of $109,000, the figure may reach $4 billion. Short sellers who sold the market with high leverage are most vulnerable, and the heat is on. Long Positions Cleared In Earlier Dip While shorts are currently in the crosshairs, long positions already lost some ground. In a recent dip, longs saw much of the bullish bets get washed out. The aggregate leverage that supported long positions has declined drastically, according to the red trendline of long liquidations. This leaves fewer overconfident buyers propping up the market, lessening the risk of an abrupt crash from long-side liquidation. The reset also leaves a cleaner path higher, as there is less resistance from leveraged longs attempting to hold their positions. Resistance Zone Between $96K And $98K Bitcoin is now trading within one of its largest resistance zones. On-chain indicators on IntoTheBlock indicate that an estimated 1.06 million wallets purchased approximately 750,800 BTC between the $96K and $98K regions. That’s nearly $73 billion’s worth of Bitcoin at break-even for a good number of holders. This region is significant. If Bitcoin manages to break above it, there will be less selling pressure in the way. The price may rise quicker with fewer hurdles between $98K and $100K. $3B in #Bitcoin shorts will get liquidated at $100K.

Although no one has actually declared it dead (at least not in the well-known public space), a social media influencer with over 500,000 followers on X explained why it could be just loading. Not Dead, Just Loading John Squire started with a 10-year setup that investors might have ignored until now. Ever since the project’s establishment around a decade ago, the company behind it has made big moves to enhance adoption. Squire said RippleNet is used in over 55 countries, while some of its notable partners include SBI, Tranglo, and Santander. As such, he noted that XRP isn’t some “new hype coin. It’s been quietly building since before most influencers discovered Bitcoin.” He touched upon the prolonged battle between Ripple and the US securities regulator, which dragged on for over four years. Although the SEC has yet to confirm that the case is closed, Ripple’s CEO triumphantly announced it in mid-March. Squire said, “XRP is the only top 10 coin to fight the US government and survive.” In terms of institutional adoption and the possibility of a spot Ripple ETF in the States, the social media influencer outlined the XRP futures product prepared to be launched by CME this month, as well as the 10 applications sitting on the SEC’s desk. Although the Commission delayed making a decision on one of them earlier this week, many experts believe it’s just a matter of time before XRP follows the example set by ETH and BTC last year. Institutional money is knocking CME launching XRP futures in May 2025 Wall Street wants in Rumors of BlackRock XRP trust won’t die This isn’t retail buzz. This is big money warming up. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) May 1, 2025 XRP Price Chart Says Bull Run Echoing another report that XRP might skyrocket in the following month(s), Squire said the asset’s chart paints a clear bullish picture. Aside from a few brief fluctuations below $2, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency has mostly remained steady above that line ever since it broke it in late 2024. Squire added that the RSI is cooling off and the volume is “quietly building. Smart money doesn’t chase pumps. It buys when you are bored,” he added. There’s certainly some proof for that, as whales accumulated nearly $2 billion worth of XRP in April alone. Additionally, whale addresses have skyrocketed to a record of their own above 300,000. After the mandatory disclaimer that his post is not financial advice, Squire concluded that the most hated assets, such as XRP, often outperform.

Smart money on-chain tracker Lookonchain has spotlighted the whale, identified as 0x15b325660. According to Lookonchain , the trader opened long positions on Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, Litecoin, XRP, LINK, AVAX, HYPE, and ENS, using between 25x and 3x leverage at a time when the tokens were significantly down due to retaliatory tariffs announced by President Donald Trump. The bet has now earned the trader more than $9 million in unrealized profits from the trades. With the trader committing millions to the position across nine tokens, the massive profits match the size of the initial investments. Trader long positions on Hyperliquid yield significant gains (Source: Hyperliquid) Most of the profits come from the 50,000 SOL long when the token dropped to $107. With the token now worth over $150, the trader has almost $2 million in unrealized gains. A similar position with 5,000 ETH long when Ether was trading at $1,515.80 has yielded $1.5 million, while the Bitcoin long trade with 70.82 BTC has led to $1.27 million in profits. All other long positions have also generated profits, varying from over $870,000 for HYPE to around $180,000 for AVAX. Interestingly, the whale did not just make profits on the perps positions; they also bought 309 BTC for $24.68 million when it was trading at $79,792 and now have $5 million in unrealized profits. Trump’s walk-back on tariffs triggered a massive rise in crypto prices Meanwhile, the massive profits highlight the strong conviction of whales during the market uncertainty in April. President Trump’s announcement of tariffs on April 2 and the counter-tariffs it triggered caused a massive decline in the value of most crypto assets, with Bitcoin crashing to $76,000 and Ether dropping as low as $1,400. While this triggered sell-offs by some investors and reignited debates about the ability of Bitcoin to serve as a hedge against inflation and market uncertainty, the whale was confident in the price rebound and bet on it. Trump’s decision to pause the retaliatory tariffs played a big role in the rebound. With the stock market crashing, many of the biggest indexes seeing their biggest declines in decades, and the threat of recession in the air, the pause was almost inevitable. Since the suspension of tariffs for all countries except China, the crypto market has been enjoying a positive performance. Bitcoin is up 13% in the last 30 days, XRP gained 4.24%, while SOL saw the most gains, with a 21.82% rise in its value. Despite these gains, most crypto assets are still trading below their price at the start of the year. Of all the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap, only Bitcoin has a positive year-to-date performance, with a 1.18% gain. Every other asset is down, with ETH and DOGE having the biggest drop, above 40%. Bitcoin struggles to go past $96k Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been stuck in the $94,000 to $96,000 range for over two weeks now since its rebound. The flagship asset has been struggling to break through the $96,000 barrier, with any surge above that level usually followed by a decline to the $95,000 range. According to Intotheblock data, the BTC support level is at $96,160, and its resistance level is $98,290. Thus, any major move would require it to break through this range. However, technical analyst Ali Martinez identified $93,460 as the key level for BTC based on the short-term holder cost basis and believes it could plunge if it falls below that level. He said: “$93,460 is a pivotal level for #Bitcoin $BTC. Holding above it could fuel a move to $132,330, but losing it may trigger a correction toward $72,420.” So far, there are no signs of any major potential dips, even though the asset lost 0.78% of its value today after dropping from above $96,000 to $95,366. Martinez noted that BTC is already trading in overbought territory and saw almost one million active addresses on May 3, its highest in six months.

In a new report , CoinGecko says only 428,383 crypto projects were launched in 2021 and listed on the decentralized exchange (DEX) tracker GeckoTerminal. But by 2025, that number has surged to nearly 7 million. CoinGecko says much of the explosive growth is linked to Pump.fun, a Solana ( SOL )-based cryptocurrency launchpad that enables users to deploy memecoins without extensive technical knowledge and significant capital. Data from crypto analytics firm Dune shows that the platform has facilitated the creation of more than 10 million tokens since last year. Says CoinGecko, “Much of this jump can be attributed to the launch of pump.fun, which simplified the process of creating tokens, leading to a flood of meme coins and low-effort projects entering the market.” But more than half of the crypto projects flopped. CoinGecko says 3.7 million of the 7 million cryptocurrencies listed on GeckoTerminal since 2021 have stopped trading and are considered failed. “52.7% of all cryptocurrencies on GeckoTerminal have failed, with the majority occurring during 2024 and early 2025.” The report says 1.8 million tokens collapsed in the first quarter of 2025 alone. The number represents 49.7% of all recorded project failures from 2021 to 2025. “This sharp decline in token survivability may be linked to broader market turbulence, particularly following Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2025, which coincided with a downturn in the crypto market.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Then you should work with LE agents to offer us legal documents to continue the freeze,” he added. The OKX CEO also resisted Sun’s public demands. He mentioned that OKX has a consumer protection policy according to law. He insists that they can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to Sun’s personal X post or oral communication. Sun deleted his original tweet, though other users had captured it in screenshots. The deleted post claimed that OKX was not responding to official freeze notices from law enforcement regarding stolen funds.

According to reports, the actor will make his directorial debut at SXSW London when the documentary premieres in June. The documentary was written, directed, and produced by McKenzie, with input from Giorgio Angelini. It was also filmed over three years in locations across New York, London, El Salvador, Miami, and Austin. The documentary follows McKenzie, who is best known for his roles on “Gotham” and “The O.C.,” as he investigates the cryptocurrency industry and interviews key figures in the industry. Notably, he made a trip to El Salvador to examine the regime of President Nayib Bukele, which made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. Ben McKenzie targets the industry with a new documentary The documentary features an interview with disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried , with the filming done months before he was indicted on multiple charges of fraud and conspiracy. Sam Bankman-Fried was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison in addition to three years of supervised release. The court also ordered him to pay about $11 billion in forfeitures for carrying out multiple fraudulent schemes. The documentary also featured Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of Celsius Network. Late last year, Mashinsky pleaded guilty to multi-billion-dollar fraud and market manipulation. He was accused of luring retail crypto investors into investing billions on his platform under false promises that their investments were low risk. The court said instead of keeping users’ funds safe, he put them in riskier bets, secretly using their funds to prop up the price of the CEL token. In addition to these personalities, the documentary highlights El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele and his fondness for the crypto industry. Nayib Bukele has been a strong supporter of the industry, especially Bitcoin. Bukele has continued to purchase Bitcoin, although at a slowed pace due to what many believe are restrictions from the country’s arrangement with the IMF. In addition, the country has removed the mandatory clause on the acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender. McKenzie highlights the ills of the crypto industry In his interview with Deadline , McKenzie mentioned how he got little attention after warning people in 2021. “When I started warning people about crypto fraud in the fall of 2021, I caught a bunch of flak from the bros online,” he said. He added that almost all the guys are now in jail, and many investors have lost a lot of money to these conmen. In his documentary, McKenzie featured other celebrities, a pseudonymous whistleblower, and several victims. The highlight of the documentary features McKenzie, who had been exploring the crypto industry in 2021, while the world was being torn from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Since then, he has been a vocal critic of the industry, even going as far as testifying before the United States Senate Banking Committee on the collapse of FTX. During his testimony, he calls crypto “the largest Ponzi scheme in history.” The documentary also features his home life, showing snapshots of the life he shares with his family and how boredom led him to research crypto. He had previously released a book in 2023 titled “Easy Money: Cryptocurrency, Casino Capitalism, and the Golden Age of Fraud,” with journalist Ben Silverman. The book explored many of the themes that the documentary will touch on. “Why is the false story of crypto still spreading? That’s the question I set out to answer with this film,” McKenzie said. He also added that he is excited about the documentary, noting that “I cannot wait for audiences to see ‘Everyone Is Lying to You for Money,’ a comedy that treats crypto and the creeps shilling it with the respect they deserve: zero.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Arbitrum Could Be Strong Picks for 2025",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/want-to-10x-2440-ethereum-xrp-solana-and-arbitrum-could-be-strong-picks-for-2025/,"As the second quarter of 2025 unfolds, investors are zeroing in on altcoins showing both technical strength and forward-looking fundamentals. Ethereum (ETH) , XRP , Solana (SOL) , and Arbitrum (ARB) are standing out with strong signals. But for those scouting early-stage potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming one of the cycle’s most talked-about names. MAGACOINFINANCE – Quietly Emerging as a Strategic Standout In contrast to headline-driven tokens, MAGACOINFINANCE is growing with intent. Its appeal stems from a focused brand, committed community, and structured rollout strategy. More than $7.8 million has already been raised, and investor sentiment continues to trend higher. What’s different here is the timing. With a capped supply, message-driven momentum, and real presence across Telegram and X, MAGACOINFINANCE offers rare early exposure ahead of broader listings. The 50% bonus (code: MAGA50X ) is still active, but not for long. Ethereum and XRP Remain Core Anchors for Long-Term Confidence Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,736 , buoyed by whale accumulation and increased utility in AI-driven ecosystems. Analysts point to a near-term move toward $2,700 , supported by rising transaction volume and renewed institutional interest. Its Layer-1 dominance remains undisputed as May’s momentum builds. XRP , currently around $2.15 , continues to attract attention thanks to the launch of ProShares’ XRP futures ETF. Technicals suggest a potential breakout past $2.45 , with institutional inflows expected to follow. Regulatory clarity and infrastructure adoption are reinforcing XRP’s leadership role. Solana and Arbitrum Offer Strong Technical Setups Solana (SOL) is trading in the $145–$150 range and riding a wave of renewed optimism after its Canadian ETF approval. With growing institutional interest and healthy on-chain activity, traders are watching for a breakout past $180 , which could trigger a path toward $220+ this quarter. Arbitrum (ARB) remains stable near $0.35 after recent volatility. While it exited Nvidia’s accelerator program, its Layer-2 credentials on Ethereum remain intact. If ETH rallies further, ARB could retest the upper $0.40s , especially with L2 scaling back in the spotlight. Final Thoughts With Ethereum , XRP , Solana , and Arbitrum delivering strong foundations and momentum, portfolios are being built with confidence. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that may provide the real asymmetric upside this cycle. As the broader market chases familiar names, early movers are positioning for what could be one of 2025’s biggest surprises.

PEPE continues to energize the meme coin space with its community backing, while Ethereum (ETH) maintains its dominance as a leading Layer 1. However, attention is beginning to shift toward newer players that bring fresh models for long-term progress. Unstaked is one such name gaining recognition. Unlike other projects, it brings together blockchain clarity and AI automation in a practical setup. Those forecasting Unstaked’s 27x rise are evaluating more than just excitement; they’re focused on real use cases and outcomes, making it a project frequently mentioned in discussions about the next big crypto. PEPE Forecast: Renewed Momentum and Community Strength PEPE continues to generate buzz as its price trajectory attracts renewed attention. Analysts watching PEPE forecast models believe the recent uptrend could open the door for further gains. With community involvement growing and the Mind of Pepe presale adding visibility, the setup hints at a possible continuation. Recent activity shows a climb in transactions and wallet address growth, strengthening user belief. Still, those analyzing PEPE stress that while current patterns show strength, market behavior can quickly shift. Additionally, enthusiasm from online forums and upcoming roadmap updates is fueling the talk around a potential surge. Currently, much of the PEPE forecast revolves around its ability to retest previous highs and find lasting strength. The coming weeks will likely decide whether the coin can meet rising expectations or fall back into a consolidation zone. Ethereum (ETH) Price Nears $1,858: What’s Next? Ethereum (ETH) is trading near $1,810 after gaining 30%, bringing its next major test closer at the $1,858 resistance level. Notably, ETH is still above its 50-day EMA of $1,773, which points to sustained strength. Breaking past $1,858 could see targets stretch toward $1,892 and $1,935. While the MACD currently shows neutrality, trading volumes on decentralized platforms reinforce Ethereum’s solid position. Uniswap’s dominance in DEX trading, $1.7 billion in the past 24 hours and $57 billion over 30 days, underscores ETH’s leading role in DeFi. However, falling funding rates for Ethereum’s perpetual futures hint at bearish setups forming behind the scenes. Because of this, traders are keeping an eye on either a breakout above $1,858 or a drop below $1,790 to determine the next major trend. Unstaked Sets the Stage for 27x Potential in 2025 The presale run of Unstaked has started drawing attention from crypto watchers, especially those seeking the next big growth story. Now in stage 2 at a price of $0.006695, the project has already raised close to $1 million in just a few days, highlighting early confidence. With a post-launch price fixed at $0.1819, early buyers are eyeing a clear 2700% return potential. Experts believe that once the presale ends and the platform goes live, Unstaked’s autonomous AI agents will gain visibility across social channels. With the $UNSD coin projected to reach between $3 and $5 in the next 12 to 24 months, expectations are rising. This forecast is based on the growing demand for tools that help automate digital actions and on the Proof of Intelligence model, which rewards real agent activity directly on-chain. When questions arise about the next big crypto, Unstaked often enters the conversation due to its blend of blockchain metrics and AI ownership. The chance to design, use, and benefit from personal smart agents, while having total user control, sets it apart. Unstaked isn’t just about presale gains; it introduces a new direction in how people manage their digital presence and influence. As the line between AI function and blockchain transparency blurs, Unstaked could be one of the top-performing launches to watch. Summing Up! Identifying the next breakout project requires looking beyond just short-term moves. PEPE delivers on excitement through strong community energy, and Ethereum continues to serve as the foundation of the DeFi structure. But Unstaked is tapping into a rising need for autonomous, measurable tools that operate in full view on the blockchain. For those evaluating the next big crypto for lasting potential, Unstaked’s model presents a different path. It reflects what many now seek: ownership, automation, and data-backed results, without relying on speculation alone. That combination is why Unstaked is climbing the watchlists of those who follow where crypto and AI are heading.

This past week alone saw a flurry of announcements from both traditional financial institutions and blockchain-native firms advancing their RWA initiatives. On April 30, BlackRock filed to create a digital ledger technology shares class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund. It will leverage blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for investors. The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY). On the same day, Libre announced plans to tokenize $500 million in Telegram debt through its new Telegram Bond Fund (TBF). The fund will be available to accredited investors and usable as collateral for onchain borrowing. The week’s biggest headline came from Dubai, where MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA tokenization deal with United Arab Emirates-based real estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk. The deal is touted as the largest RWA tokenization initiative to date. Source: MultiBank “The recent surge isn’t arbitrary. It’s happening because everything’s lining up,” Eric Piscini, CEO of Hashgraph, told Cointelegraph: “Rules are getting clearer in major markets. The tech is stronger, faster, and ready to scale. And big players are actually doing it — BlackRock is tokenizing funds, Citi is exploring digital asset custody, and Franklin Templeton has tokenized money market funds on public blockchains.” Related: Real-world asset tokenization: Unlocking a new era of finance Tokenization has moved beyond theory Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, said the recent announcements “demonstrate that tokenization has moved beyond theoretical discussions into practical application by market leaders.” He added that the growing adoption by big institutions gives the space more credibility, making others feel more confident to join in and help boost new ideas and investments. Kazmierczak stated that the renewed interest in RWA tokenization is primarily driven by US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration and growing regulatory clarity. Trump, who has pledged to “make the US the crypto capital of the world,” has taken a different approach to crypto compared to the Biden administration. That era saw an aggressive crackdown from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ), prompting many firms to withdraw from US operations. However, the narrative appears to be shifting. Since Trump’s election victory, the SEC has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies. Additionally, the DOJ recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit , signaling a softer approach to the sector. Source: ALX Aside from regulatory clarity, advancements in technological capabilities, especially in wallets, have also played a key role in driving tokenization adoption, Felipe D’Onofrio, chief technology officer at Brickken, said. “In parallel, macroeconomic pressures are pushing institutions to search for efficiency and liquidity in traditionally illiquid markets,” he added. Related: New era in mining: How tokenization can transform the salt industry Ethereum remains main hub for tokenization Ethereum continues to serve as the primary hub for RWA tokenization , thanks to its mature ecosystem, broad developer support and robust infrastructure. “Ethereum remains by far the most suitable blockchain for large-scale RWA issuance due to its unparalleled security, developer ecosystem, and institutional adoption,” Kazmierczak said. However, he noted that dedicated RWA-specialized ecosystems like Canton Network, Plume, and Ondo Chain are building compelling alternatives with features designed explicitly for compliant asset tokenization. According to data from RWA.xyz, the market value of tokenized US Treasurys currently stands at $6.5 billion. Ethereum accounts for the lion’s share of the market, hosting over $4.9 billion in tokenized Treasurys. Source: RWA.xyz Herwig Koningson, CEO of Security Token Market, said companies like BlackRock have shown that it’s possible to build large-scale tokenized products, worth billions of dollars, using more than one blockchain at the same time. He said this shows that the success of tokenizing assets doesn’t depend so much on which blockchain is used, but rather on what the company needs the system to do. “This is why you will see many banks and traditional firms use permissioned blockchains or even private DLT systems,” Koningson said. Related: $21B tokenized RWA market doubtful, institutions uninterested — Plume CEO Challenges remain, but growth potential is huge Yet hurdles remain. Regulation continues to be a significant barrier, especially for risk-averse institutions requiring guarantees around compliance and privacy. Technical limitations also persist, chiefly the lack of interoperability between blockchain platforms, according to Piscini. However, he said hybrid models are gaining traction by offering the privacy of permissioned systems with optional future interoperability with public chains. Looking ahead, Piscini estimated that more than 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by the end of the decade. D’Onofrio also made a modest projection, estimating that between 5% and 10% of global financial assets could be tokenized by 2030. On the other hand, RedStone’s Kazmierczak predicted that approximately 30% of the global financial system will be tokenized by the end of this decade. In terms of numbers, STM.co predicted that the world’s RWA market will be anywhere between $30 and $50 trillion by the end of 2030. Most firms predict that the RWA sector will reach a market size of between $4 trillion and $30 trillion by 2030. If the sector were to achieve the median prediction of about $10 trillion, it would represent more than 50 times the growth from its current value of around $185 billion, including the stablecoin market, according to a Tren Finance research report .

The regulation, known as “Senate Bill 1025” (SB 1025), was passed by the state assembly with a vote of 31 to 25, but was blocked by the governor. The bill aimed to create a digital asset reserve by investing the seized funds in Bitcoin and to manage this reserve by the state. However, Governor Hobbs stated that cryptocurrencies are in the category of “untested investments” and that these assets should not find a place in public resources. Related News: Ripple's Chief Legal Officer Explains Why the SEC Withdrew Its Appeal in the Case “The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound, informed investments.

The veto ended Arizona’s attempt to become the first state in the U.S. to establish a cryptocurrency reserve.

Business Tokenization firm Libre has announced plans to tokenize $500 million worth of Telegram-issued bonds on The Open Network (TON), in a move aimed at integrating traditional fixed-income securities with decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure. Ripple’s reported $5 billion bid to acquire stablecoin giant Circle was rejected over valuation, strategic differences, and regulatory concerns, with Circle opting to stay independent as it advances toward an IPO. Through his company, Strategy, Michael Saylor has unveiled plans to raise an extraordinary $84 billion to further expand the firm’s already substantial Bitcoin reserves.

It’s a familiar story in the crypto realm: the best performing crypto opportunities often pass unnoticed until it’s too late. But what if there’s another chance? Enter Qubetics ($TICS), a project that’s turning heads and stirring excitement. With its ongoing presale, Qubetics offers a fresh opportunity for those who missed out on previous crypto booms. It’s not just about catching up; it’s about getting ahead. This best performing crypto is still within reach, but time is of the essence. The presale is live, and the window to join this best crypto presale is narrowing. Don’t let this be another missed opportunity. Qubetics: The Best Performing Crypto You’re Still Early To Regret missing Qubetics’ early stages? Those who joined during the whitelist phase secured $TICS at just $0.01 without upfront costs. Since its quiet launch on September 29, 2024, Qubetics has progressed through multiple presale stages, each offering tokens at increasing prices. Currently, in Stage 32, tokens are priced at $0.2093, with over $16.6 million raised and more than 510 million $TICS sold to over 25,600 holders. Despite the growth, this best performing crypto still offers substantial ROI potential. Projections estimate that $TICS could reach $1 post-presale, translating to a 377.76% ROI. If it hits $10 after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, early participants could see a staggering 4,677.59% ROI. For instance, a $2,500 investment at the current price could yield significant returns if these projections materialize. Beyond the numbers, Qubetics is about real-world utility. Its flagship applications, QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, are designed to simplify blockchain development. Imagine a small business owner in Karachi wanting to integrate blockchain for supply chain transparency. With QubeQode, they can develop and deploy smart contracts without extensive coding knowledge. Similarly, a freelance developer in Lahore can use Qubetics IDE to create decentralized applications efficiently, tapping into new markets and opportunities. This practical approach positions Qubetics not just as a token but as a tool for innovation, making it a strong contender for the best performing crypto . Immutable X: From ICO to Industry Leader Immutable X ($IMX) started with an ICO price of $0.10 and quickly gained traction in the crypto community. Its focus on providing a Layer 2 scaling solution for NFTs on Ethereum addressed a significant market need. By November 2021, IMX reached an all-time high of $9.52, marking a substantial return for early participants. The platform’s zero gas fees and instant trade confirmations made it a favorite among NFT enthusiasts and developers alike. Today, Immutable X stands as a testament to the potential of well-executed crypto projects. With a market cap exceeding $1 billion and a strong presence in the NFT space, it continues to influence the industry’s direction. While the price has seen fluctuations, the platform’s commitment to innovation and scalability keeps it relevant. For those who missed its early days, Immutable X serves as a reminder of the opportunities that come with timely decisions in the crypto world. Conclusion: Seize the Moment with the Best Performing Crypto The crypto landscape is filled with stories of missed opportunities and what-ifs. Immutable X’s journey from a modest ICO to a billion-dollar platform exemplifies the rewards of early participation.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading between $95,000 and $96,000 at last check Sunday. That’s up by about 30% from its lowest level in April this year. The price movement coincided with President Donald Trumo’s claims that trade talks between the US and other countries, including China, were taking place. In a statement , China’s Commerce Ministry indicated that it was open to talks with the Trump administration, but that tariffs prevented them. Per the Wall Street Journal , China is also planning to make “a potential fentanyl offer” since Trump frequently used drug trafficking to justify the tariffs. The upcoming FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) interest rate decision will be the next key catalyst for the Bitcoin price. This will set the tone for what to expect in the second half of the year. You might also like: Top 3 reasons Bitcoin price will soar to a new all-time high Economists expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates at 4.5%. Officials will also maintain a cautious tone because inflation remains elevated. They also expect prices to rise gradually as Trump’s tariffs take effect. At the same time, officials are concerned that the economy may be moving towards a recession. Data released last week showed that the economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter, the worst performance since 2022. As such, officials may still propose a 0.25% cut at the June meeting, as Polymarket traders expect. This move will likely fuel the next Bitcoin price rally. Bitcoin price technical analysis Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the BTC price has rallied in the past few weeks, rising from a low of $74,330 to a high of $97,927. It has crossed the important resistance level at $88,655, the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $76,665. Bitcoin has formed a mini golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 100-day moving averages have crossed each other. Top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the resistance at $100,000. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the all-time high of $109,300, in line with this BTC price prediction .

While XRP and Solana continue to gain traction, a new project— MAGACOIN FINANCE is starting to raise eyebrows among analysts who track early momentum plays. XRP: Legal Clarity and Global Payment Growth Ripple’s network has expanded in several regions, including Southeast Asia, where banks and payment platforms have integrated XRP for faster cross-border transactions. XRP may not generate the headlines it once did, but its foundation appears stronger than ever—especially in a climate where predictability is valued. Solana: noticeable turnaround Solana has seen a noticeable turnaround since its rough patches in previous cycles. In the first half of 2025, its on-chain activity has increased, particularly in NFT transactions and high-speed decentralized applications. With improved uptime and enhanced validator performance, Solana is beginning to attract developers that once leaned toward other networks. What’s more, the blockchain’s ability to process large volumes of micro-transactions at low cost continues to separate it from competitors. If liquidity conditions improve following the Fed’s pause, Solana could benefit from renewed investment in real-world blockchain applications. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Gaining Momentum for the Right Reasons While legacy coins continue building on past progress, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building something new. The project is quietly drawing attention for its clean rollout strategy, community traction, and simple but effective positioning. Instead of mimicking meme coins or competing with infrastructure layers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining its own category—community-first, supply-capped, and straightforward in design. What makes it stand out is its measured pace. The team behind it has avoided overexposure while steadily building interest across crypto communities and mid-level investors. It’s the kind of project that gains credibility because of how it behaves—not because of inflated promises. Analysts are beginning to note how investor sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE resembles the early stages of past outperformers. It may not dominate headlines yet, but those paying attention see a project with structure, balance, and long-term focus.

As the broader crypto market faces macroeconomic uncertainty and consolidates just below major resistance levels, ADA is now entering a critical phase. Price action remains range-bound, but sentiment is shifting as investors eye key technical patterns that could define the next move. Related Reading: $380M In Ethereum Leaves Exchanges In 7 Days – Accumulation Trend Accelerates Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently highlighted that Cardano is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart—a pattern often preceding sharp breakouts. This technical formation suggests that ADA is coiling for a decisive move, with bulls and bears battling for short-term control. The current range continues to tighten over the weekend, with volatility expected to return once a breakout direction is confirmed. A move above $0.7730 would indicate bullish continuation and potentially trigger another leg up toward the $0.85–$0.90 zone. On the flip side, losing support near $0.6280 could spark a broader correction. As long as ADA holds its structure and stays above key moving averages, the bullish trend remains intact. Cardano Set For Breakout As Buyers Regain Short-Term Control Cardano is showing signs of strength despite trading in a tight consolidation range just below the $0.75 mark. After gaining over 40% from its early April lows, ADA has entered a crucial phase, with bulls gradually regaining control. The recent price action suggests that a breakout could be on the horizon, especially if ADA maintains its current support levels and builds further momentum. For the past few days, Cardano has traded sideways, struggling to break above the $0.75 resistance level. While this range-bound movement has frustrated some traders, it also reflects market stability, a common precursor to large directional moves. If bulls manage to push ADA above the $0.7730 resistance, a sustained rally could follow, potentially targeting the $0.85 and even $0.90 zones. Runefelt shared technical insights showing that Cardano is forming a 4-hour symmetrical triangle, a structure that often precedes sharp breakouts. The apex of the triangle is nearing, meaning a decisive move is likely within the next few sessions. The key bullish breakout level remains at $0.7730. On the flip side, a breakdown below the $0.6280 support would invalidate the bullish structure and could trigger a broader retracement. Overall, Cardano remains well-positioned for upside if it can reclaim resistance and confirm a breakout. Bulls will need to step in decisively to avoid a fakeout or extended consolidation. As the broader crypto market consolidates near highs, ADA’s setup is one of the more promising among large-cap altcoins. The next move could set the tone for Cardano’s trend in the weeks ahead.

ADA Price Analysis: Consolidation Continues Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.6963, consolidating just below the 200-day moving average (SMA) at $0.7766 and slightly under the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.7113. This tight compression suggests a pivotal moment is near, especially as ADA attempts to hold its ground above the $0.67 short-term support. Price action on the daily chart shows that ADA has been coiling in a narrow range following its 40% rebound from April lows. Despite the broader market showing strength, ADA hasn’t yet managed to break above the confluence of moving averages overhead—a necessary step to flip the market structure decisively bullish. The $0.77-$0.78 level remains the critical resistance to reclaim. A daily close above this zone could validate a breakout and push ADA toward the psychological $1.00 mark, last tested in early January.

Solana (SOL) , XRP , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Kaspa (KAS) are among the standouts, each offering a unique angle on performance, use case, or network strength. However, the growing story behind MAGACOINFINANCE is capturing the attention of early adopters—and for good reason. MAGACOINFINANCE – The Early-Stage Narrative With Long-Term Potential While the market watches large caps, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious traction beneath the surface. The project blends political branding with early-stage tokenomics, creating a unique opportunity that’s just beginning to trend. Already, over $7.8 million has been raised , and investor engagement is climbing across Telegram, YouTube, and X. This isn’t just another campaign—it’s a community-backed, high-conviction entry point for those seeking asymmetric returns. With a 50% bonus still live (promo code: MAGA50X ), this is one of the rare opportunities to lock in exposure before listings begin. Solana and XRP Continue Gaining Market Share Solana (SOL) has reclaimed territory above $140 , with key resistance at $150 now in sight. A break higher could open the door to $200+ targets. XRP is holding steady around $2.15 , fueled by institutional flows ahead of the CME XRP futures listing . Analysts are watching for a test of $2.50 , with long-term projections extending toward $5 . Bitcoin and Kaspa Show Strength in Different Ways Bitcoin (BTC) remains the core driver of crypto macro trends. Holding above $95,000 , BTC is setting the tone for broad market direction. Kaspa (KAS) , trading near $0.10 , isn’t chasing headlines. Instead, it’s advancing on the back of real innovation. Final Thoughts As Solana , XRP , Bitcoin , and Kaspa continue to deliver momentum and investor confidence, MAGACOINFINANCE is stepping into the spotlight with strategic strength. In a market where timing matters more than ever, this may be the opportunity investors look back on in 2025 as the one that redefined their portfolio.

According to reports, the French police carried out a weekend raid, freeing a yet-to-be-identified man who was kidnapped in Paris to force his son to pay a ransom. According to prosecutors, the police successfully carried out the raid , arresting five people in the process. In the statement, the prosecutors mentioned that the kidnapped man was traced to an address in the Paris suburb of Essonne, which the police raided on Saturday. The man was abducted in the Southern 14th arrondissement region in Paris on the morning of May 1 by four men wearing ski masks who had bundled him into a car on the said date. French police rescue kidnapped victim According to the prosecutors, the victim was the father of a millionaire who made his fortune in crypto. “The victim appears to be the father of a man who made his fortune in cryptocurrencies, with the crime involving a ransom demand,” the prosecutor’s statement said. According to Le Parisien newspaper, the kidnappers had called for a ransom demand, mentioning an amount between five and seven million euros ($5.7 million and $7.9 million). A source close to the investigation told AFP that the kidnappers had already chopped off one of the father’s fingers, with threats to chop off others. “There were fears of other mutilations if police had not raided the property”, the source said. The prosecutors also noted that the number of arrests was raised to five from the initial four, highlighting the appearance of a fifth suspect. They mentioned that the fifth suspect was driving the vehicle likely used by the criminals for their operation, with the statement noting that they were all in their 20s. French interior minister Bruno Rataileau hailed the approach of the police toward the case. “A huge congratulations to the investigators who did an exceptional job in freeing this man and arresting his captors,” he said . He also specifically thanked Police Prefect Laurent Nunez and his staff for their prompt actions. The victim’s wife said during questioning by the authorities that her husband and son, who owns a marketing company managing digital assets in Malta, have been subject to threats in the past. Police set to investigate rise in crypto millionaire kidnappings The French police have opened an investigation into the kidnapping, charging the criminals with kidnapping, false imprisonment, and arbitrary detention of a hostage to obtain the execution of an order or condition, armed extortion. The crime was carried out by organized criminal gangs, with all of them also charged for their participation in criminal conspiracy. The investigation was carried out by the Cybercrime Brigade (BL2C) in collaboration with the BRI. Meanwhile, the police have promised to investigate the increase in kidnappings tied to ransom in digital assets in France. In a previous attempt, criminals kidnapped the co-founder of Ledger , a company specializing in safe-keeping digital assets using their wallets. The co-founder David Balland was abducted with his partner at their home near Bourges in France. The criminals also cut off a finger as a sign of warning. The police were alerted after Balland’s business partner received a video of the finger alongside a demand for ransom in cryptocurrency worth around 10 million euros. Balland was eventually freed in a raid, with the police finding his wife tied up in the boot of a car in the Essonne area car park the following day. The police charged nine suspects for the crime, with the gang leader, a 26-year-old, having a police record for kidnapping. Another incident in December 2024 saw the kidnappers take the father of a French crypto influencer based in Dubai. Attackers raided his home and forced him into a car after tying up his wife and daughter. The son received the ransom demands and contacted the police. The police freed his mother and sister immediately, while his father was eventually found in a car park in Normandy the next day.

One popular Crypto X analyst noticed in April a familiar pattern in Bitcoin’s price rebound following the sell-off after the coronavirus shock. Global financial markets are back to placing bets after pulling their cash in during the Trump second term and tariff panic. Major participants in the Bitcoin economy may be seeing similarities between now and the last time Trump started pushing Fed Chair Jerome Powell for interest rate cuts. The last time this happened, Bitcoin grew 12 times in market prices in 24 months. Crypto Markets Feeling Bullish Again That’s an average annualized ROI of 550% from 2019 to 2021. For comparison, the S&P 500 Index delivered an average yearly ROI of 10% since 1957. It’s no wonder institutions are bullish on the original blockchain cryptocurrency. Even the doctor of Bitcoin doom himself, EuroPac’s Peter Schiff, made a big about-face in a tweet storm on X, asking followers to donate BTC to him that he promises he will never sell. For anyone who’s been keeping the score with Schiff’s anti-crypto texts, this is some kind of bizarro world. Here are four reasons the little currency is looking so good for crypto bulls in May. 1.

Here’s what the cumulative flows have looked like over time: pic.twitter.com/euWt9TGjhA — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) April 30, 2025 The entry of Wall Street buyers via Bitcoin ETFs pushed BTC prices up for almost all of 2024. Institutional investors also delivered massive capital inflows to MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and Bitcoin miners in 2023, signaling pent-up demand. Now that stock traders are a tidal force on the cryptocurrency economy, Bitcoin ETF inflows and outflows respond to and affect the asset’s price. Manhattan markets flipped wildly bullish for BTC in April. Bitcoin ETFs saw uninterrupted daily inflows from Apr. 17 to Apr. 29, a couple of times verging on a billion dollars for the day’s trades. #Bitcoin Etf inflow is at the top of 2025. Some knows something good pic.twitter.com/ynyn3KbSi3 — Alpha Whale Crypto (@AlphaWhale_) May 1, 2025 By Apr. 28, Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.06 billion in total weekly inflows, the second-highest on record. Meanwhile, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan wrote in a note to investors that he expects ETF flows to continue to expand sustainably. “I still expect bitcoin ETFs to set a new record for net inflows this year,” Hougan said , “despite pulling in ‘just’ $3.7 billion so far in 2025, compared to $35 billion in 2024.” 2. Semler Scientific Buys $15.7M BTC In addition to the high demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds by investors, corporations continue to ramp up the global race to stockpile Bitcoin. That limits the supply available on exchanges and pushes the price up further. Virginia-based Strategy started off this incredible demand for BTC to shore up its balance sheets. It works as an inflation shelter, macro hedge, and a way to increase returns on investment when the asset has a good year. On Apr. 30, California-based health care tech company Semler Scientific announced a 165 BTC buy for around $15.7 million. Semler reported: “As of April 29, 2025, Semler Scientific held 3,467 bitcoins, which were acquired for an aggregate $306.1 million at an average purchase price of $88,263 per bitcoin, inclusive of fees and expenses and had a market value of $330.6 million…” When Semler first started buying BTC last May, its stock surged 38% as a result. Meanwhile, Strategy made another billion-dollar Bitcoin buy announced on Apr. 28. That brings its total holdings to 553,555 BTC acquired for an average of $68.5K per BTC. 3. Arizona Moves to Stockpile Bitcoin It’s not just US corporations piling on Bitcoin. Following in the lead of the White House initiative to establish a national reserve, several states are moving to add the asset to their books. In April, Arizona joined them with a move by the legislature to establish a state Bitcoin reserve. That leaves the matter in the hands of a governor, who could sign one into law with a pen stroke any day now. “Crypto and bitcoin have a huge following nationwide and in Arizona,” said Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers, who co-sponsored the bill. “They are wildly popular with the youth and independents.” This is the first state legislative approval to establish a BTC reserve. While several states are seriously exploring it, the Copper State may just kick off a rush in other statehouses. 4. Bitcoin Whales’ Big Buying Spree Cryptocurrency markets are nothing without their whale-sized traders. Big moves by these behemoth investors tend to forecast future price moves because the big money has incentives and resources at scale to make smart bets. As a result, whale splashes in the Web3 liquidity pools can cause future movements in market prices and become self-fulfilling prophecies. That’s good news for BTC sellers and long-term holders. Bitcoin whales went on a massive accumulation binge in April. In the final two weeks of the month, they bought $4 billion . That strong support from both Wall Street institutional buyers and Internet retail buyers is very bullish for the cryptocurrency’s outlook.

Crypto commentator Xaif on X highlighted the development as part of a growing national discourse on how state governments engage with digital assets. BREAKING Today – Arizona, USA: Governor Katie Hobbs has vetoed a bill that would have allowed the state to invest in virtual currencies such as $XRP , $BTC , and $ETH . However, a second bill — SB1373 — is still under consideration. pic.twitter.com/1jdv3hulq4 — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 4, 2025 Governor Hobbs Blocks Public Crypto Investment The vetoed legislation was designed to authorize Arizona’s state treasury to allocate public funds toward holding cryptocurrencies in its investment portfolio. Supporters of the bill argued that it would place Arizona at the forefront of crypto innovation, aligning the state with others already exploring blockchain integration in public finance. However, Governor Hobbs chose not to sign the bill, reflecting a more conservative approach amid the broader regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto assets. Missed Opportunity or Prudent Caution? Advocates of the bill viewed it as a step toward fiscal modernization—one that could have diversified the state’s holdings and leveraged the long-term value proposition of digital assets. Critics, however, raised concerns about the volatility and regulatory ambiguity of the crypto market. Governor Hobbs’ veto suggests a reluctance to expose public funds to such risks, at least without a more established regulatory framework. All Eyes on SB1373 While the vetoed bill marks a setback for digital asset adoption in Arizona, the conversation is far from over. A second bill—SB1373—is still under consideration in the Arizona legislature. Although the full scope of SB1373 has not yet been disclosed publicly, it is expected to reintroduce crypto-related financial mechanisms in a potentially revised form, which may be more aligned with the governor’s cautionary stance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A National Trend in State-Level Crypto Policy Arizona’s recent developments are part of a larger trend across the United States, where states are beginning to diverge in their approach to cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. States like Texas and Wyoming have openly embraced digital assets, implementing frameworks that support both innovation and investor protection. In contrast, states like Arizona remain more tentative, underscoring the fragmented nature of digital asset regulation in the U.S. The Road Ahead Governor Hobbs’ decision sends a clear message that, despite the growing legitimacy of digital assets, institutional adoption at the public level still faces political and regulatory headwinds. As SB1373 progresses, the crypto community will be watching closely to see whether Arizona decides to revise its approach or maintain its current level of caution. In the meantime, the vetoed bill serves as a reminder that while the technology may be ready, the policy frameworks are still catching up.

According to reports, the politicians are now taking aggressive approaches in courting the crypto community. The country presently boasts an estimated 16 million crypto investors, representing about 36% of the entire voting population. With this development, politicians are now taking measures to ensure that sentiments shift to their side as they look to leverage that demographic. In a report by Point Daily, the political significance of crypto voters has grown as the Bitcoin market in the country now exceeds 2,600 trillion won, rivaling most companies listed on KOSPI. This is not the first time that politicians will be trying to leverage the crypto crowd and community, as we have seen it play out in the United States election late last year. According to some sources, Trump’s decision to align with the crypto crowd was integral to his success against opposition Kamala Harris, with Harris choosing to focus her campaign points on other aspects. South Korean politicians go all-in on crypto voters According to the Daily Point report , these 16 million investors represent a greater part of the country’s 44.25 million eligible voters from the previous general election. Now, major political parties in the country are now using several crypto-focused campaign strategies to sway voters. For instance, the Democratic Party has drafted the token securities analyst, Professor Kim Yong-Jin of Sogang University, into their campaign team. The party has also seen another crypto-focused alignment after Representative Min Byeong-deok introduced a draft Basic Digital Asset Act that includes provision for a stablecoin authorization system that will be linked to legal tender. The presidential candidate of the Democratic party Lee Jae-myung had initially promised to regulate the virtual assets industry during the 2022 presidential election. “I think there is a problem with the delayed development of the virtual asset market,” he said at the time. The crypto-focused lobbying is not only happening in the Democratic party, with the People Power Party also making its move in that regard. According to reports, the party, which confirmed its candidate ahead of the June 3 showdown, has released several crypto-related initiatives. This includes removing the restrictive exchange-one-bank system, establishing a taxation system, institutionalising virtual asset trading for corporations, enabling spot ETF trading a year after taking power, and establishing South Korea as a global virtual asset hub. People Power Party candidate Kim Moon-soo has also addressed the frustration of investors. “About 16 million people, or one-third of the population, are participating in the virtual asset market, but virtual asset investors are being left without even the minimum protection measures in our country’s financial market,” he said. He also made some pledges regarding what he will do if he wins, including a National Pension Service to invest in digital assets, removing restrictions on direct virtual asset investment by financial institutions, and establishing a virtual asset management and supervision system. The presidential candidate for the New Reform Party Lee Jun-seok also made promises, noting earlier in January that he intends to foster the blockchain industry. Lee said he believes that blockchain is the foundation for all digital assets, and it needs to be fostered. “There should also be attempts in the political world to radically ease regulations,” he said. An official from the virtual asset industry also waded into it, saying, “Deregulation is necessary to promote investment in virtual assets and activate the market.” He also added that it remains unclear where investors will decide to vote since all the presidential candidates are moving in the same direction.

The agreement was signed into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) announced on May 4 and signed in the first Council for the Development of Digital Assets session, chaired by Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov. Binance Pay to Drive Crypto Payments in Kyrgyzstan In line with the agreement, Binance will roll out its contactless crypto payment solution, Binance Pay, in Kyrgyzstan. The platform enables users to make payments using digital currencies, making alternative payment options for locals and visitors. The move positions Kyrgyzstan as a regional leader in adopting usable crypto infrastructure and opens up financial inclusion through decentralized payment solutions. Growing Blockchain Literacy Through Education Programs Besides payments, the partnership is also concerned with education. Binance Academy, the exchange’s educational initiative, will collaborate with Kyrgyz officials and financial institutions to develop blockchain education programs. Binance Regional Head for Central and Eastern Europe Kyrylo Khomiakov emphasized the mission of the company to empower the region: “Binance is looking forward to collaborating with the National Agency for Investments of the Kyrgyz Republic to enable the development of crypto-assets in the region to move forward.” Kyrgyzstan Looks to CBDC and Crypto Regulations Kyrgyzstan’s backing of crypto innovation extends beyond private collaboration. On April 18, President Japarov signed a constitutional law that permits the pilot launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) — the “digital som” — that will have legal tender status. In early April, Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao committed to consult with Kyrgyz authorities on crypto regulation and blockchain strategy. Energy Advantage: Kyrgyzstan’s Mining Potential The country is not unfamiliar with digital currency. With over 30% of its energy coming from hydroelectric sources, Kyrgyzstan is a crypto mining-friendly destination. The International Energy Agency reports that only 10% of its hydroelectric capacity is in use, with enormous room for expansion. Binance Strengthens Global Government Ties This partnership forms part of Binance’s series of government collaborations. Last month, CEO Richard Teng revealed that certain countries approached Binance to ask for guidance on Bitcoin reserves and regulation. Former CEO CZ also joined as an adviser for Pakistan’s Crypto Council early in April, again outlining Binance’s growing influence on country crypto policy.",Blockchain|Binance,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-04 13:48:45

In a surprise Saturday statement first reported by Politico, the senators declared they would not support the GOP-led bill “in its current form” if it reaches the Senate floor, citing a range of unresolved concerns. Their demands for changes focus on several key areas: safeguards to prevent illicit financial flows, stricter rules on overseas stablecoin providers, national security, stronger guarantees that stablecoins won’t undermine the safety and soundness of the existing financial infrastructure, and tougher penalties on noncompliant actors. The move comes just days before the chamber is expected to hold a procedural vote on the legislation, which aims to create the first federal framework for stablecoin issuers — digital tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar or other assets.

Ruben Gallego (Ariz.), Mark Warner (Va.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (Del.), and Andy Kim (N.J.) — all of whom previously voted in favor of the bill when it passed the Senate Banking Committee in March — now say the legislation still “has numerous issues that must be addressed.” The letter, also signed by Sens. Raphael Warnock (Ga.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Ben Ray Luján (N.M.), John Hickenlooper (Colo.), and Adam Schiff (Calif.), emphasized a continued willingness to negotiate. “We are eager to continue working with our colleagues to address these issues,” the senators wrote. “As stablecoins continue to grow in popularity, it is critical for Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to create a regulatory framework that sets forth clear rules of the road.” Notably absent from the statement were the bill’s two Democratic co-sponsors: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (Md.). GOPeeved The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), responded to the pushback with a warning and a challenge. “We have a choice here. Move forward and make any remaining changes needed in a bipartisan way, or show that digital asset and crypto legislation remains a solely Republican issue,” he said, stressing the need to solidify U.S. dominance in the digital asset space. The defection adds a new layer of complexity to an already contentious process, especially as the Trump family’s growing involvement in the digital asset space — including plans for a new stablecoin venture — has injected fresh political sensitivities into the debate. With the bill now hanging in the balance, Democrats may hold the leverage to reshape key provisions — or stall one of the crypto industry’s most significant regulatory breakthroughs to date.

To read full editions, subscribe . Worshipping at the Church of Satoshi has never been a bulletproof vocation. The sect of Hal Finney is a different story. Yes, even this Supply Shock has spent sizable energy on what Satoshi said over the four-ish short years that the pseudonym was active… and subjected you to all sorts of hypotheticals and assumptions about their motivations for leaving. Satoshi is/was clearly a brilliant individual. But if their decision to “ move onto other things ” means anything at all, we must treat whatever Satoshi said or signaled publicly as starting points on a larger journey. All of Satoshi’s emails and forum posts have only ever set Bitcoin in a certain direction. They rarely cut the actual path. Hal Finney is someone who did cut the path. The legendary Cypherpunk would’ve turned 69 years old today, May 4, a day celebrated across the world even beyond Bitcoin circles. Bitcoin Legend — Hal Finney Hal was the second person after Satoshi to ever run the Bitcoin software, only seven days into its lifespan, making him Bitcoin’s first real user. “When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away,” Hal said on BitcoinTalk in March 2013. “I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.” We can only ever infer the pre-Bitcoin history of Satoshi. There’s no record of the pseudonym before the white paper. He appeared out of the ether, a manifestation of the radical corpus that contained the Cypherpunk mailing list , Tim May’s Crypto Anarchist Manifesto and David Chaum’s voluminous academic papers. Hal’s own history is meanwhile woven into the very texts from which Satoshi sprung. Living in Temple City, California, he spent years closely developing Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) with Phil Zimmermann — another Cypherpunk legend — when it was still unclear whether contributing to the software was an illegal act. Hal worked there until he retired in 2011. Hal also built and operated two of the first-ever cryptographically-based anonymous remailers in the early ‘90s, which novelly allowed users to send emails without revealing any information about their identities. Running bitcoin — halfin (@halfin) January 11, 2009 The greatest Bitcoin tweet of all time These are acts of activism. Hal had pushed persistently, for decades, in defense of our right to privacy in a digital world increasingly surveilled by governments and corporations. He was also a key force in the protracted Cypherpunk war for anonymous digital cash that gave us Bitcoin. “When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction,” Hal recounted . “I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin fascinating.” Fitting Hal’s legacy into this humble article will never be feasible. Still, I can say this: In 2025, it’s very easy to take our right to encryption — the shared core ingredient for online freedom and Bitcoin — for granted. End-to-end and other manners of encryption may now be commonplace, but there are still grave concerns over the power that tech companies, financial intermediaries and state forces have over our lives. We are surveilled by default and complacency is too convenient. Normalized. I am proud to recognize the @HRF ’s incredible freedom and privacy focused initiative honoring Hal’s legacy through the Finney Freedom Prize. 🙌 Congratulations to the 2nd halving era’s winners—your work truly embodies the spirit Hal believed in. 🌟 https://t.co/PxvN0T6csr — halfin (@halfin) January 10, 2025 Fran Finney, Hal’s wife, celebrates Hal’s legacy with an annual Running Bitcoin Challenge to raise money for ALS Research . Hal built and sharpened tools for mitigating those threats, even right up until the end of his life. We must use those tools and all others like them. Promote them. “Currently I’m working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ‘Trusted Computing,’ to harden Bitcoin wallets,” Hal posted on BitcoinTalk around 18 months before his passing, even as he was “essentially paralysed” due to ALS. “It’s almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.” Hal was referring to bcflick, for which he’d earlier released a prototype . Cypherpunks write code. Hal Finney wrote code. Get the news in your inbox.

But what does it mean for the future of the bitcoin price? NYDIG Research crunched the numbers, and the results are striking. ""If we apply a 10x ""money multiplier""—a rule of thumb reflecting the historical impact of new capital on bitcoin’s market cap—and divide by the total supply of bitcoin, we arrive at a rough estimate of the potential price impact: a nearly $42,000 increase per bitcoin,"" NYDIG said in a research report. To reach this conclusion, the analysts at NYDIG reviewed Strategy (MSTR), Metaplanet (3350), Twenty One (CEP), and Semler Scientific's (SMLR) cumulative equity valuation since they adopted the bitcoin buying strategy. This gave the analysts an outline of how much money they could theoretically raise by issuing shares at current stock prices to buy more bitcoin. If this analysis comes true, the projected price is nearly a 44% increase from the current spot price of $96,000 per bitcoin. If capitalized, Wall Street money managers perhaps wouldn't mind showing this PnL chart to their clients, especially given the current volatility and uncertainty in the market. ""The implication is clear: this 'dry powder' in the form of issuance capacity could have a significant upward effect on bitcoin’s price,"" NYDIG Research said. Bitcoin’s limited supply also bodes well for the analysis. Publicly-traded companies already hold 3.63% of bitcoin’s total supply, with the lion’s share of those coins being held by Strategy. Adding private company and government holdings, the total is at 7.48% according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Demand could also grow further in the near future if the U.S. government finds “budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin” for its strategic bitcoin reserve.

The bill, known as the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, aimed to authorize the state to invest seized funds into Bitcoin and establish a reserve managed by public officials. Governor Hobbs vetoed the measure on May 2, citing concerns over risk. Crypto Community Reacts Sharply to Controversial Decision The move drew swift backlash from prominent figures in the crypto community. Casa co-founder Jameson Lopp wrote on X, “This will age poorly,” while Bitcoin advocate Anthony Pompliano criticized the veto, saying, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.” He added, “If she can’t outperform Bitcoin, she must buy it.” Wendy Rogers, who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Jeff Weninger, expressed her disappointment and pledged to reintroduce it in the next legislative session. “Politicians don’t understand that Bitcoin doesn’t need Arizona. Arizona needs Bitcoin,” she said, noting that the state’s retirement system already holds shares in MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company widely seen as a Bitcoin proxy. Governor Hobbs vetoed Arizona's Bitcoin Reserve Bill, because it is too ""untested"" for the state's retirement system. FACT: Arizona's pension funds are only 76% funded, ranking 36th in the nation. Perhaps the 'tested' investment strategies aren't working? pic.twitter.com/k4RkpQHEAc — Julian Fahrer (@Julian__Fahrer) May 3, 2025 Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon also weighed in, saying, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.” Not everyone in the financial space disagreed with the veto. Longtime crypto critic Peter Schiff supported Hobbs’s decision, arguing that governments should not “speculate in cryptocurrencies” using public funds. Arizona would have become the first U.S. state to hold Bitcoin reserves had the bill passed. Similar proposals have failed in states like Oklahoma, Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming. US Government Unlikely to Buy Bitcoin The United States is unlikely to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings , said BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, citing the country’s ballooning national debt and the cultural image tied to Bitcoin investors. In a recent interview, Hayes cast doubt on the idea that the U.S. would proactively build a “strategic Bitcoin reserve,” beyond the nearly 200,000 BTC already in its possession. However, despite the US government’s lack of interest in purchasing Bitcoin, public companies continue to show interest in the leading cryptocurrency. Just recently, Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, announced it is doubling its capital raising plan to $84 billion in an aggressive push to acquire more Bitcoin. The Virginia-based company disclosed Thursday that it has filed to sell an additional $21 billion in common shares after depleting a previous program of the same size authorized in October. It also doubled its debt issuance target from $21 billion to $42 billion, leaving $14.6 billion remaining under its current authorization. In the first quarter of the year, publicly traded companies increased their Bitcoin holdings by 16.1%, signaling continued institutional interest in the leading cryptocurrency despite market volatility.

Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $13 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Solana (SOL): A Blockchain Platform Emphasizing Scalability Solana is a blockchain platform designed to enhance scalability, providing a foundation for decentralized applications. It is one of the most popular blockchains for developers, and its trading volume has even exceeded the one of Ethereum and BNB Chain. SOL is Solana’s native cryptocurrency and plays a central role in its ecosystem by facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. The value of the SOL coin lies in its support of the Solana ecosystem, allowing users access to various projects on the platform. Solana avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability, aiming instead to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting products and services with high activity levels. In the current market cycle, Solana’s technology and the utility of the SOL coin may be of interest to those looking for scalable blockchain solutions. Cardano’s ADA: A Scalable and Sustainable Blockchain Solution Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and participate in the network through staking. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to traditional proof-of-work systems. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially reaching up to a million transactions per second. The potential of Cardano lies in its sustainable and scalable approach to blockchain technology. By focusing on energy efficiency and advanced scalability, it addresses some of the key challenges faced by other platforms. The introduction of Cardano native tokens in March 2021 allows for secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market cycle, ADA presents itself as a significant player due to these technological advancements. Its focus on sustainability and scalability may make it an attractive option for users and developers looking for efficient blockchain solutions. Conclusion While SOL and ADA show promise, XYZ’s fusion of sports and memes offers a unique opportunity for growth, making it a standout choice for savvy investors.

However, it’s not the only asset attracting investor attention. XRP , Solana (SOL) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Arbitrum (ARB) are showing solid setups with bullish fundamentals. Together, these assets are defining the tone of the market—and the opportunity set for investors aiming to position for the next leg up. MAGACOINFINANCE – Quietly Becoming a Strategic Favorite As major assets continue their upward momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground through a slower, steadier approach. It has already raised over $7.8 million and continues to attract high-conviction traders looking beyond short-term speculation. This project isn’t relying on hype. Instead, it’s building with purpose: community engagement, brand clarity, and deliberate investor positioning. With a 50% bonus (promo code: MAGA50X) still available during pre-sale, the window to enter early remains open. Ethereum and XRP Lead with Institutional Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $1,830 , maintaining strength thanks to ongoing accumulation from major wallets and deepening interest in Ethereum-based applications. XRP is holding near $2.15 , with institutional demand climbing on the back of futures ETF rollouts. ProShares’ launch and the upcoming CME futures addition are helping XRP maintain its structure. Bitcoin and Solana Build Their Cases for 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) remains the macro anchor, currently holding above $95,000 . With forecasts suggesting a move toward $130,000 , BTC is being viewed by analysts as a reliable store of value—especially in an ETF-driven cycle. Solana (SOL) is trading between $145 and $150 , supported by inflows from its Canadian ETF listing and expanding developer interest. If SOL clears $180 , a renewed rally toward $221 may follow, solidifying its status as a high-performance Layer-1 chain. Arbitrum Consolidates as a Top Layer 2 Arbitrum (ARB) is currently trading around $0.35 , consolidating after recent volatility. Despite a pullback, its infrastructure strength and relevance in the Ethereum Layer 2 space keep it on investor watchlists. Final Thoughts In May 2025, investors are focused on structure, momentum, and long-term viability. Ethereum , XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and Arbitrum offer strong use cases and macro signals. Yet MAGACOINFINANCE is crafting a quiet breakout of its own—one that many believe could define the second half of the year.

This perspective was shared in a recent update by Cointelegraph on X , emphasizing Marcus’s continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term utility and potential to reshape how money moves globally. BULLISH: Former PayPal President David Marcus says #Bitcoin will power a new global financial infrastructure capable of moving trillions of dollars daily. pic.twitter.com/X4IQlMBlJz — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 4, 2025 A Vision Rooted in Utility, Not Just Speculation David Marcus, who also co-founded the Bitcoin-centric financial technology firm Lightspark, has long argued that Bitcoin’s true value lies not only in its store-of-value status but in its potential as a settlement layer for global transactions. His latest remarks reinforce this thesis, asserting that Bitcoin’s inherent design—decentralized, secure, and scalable—is perfectly suited to underpin a digital economy capable of handling multi-trillion-dollar flows in real-time. This isn’t the first time Marcus has drawn attention to Bitcoin’s broader use cases beyond speculative investment. By positioning Bitcoin as the backbone of a global payments architecture, Marcus separates the asset from its volatility-driven narrative and redirects focus toward its technical and economic fundamentals. Bitcoin as the Rails for the New Economy What Marcus envisions is an internet-native financial system where Bitcoin functions as the trustless and neutral settlement layer. In such a system, users, businesses, and institutions could transfer value across borders at speeds and costs previously unimaginable through traditional financial intermediaries. With Lightning Network and similar Layer 2 innovations gaining traction, the infrastructure to support such large-scale, high-frequency settlements is gradually materializing. This ambition aligns with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a settlement asset. Major firms, from asset managers to payment processors, are beginning to explore how BTC can be integrated into their operations, not just as an investment, but as an operational tool for liquidity and remittance. Why Trillions Per Day Is No Longer Far-Fetched Skeptics may argue that Bitcoin is not currently equipped to handle trillions of dollars in daily volume. However, Marcus’s prediction doesn’t rest solely on the base layer of Bitcoin but on the evolving ecosystem of technologies being built atop it. Innovations like the Lightning Network, which enable near-instant, low-cost micropayments, and the integration of Bitcoin rails into enterprise-grade platforms are already proving that Bitcoin’s scalability challenges can be mitigated. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As global commerce increasingly digitizes, and as inflationary concerns push more capital into decentralized, censorship-resistant assets, Bitcoin is poised to become not just a hedge or a reserve—but the plumbing of the financial world. A Future Taking Shape Marcus’s remarks arrive at a time when Bitcoin is gaining momentum both in price and legitimacy. Regulatory headwinds remain, but the direction of innovation is unmistakable. With major ETF approvals , rising adoption in emerging markets, and sustained technological development, the groundwork for a trillion-dollar-per-day Bitcoin-powered system is steadily being laid. While skeptics still question Bitcoin’s practicality for everyday transactions, visionaries like David Marcus are steering the conversation toward what Bitcoin can do, not just what it’s worth. And according to him, what it can do is nothing short of revolutionary. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Interestingly, this crypto whale had accumulated these TRUMP tokens at an average price level of $13.47 last week. Related News: Bad News for Bitcoin (BTC) from Arizona: It Would Have Been a First in History With his latest sale, we see that the crypto whale lost $760,000. At the time of writing, the TRUMP price is trading at $11.17, with a 12% loss in the last 24 hours. The fact that the whale sold immediately after the sudden drop in the token's price at midnight suggests that this may have been a panic sale. With this sale, the whale wallet sold all of its TRUMP tokens and does not hold any other altcoins, according to onchain data. Only the $4.77 million USDC stablecoin it obtained from the sale continues to be in the crypto whale's wallet. *This is not investment advice.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading SUI Token Overview and Market Impact The SUI token is the native cryptocurrency of the Sui blockchain. It gained notable traction in late 2023 and early 2024, with prices reaching $2.18 by March 27. Though the price experienced volatility, it rebounded in the autumn and hit an all-time high of $2.36 on October 14. The year ended with SUI reaching $5.35, attributed to a rise in Total Value Locked in its system, which exceeded $2 billion. The managing director of the Sui Foundation, Christian Williams, highlighted the ecosystem’s growth and the community’s role in its organic development. As of early 2025, SUI exhibits fluctuating price predictions based on wave counts. Prices are projected to range from $2.40 to $3.60 by the end of 2025 and drop to a range of $1.03 to $1.27 by the end of 2026. Looking farther ahead to 2030, the projected price range is between $25 and $37. SUI facilitates transactions on Sui blockchain and can be staked for rewards. Mysten Labs, established by former Meta developers, launched Sui in 2023 to address some limitations of existing blockchain technology, focusing on speed and efficiency. Polygon Network and POL Token Overview Polygon, formerly known as Matic Network, is a platform designed to link various blockchains and enhance their scalability without compromising on decentralization. It serves as an improved Layer-2 scaling solution with cross-chain capabilities. Under its new branding, Polygon introduced the POL token, migrating from its original token, MATIC, to align with recent upgrades. The migration process began in September 2024, aiming to support Polygon’s scaling solutions and better integrate its ecosystem. The POL token not only facilitates transactions but also rewards those who validate transactions across the network. Users have the option to buy, sell, and trade POL on various exchanges. Polygon’s pricing forecasts for upcoming years depend on factors such as market adoption and technological development. By 2025, the POL token could see average prices around $1.50, potentially peaking at $2.50 if the market conditions are favorable. A lower support level of $0.60 might be observed during consolidation periods. Looking further ahead to 2030, increased adoption could lead to an average price of $3.00, with a potential high of $5.00. These predictions are contingent on network maturity and the broader crypto market environment. Conclusion In summary, the migration of investors from coins like SUI and POL to Codename:Pepe signals a pursuit of greater short-term potential. While SUI and POL may have their merits, Codename:Pepe offers immediate opportunities by harnessing advanced intelligence to maximize profits. Codename:Pepe crypto sets itself apart by utilizing AI to navigate the meme coin market, delivering predictive trading signals and automated trading capabilities. Its community-driven model, capped token supply, and exclusive membership in a specialized DAO provide investors with active engagement and the possibility of significant returns.

While one can easily buy the XRP token and pay no fee, its investors pay a premium for the fund, which has an expense ratio of 1.89%. A 1.89% fee is high even when compared with other leveraged ETFs. The popular Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares ETF, which has $9.9 billion in assets, charges a 0.75% management fee. Similarly, the $22 billion ProShares UltraPro QQQ ETF has an expense ratio of 0.84%. XXRP’s fees mean that a $10,000 investment will cost at least $189 annually. XXRP ETF inflows | Source: ETF Strong institutional demand Despite XRP’s high fees, sustained XXRP inflows signal strong institutional demand for XRP ETFs. It also means that the upcoming XRP ETFs will likely have more inflows. The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently reviewing 9 XRP ETFs from companies like Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and Grayscale. JPMorgan, the Wall Street bank, estimates these ETFs will have over $8 billion in inflows in the first year. If this happens, the inflow will be higher than that of Ethereum ( ETH ). SoSoValue data shows that spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted less than $2.5 billion in the first seven months. XXRP, like other leveraged ETFs, is a high-risk and high-reward fund. That’s because the fund seeks daily investment returns that correspond to 2x the daily performance of the XRP token. A good example is the ProShares QQQ ETF and the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETFs. TQQQ, which provides leveraged exposure to the Nasdaq 100 Index, has jumped by 261% in the last five years, while the Nasdaq 100 Index has risen by 127% in the same period. SQQQ, which provides leveraged short exposure to the Nasdaq 100 Index, has crashed by 98% in the same period. Therefore, an XRP price crash will lead to more pain for XXRP ETF investors.

Following an impressive performance in the third week of April marked by $3.06 billion in net inflows, these Bitcoin ETFs did well to retain investors’ interest by attracting almost $2 billion in deposits over the past week. Notably, Bitcoin has recently seen a market rebound, with prices moving from $84,000 to $97,000 in the last two weeks. The rising inflows to Bitcoin demonstrate a strong market demand backing this resurgence, hinting at the potential of a sustained uptrend.

This represents the third-largest weekly inflow in 2025 as institutional investors actively rotate their capital into the cryptocurrency and all related markets. In a familiar tale, BlackRock’s IBIT attracted the largest investments with over $2.48 billion in net inflows. Interestingly, IBIT accounted for all deposits on Friday, May 2nd, valued at $674.91 million, demonstrating an unrivaled market dominance. Other ETFs that experienced a net inflow include Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, and Invesco’s BTCO, with investments ranging from $10 million – $41 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s BTCO accounted for the largest weekly net outflow at $201.90 million in what proved a bearish week for the second-largest Bitcoin ETF. Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also registered net withdrawals valued between $30 million – $60 million. While Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, Wisdom Tree’s BTCW, Hashdex’s DEFI, and Valkyrie’s BRRR have zero market flows. Following this bullish trading week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs boast of $40.24 billion in cumulative total net inflow. Meanwhile, their total net assets are now valued at $113.15 billion, representing 5.87% of Bitcoin’s market cap.

Specifically, these ETFs registered $106.75 million in inflows in the last trading week, with BlackRock’s ETHA accounting for the majority share. Presently, these ETFs hold a cumulative total net inflow of $2.51 billion and total net assets of $6.40 billion, which represents 2.87% of the Ethereum market cap. At the time of writing, Ethereum continues to trade at $1,845 following a 0.49% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains valued at $95,514.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Michael Saylor says the firm has doubled the capital it wants to raise to accumulate the flagship digital asset from $42 billion to $84 billion. “MSTR announces BTC Yield of 13.7% and BTC gain of $5.8 billion year-to-date, doubles capital plan to $42 billion equity and $42 billion fixed income to purchase Bitcoin, and increases BTC Yield target from 15% to 25% and BTC dollar gain target from $10 billion to $15 billion for 2025.” In its 2025 Q1 Earnings Presentation, Strategy breaks down its “42/42” plan to continue purchasing BTC. Currently, Strategy holds 553,555 BTC worth $53 billion, or over 2.6% of the overall BTC supply, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. Last month, Strategy announced that it had bought billions of dollars worth of BTC in three separate instances, the most significant being on April 28th when the firm purchased $1.42 billion in Bitcoin. Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation is beginning to draw mixed reactions. Veteran pseudonymous crypto trader The Flow Horse tells his 267,600 followers on the social media platform X that he’s not fond of Strategy’s plan. “Right now Michael Saylor + MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stake is arguably the largest concentrated position in any globally traded asset by a private company or individual. Not a fan [to be honest].” Bitcoin is trading for $96,179 at time of writing, a 1.3% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-whale-addresses-hit-all-time-high-heres-the-implication/,"XRP is witnessing a significant uptick in large-holder accumulation , a development that analysts are interpreting as a potentially bullish signal for the asset’s long-term price trajectory. According to blockchain intelligence platform Glassnode, the number of XRP addresses holding 10,000 or more tokens has recently surpassed 300,000—a record high. This milestone was highlighted in a recent post by Coin Bureau on X, sparking renewed interest across the crypto community about the strategic behavior of high-net-worth investors. BULLISH: There is growing number of XRP whales. As per a Glassnode chart, a record high in addresses holding 10K+ XRP surpassed 300K, signaling strong investor confidence. Is this a precursor to a major price move? pic.twitter.com/Z8M9AEMovH — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 3, 2025 Rising Whale Activity and Market Sentiment The surge in whale-sized XRP addresses suggests growing conviction among seasoned holders, many of whom are often seen as early indicators of broader market trends. In the crypto space, the accumulation patterns of whales—entities or individuals holding substantial amounts of an asset—are closely monitored for signs of institutional interest or impending market moves. The fact that over 300,000 addresses now hold at least 10,000 XRP each indicates a deepening belief in the token’s long-term value proposition, even as it continues to navigate regulatory scrutiny and broader market volatility. Glassnode’s data provides a compelling narrative: investors are choosing to accumulate rather than divest, possibly in anticipation of structural changes that could positively impact XRP’s price and utility. These may include the expanding use of XRP in cross-border settlements , ongoing discussions surrounding potential ETFs , and the resolution of Ripple’s legal standoff with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Strategic Accumulation Thesis The significance of this trend cannot be overstated. Historically, periods of aggressive whale accumulation have preceded major price rallies in various crypto assets. While past performance is not necessarily predictive, the psychology behind such behavior often reflects internal insights or long-term positioning strategies that average retail investors may not yet fully appreciate. Furthermore, the threshold of 10,000 XRP—currently a five-figure dollar value—serves as a dividing line between casual holders and those with more serious stakes in the ecosystem. As this cohort continues to expand, it may serve as a foundational layer of support in XRP’s price structure, reducing volatility and signaling broader market maturity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation on a Major Move The core question posed by Coin Bureau—Is this a precursor to a major price move?—is one that market analysts and XRP advocates are now discussing with renewed urgency. Although XRP’s price has been relatively stable in recent weeks, this kind of on-chain behavior suggests that key market participants are anticipating significant developments on the horizon. Whether it’s tied to anticipated regulatory clarity, Ripple’s expanding partnerships with financial institutions, or the broader macro shift toward blockchain-based payment solutions, this accumulation trend is setting the stage for potential price appreciation. It also reinforces the growing narrative that XRP is evolving from a speculative asset into a cornerstone of institutional blockchain finance. With the number of XRP whale addresses reaching unprecedented levels, a new layer of market optimism is beginning to surface. The data from Glassnode, as spotlighted by Coin Bureau, points to increased confidence from investors who typically move with strategic foresight. As speculation intensifies about what this trend might herald, the broader crypto market is watching XRP with renewed interest—waiting to see if the whales are, once again, leading the charge toward the next big move.

The commentary comes as XRP faces bearish pressure, struggling to maintain momentum above the $2.2 level . Since late April, the asset has remained bound within this price range, despite experiencing brief surges and dips. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.21 as market uncertainty grows.Amid this price stagnation, investor sentiment has grown cautious. However, industry figures like Edoardo Farina, Head of Social Adoption at XRPHealthcare, view this period as an attractive accumulation phase. Farina has continued to stress XRP's long-term potential, pointing out that the current lull in price presents an opportunity for investors to accumulate tokens before the next major uptrend.As part of this campaign, he recently reviewed the XRP Rich List, an unofficial leaderboard of wallet holders ranked by XRP holdings. His analysis revealed that the total number of XRP wallets has reached 6.4 million. The XRP Rich ListDespite this figure, he warned that wallet count does not equate to individual holders. Many users, including himself, own multiple wallets for various purposes, such as trading, self-custody, and diversification.According to Farina, most of these wallets are either inactive, custodial, or contain negligible amounts of XRP. In fact, he referenced estimations indicating that roughly 60% to 70% of wallets on the XRP rich list could fall into these categories, leaving only about 30% to 40% as active, self-custody holdings. Farina stated that AI analysis, such as estimations from ChatGPT, suggests that the real number of XRP holders might lie between 1.5 and 2 million. He believes the actual count is closer to one million.This incredibly low number, when compared to the global population, shows the exclusivity involved in XRP market participation. According to these estimates, less than 0.025% of the world's population holds any XRP. Farina believes this indicates how early most investors still are .Meanwhile, citing on-chain data, Farina pointed out that to secure a rank among the top 10% of XRP wallets, an individual would need to hold about 2,500 XRP. At current market prices, this equates to an investment of roughly $5,000. XRP Rich List XRP Rich List Notably, this threshold is rather low for such an exclusive group, presenting an opportunity for those who look to leverage it early enough. ""You need about 2,500 XRP and you would be among the top 10% XRP holders, the top 10% wallets. And that's insane,"" Farina said.""99% Will Not Make It""He also discussed a misconception that XRP's rise will result in widespread wealth, as he believes only a small group of holders would continue to hold XRP when it reaches its full potential. As a result, he dismissed the idea that governments or elites would be concerned about a small group of investors becoming wealthy. ""Do you really think the government or the elites or the ones in control running the system really care that a tiny amount of holders are going to make $250,000? Hell no,"" Farina stated.Speaking further, he argued that very few people will have the patience or conviction to hold XRP through its entire growth curve. Most will likely sell during incremental price milestones such as $10, $30, or $100. Farina suggested that only around 10% of current holders might remain invested by the time XRP reaches a potential $1,000 valuation. While some have touted this goal , others still believe it is largely impossible amid the current market conditions.Farina noted that those who seek to enter the XRP rich list can do so with minimal amounts now. While the opportunity still exists, he warned that 99% of people won't reach the finish line. He argued that investors must have a long-term vision if they hope to truly benefit from XRP's potential future.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-05-04 14:46:17

44152057,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-gold-backed-tokens-rise-in-demand,1746370316,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/44152057.jpeg,Best Crypto to Buy Now As Gold Backed Tokens Rise In Demand,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/05/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-gold-backed-tokens-rise-in-demand,"Investors are rediscovering an old favorite—but this time, through a modern lens. As Gold demand hits record highs and digital innovation reshapes the way value is stored, tokenized gold is stepping into the spotlight. No longer confined to physical vaults or ETF wrappers, gold is now being minted onto blockchains in record amounts. And it’s catching serious attention. With traditional assets wavering and inflationary concerns persisting, the surge in gold-backed crypto points to a wider shift in how investors hedge their bets. Gold Goes Digital - A Resurgence in Tokenized Precious Metals This isn’t a mere blip in investor interest—it’s a structural pivot. According to the World Gold Council , Q1 gold demand reached its highest first-quarter level since 2016, totaling 1,206 tonnes. But while central bank purchases slowed down, investor-led demand— particularly through gold ETFs and tokenized gold —picked up the slack. Investment in gold ETFs more than doubled to 552 tonnes, and bar and coin demand remained strong, especially in markets like China. Meanwhile, gold-backed cryptocurrencies saw an impressive rally. In just one month, over $80 million worth of these tokens were minted, boosting the sector’s market cap by 6% to $1.43 billion. Monthly transfer volume jumped 77%, hitting $1.27 billion—a three-year high in token activity. This digital gold rush isn’t just tracking the price of the metal—it’s gaining momentum as an alternative investment vehicle. With spot gold reaching $3,240 before pulling back slightly, many investors are using tokenized gold to bridge the gap between safety and speed. In a market where risk assets like traditional crypto have soared, the rise of gold-backed tokens offers a compelling counterbalance. The infrastructure is stronger, interest is mounting, and the blockchain is proving it can modernize even the most traditional safe haven. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Gains Trust SUBBD The idea that a fanbase could be something more than just numbers on a screen has always lingered beneath the surface of the creator economy. SUBBD gives that idea structure, clarity, and a financial layer. It doesn’t simply reward followers—it transforms their involvement into something measurable and marketable through blockchain-issued creator tokens. Here’s how it works: creators can launch their own token on the SUBBD platform, allowing supporters to buy in—not just emotionally, but financially. Holding these tokens grants access to content, voting rights on decisions, a cut of revenue in some cases, and entry into exclusive experiences. The stronger the creator’s brand, the more valuable their token becomes. In effect, it’s like early investing in someone’s rising cultural stock. The real edge lies in its mechanics. Everything is powered by $SUBBD, the native token anchoring the ecosystem. Unlike traditional content platforms where algorithms and ad models determine reach, SUBBD puts decision-making—and value—back into the hands of creators and their communities. This shift feels especially timely. While gold-backed tokens represent stability through scarcity, SUBBD is redefining digital wealth as something fueled by loyalty and engagement. It’s a sharp detour from the speculative chaos of memecoins—grounded instead in audience connection and verifiable interaction. In a crypto space chasing novelty, SUBBD brings utility and creativity together under one tokenized roof—and that’s what makes it worth watching. BTC Bull There’s no shortage of memecoins, but very few are built around a meaningful thesis. BTC Bull skips the tired joke-token playbook and goes straight for something more potent: aligning itself with Bitcoin’s long-term rise. Rather than mocking crypto culture, BTC Bull pays tribute to its origin. The project embraces the idea that Bitcoin isn’t just a financial instrument—it’s a movement—and this token is designed to amplify that narrative through creative rewards and user incentives. What makes it more than a meme? Its tokenomics and staking system reward holders in Bitcoin, creating a direct tie-in to the asset it supports. The project also rewards holders every time Bitcoin reaches a price milestone. This turns BTC Bull into a gateway for everyday users to accumulate BTC over time without needing to trade or mine it directly. The interface is simple, the theme is loud, and the mechanics are surprisingly thoughtful. It also introduces a cultural layer by tapping into a community-driven model. Users stake tokens, participate in events, and earn based on community growth—all while reinforcing Bitcoin’s growth as the end goal. ClayBro —one of the biggest crypto YouTubers—also claimed that the project would have strong potential to grow in the future. And as interest grows in crypto assets that have something tangible behind them, BTC Bull offers a unique twist: it’s a meme coin with a mission to stack sats. So while gold-backed cryptos mint tokens against a physical reserve, BTC Bull mints enthusiasm into Bitcoin accumulation. It’s lighthearted in tone but serious in intention, and in this climate of renewed asset trust, that’s a recipe for relevance. Solaxy Not every crypto project needs to invent something new—some just need to fix what’s broken. Solaxy steps into that space with precision. It’s a Layer 2 protocol designed to bridge two of the busiest blockchains: Solana and Ethereum. Rather than forcing users to pick sides, it’s creating smoother interoperability, faster throughput, and lower gas fees across both ecosystems. Solaxy isn’t trying to dominate—it’s trying to connect. That approach is surprisingly rare in a market often obsessed with competition over cohesion. With decentralized apps expanding and token volumes exploding on both Solana and Ethereum, the demand for an efficient cross-chain layer has never been higher. The project also offers staking for its native token, letting users lock in rewards while supporting network stability. High APYs, coupled with real technical utility, have turned early adopters into vocal advocates. And with a total value locked that continues to climb, Solaxy’s architecture appears to be doing exactly what it promised. HyperSpeed Achieved!🔥🚀33 Million Raised! 🛸🪐 pic.twitter.com/HgswKcnnVM — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 3, 2025 So how does this tie into the larger crypto shift? While gold-backed tokens are booming because they link digital assets to something stable, Solaxy thrives because it links two entire ecosystems. It’s a different kind of trust—trust in infrastructure, in speed, in not having to worry if your assets will be trapped on the wrong chain. And as user expectations shift from novelty to reliability, Solaxy’s quiet focus on functionality could end up making the loudest impact. MIND of Pepe It started as a meme, then became an AI agent—and now, MIND of Pepe is starting to feel like a genre of its own. This project doesn’t just run on the usual hype cycle. It thinks, interacts, and evolves in real time. A fully autonomous AI character, it is modeled after the infamous Pepe meme, but designed to live on social platforms and respond dynamically to news, trends, and investor sentiment. What gives it weight beyond the meme is the level of integration. MIND of Pepe interacts directly with users, reposts charts, mocks market swings, and even suggests buy/sell logic based on crowd behavior. It’s a live, on-chain meme strategist—part influencer, part sentiment tracker. The native token benefits from this interactivity. When the AI engages, tokens move. Users can stake, trade, or simply watch as the MIND shapes its own community through personality-driven engagement. And it’s working. The project has garnered a loyal following not because it’s gimmicky, but because it reflects the mood of the market in real time—something gold, for all its timeless value, could never do. Still, both gold-backed cryptos and MIND of Pepe share one trait: people are trusting new forms of value again. One’s grounded in metal, the other in meme-driven AI engagement—but both are pulling users back into crypto with a fresh narrative. If tokenized trust is having a moment, MIND of Pepe proves even the weirdest projects can lead the charge—especially when they’re smart enough to think for themselves. Conclusion The renewed momentum behind gold-backed crypto signals more than a passing trend—it marks a shift in how investors approach digital assets. The focus is turning toward utility, stability, and purpose. Whether it’s precious metals entering the blockchain or new protocols reshaping how value is exchanged, the appetite for crypto with substance is growing. As the lines blur between traditional stores of value and on-chain innovation, the next phase of the market will likely favor tokens that offer more than just speculation—they’ll need to earn trust, deliver function, and stay relevant in a world that’s watching more closely than ever.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has generated considerable presale momentum despite its affordable price point of $0.025. Mutuum Finance has obtained $7.5 million and sold 438 million tokens during its ongoing presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing rapid development during its fourth presale phase as it indicates upcoming increasing momentum in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge Bitcoin continues to experience growing optimism across its market. The currency maintains current value at $93,650 while sustaining $55.3 billion daily trading. The crypto market flagship has experienced a 100% increase in value since the start of 2024 because of institutional adoption and positive outlook after the halving event. The strong buying trend appears from the RSI value of 67 while volatility maintains itself at 2.97 according to technical analysis. Research analysts have predicted Bitcoin to reach $160,000 by the end of the year while anticipating $200,000 due to increasing institutional funding. Since it commands a massive market value of $1.54 trillion the potential for profit growth remains stable but it will not experience explosive value increases. Mutuum Finance through its MUTM tokens gives investors an efficient path to earn fast profits that appeals to investors who need rapid-paced gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Frenzy The fourth stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale attracts investors through its current selling price of $0.025 per token with 55% sold out. The platform has successfully attracted 9,400 new holders who have contributed $7.5 million during its ongoing presale period. The forthcoming Price Phase 5 will boost MUTM token value from $0.025 to $0.03 while giving current holders a 20% profit boost. Phase 4 Investors can expect a 140% return during MUTM’s launch at $0.06 while experts forecast the price will rise to $3.50 afterward which could yield a 13,900% ROI. Users can now find the top 50 token holders displayed on the new dashboard which gives bonuses to keep their positions and strengthens competitive dynamics. This presale’s velocity signals urgency, as phase 4 nears sell-out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Security and Stability The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team places trust at the core of their operations. The project is undergoing a CertiK audit of its smart contract which will release its results through social platforms. The project demonstrates its commitment to transparency through this action because the crypto market demands such practices. Lending operations implemented through overcollateralized loans deliver stability which attracts investors who prefer low-risk services. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes a utility-based system that stands in contrast to Bitcoin because it delivers practical market benefits. Phase 5 will trigger a project breakthrough for MUTM because its tokenomics design has passed external audits with a framework that promises better performance than Bitcoin’s steady progress. Racing Toward $4 Mutuum Finance demonstrates the capability to outperform Bitcoin in terms of speed and project growth. The estimated $200,000 price milestone for Bitcoin faces setbacks due to the token’s enormous size. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors unique access to enormous returns through its $0.025 initial entry point. The cryptocurrency holds exceptional value in the market because its projected launch price of $3.50 may reach $4 by mid-2025. Many investors buy MUTM tokens in anticipation of the price increase during phase 5. Don’t miss out—explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now and join the 9,400 holders betting on its meteoric rise.

The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value. This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin ( BTC ) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term. If Bitcoin is to be treated like gold, it must be secured like gold. Very soon, we will see governments and institutions seek to secure Bitcoin in what will no doubt look like a digital Fort Knox. With more institutional and instrumental influence over the most valuable digital asset in the world, verifiable storage, hardened security protocols and structures built on resilience will become paramount. This shift could raise the stakes for developers. As institutional adoption rises, so does the demand for specialized developers capable of delivering institutional-grade security and long-term stability. What does this demand mean for the developer community that made Bitcoin what it is today? How will this affect the grassroots development built on Bitcoin’s core principles of full decentralization and transparency? Will a more institutional Bitcoin leave room for innovation, or is this the end of Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi)? Bitcoin’s institutional turn Bitcoin, the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, was designed to operate outside of traditional systems. Yet the moment governments and traditional institutions stopped keeping their distance, the future of Bitcoin has begun to pivot. What was once met with skepticism now draws a new kind of curiosity. The same players who once warned against digital assets are now staking their claims. The International Monetary Fund’s latest Balance of Payments Manual now classifies digital assets like Bitcoin as part of the international financial system, placing it firmly alongside traditional reserves and gold. As of January 2025, governments worldwide hold an estimated total of 471,000 BTC, worth over $16.3 billion. Strategy continued to lead and cross its Bitcoin holdings at a corporate level, doubling down on the cryptocurrency as a long-term strategic play. Recent: Bitcoin DeFi surge may boost BTC demand and adoption — Binance This kind of institutional recognition validates Bitcoin’s core principle but also throws it into flux. Holding it in sovereign reserves, governments are simultaneously affirming its legitimacy while also conforming it to the very system it was meant to disrupt. The changing developer landscape As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, fresh talent is still entering the space. There’s no guarantee all will stay. In 2024, the total number of developers in the industry declined by 7% year-on-year. Yet seasoned and established developers saw a 27% increase in activity, contributing to a record share of the industry’s output. While opportunities for small-scale contributors may be fading, the ecosystem supports a core of experienced builders, a signal that the space is maturing. The influx of institutional investors to crypto like Bitcoin is likely to drive up Bitcoin’s price, a consequence that might see them price out smaller developers and create an even higher barrier to entry. As the stakes around Bitcoin continue to rise, the demand is no longer just for innovation. It’ll be for security, compliance and infrastructure that can meet enterprise-grade “Fort Knox” level expectations. We’ll see a new wave of specialized developers stepping up to build intelligent, compliant and institutional-grade decentralized applications. From secure custody solutions to regulated exchanges and seamless bridges, institutional and government demands will shape the next phase of Bitcoin development. A new infrastructure As Bitcoin integrates more deeply into institutional finance, the development focus is maturing from experimentation to durability, compliance and security. Developers will likely focus on building not directly on Bitcoin but instead with Bitcoin. Bitcoin DeFi has so far been celebrated as a way to unlock open finance with the world’s most popular cryptocurrency, and it still might. Still, its future will depend on incoming compliance and regulatory frameworks. If governments go down the path of shoehorning the asset into traditional financial models, we’ll find developers seeking ways to bridge Bitcoin’s liquidity and value to more operable, friendlier chains. If governments are open to preserving Bitcoin’s core offering as a new, borderless and decentralized currency, that will signal the community to continue innovation. The question for the community then isn’t whether Bitcoin can support innovation under institutional oversight. It’s whether Bitcoin can thrive in a world that could now seek to contain it.

44152309,https://crypto.news/?p=14375393,1746370800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/44152309.jpeg,Is there hope for Canada’s crypto sector after the election?,https://crypto.news/hope-for-canada-crypto-sector-the-election/,"Cryptocurrencies are one of many dividing lines between the Liberal and Conservative parties of Canada. In 2022, Conservatives advocated for crypto as a way to “opt out” of inflation, blaming Liberal economic policy for driving inflation to 30-year highs and contributing to a spike in housing costs. Liberals, on the other hand, criticized crypto for being too volatile. Most of the time, cryptocurrencies are treated as securities, which makes developing a crypto-focused business in Canada difficult. This protective approach is seen by Conservatives as harmful to the country’s economic and technological development. Then-Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland criticized Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre’s pro-crypto stance after the 2021 bull run shifted into a bear market. She said: “Let’s talk about some really terrible advice that was offered to Canadians in the spring by the Conservative leader. He urged Canadians to invest in crypto as a way to opt out of inflation. Now, bitcoin has crashed by 21 percent over the past week and by more than 65 percent since the Conservative leader first gave Canadians that reckless advice.” She added that the Conservatives should apologize for pushing a policy that left many Canadians bankrupt. Poilievre has supported allowing Canadians to use cryptocurrencies alongside dollars, believing that crypto can preserve value in periods of high inflation. His goal is to change the legal classification of cryptocurrencies from securities to commodities. He views crypto as a positive force that can decentralize the economy. He has vowed to make Canada the “blockchain capital of the world” since 2022 — two years before U.S. President Donald Trump made a similar promise about the U.S. That same year, Calgary Nose Hill MP Michelle Rempel Garner introduced the Canadian cryptocurrency initiative. Garner’s initiative Bill C-249, introduced by Garner in 2022, aimed to kickstart communication between the Minister of Finance and cryptocurrency developers and entrepreneurs to establish a legal framework for crypto regulation. The bill sought to ease entry into the sector and foster a healthy legal environment for innovators. While advocating for the bill, Garner argued that Canada lost talented individuals due to a lack of government support and restrictive crypto laws. Read more: Canada’s global economic position at risk without crypto reforms, Coinbase warns Although the bill was well-received by Canadian crypto innovators and the Conservative Party, it was ultimately defeated in its second reading in the House of Commons. Trump enters the scene Trump’s remarks about turning Canada into the 51st state of America helped solidify older voters’ support for the Liberal Party. Prime Minister Mark Carney was seen as the politician best suited to protect Canada’s interests in any negotiations with its southern neighbor. Meanwhile, the Conservatives focused on domestic issues like inflation and out-of-control housing costs. The end result was a surprising shift in Canada’s political landscape. Young voters unexpectedly flocked to the Conservative Party while the older generation, whose top priority, according to many polls, was “dealing with Donald Trump”, formed a large enough voting bloc to hand Carney a victory. Other factors also contributed to Carney’s victory, including the Green Party banning many candidates from running in the election to avoid splitting the vote with the Liberals. Also, Conservative support in the key province of Quebec ranked the lowest in all of Canada heading into the election. Canadian polling shows that the top issue motivating voters aged 60 and older was ""Dealing with Donald Trump."" The least important issue was ""Making Canada a better place to live."" #CanadaElection pic.twitter.com/xyZWRF99fA — DKJ (@DKJBarry1) April 29, 2025 In his victory speech on April 29, Carney said, “We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons.” Trump, for his part, did not appear concerned about the Liberal victory and commented that he and Carney are “going to have a great relationship.” In the U.S., USD-pegged stablecoins are widely recognized as drivers of the dollar’s global strength. This is largely because popular stablecoins are typically backed by U.S. Treasury bonds. In 2023, USDC issuer Circle removed Treasury bonds from its reserve in 2023. Given that Conservatives were promoting stablecoins as a tool to protect Canadians from inflation, the Liberal Party’s stance can be seen as a move toward greater independence from the U.S. Moreover, their positive view of central bank digital currencies aligns more closely with the European model. In contrast, the Trump Administration in the U.S. halted work on CBDCs over privacy concerns. The future of the crypto sector under Carney Overall, the Liberal Party is not fond of cryptocurrency. On many occasions, the high-profile party members, including Trudeau and Carney, made skeptical and even fierce remarks about cryptocurrencies. Carney named Bitcoin’s low network capacity as one reason it won’t work as a mass means of payment. According to Carney, the price volatility makes crypto a bad store of value. As a former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, Carney trusts centralized financial institutions. He believes CBDCs are superior to stablecoins because they offer greater regulatory control. It does not appear that the Liberal Party will change its stance on crypto anytime soon. As a result, crypto advocates will face an uphill battle in Canada over the next four years.

Solana’s push toward $200 follows a rise in meme coins and expanding stablecoin use, making it one of the busiest chains this year. XRP is also showing signs of a major breakout, with price setups pointing to a possible 200% climb toward $6.5, helped by a renewed lift across the altcoin market. Still, beyond the well-known platforms, Unstaked (UNSD) is building something with wider reach. It plans to launch fully decentralized AI agents that interact across Web3 without needing direct input. This approach is not just part of today’s trend, but a way to support a long-term crypto economy. With presale pricing fixed at $0.006695, Unstaked is offering early access to a model focused on AI-led community growth in the next stage of digital infrastructure. Solana Builds Toward $200 as Meme Coins and Stablecoins Boost Activity Solana’s recent rise has pushed its price to $153, the highest point since March, and nearly 60% above its low this year. The increase is backed by strong activity in meme coins on the Solana network. Projects like Trump, Bonk, and Dogwifhat have helped push total meme coin value past $10 billion. At the same time, stablecoin use on Solana is growing fast, with the total stablecoin market cap now at $13.1 billion. Trading on Solana-based platforms like Raydium and Orca has also picked up, with volumes climbing past $17 billion this week. From a technical view, Solana has broken key resistance and formed a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. This setup often hints at further price increases. Analysts are now watching for a potential move toward the $200 level, which is about 32% above where it trades today. Solana’s strong usage and technical setup are keeping it in focus for traders. XRP Could Rise 200 Percent to Reach $6.5 XRP is showing signs of a major upward move, with some analysts pointing to a target near $6.5. That would mark a nearly 200% rise from current levels. Analyst Cryptarch_ noted that XRP is forming a Descending Triangle pattern, which has led to strong price gains in past setups. A recent positive shift in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also suggests that buyers may be regaining control. Cryptarch’s suggested strategy includes buying XRP at $2.10, with a stop at $2.00 and watching resistance points at $2.49, $3.00, and $3.39. The $3 level is seen as an important price point. A break above it could lead to a larger run toward $6.5. May 10 is highlighted as a key day to confirm the setup. With Bitcoin now near $91,800, strength in the wider market could give XRP extra support if altcoin interest stays strong. How AI Agents Are Shaping the Future and Why Unstaked Could Lead the Way AI agents are becoming one of the biggest new trends in both tech and crypto. As more industries move toward automation, decentralized AI agents offer ways to manage online communities, handle tasks, and support users without the need for human control. Bloomberg Intelligence reports that by 2026, autonomous agents could be behind over 40% of online activity, helping create a digital economy based on intelligent automation. In the crypto space, where global interaction happens every hour of the day, the need for AI agents that post, respond, and support users is growing fast. Unstaked is ahead in this shift. While many AI tokens promise future tools, Unstaked’s agents are already built and connected to blockchain systems for full transparency. The UNSD token is currently priced at $0.006695 in its Stage 2 presale. Buyers now are stepping into a market that may soon become one of the most talked about in crypto. As Web3 continues to develop, the projects that offer working tools with scalable AI systems are likely to lead the next wave. Unstaked provides a clear example of how this shift can begin, with a model that combines real use and growth potential in a market ready for progress. Summary of What Sets Unstaked Apart Solana’s rising network use and XRP’s strong technical setup both look promising for traders following market momentum. But Unstaked (UNSD) brings something different to the table. It holds a leading position in developing crypto’s first network of AI agents. Solana is attracting capital, and XRP may be close to a breakout, but Unstaked is building something entirely new. Its system uses AI agents to grow Web3 communities, and every task is recorded through its Proof of Intelligence system. With a crypto presale price that could grow more than 2,600% based on projected launch numbers, Unstaked gives early participants a unique starting point. Bloomberg Intelligence has predicted that 40% of digital processes could be handled by automation in just a couple of years. Unstaked is laying the foundation for this change, with a structure that reflects where crypto could be heading next.

These projects offer a mix of institutional strength, scalable architecture, and developer growth—all factors that point to long-term opportunity. And while these major players dominate headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is rising in the background as a powerful early-stage contender. MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging as a Promising Contender While big names dominate market caps, MAGACOINFINANCE is dominating conversations among serious early investors.

Solana (SOL): Scaling New Heights Solana continues to build its influence in decentralized finance, with projections indicating a possible surge to $200 in 2025. Its appeal stems from low fees, fast execution, and continued dominance in NFT and stablecoin ecosystems. New investor capital continues to flow toward SOL as analysts highlight its network upgrades and efficiency. Cardano (ADA): Advancing with Smart Contract Capabilities Cardano has struggled to maintain momentum in 2025, despite briefly pushing past $0.60 . The network has made significant progress in scaling and smart contract functionality, but sideways price action has kept traders cautious. Still, long-term developers and whales continue to accumulate—viewing it as a value Layer-1 bet. Ethereum (ETH): The Foundation Layer Still Expanding Ethereum is holding firm around $1,830 , supported by ongoing whale accumulation , AI-related token growth, and institutional inflows. Analysts are projecting targets above $2,500 in the coming months as Layer 2 adoption and ETF narratives gather momentum. Ethereum remains the most widely-used Layer 1 and continues to serve as a bedrock for crypto’s core infrastructure. Bitcoin (BTC): Macro Confidence, Micro Strength Bitcoin remains the benchmark, trading above $95,000 after closing April with a 14.5% gain . Forecasts for May range from $115,000 to $132,000 , bolstered by ETF inflows, increased global adoption, and reduced exchange outflows. BTC’s consistency makes it the centerpiece of any long-term strategy—especially when paired with high-growth altcoins. Arbitrum (ARB): Gaining Momentum with Unique Architecture Arbitrum is up 13% , with analysts pointing toward a move to $0.61+ . As Ethereum’s momentum builds, Arbitrum’s scaling solution becomes more important. Its fast confirmation times and developer tools have attracted new TVL and liquidity this quarter. Near Protocol (NEAR): Layer 1 Utility with Expansion Potential NEAR Protocol’s reputation for ease of use and scalability continues to grow. At current levels, analysts forecast potential upside toward $2.91 , particularly as institutional adoption of modular blockchains accelerates. Final Thoughts With Solana , Cardano , Ethereum , Bitcoin , Arbitrum , and NEAR all showing meaningful signs of growth, investors in 2025 have a wealth of smart-layered opportunities. But few tokens combine early entry with cultural power like MAGACOINFINANCE —a project that’s quickly becoming a standout in this year’s narrative.

In a major development for the Pi Network ecosystem, global fiat-to-crypto payment gateway Banxa has officially received Know Your Business (KYB) approval. This regulatory clearance allows Banxa to legally support Pi transactions in over 100 countries. It marks a pivotal step forward in Pi’s journey toward mainstream adoption. The approval comes after Banxa had temporarily suspended Pi transactions, likely due to pending compliance requirements. During this pause, reports surfaced that Banxa had already accumulated millions of Pi tokens at low prices, positioning itself for a strong re-entry once legal barriers were cleared.

The cryptocurrency has remained confined to a narrow range over the past week, with no major directional shift. However, emerging signals from technical indicators and whale behavior suggest that a more decisive move may soon unfold. Signs of Accumulation as Volatility Declines Despite muted price action, underlying activity in the XRP ecosystem has intensified. Whales have been steadily increasing their holdings over the past month. Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a well-known analyst in the crypto space, recently revealed that whales bought 900 million XRP over the past month. Whales bought around 900 million $XRP over the past month! pic.twitter.com/k3UyFMkJLq — Ali (@ali_charts) May 2, 2025 This steady buying relative price stagnation is generally interpreted as a strategic build-up in anticipation of a future rally. This accumulation trend is unfolding at a time when XRP is trading at $2.18, down 0.74% over the past 24 hours. The asset’s daily volume has also seen a notable 30.54% decline, with only $1.49 billion tokens traded in the past 24 hours. The consolidation has also helped XRP escape a death cross , and the current market position points to a phase of reduced volatility, often a precursor to more pronounced price action. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Breakout Scenario Hinges on Price Compression Technical analysis reveals that XRP’s current position places it slightly above the centerline of its Bollinger Bands, which have been tightening . This compression of the bands’ signals decreased volatility and a potential buildup toward a breakout. If XRP moves toward the upper band near $2.3 and closes above it with sustained momentum, it could create the conditions for a breakout from the current range. Market observers are closely watching this price level as the next significant test. Questions from Ripple’s Latest Escrow Release The unusual change in Ripple’s escrow activity complicates the short-term outlook. The company, which routinely releases 1 billion XRP on the first day of each month, made its most recent escrow release outside the usual schedule. The company initially locked 700 million tokens and waited almost 24 hours before unlocking 1 billion XRP. The timing of the release has raised speculation about Ripple’s internal decision-making and what might signal for XRP’s circulating supply and liquidity in the coming weeks. However, no official explanation has been provided. While the departure from routine has become a topic of interest among analysts, more experts are focused on an impending price surge. Analysts believe a move beyond $2.30 could redefine XRP’s short-term trend and set the stage for a move toward $5.85 .

This article examines the possible price trajectories of 6 highly sought after crypto tokens – Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Pepe (PEPE), Pi Network (Pi), and Remittix (RTX). Some of them offer steady gains, others not so much, and a few could fetch life-changing crypto returns before the year runs to an end. High-speed Solana eyes new highs Solana distinguishes itself with lightning-fast transaction speeds and a robust, thriving ecosystem of decentralized applications. This makes it a favorite destination for new crypto tokens, a quality that has boosted the SOL price handsomely over the years. However, Solana isn’t done yet. The project’s upcoming Firedancer upgrade promises a million transactions per second, increasing throughput to close the gap on Ethereum. This development has seen the SOL price rise gradually in recent times. Solana surged 26% in the last month. Source: Coinmarketcap A 24% appreciation in the last month positions Solana for a major rally in 2025. Experts forecast a possible surge to $490 as the crypto market gets more bullish. Key support for SOL lies around $122, and any sustained momentum above $250 could signal a new phase of growth. Ripple price prediction: How high can XRP rise in 2025? Historically, XRP’s price has seen dramatic swings, with its all-time high (ATH) previously in the $3 range. After a volatile start to 2025, XRP has maintained a bullish long-term structure, buoyed by a friendlier government regulatory environment and potential XRP ETF approvals. XRP price in the last 3 months. Source: Coingecko Looking ahead, experts' forecasts for 2025 place XRP in a range between $1.81 and $4.40. More optimistic analysts suggest stretched targets of up to $5.15 if key resistance levels are broken. The general consensus is that XRP’s chart structure is among the most bullish in crypto. If XRPcan sustain a breakout above $3.3 for weeks or months, a rapid price appreciation could push it to $6 or even $8. Will Litecoin reclaim its lost glory? Litecoin was generally referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold. But competition has seen LTCfall down the pecking order. As the crypto market surges upwards, Litecoin holders are hoping LTC will reclaim its glory days and head to the top, but little evidence suggests this would happen. Litecoin’s bullish momentum since April. Source: Tradingview Since the start of April, Litecoin has been trading with an ascending triangle pattern. The coin has a resistance level between $90 and $95, as LTC retraced at this level several times in March. A firm move above $95 could mark the beginning of a major recovery and confirm a bullish pattern that could push Litecoin above $150 for the first time in years. Pepe's price is recovering from the bears Pepe Price’s upward surge in recent times. Source: Coingecko Despite lacking real utility, PEPE surged to $0.000008 in early May, buoyed by general crypto positivity. This represented an 18% PEPE increase on the monthly scene, which is quite remarkable given that the meme coin market sort of crashed in the last few months. However, PEPE’s future still hinges on meme culture’s staying power. So, analysts aren’t too expectant of a Pepe price boom in 2025. Current predictions suggest a subtle PEPE drop to $0.00000737 if the meme craze doesn’t kick off. Should the opposite happen, PEPE could cause FOMO and surge to $0.00001 levels. Pi Network crumbles before the $0.75 resistance wall Over the years, Pi Network garnered a massive global user base, thanks to its unique mobile mining approach. This allowed users to accumulate PI tokens, a feature that combines well with a peer-to-peer marketplace. Pi Network’s struggle with the $0.75 resistance level. Source: Coingecko But since PI’s launch last February, the coin has only tanked. Pi Network has lost nearly 90% of its value, falling from $2.99 to below $0.40. During this period, PI struggled to break a $0.75 resistance wall, with daily trading volume peaking at half a trillion dollars. This collapse seems to have marked the end of Pi, despite a recent price rebound. Analysts aren’t hopeful of a reversal in 2025. But given PI’s massive community and popularity, any event could trigger a new PI rally. Remittix: A PayFi powerhouse destined for the top Remittix has quickly emerged as a standout crypto project. Designed to revolutionize cross-border payments, it allows anyone to send crypto as fiat to any bank account. This solution is highly applicable in the global remittances market, making it attractive to both retail and institutional entities. RTX: The Presale You've Been Waiting For | Remittix Review As a result, Remittix’s presale has been a hotly contested event. Over $14.7 million has been raised, with over half a billion tokens sold! Currently priced at $0.757, Remittix is well-positioned to disrupt the traditional financial markets, and that’s why experts have predicted a possible 100x surge in 2025. Given that Remittix has appreciated by 400% already in 2025, there’s little doubt it won’t hit close to this target before the year runs out.

Data shows that POPE developers created a new wallet ahead of the token launch and were the first to sell 5.8 million POPE tokens as soon as the token launched, using $100,000 worth of USDC – a worrying development for an altcoin. After purchasing POPE tokens, the developers sold 1.5 million POPE tokens as the price jumped to $0.286. With the subsequent sales, they increased their total realized profit to $688,000. They still hold $286,000 worth of POPE tokens.

From its long, drawn-out feud with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission being dropped in March , and to global banking giant Standard Chartered predicting a 500% XRP price run by the end of Trump’s term, XRP is the hot topic among the big-caps. Ethereum, meanwhile, has largely floundered for most of the year, but with recent price action improving, ETH could be on the verge of a comeback. However, the savvy money is going elsewhere in search of greater pump potential in the form of Remittix (RTX) —a newly-launched PayFi protocol ready to take a piece of the lucrative trillion-dollar cross-border payments industry. Here’s why RTX may very well outperform ETH and XRP price predictions this year. PayFi presale sensation Remittix primed to outrun ETH and XRP in 2025 In crypto, fortune favors the disruptors—and that’s exactly what Remittix has to offer early adopters with the launch of its highly anticipated presale. Remittix is looking to revolutionize cross-border payments by providing a seamless gateway allowing users to send fiat by way of over 100 cryptocurrencies directly to any bank account anywhere in the world. Offering low fees (1% flat fee and 0% on FX transactions), high staking rewards of up to 18% APY for its native token RTX, and a greater layer of privacy, Remittix is reminiscent of XRP’s early hype when it first came out in 2012. As evidenced by raising over $14.7 million in presale funding , Remittix is drawing attention across sectors for all the right reasons: strong fundamentals, rising adoption, and a low price point for entry into a blue chip on the verge of mooning. RTX: The Presale You've Been Waiting For | Remittix Review XRP price in a holding pattern after brutal start to May XRP prices started May off on the wrong foot after plunging to $2.15 in a spate of long liquidations, suggesting overexposure and major leverage disequilibrium. However, XRP priceshave bounced back to strong support at $2.20 as of press time. The recovery was attributed to its strong fundamentals and recent big-money institutional moves, indicating solid, if capped upside growth potential for long-term holders. XRP holding strong at support levels after a rough start. Source: CoinMarketCap Is Ethereum primed for a comeback? Ethereum is underperforming in every sense of the word over the past year, recording a staggering 38.6% annual loss for long-term ETH holders. Ethereum has stumbled out of the blocks, but better times could be around the bend for the Layer-1 smart contract platform. With Ethereum ETF demand rising amid its upcoming Pectra upgrade sparking renewed interest from traders, ETH prices may finally break past the wall at $1,900. It could be all just a matter of time before Ethereum crawls back to the critical psychological level of $2,000 in the coming months. And if ETH prices manage to do so, it stands to reason that a rally could be brewing in the works. Can Ethereum regain its momentum towards $2,000? Source: CoinMarketCap XRP vs. ETH vs. RTX: Which one to pick for the best ROI? XRP and Ethereum are ultimately bullish in the near future, with both large-cap tokens riding the wave of bullish tailwinds that could see them get on the next leg up. However, the largest ROIs won’t be made in XRP or Ethereum this year. Instead, the smart money is going all in on low-cap gems like Remittix that have an infinitely higher price appreciation potential than big-cap competition. With RTX token prices available at just $0.0757, the Remittix presale offers a golden ticket to what could be parabolic growth in 2025 and beyond.

The revelation, shared by on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain via its X account, sheds light on the whale’s month-long accumulation and holding spree across multiple major cryptocurrencies. A whale has been long $BTC , $ETH , $SOL , $LTC , $XRP , $LINK and other 16 tokens in the past month, with a total profit of more than $9M. Additionally, this whale bought 309 $BTC ($24.68M) at an average price of $79,792, currently sitting on unrealized profits of more than $5M.… pic.twitter.com/LVwmdlmUhf — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 3, 2025 A Tactical Bet on Market Momentum The investor’s portfolio reveals a diversified yet focused exposure to leading crypto assets. Notably, the whale has accumulated 1.5 million XRP, which currently holds an estimated value of $3.29 million. Alongside XRP, their holdings include nearly 71 BTC, worth approximately $6.82 million, 5,000 ETH, and a sizable 50,000 SOL, along with positions in LINK and more than a dozen other cryptocurrencies. These long positions, maintained during a volatile but upward-trending market phase, underscore a tactical approach to riding the broader crypto rally. Rather than engaging in frequent trades or short-term speculation, this investor appears to be banking on long-term growth across a diverse crypto basket. Bitcoin Accumulation Pushes Profits Higher Adding further weight to the whale’s bullish stance, Lookonchain highlighted another substantial move: the purchase of 309 Bitcoins at an average price of $79,792. This aggressive acquisition alone has produced over $5 million in unrealized gains, suggesting both confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory and a high tolerance for market fluctuations. This move comes at a time when institutional interest in Bitcoin is intensifying, following the approval of multiple U.S. spot ETFs and growing adoption narratives. For whales operating at this scale, such positioning often reflects broader macro expectations and conviction in the long-term value of digital assets. XRP’s Prominent Role in Whale Strategy The inclusion of XRP in the whale’s portfolio is particularly noteworthy. With 1.5 million tokens under management, the whale’s XRP position indicates confidence in the token’s utility and future upside. As Ripple continues to expand its payment and settlement ecosystem globally, some investors appear to be positioning themselves in anticipation of regulatory clarity and increased institutional usage.

Strategic Patience Pays Off The current unrealized gains of over $9 million highlight the value of strategic patience in crypto investing, especially when market momentum begins to align with long-held convictions. While the identity of the whale remains anonymous, their actions are sending a clear message to the market: calculated, diversified, and well-timed long positions in quality crypto assets can yield substantial upside—even amid uncertainty. In a space often dominated by fast trades and speculative hype, this whale’s performance serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring strength of a disciplined investment approach, particularly when backed by deep pockets and strong convictions. As market dynamics continue to evolve, all eyes will be on whether such long positions will eventually be realized, and what ripple effects they might trigger across the broader crypto landscape.

The biggest piece of positive news comes from a popular chart analyst, Ali Martinez. He took to X (where he has over 136K followers) to share the monthly $SOL chart, which is forming a bullish cup and handle pattern. The ‘cup’ started forming around November 2022, with the handle coming into existence during the tariff-induced panic sell-off. What’s even more encouraging is that this pattern has taken a long time to form – almost 2.5 years. This makes it a stronger bullish indication. It’s also worth noting that $SOL has risen around 38% since the second week of April, showing good upward momentum. Read on to find out more reasons why investors are bullish on $SOL. We’ll also point you towards the best crypto to buy to benefit from the upcoming bull run. Solana Tokenized Stocks and ETF Push There has also been an increasing push towards stock tokenization on the Solana blockchain. The Solana Policy Institute has submitted a proposal called ‘Project Open’ to the SEC, which seeks approval to issue tradable tokens for stocks. Larry Fink, BlackRock CEO, has backed the idea of stock tokenization and believes it can revolutionize the financial markets. This would make transactions faster, and billions that are often stuck in settlement delays can be pumped back into the markets almost instantly, generating more wealth over time. Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. – Larry Fink More good news: a Solana exchange-traded fund also looks like a certainty in the near future. Bloomberg has predicted a 90% chance for $SOL ETF approval in 2025 itself. Furthermore, the Solana stablecoin supply is also at an all-time high. It reached $11.7B in February 2025 and further shot up to $13B by May. Note that it was just $5B last year. A hike is supply like this should open up new possibilities in the Web3 and DeFi space. All in all, if you want to ride Solana’s growth, this is the best time to invest. The cryptos mentioned in this guide, especially Solaxy, offer the highest potential for returns. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Crypto to Buy Now on Solana, Boasts over $32M in Presale Even though Solana has many positives potentially propelling it to new highs, it’d be difficult for the network to realize its full potential until it can overcome its congestion and scalability issues. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX) . Solaxy is a new cryptocurrency and one of the very few offering real-world application. After all, it plans to build the very first Layer 2 scaling protocol on Solana. This Solana L2 will offload some transactions onto a sidechain, which is how it’ll reduce the burden on Solana’s mainnet and speed up the entire blockchain. Additionally, $SOLX will also reduce the transaction fees on Solana by processing a lot of transactions simultaneously, instead of one by one. Because it aims to breathe new life into one of the most popular blockchains, it’s no wonder that Solaxy is expected to surge 11,600% and reach $0.20 by 2030 . Currently, however, one $SOLX will only cost you $0.001714. That’s because the token is in presale, where it has raised a staggering $33M. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy . 2. Bonk ($BONK) – Solana’s Dog Meme Coin King With over $1.5B in market capitalization, Bonk ($BONK) is easily the biggest dog-themed meme coin on Solana. It was also the first-ever dog coin on the network. In case you have any reservations about the potential of dog cryptos, just look at the most successful meme coins of all time. Three out of the top five, i.e., $DOGE, $SHIB, and $BONK, are inspired by ‘a man’s best friend.’ What’s more, one of the biggest success stories of recent times, $BROCCOLI, is also a dog-themed coin. Coming to $BONK, its chart suggests that it’s now taking support at the $0.000016 level, which happens to be a previous resistance zone. The crypto is already up over 50% in the last month and can rally further once $SOL takes off. Thanks to a low price of $0.0000161p, $BONK is in contention for the best cheap cryptos to buy now . 3. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) – The Loudest and Stinkiest Token on Solana Created on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) is one of the most amusing community-driven cryptos on the market. It rewards token holders if they submit hilarious fart jokes. Moreover, there’s an uncanny ‘Gas Fee’ mechanism that emits a fart sound every time a transaction goes through. Quite naturally, crypto degens were quick to send $FARTCOIN soaring; it’s, in fact, one of the best meme coins on the market. The token has jumped over 145% in just the last month or so, and it’s expected to continue its climb with much velocity once it breaks through the $1.20 resistance level. You can buy it now for just $1.09. Even the Best Crypto to Buy Needs the Market’s Help $SOL’s upcoming upward momentum can indeed drag the best altcoins on its network along with it. However, even though the signs are all there, there’s really no guaranteeing anything in crypto. The market is volatile and full of ups and downs, which is why it’s recommended you only invest an amount that’s small enough for you. Finally, we urge you to do your own research before investing.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges. In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades. Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes. Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and profit-securing tool. They help reduce losses and boost revenue by automatically buying or selling an asset when its price reaches a set level. With Bitcoin’s emergence in 2009 and its subsequent trading on exchanges , these advanced trading strategy tools became crucial for dealing with its well-known price volatility. As Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained traction, traders began to use stop-loss and take-profit strategies from forex and stock markets. At first, price monitoring was manual. Then, automated features on crypto platforms changed everything. What are stop-loss and take-profit orders? Stop-loss and take-profit orders are trading strategies that help investors manage risk and secure gains automatically. They’re instructions you set on a trading platform to close a position when certain price levels are reached. They help limit losses in case of significant price drops or lock in profits when a price target is reached. They can be set up to boost gains and cut losses. This helps keep emotions out of trading, which can prevent regrettable mistakes. They also help if you can’t monitor the market constantly. There must be specific conditions for the orders to trigger. Bitcoin trading is very volatile. Its fast price changes and possible system delays can cause orders to trigger at a different price or not trigger at all. This type of trading strategy gives peace of mind to risk-averse investors. Bitcoin stop-loss orders If you don’t want to take risks and preserve your capital, you can use a stop-loss order designed to limit your losses. You can use it for a buy order, setting up a price level below your entry point, or right above it for a sell trade. In case of a price drop, the order is executed automatically at your designated price, preventing further losses. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a stop loss at $85,000, your position sells if the price drops to $85,000, capping your loss at $5,000. Bitcoin take-profit orders To lock in some gains, you can use a take-profit order. Set a price level above your entry point, and when the market reaches that level, the trade is executed, giving you the expected gains. For example, if you buy BTC at $90,000 and set a take profit at $95,000, if the price hits $95,000, it sells, securing a $5,000 profit per BTC. Importance of stop loss and take profit for Bitcoin trading Bitcoin’s wild price changes make stop-loss and take-profit orders important. These tools help lower the risk of losses and boost the chance of gains. Remember, setting up these orders doesn’t guarantee they will be executed. Their execution relies on various factors, like market volumes. Why set up a stop loss for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s volatility has gone down over time. Still, it can have big price swings. Without proper Bitcoin trading risk management, traders may face heavy losses. Here are some of the most important reasons why it would be useful to adopt stop-loss orders in your Bitcoin trading strategy. Bitcoin volatility: BTC can still drop 10% in a very short time due to factors such as news, whale moves or market sentiment. On Dec. 5, 2024, for example, BTC suffered a flash crash from $103,853 down to $92,251 before recovering. A stop loss caps your downside trend when a flash crash hits. Without it, you’re gambling on timing the recovery manually. Non-stop market: The Bitcoin market is open 24/7. Setting up a stop loss will prevent losses due to sudden drops while you’re sleeping. Emotions: An emotional state can be a huge game-changer in trading. Emotional investors may panic-sell or panic-buy, triggering significant losses. A stop loss will reduce the risk of making costly emotional mistakes before fear kicks in. Why set up a take-profit order for Bitcoin A Bitcoin trading strategy may include defining price targets and a percentage of gains. Setting up a take profit order for BTC may be necessary as part of an overall trading risk management plan and will help reach the following targets. Locking gains: BTC’s volatility, in both bull and bear markets, can lead to quick spikes and can reverse just as quickly. A take profit ensures you cash out before pullbacks. Greed control: Without a take profit order, traders may be tempted to chase higher highs, which may not occur over the short term. Non-stop market: You can’t just sit and watch the market 24/7. A take-profit order ensures profits in case of a sudden pump while you’re asleep. How to set up BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders Setting up stop-loss and take-profit for Bitcoin trading varies by platform. However, the process is usually similar on most crypto exchanges, like Binance, Coinbase Pro and Kraken. The following step-by-step guide to setting up your BTC stop-loss and take-profit orders should give you a good overview of the process. Step 1: Choose a Bitcoin trading platform This may be the most crucial aspect of your process to set up your advanced BTC trading strategies. Pick a platform that aligns with your needs. Make sure to check the fees, volumes, reputation and security because these features can impact your trading strategy. Step 2: Open a BTC trading position Once you’ve set up your trading account, log in to your platform and navigate to the trading section, and look for the order form. Choose a BTC pair, for example, BTC/USD. Place your buy order (long) or sell order (short). For example, you can place your order to buy 1 BTC at $90,000. Step 3: Set your stop loss for BTC Here’s an example of an order from the Kraken platform. Click on the stop-loss option from the order menu as shown below to set up the tool. Set the stop-loss price by first deciding your risk level, or how much you’re willing to lose in case the Bitcoin price drops significantly. For example, if you bought BTC at $92,500, you can set the stop loss at $87,300, meaning you set your loss at roughly 5.62%. The loss = 92,500 - 87,300 = 5,200 Now, to find the percentage loss: (5,200 / 92,500) * 100 = 5.62% Step 4: Set your take profit for BTC Stay in the same trade interface. Just as above, after you select your BTC pair and buy the relevant BTC amount, click on the take-profit option. Set the take-profit price based on your exit strategy. For example, you want to set it 5% above the entry price, which would be $94,500 if you bought BTC for $90,000. Enter $94,500 as the sell price. When Bitcoin hits this price, it will sell automatically. Step 5: Confirm and monitor your orders Confirm and activate after double-checking the amount and price, then submit. If your notifications are active, you will receive one once the order is triggered. Nothing stops you from monitoring your order status, and you can cancel or amend it if the market conditions change. Best practices for BTC stop-loss placement Traders can limit their potential losses by using stop-loss orders. This helps them protect their capital during volatile market conditions. Therefore, with Bitcoin’s possible daily swings of 5%–10%, it’s safe to base a stop loss on volatility. Volatility: Platforms like TradingView might offer an option called Average True Range (ATR) over 14 days. This lets you set an average range below your entry point. For instance, you can choose a range of $3,000, so if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000, the order will trigger once it goes down to $87,000. Align with support levels: Historically, BTC respects price floors. Setting up a stop below a crucial support level gives some peace of mind. For instance, if you bought Bitcoin at $90,000 and $88,000 is your support level, set a stop-loss order at $87,800, just below the zone to bypass stop-hunting bots. Avoid obvious levels: Whales and bots target batches of stop-loss orders at round numbers ($80,000, $85,000) or chart patterns , triggering orders before price reverses. Moving the stop loss a bit lower, like to $87,800 instead of $88,000, will probably trigger the order more effectively. BTC trailing stop loss A trailing stop-loss order automatically adjusts a stop-loss price as the market price moves in a profitable direction to lock in profits and limit losses by following a trade’s price. It’s designed to keep a fixed distance below (for long positions) or above (for short positions) the current market price. A simple stop loss may miss profits, while a trailing stop locks them. You can set a trailing stop loss at 3%–5% below the peak as the price rises. If you buy BTC at $90,000 and it hits $95,000, the trailing stop loss moves to $93,250. You can adjust manually or automatically if the platform allows. Account for slippage Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which it is executed. This can occur due to market volatility or low liquidity. In case of low liquidity during BTC crashes, execution can skip your stop loss. For instance, $88,000 may fill at $87,500. Widening the stop loss slightly by 0.5%–1% can solve the problem. How to adjust stop-loss and take-profit Bitcoin orders When and how to adjust a stop loss Stop-loss adjustments should be made carefully. This helps protect capital from unexpected market changes and secures profits when possible. It’s often done by adjusting the order to support or resistance levels. Another common strategy is using trailing stop-loss orders. You can use “modify position” or “edit trade” on your platform to adjust them. Tighten the stop loss after a move in your favor. In case BTC’s price rises after entry, you can move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profits. If BTC rises after entry, move the stop loss to reduce risk or lock in profit. For example, if BTC bounces from $88,000 to $93,000, you can tighten the stop loss to $90,500, thereby ensuring no loss if it is reversed. Trail the stop loss during a trend. As BTC keeps running upward during a bull market, trailing the stop loss captures more on the upside. A percentage- or ATR-based trail can be used. For instance, with a $90,000 entry, if BTC rallies to $100,000, you can trail the stop loss to $97,200 to lock in $7,200 per coin, which is an 8% profit if it then dips. Widen the stop loss during consolidation , as tight stop losses will get hit in unsettled ranges. For instance, if BTC stalls after the $90,000 entry, you can extend the stop loss from $88,000 to $87,500 to avoid sudden drops below support. Adjust before major events , like US Federal Reserve rate announcements or ETF approvals. These can cause big swings and increase slippage risks. You can tighten the stop loss to 1%–2% if you decide to remain in the trade, or you can widen it to 10% to ride the upward trend. When and how to adjust the take-profit order Take-profit orders can be adjusted to maximize gains, adapting to momentum or resistance. Just like a stop loss, you can modify them on your trading platform by selecting the open trade and choosing the “modify position” or “edit trade” option. Extend the take profit during strong momentum. This is to avoid missing a peak in a bull run. If you see volume spiking or a breakout clearing resistance, you can push the take profit higher. For instance, you buy at $90,000 and set the take profit at $93,000. If BTC hits $92,500 fast, you can adjust the take profit to $95,000 or $97,000 to maximize profits. Take partial profits at key levels. Resistance levels like $85,000 or $90,000 often see BTC reversing. Then you can decide to sell some of your position to grab some gains and let the rest ride. Tighten the take profit near resistance levels. BTC usually stalls at round numbers or past highs. If the price approaches resistance, you can cut the take profit from $90,000 to $88,500, for example. Reset the take profit after a pullback. If you just missed a take profit trade, do not despair, as BTC usually retraces and then runs up again. If you enter the trade at $90,000 and BTC dips to $85,000, you can reset your take profit order to $87,000 or $88,000 for a moderate win. Common mistakes to avoid with BTC orders Bitcoin’s fast-moving market needs a solid trading strategy. Stop-loss and take-profit orders are key tools. However, if they aren’t set up properly, they could do more damage than benefit. Here are some common mistakes traders make with BTC orders and how to get around them. Setting stops too tightly: Placing a stop loss too close to an entry price means it may get hit by an average drop of 2%–3%. Always keep Bitcoin’s high volatility in mind and use volatility and support level metrics. Ignoring slippage: Slippage can occur due to high volatility or low liquidity. Ignoring it may lead to costly mistakes. Especially on leveraged orders, slippage may result in heavy losses, which may affect your risk plans. Widening the stop loss slightly during highly volatile times may help reduce the risk of big losses. Chasing round numbers: Setting a stop loss at a round number is not a good idea. This can attract bots and whales looking to hunt stops or dump orders. Always set it up $100–$500 below or above a round number to avoid being caught in this typical mistake. Forgetting to adjust: Leaving a stop loss at $88,000 and a take profit at $93,000 after BTC pumps to $95,000 means you may miss profits or risk a reversal. Regularly monitoring the BTC price will ensure you’re ahead of the game and can adjust the orders accordingly. Setting platform alerts is also useful. Misjudging market context: Use your judgment following market trends. Setting a tight stop loss before a Fed announcement or a wide take profit in a bearish trend may incur heavy losses. Adjust accordingly while following trends and sentiments. Tighten the orders pre-event and widen them post-event. Aligning a take order with resistance is also a good idea. Not accounting for fees: Large-scale orders may be subject to high fees, which should be accounted for when setting up orders. Always factor fees into targets, as in the long term, it will make a difference. Panic-canceling orders: Emotions can lead to big losses. So, it’s smart to stick to your initial plan. This is especially true for BTC, which often faces flash crashes but can recover quickly. You can use trailing stops to adjust automatically. Avoid these mistakes by planning strategically, staying disciplined and adapting to Bitcoin’s volatile nature. Always test strategies on a demo account before trading live.

But with mining getting harder and more expensive, many people are wondering: what’s the best crypto to mine without needing massive machines or huge electricity bills? The answer might surprise you — it’s not Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s a new and fast-rising project called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Traditional Mining Projects: Effective but Not Easy Bitcoin was the first to show how mining could support a network and reward users. But over time, it became harder for regular people to mine. You now need special hardware like ASICs, lots of power, and deep knowledge to even get started. Ethereum used to be mineable, but it has now fully moved to Proof-of-Stake, closing the door on mining completely. Other coins like Litecoin and Monero offer simpler options, but they still demand time, energy, and powerful devices. These projects are useful, but for those looking for easy, low-cost, and mobile-friendly mining, they just don’t check all the boxes anymore. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Accessible, Efficient, and Built for Everyone Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is changing how mining works in 2025. It’s designed to bring mining back to everyone — whether you’re using a phone, a laptop, or a full rig. This crypto doesn’t just talk about decentralization, it makes it happen. Bitcoin Solaris runs on a dual-consensus system: Proof-of-Work (PoW) on the Base Layer for Bitcoin-level security Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) on the Solaris Layer for fast, energy-saving performance This combination allows BTC-S to process up to 10,000 transactions per second, with 2-second confirmations, and use 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin​. It’s also backed by audited smart contracts , and verified contributors , which means security is a top priority. How You Can Mine BTC-S from Any Device With the Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S easily —no fancy equipment needed. It will work on: Smartphones (iOS & Android) Laptops and Desktops (Windows, macOS, Linux) Mining Rigs (ASICs and GPUs for advanced users) The app is: Easy to use with one-click mining Equipped with a built-in wallet Supported by an intelligent mining algorithm Full of tutorials to help beginners learn quickly So whether you’re at home, at work, or on the move, Bitcoin Solaris makes it easy to earn passive income from anywhere. New Token, Familiar Strength—Meet BTC-S Today Earn More Through Liquid Staking Mining isn’t the only way BTC-S helps you earn . With liquid staking, you can lock up your BTC-S tokens and get sBTC-S in return. These are 1:1 tokens that: Let you keep access to your funds while still earning rewards Can be traded, used in DeFi apps, or moved freely Are rewarded through smart, automated validator systems Stakers also play a role in governance, voting on decisions that shape the project’s future. It’s an easy way to earn without giving up control of your assets. The BTC-S Presale: A Rare Opportunity for Early Gains Presale Phase 1 is live and gaining massive attention from crypto influencers, investors, and enthusiasts alike. With demand rising fast, now’s the time to get in before the price doubles in Phase 2 – Checkout this review from Crypto Volt where he goes into a more detailed review. Here’s what you need to know: Current price: $1.00 Next phase: $2.00 Launch price: $20.00 That’s a potential 1,900% profit for early buyers. And with only three months of presale and a total supply capped at 21 million BTC-S, the window to join early is limited. With buzz building fast and the mining model already proving popular, BTC-S is topping “Best Crypto to Mine” lists all across the space. What If You Caught the Next Big Bitcoin Fork Early? Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris is more than just a coin—it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make passive income from crypto mining and staking available to everyone. Whether you’re using a smartphone or a high-end rig, BTC-S welcomes you with open arms.

The event, which unfolded during a token swap process, was initially perceived as a massive service fee tied to the Xaman Wallet. However, the incident was soon clarified by Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz , who also played a foundational role in designing the XRP Ledger. Unsuccessful Transaction Sparks Alarm The commotion began when a failed payment appeared on the XRP Ledger, pointing to a supposed 10,000 XRP transfer listed under a “Xaman Service Fee.” The transaction, however, was never actually processed. Labeled as “UNFUNDED_PAYMENT,” it was rejected because the sender’s available balance, after accounting for XRP’s required minimum reserve, was insufficient to fulfill the payment. There's no mystery here. It's a weird edge case that the code was not designed to handle. It's been fixed. — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) May 4, 2025 While technically unsuccessful and financially harmless, the size of the attempted transfer was enough to spark panic. The error’s visibility on-chain gave the impression that a user was being charged an excessive and possibly unjustified fee, fueling rapid speculation on social media and within the XRP developer community. Schwartz Explains: No Malice, Just a Rare Software Flaw As concerns escalated, David Schwartz took to the conversation to offer technical clarity. According to him, the transaction attempt was the result of an unusual edge case in the system—a rare occurrence the software wasn’t originally built to anticipate. He emphasized that there was no malicious intent behind the error and reassured the public that the issue had already been identified and corrected. Schwartz further confirmed that no actual funds were deducted, as the ledger never finalized the transaction due to its “unfunded” status. His intervention helped quell immediate fears, though questions around wallet transparency and ecosystem resilience remain. Deeper Distrust Surfaces in the Wake of the Incident The incident has nonetheless reignited debates around the reliability of wallets within the XRP ecosystem, particularly Xaman, which was at the center of this mishap. Some community members began to speculate that the error might not have been accidental at all. Allegations ranged from hidden vulnerabilities in wallet software to conspiracy theories that the event was engineered to undermine certain developers or XRP-aligned entities critical of recent changes in the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 One particularly vocal user questioned whether the glitch might be part of a coordinated effort to discredit players seen as obstacles to the current direction of XRPL development. Although unsubstantiated, such theories have contributed to growing tensions within certain parts of the XRP community. Moving Forward: Trust, Transparency, and Technical Precision While the situation ultimately caused no financial damage, it serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and communication between technical leadership and the wider user base. In an environment where public ledger data is immediately visible and widely interpreted, even failed transactions can carry serious reputational implications. Thanks to the timely clarification from Schwartz, much of the alarm has been addressed. However, the event highlights the need for robust error-handling mechanisms in wallet software and the importance of ongoing community engagement, especially as XRP and its surrounding infrastructure continue to mature in an increasingly scrutinized digital asset market.

This rising altcoin might beat it to the punch,https://crypto.news/can-dogecoin-still-hit-1-in-2025-this-rising-altcoin-might-beat-it-to-the-punch/,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While Dogecoin’s $1 dream is still alive, rising altcoin Remittix, with its real-world utility and strong presale momentum, might get there first. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s $1 dream: Can hype and momentum carry it in 2025? Remittix: The rising altcoin in cross-border payments Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) is still one of the most iconic coins in crypto, but it’s also one of the slowest to move. Why? Because it doesn’t usually lead the charge. It follows the trend, riding the hype as other coins pump. That said, it’s catching some momentum again, up around 9% in the last 30 days, and the $1 dream isn’t dead just yet. But while DOGE stirs, Remittix is already getting stuff done. Its presale is gaining speed, with over $14m raised and the current price standing at $0.0757. Dogecoin’s $1 dream: Can hype and momentum carry it in 2025? Dogecoin is starting to stir again, but analysts remain cautious about whether it has what it takes to hit the long-teased $1 mark. While the memecoin is getting fresh attention, especially from large holders, its long-term trajectory is still up for debate. On May 1, crypto analyst Ali Martinez flagged a surge in whale activity, with wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million DOGE snapping up 100 million tokens in one week. That kind of accumulation has historically preceded massive moves, and retail traders are beginning to take note. Technical analysts are seeing early signs of a trend reversal. Cryptokijker recently spotted a hidden bullish divergence in the RSI, signaling that strength may be building beneath the surface. DOGE also climbed above its previous day low, a quiet but notable indicator that sentiment is shifting. Short-term breakout targets for the Dogecoin price sit at $0.1840 and $0.1920, while support holds near $0.1760. If volume continues to rise, many believe DOGE may be entering a markup phase, slowly edging closer to the $1 dream.

Remittix: The rising altcoin in cross-border payments While Dogecoin rides the waves of speculation, Remittix is turning heads for a different reason: real utility and a hot presale. Early investors can buy RTX for $0.0757 now, and if history tells us anything, presales like this can lead to massive returns once listings go live. Remittix is joining the $750 billion remittance industry by fusing blockchain speed with fiat convenience. Users can send funds in over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, and have them instantly converted into local fiat currencies like USD and EUR. This makes it a faster, cheaper, and more reliable alternative to systems like SWIFT. But it’s not just fast, it’s secure, too. The Remittix smart contracts have passed audits by SolidProof and BlockSAFU, and both the liquidity pool and team tokens are locked for three years. This kind of transparency is rare, especially in early-stage projects, significantly reducing the risk of sudden sell-offs. With a solid use case, strong security, and early-bird pricing, Remittix might challenge altcoins like Dogecoin with momentum and real-world impact. Conclusion Dogecoin’s hype-driven price action may see some upside, but its long-term potential remains uncertain. On the other hand, Remittix is focused on transforming global payments with its blend of crypto and fiat. Currently in its presale at $0.0757, it offers real utility that could shake the cross-border payments market. With strong security, transparency, and a massive upside potential, Remittix is positioning itself as a serious player. For more information on Remittix, visit the website or socials .

Solana astounds with its exponential rise while XRP remains a cornerstone in cross-border payment, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the one picking up speed. With its presale price still hovering at a low $0.025, analysts are projecting that MUTM could deliver returns that far outpace what Solana and XRP achieved in their prime. If 2025 is set to be the year of DeFi innovation, then Mutuum Finance might just be the rocket that accelerates past its more established rivals. Presale Gets Seriously Underway Mutuum Finance is deep into Phase 4 of its presale and selling tokens for a low $0.025. The project has already reached more than $7.5 million in funds from more than 9,400 early investors to date, a strong sign of ever-growing confident markets. But time’s running out: Phase 4 is more than 50% sold, and when it’s full, the token price will increase 20% in Phase 5. With a planned launch price of $0.06, current buyers might save a 140% profit before the token even reaches exchanges. Mutuum created a token giveaway worth $100,000 to boost participation by distributing $10,000 MUTM tokens to the 10 winners. The platform recently introduced a new dashboard that features a leaderboard to display the top 50 token holders among the community members. A New Standard in DeFi Lending So what makes Mutuum stand out in a fast-filled DeFi ecosystem? It’s the platform’s new dual-model crypto lending mechanism, which combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. Decentralization reaches its highest point in P2P lending which enables borrowers and lenders to bypass traditional intermediaries during their transactions. Users benefit from negotiating customized loan arrangements through the system to achieve lending transactions that are personalized and transparent and flexible. This two-lending system gives Mutuum Finance an edge by offering both passive income opportunities and fully decentralized financial interaction, of interest to a wide user base. Issuing a USD-Backed Stablecoin The Mutuum Finance platform is preparing to introduce its own Ethereum-based USD-backed stablecoin as its next innovation in addition to its lending features. The asset-backed method of Mutuum creates stable value that can stand as an alternative to the prediction of algorithmic stablecoins’ volatile price fluctuations and devaluation. Security is a second key pillar of the project. Mutuum Finance has partnered with CertiK, one of the most prominent blockchain auditing firms, to conduct a thorough audit on its smart contract platform. Once the audit process is finished, the team plans to release it publicly on their social media channels to further establish transparency and trust in the community. Creating a Strong Community through Rewards Mutuum’s Finance community is seriously embracing community growth. In addition to the $100K giveaway the platform has added a referral program with incentives for users who bring in others. Early joiners also get priority access to platform updates which helps spur ongoing engagement and stickiness as the ecosystem scales. Final Thoughts: The Clock Is Ticking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly outshining Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) with over $7.5 million raised and 9,400+ investors onboard in its presale. Still in Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025 set to rise 20% in Phase 5 and hit $0.06 at launch—offering a potential 140% ROI. Backed by CertiK, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a dual lending model, MUTM blends innovation with security. The $100K giveaway and leaderboard rewards only add to the buzz. Phase 4 is almost gone, lock in your tokens now before the next price jump.

Drawing on Bitcoin’s minimalist design principles, Buterin published a blog post titled “Simplifying the L1” on May 3, outlining a path to reduce the network’s technical complexity. Buterin’s vision targets Ethereum’s core layers—consensus, execution, and shared components—with a strategy to streamline processes that have grown increasingly convoluted since the network’s inception. Ethereum’s Complexity Is Slowing Progress and Raising Risks Buterin argued that unnecessary complexity has led to bloated development timelines, higher maintenance costs, and increased risks of bugs. A central element of Buterin’s proposal is a reimagining of the consensus layer through a model called “3-slot finality.” This approach would eliminate intricate mechanisms such as epochs, sync committees, and validator shuffling. By reducing the number of active validators at any given time, the protocol could adopt a simpler and safer fork choice rule, easing the development of light clients and reducing attack surfaces. The effort to revamp Ethereum's consensus, historically called the beam chain, includes many opportunities to simplify consensus, while also increasing efficiency and security. pic.twitter.com/MIRpsbe48h — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) May 3, 2025 On the execution side, Buterin proposed transitioning from the current Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a new, zero-knowledge (ZK)-friendly virtual machine based on the RISC-V architecture. RISC-V is a lightweight, open-source instruction set architecture known for its efficiency and simplicity. The move could accelerate ZK proof generation by up to 100x and make the protocol more auditable and developer-friendly. Buterin suggested maintaining backward compatibility during the transition by running legacy EVM contracts through a RISC-V interpreter. Buterin also called for protocol-wide standardization to minimize fragmentation. He recommended consolidating tools and formats—such as adopting a single erasure coding method, serialization format (SSZ), and tree structure—to reduce redundant systems and enhance developer tooling. “Simplicity is in many ways similar to decentralization,” Buterin noted, proposing that Ethereum adopt a “max line-of-code” principle for consensus-critical logic, much like the lightweight machine learning project Tinygrad. Under this approach, non-critical or legacy features would still be supported but moved outside the core specification. Ethereum Has ‘Huge Opportunity’ to Fix AI’s Centralization Problem Ethereum could play a key role in solving some of the most pressing problems facing artificial intelligence, according to Eric Connor, a former core developer of the blockchain. Earlier this month, Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues. Last month, crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures pointed to two key issues undermining Ether’s value: the rise of layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and unchecked token issuance. He argued that “greedy Eth L2s” are siphoning off value from Ethereum’s base layer while giving little back. He also criticized the Ethereum community’s acceptance of excessive token creation, claiming that “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” The post Vitalik Buterin Calls to Simplify Ethereum Protocol with New Design appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-04 16:00:00

XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Kaspa (KAS) , Injective (INJ) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Solana (SOL) are leading watchlists with rising momentum, while one lesser-known project— MAGACOINFINANCE —is quietly positioning itself as a standout early-stage opportunity with lasting potential. MAGACOINFINANCE – A Rising Star Among Early-Stage Contenders While most of the market chases headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is executing a quieter—but more strategic—rise. With over $7.8 million raised and growing community strength, the project is now making its way into more watchlists and early mover portfolios. What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart is its consistent delivery, message clarity, and rising traction without relying on gimmicks. The pre-sale listing is approaching, and those who enter now are positioning at a pivotal moment before broader exposure arrives. Bitcoin and Ethereum Anchor the Recovery Bitcoin (BTC) is showing strength above $95,000 , buoyed by growing institutional demand and a bullish ETF landscape. With forecasts pointing toward $132,000 in the coming weeks, BTC remains the cornerstone for serious capital inflow in this cycle. Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade near $1,830 , showing firm technical resilience. Whales are accumulating, transaction fees are decreasing, and AI-related project adoption is on the rise. Analysts suggest ETH could soon challenge the $2,500–$2,700 range in May. XRP, Solana, Kaspa, and Injective Push Higher XRP is priced around $2.15 , gaining traction from the recent approval of XRP futures ETFs. The next technical hurdle is the $2.45 resistance level, with breakout potential inviting significant institutional volume. Solana (SOL) is holding firm near $150 , fresh off an impressive 41% gain in April . With the recent approval of a Canadian spot ETF and renewed developer activity, SOL is seen as one of the top Layer-1 assets to watch this quarter. Kaspa (KAS) continues its slow and steady climb, maintaining support around $0.10 . Its unique blockDAG structure and increasing adoption have bulls watching for a breakout toward $0.30+ . Injective (INJ) is priced near $35 and continues to be a strong infrastructure token in DeFi. Though it hasn’t made recent headlines, long-term fundamentals and developer traction remain intact. Final Thoughts May 2025 is shaping up to be a defining month. While blue-chip tokens like Bitcoin , XRP , Solana , and Ethereum gather strength, MAGACOINFINANCE is building real momentum beneath the surface. For investors seeking both credibility and high-upside positioning, the opportunity is here—and the timing has never been more critical.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency slipped by 0.52% over the past 24 hours, but it remains up 1.71% for the week. A recent high of $97,754 confirmed that bullish momentum hasn’t vanished entirely. Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is holding firm above the 50-period EMA ($94,971) and above the $94,872 support zone. This confluence of indicators forms a solid base, and any bounce from here could open the door to $96,782 and $97,329.

He’s asked the Dubai government to act promptly on the matter and stand against fraud and money laundering. He also urged the country’s regulators and banks to step up against financial crimes. Sun claimed that top executives at FDT, including CEO Vincent Chok, were involved in the fraud In an X post, Justin Sun named several individuals he believed were involved in the $500 million fraud case. They included Christian Alexander Boehnke, De Lorraine Elbouef, Vincent Chok, Yai Sukonthabhund, Matthew William Brittain, and Cecilia Teresa Brittain. He claimed they moved thousands of dollars through Hong Kong’s FDT and Legacy Trust into multiple Dubai banks, including Mashreq Bank, ADIB, Emirates NBD, and EFG. Most of the mentioned individuals held executive positions at FDT, like Vincent Chok who is, the CEO and director of FDT and Legacy Trust, and Yai Sukonthabhund, an investment manager and advisor of both companies. Sun has called on the Dubai government, regulators, and banks to act swiftly and decisively, stressing that Dubai must not become a safe haven for fraud and money laundering. He urged banks to conduct internal reviews, immediately freeze suspicious inflows, and proactively report them to authorities. He warned: “Do not become enablers of criminal activity. I remain confident that the authorities in Dubai and UAE will take firm action and stand with us in the global fight against financial crime.” Sun also targeted FDT in April, comparing its liquidity crash to FTX’s failure. He argued that the FDT scam was far worse because of the lack of loan collateral cover and customer consent, which made the fraud more direct. He also argued that, despite FTX mismanaging user funds, it maintained internal records that characterized the criminal activity as pledged loans. FTT, SRM, and MAPS were used as acceptable collateral for their illegal activity, contrary to FDT, which stole funds directly without user authorization and knowledge. Sun even argued that at least some of FTX’s funds went into investments in firms like Robinhood and Anthropic, while FDT moved funds into their private entities and none in investments. He even threw shade at FDT CEO Vincent Chok Zhuo for not being remorseful. He said the CEO had “no interest in accepting any responsibility or being accountable.” Additionally, he asked the Hong Kong government to respond quickly like its US counterparts did when dealing with the FTX collapse. Moreover, he met with Hong Kong lawmaker Johnny Wu to discuss possible regulatory action. Sun launched a bounty initiative and website to support investigations Sun has launched a $50 million reward program to help the ongoing investigation. He even had a website to reveal the alleged scheme. FDT, however, has said Sun’s allegations were unfounded and has subsequently sued him for slander. Sun’s claim has also appeared to garner some interest from lawmakers. Hong Kong regulators recently began taking a closer look at local trust companies. In the meantime, the market cap for FDT’s stablecoin, FDUSD, has fallen from over $2.5 billion to about $1.4 billion.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating a splash currently by providing a new path towards decentralized finance. Currently at $0.025, MUTM is already at Phase 4 of its presale and will continue to grow to $0.03 in Phase 5. Experts predict that MUTM will hit $6 as early as mid-2025, an astronomical 24,000% rise from its current level. This translates to a $1,000 investment today potentially climbing to $240,000, surpassing DOGE’s iconic surge. While the cryptocurrency market is unsteady, MUTM’s unique value proposition coupled with growing interest from investors translates to it perhaps being poised for liftoff.​ Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction with Growing Investor Interest Mutuum Finance is deep into Phase 4 of its presale and selling tokens for a low $0.025. The project has already reached more than $7.5 million in funds from more than 9,400 early investors to date, a strong sign of ever-growing confident markets. But time’s running out: Phase 4 is more than 50% sold, and when it’s full, the token price will increase 20% in Phase 5. With a planned launch price of $0.06, current buyers might save a potential 140% profit before the token even reaches exchanges. Unlike tokens that depend on hype and social media trends, Mutuum Finance is built on tangible utility. The platform’s innovative dual lending model, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) protocols, has garnered significant attention in the decentralized finance (DeFi) community. The P2C model allows users to earn passive income by providing liquidity to smart contract-based pools. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates intermediaries, enabling direct transactions between borrowers and lenders for greater efficiency and privacy. This hybrid approach offers a secure, flexible, and profitable platform that appeals to both conservative investors seeking stable returns and those looking for higher yields. Stability in a Volatile Market Mutuum Finance provides market stability in a volatile industry which makes it stand apart from traditional market players. The Ethereum blockchain hosts a stablecoin which receives full collateral through USD reserves to maintain stability. Project stability depends on over-collateralization because it provides protection from algorithmic stablecoin risks while ensuring trust through its design approach. Open-source smart contracts together with regular third-party audits provide both security and transparency which solves vulnerability issues across multiple other DeFi projects. Community Rewards and Incentives The growing community of Mutuum Finance receives multiple incentives through their reward programs. Mutuum Finance established a $100,000 prize distribution that grants $10,000 MUTM tokens to each of its ten winners. Users can receive rewards through a referral program that offers benefits for recruiting new investors to join the platform. Live leaderboard technology displays positions of the top 50 token holders and gives bonus token rewards to participants who succeed in keeping their rankings. The ranks-based program combined with rewards mechanisms shape an interactive network which honors continuous member dedication through its gameplay elements. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to potentially deliver returns rivaling Dogecoin’s 2021 surge. With its Phase 4 presale already raising $7.5 million from over 9,400 investors, the token’s current price of $0.025 could skyrocket to $6 by mid-2025, offering a 24,000% return. The platform’s unique dual lending model and USD-backed stablecoin provide real value beyond hype. Time is running out, Phase 4 is over 50% sold, and prices are set to rise. Don’t miss out on securing your position before the next price jump.

According to a report shared by Crypto Beast on X, the move explicitly targets tokens such as Monero ($XMR) and services like Tornado Cash, marking a decisive step in France’s intensifying regulatory stance on digital assets. BREAKING It’s official, privacy coins like $XMR (monero) or platforms like tornado cash are now ILLEGAL in france. pic.twitter.com/mWPEfAGekj — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) May 4, 2025 The End of Anonymity: France’s Regulatory Shift Privacy coins have long posed a unique challenge to regulators due to their ability to obscure transaction data and user identities—features that appeal to privacy advocates but raise concerns among law enforcement and financial oversight bodies. France’s latest decision is aimed squarely at curbing these concerns, effectively outlawing the use, trade, and facilitation of cryptocurrencies and platforms designed to mask financial flows. Monero, one of the most prominent privacy coins, utilizes ring signatures and stealth addresses to shield transaction origins, amounts, and recipients. Tornado Cash, meanwhile, is an Ethereum-based protocol that allows users to mix tokens to break transactional links, further enhancing anonymity. Both have come under heavy scrutiny in recent years, and France’s move echoes growing global sentiment that such privacy-enabling tools conflict with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) frameworks. Legislative Justification and Market Implications The French government’s decision is understood to be driven by a desire to align more closely with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines, which recommend strict oversight of virtual assets that impede traceability. French lawmakers have argued that total anonymity in financial transactions poses an unmanageable risk in combating illicit finance, tax evasion, and cybercrime. The ban places France among the most restrictive European jurisdictions regarding privacy-enhancing crypto technologies, potentially pressuring other EU member states to adopt similar policies as the bloc finalizes its MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulatory framework. This could significantly hinder the adoption and utility of privacy coins within regulated financial environments. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Global Context and Future Ramifications France’s prohibition follows earlier moves by U.S. authorities, who sanctioned Tornado Cash in 2022 over allegations that it had facilitated billions in money laundering activities, including for state-sponsored hacking groups like North Korea’s Lazarus Group. With France now joining the list of nations outlawing such platforms, a wider international crackdown could be imminent. For privacy-focused crypto developers and advocates, the challenge moving forward will be navigating a world increasingly hostile to anonymity. While privacy remains a fundamental tenet for many in the blockchain space, regulatory tolerance for untraceable digital transactions is waning rapidly. As Crypto Beast noted in their post, the ban is now official. For privacy coins and protocols, the clock may be ticking—not just in France, but globally—as regulators intensify efforts to bring every corner of the digital asset landscape under watchful scrutiny.

Everyone’s talking crypto in 2025, but only a few tokens are actually doing the work, building tech, launching products, or giving early investors a real head start. A new wave of networks is gaining traction, some riding strong momentum from last year, while others are just starting to break out with exciting use cases, price jumps, and serious buying incentives. The market today isn’t just noise, it’s about which projects are showing real growth through smart updates, key partnerships, and rising demand. This article spotlights the crypto top gainers for 2025 making headlines for the right reasons. BlockDAG leads the charge with a bold pricing model, explosive presale results, and daily buyer battles. Right behind it are Aptos, Cardano, Cosmos, and Tezos, each rolling out updates that could reshape their entire year. Whether you’re chasing adoption, transaction power, or the benefits of getting in early, these five projects demand your attention. It’s no longer about who did well last cycle, it’s about who’s next. 1. BlockDAG: Price Drop, Buyer Contests, & Viral Referrals Fuel Growth BlockDAG is pushing harder than anyone else right now. Its special offer of $0.0019 has reignited buyer interest, driving the presale past $225 million and pushing BDAG sales to 19.6 billion coins. This price window closes on May 13, giving buyers limited time before listings start at $0.05. That spread alone offers early participants an estimated 2,500% return, and that’s before referral perks kick in. Buyers using a referral link get 5% more BDAG, while referrers enjoy a massive 25%, sparking massive sharing across social media. Adding to the rush are BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles, which bring a game-like twist to the presale. Each day, 25 million BDAG is up for grabs, and if there are leftover tokens, they go straight to that day’s highest buyer. With its beta testnet now live and pushing 800+ transactions per second, and with 10 exchange listings lined up, the project is moving fast. Over 1 million users from its X1 mobile mining app are already on board. BlockDAG isn’t just a presale, it’s one of the crypto top gainers for 2025 with actual speed and scale already showing. 2. Aptos: Major Expo Deal Pushes Price & User Surge Aptos is landing real-world deals fast, and the Expo 2025 partnership is its biggest win yet. As the official digital wallet for the Osaka World Expo, Aptos has already cleared 550,000+ transactions and added 130,000 new users. That kind of action has kept its price steady at $5.40, with analysts eyeing a jump to $14 by year-end. These price targets are backed by data, 2.7 billion total transactions, 18 million monthly users, and strong validator support. What makes Aptos a strong pick among crypto top gainers for 2025 is this blend of utility and exposure. While other projects are stuck in testnet tweaks, Aptos is making waves with live adoption. Developer growth on Move is rising, and the network’s metrics keep improving. It might not be the cheapest on this list, but Aptos is earning its momentum through solid fundamentals. 3. Cosmos: Cross-Chain Strength Still Flying Under the Radar Cosmos isn’t making noise for the sake of it, but its work on cross-chain functionality keeps paying off. Its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol remains the leader in blockchain interoperability, and more projects are joining the Cosmos family. ATOM trades around $4.32, and 2025 forecasts put it between $6.10 and $6.46 if network activity climbs in the coming months. What keeps Cosmos in the crypto top gainers for 2025 club is its powerful ecosystem and ongoing improvements. The Cosmos SDK supports app-specific chains that scale better, and developers continue to prefer it for building efficient networks. With DeFi tools, gaming apps, and privacy tech all tapping into the Cosmos Hub, ATOM keeps gaining real value. For anyone banking on cross-chain systems and long-term use, Cosmos is still a serious contender. 4. Cardano: Big Whale Moves & Price Pressure Mount Cardano is making a quiet but strong return, holding above $0.70 after jumping 14% this week, with some predicting it could hit $1 soon. Whale wallets added over 420 million ADA in April, a powerful vote of confidence while prices tighten. The network now supports 1,990 live projects, over 130,000 smart contracts, and 108 million transactions. These numbers tell a solid story, even if the price hasn’t fully caught up yet. Cardano stays among the crypto top gainers for 2025 because it builds slowly but surely. There’s no over-the-top hype, it’s about expanding its developer base and keeping its stake decentralization strong. If ADA breaks past $0.74 resistance, analysts believe momentum could spike. A single trigger, like a major dApp launch or big CEX listing, could light a fire under ADA’s recovery potential. 5. Tezos: Speed Upgrades & New Projects Spark Fresh Interest Tezos has stayed heads-down, building faster performance and lower costs, and its Quebec upgrade proves it. With 8-second block times, quicker finality, and smoother staking, the chain’s metrics are sharper than ever. XTZ trades around $0.55, with targets of $1.73 by year-end and potential highs of $4.66 by 2028 if adoption holds. Beyond the tech, Tezos is seeing new attention from fresh apps like “Stables,” a fantasy racing platform now rolling out in North America. More games, DeFi tools, and marketplaces are in development. Tezos might not trend like meme tokens, but in terms of consistent upgrades and protocol reliability, it’s among the crypto top gainers for 2025 with actual results to show. Identifying the Crypto Top Gainer in 2025 The gap is widening between coins that make noise and networks that deliver results. BlockDAG’s presale discount, reward system, and referral payouts have made it a leader, especially with a $0.05 listing just ahead. Meanwhile, Aptos is showing how real partnerships drive adoption, and Cardano’s whale moves hint at something brewing. Cosmos is still the go-to for chain connectivity, and Tezos is delivering upgrades with precision. If you’re serious about crypto in 2025, keeping an eye on these crypto top gainers for 2025 is more than just smart, it’s necessary. Whether you want fast ROI like BlockDAG offers, or long-term tech plays like Cosmos and Cardano, these five projects are shaping up to lead the next wave.

But it was down even more, by -38%, over the 1-year view. That could be a buying opportunity for cryptocurrency investors and altcoin traders to scoop some Ether tokens at a discount. In fact, one popular Crypto X analyst recently pointed out that Ethereum’s price chart exhibits a potential bullish breakout up ahead. Crypto Analyst Checks Ethereum Price Falling Wedge MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe wrote in an update on Wednesday, Apr. 30: “$ETH is consolidating before a big breakout upwards. The liquidity is up for grabs, it just needs a news related item to kick it off.” $ETH is consolidating before a big breakout upwards. The liquidity is up for grabs, it just needs a news related item to kick it off. pic.twitter.com/VQaGvfZcA0 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 30, 2025 De Poppe then shared a TradingView screen grab of descending wedge lines with steeper lines of resistance and flattening lines of support. This is a classic chart indicator of a bullish reversal from a downward trend. It is an especially suggestive indicator in this case because it has the textbook declining daily trade volume as the trend lines converge. Vitalik Buterin New Ethereum Roadmap for 2025 One commentator replied to van de Poppe: “Yeah that ETH chart’s wound tighter than a drum rn. Consolidation screams pre-breakout vibes. Just need that catalyst like you said. What kinda news are we realistically looking for tho?” Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s new 2025 roadmap for the cryptocurrency may pull its community back together. The number two ranked cryptocurrency by total market cap has been in a price doldrums on Bitcoin’s current multi-month upswing. But that doesn’t mean it’s all over for Ethereum yet. The leading smart contract altcoin has seen price growth deflate while several L2s grew vastly in market cap since the Dencun Upgrade in Mar. 2024. These Layer 2 zip file style solutions to speeding up Ethereum have been making most of the percentage gains because that’s what the new incentive structure rewards. The same day as his Ethereum falling wedge update, van de Poppe reminded followers the extreme bearish sentiment on many altcoins at the moment is a window of opportunity to capture ROI when the market turns again. The next leg upwards is on the horizon for the #Crypto markets. The bearish sentiment remains extreme on #Altcoins and that’s an ideal ingredient for the next leg up. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 30, 2025 The post Crypto X Analyst Spots ‘Big Breakout’ for Ethereum appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-05-04 16:36:11

Since 1964, Berkshire Hathaway has returned 5.5 million percent, dwarfing the S&P 500’s return of roughly 39,000 percent over the same period. If someone dropped $10,000 into Berkshire six decades ago, they’d be sitting on $550 million right now. The S&P 500 couldn’t keep up even if it grew legs. Warren beat it by 140 times. The numbers were on everyone’s mind this weekend at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where thousands of shareholders gathered without knowing they were walking into a bombshell. Warren, now 94, said he plans to step down by the end of the year, a move no one at the arena expected. The man who turned a dying textile company into a $1.2 trillion beast said this would be his final run as CEO. Buffett shocks crowd with exit plan after 60-year run “I’m stunned,” said Jim Ross, a shareholder and bookstore manager who lives just four doors down from Warren’s house in the Dundee–Happy Hollow neighborhood of Omaha. The shock hit hard because Warren had only informed two of his kids, both on Berkshire’s board, before making the announcement. Everyone else, including the rest of the board, heard it live. Warren ended the hours-long Q&A by telling the crowd that he’d ask the board to approve the transition during their Sunday meeting. He confirmed that Greg Abel, who runs Berkshire’s energy division, will take over the CEO role. “I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” Warren said. He also made it clear he’s not selling any of his Berkshire stock and will stay connected to the company in some way. If the board gives it the green light, Warren’s departure would close out a 60-year run in charge of the company. This year’s event was already shaping up to be different. There was no intro video, and Warren’s Q&A session was shorter, with quicker breaks between segments. Berkshire auctioned off signed copies of a new book about the company’s history, with all proceeds going to a homeless charity in South Omaha. Grant Macklem, a software engineer from Colorado Springs, flew in because he wanted to see Warren one last time as CEO. He’s been holding Berkshire shares for 15 years and said, “We could kind of see it coming someday, just, I didn’t expect it this year.” Grant said he thought about buying more stock before the meeting but didn’t get around to it. Now he’s considering grabbing some if the price drops. Shares had just hit an all-time high on Friday. Others who’ve followed the company closely weren’t as surprised. David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland, said Warren walking with a cane and his 2024 letter where he hinted that Abel might soon write the shareholder memo made the writing on the wall obvious. “The announcement memorializes some of what we already knew,” said Bill Stone, CIO at Glenview Trust Company. “Greg has effectively been running the operating businesses day to day. But he will also now take over capital allocation decisions.” The company has changed since Charlie Munger, Warren’s longtime friend and business partner, died in 2023. For fund managers, succession has been the big question. “Berkshire is no longer a stock picker with great cash flow. Now a group of well-known businesses with cash to reinvest,” said Bill Smead, CIO at Smead Capital Management. “Losing Charlie and age have ended the era for Warren.” The crowd in Omaha made it clear how much he still means to them. Many had lined up in the early morning just to be in the room. After Warren’s announcement, the arena rose to its feet in applause. People wore t-shirts and hoodies with his face on them.

With Cardano (ADA) trading at $0.52, Ethereum (ETH) at $1,490, Solana (SOL) at $100, and Rexas Finance (RXS) at $0.20, speculation is rife on where these assets might move over the next three months. Based on project foundations, present market patterns, and possible catalysts, this forecast is a comprehensive view of what these four cryptocurrencies might have ahead. Rexas Finance (RXS): The RWA Asset With Explosive Potential Given the global real estate market's valuation at around $280 trillion, Rexas Finance offers a revolutionary approach to liquidity. Tokenizing real estate lets investors quickly purchase and sell property shares, making the market more accessible. Rexas Finance promises security, openness, and rapid settlements using its blockchain-powered ecosystem. Eliminating intermediaries helps the platform accelerate real estate investments globally and lower transaction costs. With over 459.8 million Rexas Finance tokens sold, the presale has attracted an enormous rush from investors. This great demand points to early buyers setting themselves up for significant rewards once the cryptocurrency formally starts trading. With 91.98% of the tokens already bought, the last presale stage is fast running out of supply. Investors trying to guarantee RXS at the presale price of $0.20 have limited time before the chance expires as availability gets tighter. At $0.20, Rexas Finance is a less-known but up-and-coming rival. RXS has created excitement with excellent presale performance and a convincing use case by emphasizing tokenizing real-world assets- a market under development. With a startling 4900–7400% increase over the next three months, RXS might experience explosive expansion and reach $10–$15. This estimate captures early-stage momentum and the attraction of linking tangible assets with blockchain. Cardano (ADA): Steady Growth on the Horizon With its research-driven approach, Cardano—currently costing $0.52—has long been a darling among developers and long-term investors. Supported by continuous improvements like the Leios update, which seeks to improve scalability and transaction throughput, the blockchain is expected to have a modest expansion in the following months. Should favorable market conditions remain, ADA may rise to $0.70–$0.80, reflecting a 35–55% increase. This hope depends on increased interest in its ecosystem and effective implementation of scheduled upgrades. Meanwhile, faster platforms like Solana pose fierce competition for Cardano, and its slower DeFi acceptance could restrict advances. Under more cautious conditions, ADA might hover around $0.60, indicating slight improvement without a significant breakout. Ethereum (ETH): The Stalwart’s Next Move Still the pillar of decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract innovation, Ethereum is trading at $1,490 as of this writing. Its leadership and rising institutional acceptance—shown by spot ETF interest—position it for a strong run over the next three months. Driven by possible network enhancements and a more general market boom, analysts predict ETH could climb to $1,800–$2,000, a 20–35% gain. ETH might even test higher should macroeconomic tailwinds grow or gas prices rise. Conversely, a bearish shift brought on by a growing risk-off attitude or interest rates may see it drop to $1,300. Ethereum is a safer option among the four because of its durability; its upward potential may not be as dramatic as that of more recent arrivals. Solana (SOL): Speed and Stability in Focus Solana is a go-to for DeFi and NFT projects since, at $100 as of writing, its fast blockchain continues to wow. Designed to solve prior network problems, the forthcoming Firedancer update might be a game-changer, increasing investor trust. Solana might explode to $130–$150 by July 2025—a 30–50% increase—if she takes advantage of this and breaks a significant barrier around $110. A return in distributed application use could propel this climb even further. Still, there are residual questions over network dependability, and a failure to live up to promised enhancements might put SOL in a more conservative perspective at $115–$120. Solana's course will mostly rely on execution and market momentum. Conclusion Driven by its cheap starting price and unique specialty in asset tokenization, RXS stands out among the four cryptocurrencies for possible significant gains. With their established ecosystems, Ethereum and Solana provide more consistent expansion and attract people looking for security with an upside. Although Cardano shows promise, it could lag until its rated development quickens. These projections assume a steady or positive market; any significant downturn—such as a legislative crackdown or economic crisis—may destroy even the most hopeful predictions. Investors should approach the crypto market carefully, as always, weighing opportunity with the constantly existing risk.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP may struggle to reach $3 this May, but analysts are betting big on it and rising rival Remittix hitting $10 by 2026. Table of Contents XRP price rise: Will $10 by 2026 become a reality? Remittix: The altcoin set to rock cross-border payments Conclusion XRP has been making some steady moves, but hitting $3 this May seems a bit of a stretch. While there’s definitely some hype around a potential XRP ETF approval and increasing whale activity, it’s facing some pretty tough resistance in the market right now. Nonetheless, analysts are still feeling optimistic about its future, with forecasts pointing to a potential $10 by 2026. Remittix has also been gaining significant traction. With its presale ongoing at $0.0757, this Ethereum-based platform is changing the game for cross-border payments. Investors getting in early also have a chance to see significant upside. XRP price rise: Will $10 by 2026 become a reality? XRP has been stuck around the $2.20 mark, with a bit of resistance at $2.40, making a jump to $3 a little tricky for now. But if it can break through that resistance, things could start to move. The charts are showing some bullish signs, and the market is feeling more stable. That said, some of the short-term excitement has cooled off because of ETF delays and ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Still, analysts are pretty optimistic about the long run, with Standard Chartered saying XRP could hit $10 by 2026. They see the possibility of up to $8.3 billion in ETF inflows, which would give XRP a significant boost. If XRP keeps up a steady 10% growth each month, hitting $10 by 2026 looks pretty realistic. There’s also a pattern showing that the XRP price could see a 70% rally, potentially pushing it closer to $3.78. Plus, with big investors buying up more, there’s some solid demand behind it. While $3 might take a little longer, the long-term future for XRP still looks promising.

With the flexibility of smart contracts and easy integration for dApps and payment gateways, Remittix is poised to be the next big thing in global finance, offering a more efficient and user-friendly alternative to XRP. Conclusion While XRP’s future remains promising, Remittix is quickly emerging as a game-changer in cross-border payments. With its lower fees, faster settlements, and blockchain transparency, Remittix is setting the stage to dominate the $250 trillion market.

With the broader market showing signs of recovery, savvy investors are looking for high-upside opportunities that are still flying under the radar. Fortunately, you don’t need a fortune to invest. Several bullish projects are trading below $0.30 right now and showing strong signs of breaking out. You can’t miss these tokens as they present today's best investment opportunities. Below are the four must-buys. Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance is gaining momentum as investors have been stacking up their portfolios while the token is still cheap. After seeing success in other stages, RXS will sell at $0.20 in its final presale stage. RXS has already delivered early investors a 566% return from its starting price of just $0.03. But even with this massive gain, many believe the actual rally is only getting started. With a planned listing price of $0.25 and its official launch set for June 19, analysts predict that RXS could soar once it hits major exchanges. Its strong use case makes Rexas Finance a top contender among cheap altcoins. The project focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a fast-growing sector expected to reach a $16 trillion market cap by 2030. Rexas Finance aims to redefine finance using tokenization. This tool turns RWAs into tradable digital tokens, removing key problems like high cost and illiquidity. This opens up investment opportunities that were once only available to the wealthy or institutional players. Rexas has also built a complete ecosystem around its mission. It offers tools like the Rexas Token Builder, allowing anyone to create and deploy tokens without coding knowledge. The QuickMint Bot lets users tokenize assets directly from Telegram or Discord, making it easy and fast. Then there's Rexas Estate, a marketplace for fractional real estate investments. These features contribute to the RXS token's real utility and drive long-term value. The presale has raised nearly $48 million so far, showing strong investor confidence even before its official launch. Rexas Finance has a real product, a growing ecosystem, and a clear roadmap. Hence, it’s a rare find at this price point. With weeks before the launch, RXS could witness a massive rally as demand surges. If momentum holds, the token could be a life-changing pick. Dogecoin (DOGE) DOGE is down over 50% from its recent high, but analysts are still optimistic. Top analysts like Kevin still see a massive upside if broader market conditions stabilize. He believes DOGE must hold above $0.139 to keep its bullish setup intact, calling it the “last line of bull market support.” Dogecoin is currently retesting key technical levels while high-timeframe indicators are reset, often a sign of an upcoming bounce. Daily trading volume has plunged 90% since November 2024, hovering under $5 billion. This shows that interest is low but also suggests a prime accumulation zone. If global liquidity improves and Bitcoin holds above $70,000, DOGE could stage a comeback. Some analysts even see a $2.1 price target, hinting at a 1,500% surge. For under $0.30, DOGE remains one of the boldest, cheapest altcoin bets today. Hedera (HBAR) The HBAR Foundation's cooperation with Zoop to acquire TikHub's U.S. businesses has lately drawn more investor interest. This calculated action seeks to build a platform whereby artists and their communities directly gain from the value they create. Following this news, the long/short ratio of HBAR reached a monthly peak at 1.08. This rise in long positions indicates confidence in the altcoin's future success. Currently, HBAR faces key resistance levels at $0.165 and $0.197. If it breaks past these barriers, it can move toward $0.20. However, it must hold support above $0.15 to prevent a drop toward $0.134. Given these developments, HBAR sounds interesting and is a coin not to miss. Pepe Coin (PEPE) PEPE has lately drawn interest because of strong whale activity and interesting technical indicators. A whale recently withdrew 500 billion PEPE tokens from Binance, inspiring investor confidence. If PEPE can overcome the critical resistance level, analysts estimate it will rally to $0.00012. For investors, this presents significant rewards. Thus, given its low price point and recent market swings, PEPE offers an interesting chance for people wishing to invest in reasonably priced altcoins. Conclusion Each of these four altcoins—Dogecoin, Hedera, Pepe Coin, and Rexas Finance—offers something different, but all share one thing: high upside potential at a low entry point. However, among them all, Rexas Finance stands out the most. RXS has already delivered a 566% return in presale, and the upcoming exchange launch on June 19 could trigger even bigger gains. With a $0.20 price, real utility, and momentum, Rexas Finance may be the best bet in 2025.

To this end, FenzoFxBroker analysis indicated that for the asset to reclaim $2.50, the resistance at $2.35 remains a key level to clear. In a TradingView post , the analysis suggested that a clear break above this barrier could pave the way for a push toward the psychologically significant $2.50 mark, an elusive level in recent trading sessions. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView XRP must hold above the $2.120 support zone to maintain its bullish bias. A failure to do so could signal weakness, potentially leading to a decline toward the $2.034 support. If this level is breached, further downside risk could extend to $1.924, marking a deeper retracement within the current trading range. XRP traders lean bullish Indeed, if on-chain data is any indication, XRP is likely to reclaim the $2.50 level, considering that most investors are leaning bullish. In this regard, data from Binance Futures shared on May 4 indicated that 71.54% of traders with open positions in XRP are betting on upward price movement. However, caution is warranted, as such an imbalance in positions could increase volatility, especially if the price moves against the crowded side. XRP long/short ratio. Source: Binance As things stand, XRP is trading in line with the broader cryptocurrency market , as the asset currently lacks key catalysts to support sustained price growth. Notably, investor optimism could rise if the case between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is concluded . Speculation persists that the legal drama may be nearing a resolution, with key Ripple officials reportedly meeting with the SEC. Additionally, developments around a potential XRP spot exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) approval in the U.S. could be a major catalyst. The SEC has delayed decisions on several applications, with the next announcements expected in June and mid-October this year. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.20, down about 0.6% in the last 24 hours. The asset is also red on the weekly chart, down 1.5%. The price has remained relatively stable despite releasing over one billion XRP from the Ripple escrow account. XRP seven-day price chart.

On-chain tracker Whale Alert confirmed the transaction, adding to growing excitement surrounding Ripple’s near-term outlook. Backing this optimism is data from Santiment, which shows whale wallets holding 10M–100M XRP accumulated over 200 million tokens in just one week. This type of accumulation, especially ahead of a potential market catalyst, often precedes strong upside moves. Contributing to the bullish sentiment is the anticipated launch of the ProShares XRP ETF, slated for May 14. According to Polymarket, the probability of ETF approval sits at 80%, adding institutional interest to the equation. Notably, 23% of U.S. crypto investors now hold XRP—further validating its rising popularity. Key takeaways: $64M XRP whale transfer detected heading to Coinbase 200M+ XRP added by large wallets in the last 7 days XRP ETF approval odds hit 80% ahead of May 14 decision XRP Holds Key Support, Eyes Breakout XRP is currently priced around $2.19 after briefly dipping to $2.15 earlier in the week. That drop led to nearly $14 million in long liquidations, suggesting a market shakeout rather than a structural breakdown. Price remains above the 20-day SMA at $2.167, which now acts as immediate support. XRP Holds Key Support, Eyes Breakout XRP trades near $2.19, holding above its 20-day SMA ($2.167) after $14M in long liquidations. A break above $2.208 could target $2.270 → $2.333. Drop below $2.169? Watch $2.068 next. #XRP #Crypto #Ripple #XRPPrice pic.twitter.com/VaGJbsmM2F — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) May 4, 2025 Technical analyst Javon Marks notes that shorter timeframes are flashing bullish signals. XRP is pushing against the upper boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern , with the 50-EMA ($2.208) acting as dynamic resistance. A breakout above $2.208 could quickly extend gains toward $2.270 and $2.333. Meanwhile, a decisive move below $2.169 might invalidate the bullish thesis and trigger a pullback toward $2.068 or even $1.993. Trade Setup: Entry: Breakout above $2.208 or breakdown below $2.169 Upside Target: $2.270 → $2.333 Downside Target: $2.068 → $1.993 Stop Loss: Slightly below trendline support or breakout wick Mixed Indicators Signal Patience Is Key; XRP Supported Despite the optimistic setup, indicators remain mixed. RSI currently hovers at 52.4—neutral, yet leaning positive. The average RSI at 54.0 adds slight bullish bias, but nothing definitive. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) reads -0.13, hinting at light capital outflows. However, it’s close enough to neutral that a shift into positive territory could amplify price action. Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating compression and an imminent breakout—direction still uncertain. In short, the setup is brewing, but confirmation is critical. With ETF news on the horizon and whale accumulation ramping up, XRP remains one of the most promising altcoins to watch this month. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.28M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) continues to gain traction, crossing $5.28 million in funds raised as it nears its $5.96 million presale cap.

The company's most recent acquisition occurred on April 28 when Strategy purchased 15,355 BTC, valued at over $1.4 billion at the time, bringing the company's total holdings to 553,555 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is up approximately 39% on its investment, representing over $15 billion in unrealized gains. Strategy’s history of Bitcoin acquisition. Source: SaylorTracker Bitcoin investors continue closely monitoring the company, which has been a major driver of direct institutional exposure to BTC by popularizing the Bitcoin corporate treasury concept and indirectly through institutions holding Strategy's stock in their investment portfolios. Related: Strategy ends April up 32% in best month since November as Q1 earnings loom Strategy misses Q1 analyst estimates but continues stacking Bitcoin Strategy fell short of analyst estimates for Q1 2025, reporting approximately $111 million in revenue, down by 3.6% from Q1 2024 and missing analyst expectations by 5%. However, the company also reported that it acquired 61,497 BTC so far in 2025 and also revealed plans to raise $21 billion through an equity offering to finance the purchase of more BTC. The quarter-by-quarter growth of Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury. Source: Strategy Asset manager Richard Byworth recently suggested that Strategy should acquire companies with ample cash reserves and convert those fiat cash reserves to Bitcoin for its treasury. Byworth added that Strategy could also purchase Bitcoin on the open market as exchange balances dwindle, rather than the over-the-counter (OTC) transactions between private parties that do not affect the market exchange price. Doing so would push prices higher, driving up the value of Strategy's Bitcoin reserves and acting as a catalyst attracting even more investors to BTC, the asset manager said. Strategy's effect on Bitcoin's price and Bitcoin adoption continues to draw intense discussion over the role of the company as it relates to market dynamics. Adam Livingston, a BTC analyst and author of ""The Bitcoin Age and The Great Harvest,"" recently argued that Strategy's demand for BTC is synthetically halving Bitcoin by outpacing the daily miner output. Livingston pointed out that Strategy's average daily rate of Bitcoin accumulation of roughly 2,087 BTC far outstrips the collective daily mined supply of around 450 BTC.

In a ruling from the Northern District of California, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers says that Apple willfully violated an injunction from its legal battle with video game developer Epic Games – the company behind Fortnite. In 2020, Apple banned Epic’s account from the App Store when the video game developer allowed users to go outside the Apple ecosystem to get better payment deals. Epic subsequently sued Apple, accusing the tech giant of anti-competitive behavior. Judge Rogers ruled in 2021 that Apple violated state law and ordered the tech giant to allow developers to direct users to other payment channels. Years later, however, the judge says that the company didn’t comply, and that “Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated.” “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the essence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously ordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins Apple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid compliance with the Injunction. Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users, nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.” The court order opens the door for digital assets to become an alternative means of payment for App Store users. Screenshots from Apple users on the social media platform X reportedly show an update clarifying that app developers are allowed to direct users to other payment methods, which may include crypto. Commenting on the update, economist Alex Krüger said it could be “huge.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The latest comment came during an interview taped in Florida with NBC News, which aired Sunday. When Kristen Welker asked if Powell would be removed before his term ends, Trump replied, “No, no, no. That was a total – why would I do that? I get to replace the person in another short period of time.” Trump also repeated his long-standing demand that the Fed slash rates, adding, “He should lower them. And at some point, he will. He’d rather not because he’s not a fan of mine. You know, he just doesn’t like me because I think he’s a total stiff.” Wall Street had already reacted badly last month after Trump ramped up his attacks on Powell, raising fears that the White House might interfere with the Federal Reserve’s independence. Markets plunged during that period, with volatility rising to levels not seen since the first months of the COVID pandemic in 2020. Trump’s new comments seem aimed at calming those fears, though he made it clear he still wants Powell to fall in line. Trump defends tariffs, blames Biden for weak GDP Trump also used the interview to defend his chaotic trade strategy and to dodge blame for the latest economic numbers. The US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, but Trump insisted that was Joe Biden’s fault. “It partially is right now,” Trump said when asked about taking responsibility. “And I really mean this. I think the good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy because he’s done a terrible job.” He went on to say that his administration brought down energy and gas prices, and began fixing the US trade deficit. He also dismissed concerns about rising prices caused by tariffs. He told NBC: “I’m just saying they don’t need to have 30 dolls. They can have three. They don’t need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.” Trump claimed Americans wouldn’t be hurt by the higher prices on imported goods, because they could simply buy less. On April 2, Trump launched a massive tariff campaign. He slapped a 10% tariff on most countries and raised rates for several trading partners. Some of those hikes were paused for 90 days, but others hit immediately. He imposed 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico, autos, steel, and aluminum. On China, the rate was set at 145%. That move essentially halted trade between the US and China, according to Trump. “We’ve gone cold turkey,” he said. “That means we’re not losing a trillion dollars … because we’re not doing business with them right now.” Trade deals incoming, tariffs may stay forever Trump told NBC that China now wants to come back to the table, though China has said many times the claims he’s making are nothing but lies. “They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal very badly,” he lied. As per usual, he didn’t say if talks had started, but warned that any deal would have to be “fair.” Trump also confirmed that his administration is in talks with more than 15 countries to create new trade agreements. One of those deals could be ready soon, he said, without giving a date. When asked if the tariffs could be lifted after those deals, Trump said maybe not. “No, I wouldn’t do that because if somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?” he asked. Trump claimed that trillions of dollars in foreign and domestic investment were already coming in because of the tariffs, and he didn’t want to lose that momentum.

As the crypto market gains momentum in 2025, more attention is turning to coins with major upside potential. Unstaked stands out with strong prospects and offers a unique chance ahead of its AI launch. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also in focus, showing signs of a 17x move based on a solid technical setup. Hedera (HBAR) continues to hold its ground with a price forecast that targets a resistance level of $0.25559. These three crypto coins each show signs of promise, but the key question remains: which one could deliver the biggest return? Each project brings something different to the table, so those looking for gains in 2025 will need to compare the data and choose wisely. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Forecast: 17x Growth Possible with Strong Chart Pattern Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains one of the most recognized crypto coins in the space. Recently, its chart pattern has caught attention from technical traders. SHIB is moving within a long-term symmetrical triangle, a pattern known to lead to strong breakouts when price compresses near the end. SHIB has respected the triangle’s support level with several bounces, showing the pattern is holding firm. If SHIB manages to move past the upper resistance line, the price could rise 17x, reaching a target of $0.00023. While this outlook may seem bold, symmetrical triangles often result in large moves, making this target a logical possibility. A breakout would open the door to strong gains for those entering at current levels. The monthly chart has recently flipped positive for SHIB, ending a streak of five months of red candles. This reversal adds strength to the bullish view. Shiba Inu’s future performance will still depend on the broader market, but the setup supports the idea that the SHIB price could rise in the near term. Hedera (HBAR) Outlook: Bullish Momentum Builds Toward $0.25559 Resistance Level Hedera (HBAR) is still viewed as a strong crypto project thanks to its hashgraph model, which is made to improve speed, security, and scaling compared to standard blockchains. The recent price action suggests Hedera (HBAR) may be entering a growth phase, supported by key technical signals. HBAR has climbed above a falling trend line, showing early signs of strength. If it stays above the support at $0.17551, more gains could follow. The next resistance level is at $0.25559, and many are watching to see if HBAR can break through this key level soon. The overall Hedera (HBAR) price outlook remains positive, although there is some concern that current momentum may slow. Stochastic indicators point to overbought levels, which could limit short-term progress. Unstaked’s Price Setup Points to Strong Growth Ahead While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Hedera (HBAR) show strong potential, Unstaked stands out with a clear opportunity. Now in stage 2 of its presale and priced at $0.0066, Unstaked could deliver a major return if it reaches its expected launch value of $0.1819. This gives early participants a rare chance to enter at a low price with meaningful upside. What makes Unstaked different is its use of AI-powered agents designed to help build decentralized communities on platforms like Telegram and X. Unlike typical meme coins or basic tokens, Unstaked combines AI with blockchain to offer practical value. These agents are planned to support community growth in a way that could help the ecosystem expand steadily after launch. Unstaked’s forward-looking structure separates it from projects that rely only on short-term trends. People interested in long-term AI-based solutions for crypto communities may see Unstaked as a leading choice. With the ai crypto presale underway, its unique model and growth plan make it a strong option for those aiming for solid returns in the future. Comparing Crypto Options with Growth in Focus In the end, the best crypto choice depends on personal goals. Unstaked brings high return potential backed by a tech-driven AI and community platform. For those who prefer utility and long-term plans, it stands out. Shiba Inu (SHIB), aiming for a 17x move, has moved beyond its meme start but still needs to maintain its current pace to succeed. At the same time, Hedera (HBAR) continues to serve enterprise goals but has to break the $0.25559 resistance level before it can climb further. Unstaked’s blend of blockchain and AI gives it strong growth tools and makes it scalable in a way others may not match. Each project has its strengths, but success will depend on research and understanding, as crypto markets can shift quickly.

If you’re scanning for the cryptos with most potential , now could be the time to spot them. Several high-utility projects are rolling out updates, launching new features, and offering limited-time incentives, all pointing toward future value that hasn’t fully surfaced yet. This isn’t about waiting and wishing. It’s about identifying projects that are actively building. Whether it’s a temporary price rollback, increased developer activity, or successful live testing, each coin on this list has shown visible signs of upward movement. Here are five you may want to keep on your radar. 1. BlockDAG’s Price Rollback & Competitive Buyer Battles Draws Attention BlockDAG is not riding trends, it’s setting them, through targeted upgrades and clear buyer incentives. The presale is currently priced at $0.0019, a rollback offer valid until May 13. This pricing brings back early-stage entry options, which are rare at this point in a project’s timeline. With more than $225 million raised and 19.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG has caught the attention of a growing global community. Its referral model offers 25% BDAG to the referrer and 5% to the buyer, adding a viral element that draws in thousands each week. But what’s really grabbing eyes is Buyer Battles, 25 million BDAG available every 24 hours, with any unsold portion going to the day’s top spender. On the development side, BlockDAG is gaining ground too. Its beta testnet is live and surpassing previous performance, clocking over 800 transactions per second. Security audits by CertiK and Halborn confirm its credibility. Its X1 Miner App already has over a million users mining via mobile, and hardware mining gear is on the way. With 10 confirmed CEX listings and a mainnet launch ahead, BlockDAG is ticking every box among the cryptos with most potential right now, combining community growth with working products and limited-supply urgency. 2. Render Network Evolves from GPU Renders to AI Compute Backbone Render has started expanding its scope beyond GPU rendering, stepping into AI and general compute services. With the approval of RNP-019, Render now supports decentralized compute for AI and other complex workloads. This comes at a time when demand for decentralized AI processing is gaining serious ground. RenderCon 2025, held in Hollywood on April 15, helped solidify its reputation across media, AI, and Web3 sectors. Priced at $4.52, RNDR has short-term forecasts up to $6.56 and long-range estimates as high as $18.53. These projections are backed by actual growth in utility. As more AI models demand GPU compute and decentralized setups, Render is offering a timely solution. Expanding from 3D rendering into AI inference has opened doors to a much broader user base. It’s this strategic shift that makes Render one of the cryptos with most potential in today’s evolving blockchain landscape. 3. NEAR Protocol Bets Big on AI and Multi-Chain Interactions NEAR Protocol is evolving into a hub for AI-native applications, and its recent features show why it’s gaining traction. With Chain Signatures now live, smart contracts on NEAR can sign transactions on other chains, making cross-network AI interaction possible. Add to that the “Intents” system, which automates how apps manage user activity across blockchains, and NEAR starts looking like a natural fit for the future of AI in crypto. As of May 1, NEAR trades near $2.50, with projections from CoinCodex and Changelly placing it between $4.50 and $8.79 by year-end. Its cross-chain tools, dev-friendly language support (Rust, JS, Solidity), and scalable architecture position it well for AI-powered growth. With real products, a growing community, and technical depth, NEAR easily makes the list of cryptos with most potential for 2025. 4. Aptos Ramps Up Cross-Chain Utility with Chainlink Integration Aptos is enhancing its cross-chain capabilities by integrating Chainlink’s tools into its ecosystem. The addition of Chainlink’s Data Feeds and the CCIP protocol allows developers to use off-chain data and bridge assets securely across chains. This upgrade makes dApps on Aptos far more adaptable and connected, expanding their reach beyond the native network. APT currently trades at $5.42, with projected values ranging from $9.93 to $31.32 by the year’s end. Aptos’s momentum is driven by high-performance infrastructure, frequent updates, and growing partnerships. It balances speed with developer usability, giving teams the tools to launch scalable dApps quickly. In the wider list of cryptos with most potential , Aptos stands out for its blend of smart upgrades and timely integrations. 5. Chainlink Scales Reach Through Integrations & Mainstream Access Chainlink continues building its presence in 2025 by adding new features and securing real-world listings. In the first quarter alone, it expanded to 37 new blockchains and introduced 77 new Data Streams. The Multistream upgrade further optimized how its data is handled across dApps. These updates are creating fresh demand for LINK, which trades at $14.62 and has forecasts ranging from $17 to $45. The big news? Chainlink is now part of PayPal’s crypto selection, massively increasing its user base and credibility. As a leading provider of oracle services, Chainlink’s tools remain critical for dApps needing reliable external data. With more integrations expected, its reach is only growing. For investors identifying the cryptos with most potential , Chainlink’s role as a data provider makes it hard to overlook. Why These Coins Stand Out Now Each project brings something unique. NEAR is all-in on AI tools and developer access. Render is growing into a decentralized compute giant. Aptos is bridging ecosystems with Chainlink’s help. Chainlink itself is expanding its data network and institutional presence. But BlockDAG brings something different, time-sensitive pricing, daily engagement mechanics, and a rapidly expanding user base. With a $0.0019 presale, aggressive referral payouts, and Buyer Battles driving attention, it offers high activity and high reward in equal measure. When you’re looking at the cryptos with most potential , the trick is to focus on what’s working now, not just promises. These five projects are delivering results, running live systems, and expanding communities. If past market cycles are any indication, early participation in projects that show this kind of activity often pays off the most. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

This followed the ruling of a U.S. judge in the Northern District of California, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Judge Blocks Apple’s 30% Commission on Out-of-App Crypto Sales As per the ruling, developers can redirect users outside Apple’s App Store without restriction. Before Judge Gonzalez Rogers’ decision, developers could not link users to purchase outside the app store. Although Apple allowed NFTs on its platform before now, all purchases made using the device were subject to a 30% fee . This was for in-app purchases, while a 27% commission fee was applicable for those making external purchases. However, the judge has now issued an order to stop Apple from charging these commissions on sales outside the App Store. The legal decision could serve as a milestone for crypto and crypto-based apps, as developers can now bypass the fees. As developers take advantage of this opportunity, the crypto space might likely witness a flood of crypto apps on the U.S. App Store. Apple to Appeal, But Comply for Now Many had critiqued Apple for its policy, describing it as anti-competitive behavior that stifled growth in the sector. Epic Games sued the tech giant because the games store believes NFT game demand is rising and must be met. Apple has confirmed that it will appeal Judge Gonzalez-Rogers’ decision in a notable development. In a statement by Olivia Dalton, the company’s Senior Director of Corporate Communications, “Apple strongly disagrees with the decision.” However, it has agreed to comply with the judge’s ruling and court order pending the appeal process. External links are now allowed on the U.S. App Store. The permission is only applicable in the U.S., as Apple still restricts certain crypto apps that could allow crypto mining outside the U.S. Additionally, app projects that gift crypto rewards to users for completing tasks are still restricted. Could Fortnite’s Return Signal Crypto’s Rise in the App Store? Meanwhile, according to Epic Games, its renowned Fortnite game, which was delisted from the App Store in 2020, will return soon. Tim Sweeney, Epic Games CEO, anticipates its return possibly this week. The court’s decision has sparked debate online, with some lauding Epic Games’ courage in suing.

With $3,270 , investors can gain meaningful exposure to high-potential projects—without needing to chase inflated valuations. As May 2025 unfolds, coins like XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Kaspa (KAS) , Aptos (APT) , and Solana (SOL) are gaining traction across technical and fundamental indicators. Meanwhile, early adopters are turning their attention to MAGACOINFINANCE , a rising altcoin with a clear growth trajectory. MAGACOINFINANCE – Quiet Execution, Growing Momentum While major tokens dominate headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is building with precision. With over $7.8 million raised , this project is gaining traction not through hype—but through disciplined delivery, strategic outreach, and growing investor support. Backed by real wallet growth and expanding community engagement, MAGACOINFINANCE is beginning to appear in more analyst watchlists. For investors looking beyond crowded names, this early-stage altcoin is offering something harder to find: a structured, mission-driven opportunity with long-term upside. Ethereum and XRP Continue to Set the Standard Ethereum (ETH) is trading around $1,837 , continuing its climb thanks to bullish institutional accumulation and momentum across AI-related infrastructure tokens. Analysts point to targets above $2,500 , backed by declining gas fees and growing network utility. XRP remains steady near $2.28 , building on a 4.7% rally with strong ETF-driven optimism. Technical analysts are watching a breakout toward $5 , as the Franklin Templeton spot XRP ETF and Ripple’s legal progress attract institutional flows. Solana, Aptos, and Kaspa Show Technical Strength Solana (SOL) holds firm between $145.97–$150.04 , with analysts calling for a move toward $205 . The network’s low-cost, high-speed design continues to attract developers in DeFi, NFTs, and real-world asset integration. Aptos (APT) is trading at $4.71 , showing steady growth alongside its adoption as a digital infrastructure provider. Price projections suggest a run toward $6.44 , driven by demand for scalable Layer-1 solutions. Kaspa (KAS) , currently at $0.0991 , is quietly climbing as demand for scalable proof-of-work alternatives increases.

He made the comment during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press with Kristen Welker that aired Sunday. “At some point, I’m going to lower them, because otherwise, you could never do business with them, and they want to do business very much,” Trump said . The U.S., under Trump, has already hit Chinese imports with tariffs as high as 145%, while China hit back with 125% on American goods. The standoff has cut down trade activity between the world’s two biggest economies, sent warnings through the markets, and could raise the price of essential products like manufacturing equipment, clothing, and toys that people in the U.S. buy regularly. The information was reported by CNBC. Retailers stop orders as factories halt production Trump launched the new tariffs on April 2, starting with a 34% hit on goods coming from China. The White House later raised that figure to 145%. Once those numbers dropped, American retailers immediately paused orders. Many Chinese factories froze operations because of the uncertainty. That’s what several companies told CNBC during interviews. Some factories have started moving again, but only because they’re worried about missing the shopping season. “If you don’t start producing in the next couple of weeks, you’re going to start missing Black Friday and Christmas,” said Cameron Johnson, a senior partner at Tidalwave Solutions, based in Shanghai. Johnson added that “both sides are trying to be flexible to some degree,” and pointed out that restarting supply chains after a full stop is way harder than keeping them alive. Many U.S. buyers tried to outsmart the tariffs by piling up inventory late last year, when they expected Trump to come back into office and raise trade duties. That move temporarily boosted Chinese exports. Shipments from China to the U.S. in March jumped 9.1% compared to the same month last year. At the same time, U.S. imports from China dropped 9.5% year-over-year. These numbers were based on CNBC’s calculations of official customs data. But those early moves have worn off. The amount of container ships heading from China to the U.S. has fallen sharply in recent weeks, according to Morgan Stanley, which tracks shipping traffic. Between April 14 and May 5, the number of canceled cargo trips rose by 14 times compared to the March 10 to April 7 period. That sudden drop signals that front-loading is slowing down fast. China looks at talks while export orders collapse During the interview, Trump pointed to economic weakness inside China as proof that his pressure campaign is working. He said China’s factory activity has fallen into the worst slowdown since 2023. The official purchasing managers’ index showed that new export orders hit the lowest level since December 2022, and it was the biggest decline since April of that year—when Shanghai was shut down due to COVID. Still, Trump said China made some “positive” statements recently. He said any deal between the two sides would have to be “fair.” On Friday, China’s Commerce Ministry said it’s “currently evaluating” the option of trade negotiations with the U.S. It was the first time since the new tariffs were announced that Beijing suggested talks might be possible.

JPMorgan’s trading team believes that the US stock market has a bit more upside potential in the near term amid the de-escalation of President Trump’s trade war, reports Bloomberg. But the firm warns that the true impact of Trump’s tariffs on the economy has yet to be felt, leading the team to believe that the market is not yet over the hump. “The combination of light positioning, low liquidity, subdued investor participation means that this market is likely to drift higher in the absence of negative news such as tariff headlines or a spike in bond yields… [However,] this is not an all clear for markets… We are still 1-2 months away from seeing the negative impact of the trade war on the real economy.” The bank’s equity research team shares a similar sentiment, noting it has “a bias to sell risk assets on strength rather than chasing the momentum as a complete shift in narrative will require clearing further headlines.” Meanwhile, Bank of America’s team of market strategists says the recovery is likely not sustainable, advising clients to “sell into rallies in US stocks and the dollar.” The bank also says debasement of the US dollar is the “cleanest investment theme to play.” According to BofA, a depreciating dollar is a strong signal that investors around the world are moving capital away from US assets. “Weaker US dollar will play out either slowly with lower yields or quickly with higher yields. It’s brutally flagged by the soaring gold price.” BofA believes that the capital flight from US assets will continue unless the Federal Reserve slashes rates, Trump cuts a trade deal with China and consumer spending remains strong. The bank also highlights that a weak US dollar suggests that investors are reallocating capital into commodities like gold and foreign stock markets. The US dollar index (DXY), which measures the strength of the USD against a basket of other major foreign currencies, is down about 8% this year, after witnessing its deepest slide in 16 years last month. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up roughly 15% since its 2025 lows of 4,835 points, which it hit on April 7th.

Analysts feel that DOGE can hit $1 if it holds onto key support levels. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is generating buzz with its promising DeFi platform, with huge growth potential. Currently trading at a mere $0.025, this new DeFi token is showing all the initial signs of a break-out point. Mutuum’s ongoing presale has already managed to attract more than 9,400 investors and raise more than $7.5 million, which demonstrates growing confidence in the long-term value of the project. As Phase 4 goes over 50% sold out, the token ought to spike 20% to $0.03 during Phase 5. New investors now joining the boat may have returns of as much as 140% when the token hits its estimated launch price of $0.06. The Birth of a New DeFi Frontier Mutuum Finance ‘s trailblazing crypto lending products have propelled the platform to becoming a significant player in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). The presale funding from initial investors exceeds $7.5 million through the involvement of more than 9,400 investors. During its next presale round Mutuum Finance token will rise to $0.03 from the current $0.025 price. Early investors will receive up to 140% return if the token reaches its launch price of $0.06. The innovative lending products of the platform are shattering decentralized markets and putting Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the most potential DeFi initiatives. During the development process, the platform will also be receiving a Certik smart contract audit, which will uncover more information and additional security for investors. A Powerful Performance in the DeFi Market Mutuum Finance is rewriting the rules of decentralized lending. Its innovative dual-model lending system blends Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, delivering unmatched flexibility and control to both lenders and borrowers. P2C Model: Users can earn passive income by supplying stablecoins like USDT to smart contract-powered liquidity pools. P2P Model: Direct, decentralized lending lets users engage with each other without middlemen, enabling full ownership control. Together, these two systems form a hybrid strategy that empowers users with both security and autonomy, a clear edge over many existing DeFi platforms. Utility Meets Incentives: Fueling Community Growth What truly sets Mutuum apart is its laser focus on utility and engagement. The platform’s real-time leaderboard now tracks the top 50 token holders, rewarding loyalty and community participation with bonus MUTM tokens. This gamified system has helped strengthen long-term holding strategies and deepen community involvement. Mutuum Finance will distribute ten prizes worth $10,000 in MUTM tokens through a $100,000 giveaway that rewards participants. The referral system provides benefits to spread the MUTM token ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is transforming from a basic token to an active force advancing the DeFi market with these strategic initiatives. Mutuum Finance is one of its top performers since its initial backers have surpassed 9,400 participants and its presale secured $7.5 million funding success. Phase 4 surpasses 50% of its selling mark while Phase 5 will introduce a 20% price increase to $0.03 which reinforces continuing market development. Those who get involved in phase 4 can achieve profit growth of 140% when Mutuum Finance reaches its purposeful launch token price at $0.06. Mutuum Finance gains serious traction because of its real utility along with advanced lending methods and a strong community rewards system. The Mutuum Finance presale offers a perfect opportunity for DeFi investors to take part in the decentralized lending revolution and acquire position before the upcoming DeFi expansion. The time to secure MUTM tokens is now because future prices are expected to rise.

Based on a fully formed bullish pattern, the Dutch market expert postulates that altcoins are on the edge of a market breakout. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Price Rally As STH Numbers Set To Cross 4 Million — Here’s Why Altcoin Market Tipped To $5.4 Trillion Valuation In Altseason The cup-and-handle is a classic bullish continuation pattern in technical analysis. It usually signifies an asset’s potential to continue rising after a period of consolidation. According to Van Lagen, the cup-and-handle pattern has appeared on the altcoin market bi-weekly chart. It consists of a U-shaped price movement (cup), which represents a period of gradual decline and recovery as seen between 2022 to mid 2024. Van Lagen explains that investors typically accumulate assets during this period, perhaps due to an extended downside market prior to a rebound. This cup movement is followed by the handle, which often resembles a small descending channel as seen in 2025. The handle usually represents a breakout and retest zone, paving the way for the altseason. For the altseason to occur, the altcoin market cap must convincingly break above the neckline of the cup-and-handle pattern, which is currently at $813.18 billion. If this breakout occurs, inducing an altseason, Van Lagen analysis shows that total altcoin valuation could rise to around $5.4 trillion before 2026, indicating a potential 564% market growth. Related Reading: $380M In Ethereum Leaves Exchanges In 7 Days – Accumulation Trend Accelerates Why The Altseason Is Sure To Happen In other news, analysts continue to debate the feasibility of an altseason for the current bull cycle. Crypto analyst and Web3 growth manager Cas Abbé joined this discussion, highlighting three reasons the altseason is certain to come to pass. Notably, Cas Abbé acknowledges the altseason has been delayed, citing a lack of sufficient liquidity due to a large amount of token unlocks and the ripple effects of the memecoins craze driven by Pumpfun. However, the analyst remains confident in the prospects of an altseason due to multiple reasons, one of which is the potential for multiple altcoin ETF approvals. Cas Abbé explains that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to issue the green light for several altcoin ETFs in Q3/Q4 of 2025, which holds the final deadline for most of these ETFs. Following these approvals, the analyst predicts a rise in institutional investments, which could produce a rallying effect similar seen with the Bitcoin ETFs in 2024. Furthermore, Abbé states the Fed is likely to begin rate cuts in June as well as terminate all quantitative tightening measures. Both moves are expected to be followed by a liquidity injection, untimely creating a risk-on environment in financial markets that will support the growth of altcoins. Finally, the Web3 growth manager expects regulatory clarity by Q3/Q4 2025, which will allow banks to comfortably engage the crypto market, leading to massive liquidity. At press time, the total crypto market remains valued at $2.94 trillion, with altcoins accounting for 36.1% of all investments.

Shardeum’s upcoming launch follows an extended development cycle that featured multiple testnets, including “Liberty,” “Sphinx,” and the incentivized “Atomium.” Ahead of the platform’s mainnet launch on May 5, 2025, we spoke with Srinivasan “Srini” Parthasarathy, the Chief Technology Officer at Shardeum. Parthasarathy shared insights into the platform’s core technology, the challenges faced along the way, and what the mainnet launch means for the future of decentralized applications. Here are the edited excerpts from the interview. The tech behind Shardeum Invezz: Could you give us an overview of Shardeum — what the project aims to solve, and the core technology powering it? Parthasarathy describes Shardeum as “a layer one, EVM-compatible, dynamic state sharded blockchain network.” While it may be a technical mouthful, he believes the team has achieved something unprecedented. “We can scale pretty much indefinitely without any security issues and also stay totally decentralized,” he said. “We’ve kind of solved the blockchain dilemma,” the CTO added. That decentralization and scalability, he emphasized, come without compromise. “It’s a very exciting project for me personally… I’m very happy to be working with a fantastic set of engineers and people here.” Shardeum has been running several dry runs of its launch process and expects to be fully operational on May 5. “Technically, we’ve been ready for more than a month now,” Parthasarathy said. Invezz: Shardeum has conducted several testnets. What were some of the key learnings from those testnet phases? As per the CTO, Shardeum’s approach to testing has been both extensive and transparent. The final testnet attracted 171,000 independent validators across the world. “We have a very vibrant, supportive community that has actually helped us through a lot of our testing,” Parthasarathy said, crediting contributors for their time, effort, and financial support. “We have found a lot of security issues, and we’ve found bugs that we fixed,” he added. He also added that open-source development has been at the heart of the project. “We are sort of in a fishbowl. Everybody can see exactly what we are doing — coding in public, so to speak.” The team has incorporated feedback from the community and patched bugs revealed through bounties and audits. “There are more learnings in this than anything that we can do internally,” Parthasarathy added. Dynamic sharding and scalability Invezz: Shardeum uses dynamic state sharding. Can you explain how that works and why it matters from a scalability and decentralisation standpoint? Parthasarathy used an analogy to explain the underlying architecture of Shardeum’s dynamic state sharding. Imagine a blockchain as a spreadsheet, he said, with each row representing a block and each column a transaction. Traditional blockchains allow only one row to be written at a time. “What Shardeum did is something very interesting. What we said is that instead of having a single sheet with a billion rows, let’s break it up into, say, smaller tabs.” This sharding allows Shardeum to assign subsets of data to different validator groups, reducing the storage and compute requirements for running a node. “We want the whole world to participate in securing the network,” He said. “Anybody with $2,000 to spare should be able to spin up a node and secure the network.” Most other sharded blockchains operate with a fixed number of shards. Shardeum’s innovation is the ability to scale shards up and down dynamically as demand increases or decreases. “Now that is very unique. I don’t know of any other network that does that,” the CTO said. The ultimate goal, he said, is to keep barriers to entry low, particularly for participants outside the Western world, and ensure broad decentralization. Leadership changes and other challenges Invezz: The project has seen some leadership changes and delays in the launch timeline. How do you respond to concerns around leadership changes and execution risk? Parthasarathy acknowledged the turbulence but emphasized that such changes are part of the natural evolution of any high-stakes technology initiative. “At Shardium, we are trying to solve a problem that’s very hard,” he said. “The team had a very ambitious goal that they set for themselves… Now, doing a dynamic state-sharded blockchain is a very tough technical problem to solve.” He added that shifts in leadership and personnel should be expected in a startup environment. “Changes in teams are a very natural consequence of growth in any company… It’s just the way, that’s the nature. This is a very tough problem. If we get burnt out, if we want to do other things, it’s just an actual course of things.” What comes next after launch Invezz : What features will be available at launch, and what will roll out over time? The May 5 launch is just the beginning of a phased rollout. Features like smart contract support will not be fully available on day one but will be enabled over the following weeks. “We are releasing this in a phased manner,” Parthasarathy said, adding that other enhancements related to autoscaling and governance are also in the pipeline. The CTO reiterated the team’s long-term vision: “The goal is to make Shardeum as robust and decentralized as possible.” A major focus will also be working with developers to build applications on the network in the months ahead.

This marks a $7.85 billion increase in the past 30 days, including $4.09 billion in the last week alone. The growth follows 19 consecutive months of supply expansion, with fiat-backed stablecoins reaching an average supply of $218 billion in April, up 2% month-over-month and 8% year-to-date. Monthly transaction volumes have also surged, surpassing $720 billion, another record. Key stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) have contributed significantly, with USDT adding $5.3 billion and USDC $6 billion in recent months. The resurgence in stablecoin liquidity is seen as a precursor to potential gains in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Treasury projects that stablecoins could grow to $2 trillion by 2028, nearly ten times the current size, and Citi forecasts a possible rise to $3.7 trillion by 2030 under a bullish scenario. Stablecoins are increasingly recognized for their role in facilitating open, instant, and borderless payments, moving $15.6 trillion in value in 2024 alone. Additionally, the Tron network dominates stablecoin transaction volume, with $4-5 billion worth of USDT transacted daily through its platform. This growing momentum in stablecoins is also prompting regulatory attention and discussions about their impact on global financial markets.

She emphasized that the Arizona State Retirement System should focus on sound and informed investments.

The firm's BUIDL fund currently holds approximately $2.92 billion in assets under management (AUM), with around 92% of these assets, or $2.7 billion, tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain. This dominance highlights Ethereum's liquidity and the trust it commands within BlackRock's portfolio. Other blockchain platforms in the fund's allocation include Aptos with $53.4 million, Avalanche with $52.8 million, Polygon with $38.4 million, Arbitrum with $32.5 million, Optimism with $26.2 million, and Solana with $20.1 million. The data underscores BlackRock's strategic focus on Ethereum compared to other chains, which hold relatively minor portions of the fund's assets.

The deal, announced this week, comes from MBS Global Investments, a family office that says it manages around $14 billion in assets. The five-year project will be built in the capital, Malé, and aims to pull the island nation out of a growing debt crisis. The Maldives finance minister Moosa Zameer reportedly told the Financial Times that the country needs to “take the leap” and move away from its dependence on tourism and fisheries. He said the country’s biggest problem is debt payments due within the next two years. “It’s something we see as a potential contributor to bring us out of certain difficulties that we are in,” Zameer said about the crypto investment. MBS signs joint venture to launch financial center in Malé MBS Global Investments officially signed a joint venture agreement with the Maldives government on Sunday. The plan is to build the Maldives International Financial Centre, which will cover 830,000 square meters, house 6,500 residents, and create 16,000 jobs. It will serve as a crypto financial zone aiming to triple the Maldives’ GDP within four years, and generate over $1 billion in revenue by the fifth year, according to the masterplan. MBS chief executive Nadeem Hussain confirmed that commitments worth between $4 billion and $5 billion have already been secured. “We appreciated right from the offset what was involved in terms of funding and we’ve made the necessary alliances and brought in the necessary partners to ensure we have that,” Hussain said. “It is a large sum of money.” The office is backed by Sheikh Nayef bin Eid Al Thani, a Qatari national, who will tap into a network of family offices and wealthy individuals to raise the rest of the funds. Hussain said the firm plans to use a mix of equity and debt to finance the buildout of the crypto hub. This announcement comes just months after India gave the Maldives a $760 million bailout to help prevent a default. But the numbers are still ugly. Moody’s Ratings flagged major liquidity problems in December, pointing to external debt payments of around $600 million to $700 million due this year, and another $1 billion in 2026, including a $500 million sukuk, a debt instrument compliant with Islamic finance. Zameer said that both India and China have been important “development partners,” but this new deal with MBS is different. “With MBS we are getting into business, it’s going to be a business which is totally different from the traditional models of borrowings that we do,” he said. The country is now banking on its political stability, location, and access to major markets like India and the Gulf as advantages. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

That price surge followed the pattern the chart analyst describes for DOGE’s graph. The lovable meme coin’s price has historically followed the pattern of reversing at recent swing high levels. DOGE found decisive support there in April. So a breakout to markedly higher levels could be ahead.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Maryland says 27-year-old Mountee Brown has pleaded guilty to bank fraud and aggravated identity theft in connection in a scheme to steal funds from customers at a Clinton, Maryland, bank. Prosecutors outlined a web of deceptive acts by Brown and at least two co-conspirators against five victims, four of whom were over 80 years old. Brown’s guilty plea revealed that he used his position as a bank teller to gain access to the victims’ accounts and, using co-conspirators to “pose” as the victims walking into the bank, make at least 26 unauthorized withdrawals. Brown verified the transactions and falsely reported that they were done by “known clients.” Says the prosecutors, “The co-conspirators began carrying out the scheme on October 21, 2022, when Co-conspirator #1 entered Bank A and approached Brown at his designated teller station. Brown knew that Co-conspirator #1 was not Victim #1. But Brown and Co-conspirator #1 conducted a $10,000 cash withdrawal from Victim #1’s account without Victim #1’s knowledge or consent. Brown conducted the cash withdrawal by falsely documenting that he verified the customer, the customer was a ‘known client,’ and that the customer was known by Brown’s supervisor. Co-conspirator #1 falsely signed the withdrawal ticket as Victim #1.” According to the DOJ, Brown repeated the same scheme multiple times, and made cash deposits of approximately $30,200 into his personal account at another financial institution, and he and his co-conspirators made off with at least $255,000.

Turning bullish again on a short-term scale, it looks strong daily as it prepares to break out to a new high. Layer’s daily outlook is turning out more bullish on the daily chart due to the latest increase, which came after undergoing a three-day pullback. The $2.8 level produced support, and the price bounced back to where it is changing hands at $3.2 at the time of writing. This bounce brought the bulls back in action and they are now on the verge of reclaim the $3.4 resistance level, which served as barrier in the previous swing high. A successful break above this resistance level should send the price to a new high – expected around $5. Failure to break higher could lead to a slow-down in the rally while subjecting to a consolidation phase. As of now, there’s no signs of weakness. If that happens, it may correct lower until it finds a solid ground level. Losing February low in the process could lead to a serious bearish move in the mid-term. Looking back from where the price picked up in late Feruary, Layer has seen a nice growth with no signs of stopping at the time of writing. Layer’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from the immediate $3.4 resistance, there’s no key obstacle for the asset on the way up. If it flips this resistance, the next high may come at around $4 and maybe $4.5 in the near term. In case of a drop, the closest support levels to watch for a rebound are $2.8, $2.3 and $1.9. If they fail to hold, $1 would be the next key level to watch more dips.

The new profile picture looks like a distorted version of the logo for Grok, the platform’s artificial intelligence arm. This has been interpreted as a reference to a recent trend that Elon Musk has previously mentioned, in which well-known names are hilariously changed for the sole purpose of making fun of others. In this trend, the name of the artificial intelligence platform Grok is incorrectly written as Gork. Elon Musk's profile photo change is also thought to represent Gork.

Both are showing strong movement, but this alone doesn’t ensure lasting value. On the other side, Cold Wallet $CWT is creating a solid base, shaping a privacy-focused Web3 space using zero-knowledge architecture and practical uses. As traders watch for breakout points and increased investments, the key question remains: which projects will remain relevant in five years? For those keeping an eye on the top crypto coins right now, Cold Wallet is worth a deeper look. Render (RNDR) Aims for $6 Following Strategic Breakthrough Render (RNDR) has recently breached a crucial $2.50 resistance level, signaling a major shift in market dynamics. This breakthrough has drawn attention from both analysts and traders, especially as RNDR retested its May 2023 high and now aims for $4.50; a critical point where horizontal resistance and a descending trendline converge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaching 66 indicates growing momentum without reaching overbought territory, and a bullish MACD crossover supports this upward move. If Render can sustain a close above $4.50 with strong volume, it eyes the $6.00 target, a key psychological milestone. This bullish scenario is becoming more probable as investor enthusiasm builds. However, failure to break this threshold could limit RNDR to oscillating between $2.50 and $4.50. Avalanche: Leveraging Whale Influence and Protocol Upgrades Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a market transformation, driven by substantial whale transactions and significant protocol upgrades, highlighting its potential as the best crypto presale 2025 . Recently, AVAX rose to $19.69, a 32.95% increase, fueled by the accumulation of over 11.9 million AVAX by major investors. Concurrently, the Octane upgrade enhanced the network’s C-Chain, slashing transaction and swap fees by more than 30% and 97%, respectively, boosting performance without sacrificing security. On-chain data shows a shift with spot inflows dropping from $10.63 million to $1.4 million and open interest rising to $423.55 million, indicating decreasing sell pressure and growing investor confidence. These developments suggest a strategic advancement in Avalanche’s protocol, potentially shaping its mid-term market trajectory. Cold Wallet: Pioneering the Privacy-First Ecosystem with $CWT Cold Wallet is transforming from a mere storage solution into the cornerstone of a comprehensive privacy-focused ecosystem. This platform is tailored for developers, institutions, and discerning users who prioritize control. Cold Wallet is developing a robust layer of infrastructure with its upcoming Launchpad, SDKs, and third-party integration tools, where privacy is not just an added feature; it’s the foundation. At the core of this innovation is the $CWT token, powering an ecosystem that facilitates anonymous DeFi interactions, private token launches, and stealth dApp operations. As this ecosystem expands, Cold Wallet’s zero-knowledge architecture is setting new standards for privacy in Web3, positioning it as a crucial facilitator of this evolution. Developers can leverage its SDKs to create privacy-preserving tools, while projects can initiate token offerings directly via the Cold Wallet Launchpad. Users holding $CWT gain access to a suite of stealth utilities, ensuring privacy without compromising on transparency or functionality. With $CWT currently available at $0.0071 in its second presale stage and a projected public listing price of around $0.351, early investors are presented with a unique opportunity. Those looking for more than just temporary hype and focusing on substantial, long-term infrastructure benefits will find $CWT compelling. It represents not merely an investment but a stake in a future dominated by privacy-first principles, making it a standout candidate for the best crypto presale 2025 . Building Lasting Value in Crypto Beyond Just Prices Price changes often grab attention, but the real strength of a cryptocurrency comes from the solid work done quietly. Render’s recent price jumps and Avalanche’s growth driven by big investors show they are moving well, but their success is still tied to market changes. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is setting up a strong base. It helps developers, makes private financial transactions possible, and meets the growing need for control over personal digital information. As the excitement around quick profits fades and solid setups become more important, the usefulness of a crypto will decide who leads next. For those looking at top crypto coins, it’s important to see which ones are just being traded a lot and which ones are truly making a difference.

Web3 ai Might Be the Last Early Play With 1,747% ROI Potential Mantle is steady near $0.66, but the latest Mantle price analysis now gets compared to Chainlink’s 2019-2020 run, where flat action turned into a major rally. On the flip side, the IMX surge is already here. A 41 percent move in a day, with volume rising 761 percent. Traders now wait for a dip just to get in. It proves one thing: once the move is clear, the best entry may already be gone. Web3 ai ($WAI) is set to spot those setups early. Its AI stack watches trends, on-chain movement, risk shifts, and token signals before the market reacts. Right now, the Web3 ai($WAI) token is priced at $0.0003 in Stage 1, with a launch price set at $0.005242. That gives it a 1,747% ROI edge for early access. Mantle Price Analysis Points to a Possible Breakout Move Mantle price analysis is drawing eyes after analyst Inmortal compared MNT’s current setup to Chainlink’s quiet phase in 2019-2020, which came before a huge rally. MNT, the core token for layer-2 network Mantle, is at $0.66, but the forecast puts it at $6 within a year. While history can’t predict everything, many traders are watching closely. As the market moves past coins that already pumped, this Mantle price analysis could be the clue to one that has not yet made a big move. IMX Surge Sets the Pace With 41 Percent Daily Jump The IMX surge put Immutable’s token back in the spotlight with a strong 41 percent move to $0.65, the highest in nearly a month. Trading volume jumped 761 percent, with Bitcoin staying above $90K and pushing altcoins higher. Charts show the breakout has support. IMX now trades above its 20-day EMA, with a bullish MACD and Balance of Power at 0.54, pointing to strong buying. If pressure keeps up, the IMX surge might push it to $0.79 or even $0.87. But a cooldown could drop it back to $0.34 if profit-takers step in. Web3 ai Moves First While the Market Waits Web3 ai’s presale is live, and the $WAI token is set at $0.0003 in Stage 1. When the token launches, it is expected to hit $0.005242. That’s a 1,747% ROI for those who join before Stage 2, putting $WAI high on the list of best presale cryptos right now. But what matters more is how fast Web3 ai works. In crypto, every second counts. Web3 ai doesn’t wait for late signals or old news. It runs on live data from many sources, all at once. It pulls from price feeds, wallet activity, exchange books, social posts, dev logs, and trusted news. All of this is filtered and checked as it comes in. See a jump in trading volume? The scam checker turns on. Catch odd wallet moves? The risk alert updates. All twelve tools share the same feed, so no signal is missed. You don’t have to watch charts all day or chase every alert.

Look at the Moves Before They Happen Mantle price analysis shows a chart that has not moved yet, but traders are watching closely. Some analysts believe a $6 target could play out, comparing it to early Chainlink patterns. The IMX surge has already happened. A 41% jump in a single day, with volume rising 761%, turned heads across the space. The real question now is who saw it coming and acted early. It’s the same message every time. The biggest wins come before the chart moves. That’s why Web3 ai is standing out. As one of the best presale cryptos , it is still in Stage 1 and priced for early access. With a projected 1,747% ROI, the best window is now, before the rest of the market catches up.

Its surge above $1800 has investors optimistic, but whispers are becoming louder about the next revolutionary crypto on the horizon. Enter Ruvi , a groundbreaking blockchain project fusing artificial intelligence (AI) to address real-world challenges. While Ethereum headlines set the tone for the crypto market, those who missed Ethereum’s early investment days now have a unique chance to jump aboard Ruvi early. Packed with innovative technology, Ruvi is offering an exclusive presale with extraordinary bonuses. This very moment could transform your financial future. Why Ruvi Outshines Ethereum Ethereum’s dominance comes from its wide adoption and smart contract ecosystem, but Ruvi isn’t merely following the path paved by ETH. Instead, it’s redefining the narrative entirely. Here’s what sets Ruvi apart: 1. Scarcity-Driven Value Ethereum fuels its network with a high circulating supply, but Ruvi’s capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens introduces scarcity from the start. This means every token’s value increases as demand grows. 2. AI-Powered Applications Ruvi connects AI with blockchain to tackle urgent global challenges, including logistics optimization, predictive modeling in healthcare, and fraud detection in fintech. Its utility isn’t limited to crypto enthusiasts but expands into real industries worldwide. 3. Game-Changing Early Bonuses Ethereum never offered bonuses when it launched, but Ruvi is rewarding early backers with presale bonuses that climb as high as 100% extra tokens . Ruvi Presale Breakdown and Your Earnings Ruvi’s presale offers never-before-seen perks that multiply your rewards before Ruvi even hits major exchanges. Curious about what your initial investments could yield? Here’s a glance at the possibilities: A Modest $500 Investment For $500, you’ll snag 50,000 Ruvi tokens at $0.01 apiece. With a 40% bonus , you walk away with 70,000 tokens . Fast-forward to a post-release price of $0.80 , and you’re holding $56,000 , giving you a jaw-dropping 11,200% ROI for your modest start. A Mid-Tier Investment of $5,000 Invest $5,000 and collect 500,000 tokens . Count in the 100% bonus , and your total rockets to 1,000,000 tokens . When Ruvi climbs to $1.50 , your holdings transform into a life-altering $1.5 million , translating into roaring gains of 30,000% . A High-Stakes Roll of $15,000 Taking the all-in approach with $15,000 nets you 1.5 million tokens . With a 100% VIP bonus , your holdings double to 3 million tokens without spending an extra penny. At a valuation of $3.00 , you’re sitting on $9 million , cementing yourself as one of Ruvi’s millionaire elite. Why Timing Is Everything Ethereum’s early movers bagged exponential returns by siding with innovation before the masses caught on. Ruvi is offering a similar opportunity. Current Ethereum developments like the Pectra upgrade highlight the ecosystem’s growth, but Ruvi not only parallels this innovation but introduces entirely new applications enriched with AI. With its capped supply and strong presale bonuses, Ruvi’s price could surge as demand outweighs availability. Early adopters inevitably stand to gain the most, leaving stragglers asking, “What if?” Take Action or Risk the “What-Ifs” The Ruvi presale is now live, but this window of opportunity is vanishing fast. Tokens priced at $0.01 aren’t going to last long as savvy investors flock to secure their chance of skyrocketing profits. Ethereum paved the way, but Ruvi is showing an exciting new path for those entering the market today.

XRP , Solana (SOL) , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Injective (INJ) are showing signs of renewed strength, while MAGACOINFINANCE continues to build recognition as an early-stage asset with long-term potential. For investors working with $1,230 , the current environment presents a unique opportunity to enter high-potential positions ahead of broader moves. MAGACOINFINANCE – Rising With Precision and Purpose Away from short-term noise, MAGACOINFINANCE is becoming one of the most closely watched early-stage projects of 2025. Backed by over $7.8 million raised , a growing investor base, and consistent development milestones, this asset is not just trending—it’s earning attention. Rather than riding hype cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE is rising through structural growth, brand strength, and organic traction across platforms. Strategic investors seeking asymmetric upside are increasingly including MAGACOINFINANCE in their watchlists—and with good reason. XRP and Solana Press Against Key Resistance XRP is holding steady at around $2.15 , buoyed by ETF exposure and institutional inflows. Traders are eyeing the $2.45 breakout zone, which, if surpassed, could unleash a surge of capital targeting medium-term highs. Volume remains consistent, with confidence growing in XRP’s strategic role in global settlement systems. Solana (SOL) continues to trade in the $140–$145 range after a strong April. Analysts are focused on the $180 resistance zone, with expectations of renewed momentum as new NFT and DePIN projects gain traction on the network. Solana’s speed and scalability remain attractive to developers and institutional backers alike. Bitcoin’s Macro Momentum Gains Strength Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $95,000 , having climbed 14.5% in April . With ETF inflows increasing and major financial institutions reinforcing long-term interest, BTC’s macro narrative remains intact. Analysts suggest targets up to $132,000 by summer if the current trend holds. As the market anchor, BTC’s strength continues to elevate altcoin interest and confidence. Optimism and Injective Remain Infrastructure Leaders Optimism (OP) , trading near $3.25 , is seeing steady growth as Ethereum Layer-2 demand rises. Developer adoption and infrastructure expansion are key strengths, and any ETH surge could act as a catalyst for OP’s next leg up. Injective (INJ) remains a standout for decentralized finance infrastructure. At approximately $35 , INJ has shown technical resilience despite market fluctuations. Its roadmap and dApp ecosystem continue to gain traction, with strong support from long-term holders. Final Thoughts From XRP and Solana challenging resistance, to Bitcoin’s macro strength and infrastructure projects like Optimism and Injective setting deeper roots—this market phase rewards strategic positioning. And in that environment, MAGACOINFINANCE stands tall as a discovery-phase asset with a blueprint for relevance.

The cryptocurrency market is in a consolidation phase, but several digital currencies are witnessing increased buying pressure, pushing them into the overbought zone. Indeed, these cryptocurrencies are recording high Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) readings, which point to a potential crash in the coming week. Nexo (NEXO) and Quant ( QNT ) are among those showing signs of being overbought, making them risky bets for traders. Nexo (NEXO) Crypto lending entity Nexo is witnessing increased activity after announcing its re-entry into the U.S. market. Co-founder Antoni Trenchev has credited the move to a more favorable regulatory environment under the Donald Trump presidency. Notably, Nexo exited the U.S. in 2022 following regulatory challenges related to its Earn Interest Product, compounded by the FTX collapse and a broader crackdown on crypto lenders. However, NEXO’s price action raises concerns, signaling an imminent downturn. Currently trading at $1.27, the token has seen a 1.60% increase over the past 24 hours. More telling are its RSI values with a reading of 71.98 on the 24-hour chart, 69.31 on the 12-hour chart, and 58.26 on the 4-hour chart. Generally, an RSI above 70 indicates an overbought condition. NEXO price and RSI reading chart. Source: Coinglass Quant (QNT) Quant, a blockchain interoperability project, is also flashing warning signs for traders. Priced at $86.70 as of press time, QNT has posted modest gains of 1.40% over the past 24 hours. However, its RSI readings are concerning, with figures at 70.99 on the 24-hour chart, 73.64 on the 12-hour, and 69.03 on the 4-hour. These elevated RSI levels, particularly the 12-hour RSI above 70, potentially signal a forthcoming price dip. QNT price and RSI reading chart. Source: Coinglass Although the technical indicators suggest that the highlighted digital assets might crash, their next price trajectory heavily depends on broader market sentiment. If Bitcoin ( BTC ) breaks past the $95,000 mark, there’s a good chance both NEXO and QNT will follow suit.

Known for its high-speed transactions and scalable infrastructure, Solana is on track to continue making waves in the crypto market. However, while SOL’s trajectory looks promising, a rising star is gaining attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At just $0.025, MUTM has the potential to far outpace Solana’s gains, with projections suggesting exponential growth in the coming months. Once Phase 5 begins, the price will increase to $0.03, providing 20% ROI for Phase 4 buyers. The project has already raised over $7.5 million and secured more than 9,400 investors, with Phase 4 selling out more than 50% of its available tokens. As investors look for affordable altcoins with massive upside, MUTM’s low entry point could prove to be the perfect opportunity for those looking to maximize their portfolio’s value. MUTM will steal the spotlight from established players like SOL. Time will tell, but the race for 2025’s top performer is just getting started. Solana Poised for a Breakout: Analysts Eye 100% Surge in May Solana (SOL) is gaining significant traction within the cryptocurrency market, as bearish stress continues, with analysts forecasting a potential 100% price bounce in May. Such positivity is rooted in Solana’s strong fundamentals in the guise of its throughput-intensive blockchain platform and growing adoption on DeFi and NFT platforms. Through its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second at low cost, Solana is being seen more and more as an Ethereum substitute with scalability. Technical indicators are showing a breakout from consolidation levels in recent times, and market sentiment is in tune with on-chain indicators for a rally to past all-time highs. While Solana’s outlook is bright, investors are also keeping an eye on newer plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that is starting to display characteristics of high growth prospects. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is capturing major investor interest thanks to its unique decentralized financing model. The platform combines two key mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. The P2C model is managed by smart contracts, offering users a stable, automated experience. Meanwhile, the P2P model gives users full control over their loan management, enhancing privacy and autonomy. By offering adaptive operations, high-yield returns, and liquidity provider returns exceeding 10%, Mutuum Finance presents a profitable and user-friendly DeFi solution. Boosting Adoption Through a $100K Community Giveaway To encourage community growth, Mutuum Finance is running a $100K giveaway, with ten lucky participants receiving $10K in MUTM tokens. This initiative, coupled with a referral program, helps to retain existing users and attract new ones, building a stronger, more engaged community. These efforts also raise the platform’s visibility and contribute to long-term growth. Security is a prominent feature of Mutuum Finance. The platform will launch a fully collateralized, Ethereum-backed, USD-pegged stablecoin, offering stability and steering clear of algorithmic construction risks. Further, the platform regularly performs smart contract audits and emphasizes financial transparency to aid in building trust and ensuring defense against common vulnerabilities within the DeFi market. Investors are eyeing the blockchain’s breakout potential, with Solana (SOL) set for a possible 100% surge in May, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) might just steal the show. Priced at just $0.025 and already raising over $7.5 million from 9,400+ investors, MUTM is quickly becoming the most talked-about altcoin of 2025. Phase 4 is already more than 50% sold, and once Phase 5 hits, the price jumps 20% to $0.03, handing early investors an instant ROI. Backed by a powerful DeFi model, real-world lending utility, and a $100K token giveaway, Mutuum Finance is designed to disrupt and dominate. Opportunities like this don’t wait, get in now or watch from the sidelines as others ride MUTM to the top.

The move became necessary following accusations from Justin Sun, Tron founder, that OKX exchange refused to freeze users’ stolen funds associated with a malicious attack on Tron’s official X account. Dispute Over Alleged Freeze Request After Tron X Account Hack Sun had alleged that OKX ignored a law enforcement freeze notice after the malicious attack on May 3. However, in a post wherein he tagged Sun, the OKX CEO refuted the claims, stating that no official communications came from Tron to OKX. According to XU, the OKX law enforcement cooperation team has checked their email boxes, including the spam folder, and no such request exists. He insisted that Sun provide a screenshot of the request to prove that Tron initiated such a communication with OKX. XU clarified that the exchange has a consumer protection team, OKX strictly adheres to laws, and would not freeze a customer’s funds based on oral communication. He noted that not even a personal post on social media platforms qualifies as an official request; Tron and Sun should do the needful. Justin Sun Deletes Post, Opts for Private Communication Interestingly, Sun’s original post, which has now been deleted, had the Tron founder claiming to have reached out to OKX via email. XU, however, shared a screenshot of it to call Sun out. In Sun’s post, he stated he acted to protect the Tron community, as the stolen funds do not belong to him. Sun said his decision to contact OKX’s compliance team came after the exchange failed to respond. Meanwhile, Sun has responded to Xu’s post with a short reply stating, “Will send to you privately.” Crypto Hacks Expose Growing Risks Across Industry The back-and-forth between two CEOs is a result of malicious actors targeting social media accounts to carry out crypto hacks. In mid-March, hackers took over the account of Yu Hu, founder of Kaito, a crypto AI platform. The malicious actors used the account to issue fake warnings that wallets were compromised after the attacker had opened a ‘short position’ in KAITO tokens. The incident highlights the extent to which hackers carry out fraud in the crypto space.

While it struggles to push through, three promising altcoins may offer rapid profits in the current market frenzy. This article reveals which assets are poised for significant growth, inviting readers to explore potential opportunities amid the ongoing volatility. Aave Price Action and Future Trading Zones Aave experienced a steady climb with a 17.37% increase in the last month and a 38.23% surge over the past six months. Prices fluctuated within a range that indicates a rise in investor interest and improving sentiment. The coin's performance reflects a gradual buildup of buying momentum and a shift toward bullish behavior, attracting both new participants and existing holders. Current prices are between $125.92 and $191.13, facing resistance at $217.84 and $283.06, while support is set at $87.40 and $22.19. Bulls maintain momentum, but the RSI at 63.27 suggests a need for caution. Trading strategies recommend buying near support levels, with an eye on resistance for potential profit-taking, as the market lacks a clear trend. Uptrend on the Horizon: TRON’s Steady Climb and Short-Term Setbacks TRON experienced a modest weekly slip of 1.50% while advancing 4.22% over the past month and an impressive 52.44% rise over the last six months. The coin’s performance shows periods of healthy gains punctuated by short-term corrections that keep traders on alert without any dramatic volatility. TRON’s current price is trading between $0.2244 and $0.2639, with close resistance at $0.28 and clear support at $0.20. Bears and bulls are in a tug-of-war as prices hover near these levels, indicating a balanced zone without a dominant trend. Watching price movement within these boundaries could reveal breakout points to guide trading decisions. Mantle Price Update: Recovery Gains and Consolidation Challenges Over the past month, Mantle experienced a mild decline of 2.33% while marking a notable 32.89% upward shift over the last six months. The coin’s behavior signals a period of recovery following a short-term dip, reflecting fluctuations that hint at renewed investor interest during a phase of overall appreciation. Currently, Mantle trades within a range of $0.66 to $0.82, with immediate resistance at $0.89 and a secondary hurdle at $1.05. Support is noted at $0.57, with further backing near $0.41. Technical signals, including a near-neutral RSI of 52.37, suggest there is no clear trend.

The stand-out as of writing is the Deribit-listed $300,000 strike bitcoin call option expiring on June 26. Theoretically, this call is a bet that BTC's spot price will triple to over $300,000 by the end of the first half of the year. Over 5,000 contracts were active in the June $300K call at press time, with a notional open interest of $484 million. That makes it the second-most popular option bet in the crucial June expiry, trailing only the $110K call. Deribit is the world's leading crypto options exchange, accounting for over 75% of the global options activity. On Deribit, one options contract represents 1 BTC. Quarterly expiries, such as the one due on June 26, drive heightened market activity and volatility, with traders using these deadlines to hedge positions, lock in gains, or speculate on the next price moves. ""Perhaps, people like buying lottery tickets. As evidenced by the call skew, there are always folks that want the hyperinflation hedge,"" Spencer Hallarn, a derivatives trader at crypto market maker GSR, said, explaining the high open interest in the so-called out-of-the-money (OTM) call at the $300K strike. Deep OTM calls, also called wings, require a large move in the underlying asset's price to become profitable and, hence, are significantly cheaper compared to those closer to or below the asset's going market rate. However, the payoff is huge if the market rallies, which makes them similar to buying lottery tickets with slim odds but potential for a big payout. Deribit’s BTC options market has experienced similar flows during previous bull cycles, but those bets rarely gained enough popularity to rank as the second-most preferred play in quarterly expiries. The chart shows that the June 26 expiry is the largest among all settlements due this year, and the $300K call has the second-highest open interest buildup in the June expiry options. Explaining the chunky notional open interest in the $300K call, GSR's Trader Simranjeet Singh said, ""I suspect this is mostly an accumulation of relatively cheap wings betting on broader U.S. reg narrative being pro-crypto and the 'wingy possibility' (no pun intended) of a BTC strategic reserve that was punted around at the start of the administration."" On Friday, Senator Cynthia Lummis said in a speech that she's ""particularly pleased with President Trump's support of her BITCOIN Act. ""The BITCOIN Act is the only solution to our nation’s $36T debt. I’m grateful for a forward-thinking president who not only recognizes this, but acts on it,"" Lummis said on X. Who sold $300K calls? According to Amberdata's Director of Derivatives, notable selling in the $300K call expiring on June 26 occurred in April as part of the covered call strategy , which traders use to generate additional yield on top of their spot market holdings. ""My thought is that the selling volume on April 23 came from traders generating income against a long position,"" Magadini told CoinDesk. ""Each option sold for about $60 at 100% implied volatility."" Selling higher strike OTM call options and collecting premium while holding a long position in the spot market is a popular yield-generating strategy in both crypto and traditional markets.

According to a new study conducted by State Democracy Defenders Action, a nonprofit group dedicated to ending autocracy in the US, Trump has not only increased his wealth through crypto but has set himself up to earn more profits in the future. The study further says that Trump’s position of power has allowed him to loosen regulatory policies on tokens associated with his decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which was founded in September 2024. “President Trump’s recent foray into crypto assets has allowed him to substantially increase his wealth in a relatively short period of time. Trump will likely profit more from them in the future now that one of the companies he is affiliated with has added a new stablecoin to its portfolio. Unlike other executive branch employees, he is not subject to the primary criminal conflict of interest law, which has allowed him to adopt regulatory policies that favor private sector stablecoins like those offered by WLFI.” Citing Fortune, the study finds that Trump’s $2.9 billion worth of cryptocurrencies comprise 37% of his total assets, which amount to $7.7 billion. The study concludes by noting that Congress has the power to stop Trump from profiting from digital assets. “The regulation of digital assets is in its nascency, but rather than divest his crypto assets to avoid any possible conflict of interest, President Trump seems to have positioned himself to maximize profiting from them by adopting a less aggressive regulatory and enforcement program than his predecessor. Congress has a unique opportunity to prevent President Trump and future presidents from using their public office for private gain by adopting legislation barring them and other elected officials from holding stablecoins and other digital assets.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

His post revisits conditions similar to those that preceded XRP’s rapid 5x price increase in late 2024. According to JD, two critical indicators had aligned before that rally: a green flip in the MACD histogram and a Stochastic RSI (SRSI) cross above 80 on the 3-day chart. He now points to a similar setup developing again, potentially setting the stage for another substantial move. #XRP – Last time $XRP 5x within weeks when: 1. MACD changed to green 2. SRSI crossed above 80 (green line) Will the SRSI confirm the 80 cross on the 3-day?! (Patreon/Discord are updated weekly!) #XRPArmy #XRPCommunity pic.twitter.com/KFhbNknAxp — JD (@jaydee_757) May 3, 2025 The chart shows XRP consolidating in a descending triangle following its sharp rise toward the end of 2024 after Donald Trump’s election victory and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation announcement . That rally began when the MACD histogram turned green and the SRSI crossed the 80 level. JD’s chart highlights that both conditions were present before XRP surged from around $0.6 in November to $3.39 in January. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Indicators Begin to Align Again The MACD histogram has just flipped back to green, and JD has drawn attention to the SRSI approaching a critical juncture. He notes the SRSI’s proximity to crossing above the key 80 level on the 3-day timeframe. If confirmed, it would mirror the conditions that previously led to explosive price action. JD’s chart illustrates how XRP has been consolidating within a falling wedge pattern since early 2025, with gradually declining highs and higher lows converging toward a breakout point. The most recent candles suggest price action is nearing the wedge’s apex, and the chart also shows that XRP has broken above the upper trendline of this pattern. If it can sustain its price above this crucial level , JD expects a massive breakout for the digital asset. Price Targets and XRP’s Future When the chart was shared, XRP was trading around $2.2. The lower boundary of the wedge has acted as consistent support, while resistance has been gradually declining, forming a compressive price structure. The chart’s breakout projection points toward a significant move, with a large arrow implying potential continuation beyond the previous all-time high of $3.84. Applying the same 5x increase to the asset’s price means it could climb as high as $11. The focus is whether the SRSI can print a successful cross above the 80 level. While the MACD histogram has already turned green, JD implies the SRSI confirmation could be the final piece needed to validate a bullish breakout. Traders monitoring XRP’s 3-day chart may look to this signal for confirmation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

About 16 million crypto investors now represent around 36% of the nation’s eligible voters, leading to attempts by major parties to win them over with greater effort. Bitcoin’s domestic market capitalization has increased beyond 2,600 trillion won— reportedly more than the sum of all KOSPI-listed firms—demonstrating the sector’s growing clout in national politics and economies. Democratic Party Woos Investors With Reform Platform The Democratic Party has recruited digital finance experts and offered bill drafts to attract crypto-conscious voters. Sogang University Professor Kim Yong-jin, a renowned tokenized securities expert, joined the party’s campaign team. Legislator Min Byeong-deok proposed the Basic Digital Asset Act, aimed at normalizing permission for stablecoin and aligning it with South Korea’s law of legal tender. The proposal seeks to usher in regulatory clarity and consumer protections without hindering innovation. People Power Party Rolls Out Comprehensive Crypto Roadmap The rightist People Power Party is counterattacking with its own powerful digital asset agenda. Candidate Kim Moon-soo emphasized that even though millions are being spent on crypto, there remain no investor protections.

There is another Senate Bill in the works, but Hobbs will most likely veto that. Hobbs announced the veto proudly, saying that the state has one of the strongest retirement systems in the country because politicians like herself make sensible investment decisions. Arizona was first in the race to create a crypto treasury . Sadly, many crypto supporters in Arizona will have no crypto treasury for at least a year. The Senate Bill 1025 would have allowed the state to invest up to 10% of public funds into crypto. Many retirement groups protested the bill because they felt politicians were gambling away their pensions on Bitcoin. Wendy Rogers, co-sponsor of the bill, voiced her disappointment and pointed out that Arizona’s retirement funds have already been invested in Saylor’s software company, Strategy, which has the world’s most extensive corporate Bitcoin treasury. Rogers said that Bitcoin doesn’t need Arizona, but that Arizona needs Bitcoin. Rogers promised supporters that she would refile another Senate Bill and, through persistence, get the bill passed. Strategy’s stock price rose around 30% in April, most assuredly adding value to Arizona’s robust retirement system. Hobbs, moreover, has a history of vetoing bills. She even threatened to veto all bills until disability legislation was resolved. In 2025 alone, she has vetoed 75 bills, more than all of 2024, which had 74 bills, but less than her record of 143 bills, which she vetoed in 2023, a record for an Arizona governor. There were two Senate Bills on Hobbs’ desk, awaiting approval: the 1025 bill she just dropped, and another 1373 bill, which she will most likely veto, due to her history of vetoing bills, especially those of investments she deems highly risky. North Carolina, meanwhile, has stepped up efforts to win the race for Bitcoin legislation . North Carolina has just passed a bill that allows for a 5% allocation of public funds to crypto investments. However, North Carolina could suffer the same fate as Arizona if certain politicians judge crypto as a speculative asset, not a serious asset. Some politicians may reject a Bitcoin reserve because President Trump is endorsing it at the federal level. Investors from the crypto industry may lament that Arizona has missed out on an opportunity to embrace a new technology. New Hampshire is another runner-up state in the Bitcoin race, with local politicians believing their state will be the first to make history. However, others are paying close attention to Texas, which is also a runner-up state, but with much more momentum, suggesting it could be the winner. Arizona rejected the bill, in part because of factional divisions in state government. Hobbs admits that she would veto bills until disability legislation is passed. Bitcoin, after all, is just one issue facing the American public, and it may have to come second to other, more pressing matters, such as disability funding.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-04 18:54:30

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.54. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.76 and an average forecast price of $5.53. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.707 Market Cap $1.1B Trading Volume $122.3M Circulating Supply 1.56B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.7449 24-hour Low $0.7038 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.47% 50-Day SMA $ 0.640987 14-Day RSI 60.56 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.649334 EOS price analysis: Cryptocurrency devalues to $0.707 amidst loss TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a downward trend at $0.707.

Coin value has dropped down to $0.707 amidst the growing selling pressure. At the same time, the currency lost up to 2.00% of its value in the day. This creates discouraging circumstances for the investors, as the cryptocurrency is losing rapidly. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirmed a downward trend for the currency. EOS/USD value has depreciatedo a low of $0.707 in the past 24 hours. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a rising selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility.

Conversely, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.592. EOS/USD 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has dropped down to 56.35.

EOS /USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has deteriorated to $0.7095 in the day. The decline in the volatility is suggestive of a lower chance of reversal. The Bollinger bands are converging, leading to a reduction in the volatility.

Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $0.673, securing the support. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart, Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is present within the neutral region for now.

EOS price analysis gives out a relatively bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. EOS/USD value has depreciated to $0.707 in the past 24 hours. From an overall analysis, the currency has lost 2.00% of its value in the day. Technical indicators give out a bullish signal, whereby the price charts present a bearish market scenario. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS down? EOS is in descent with bearish pressure. The coin decreased to $0.707 in the past 24 hours. EOS price will decrease further if further resistance from the sellers is experienced. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2026 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2030. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.76 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.76 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time. Recent news/opinion on EOS Vaulta announced that its current total value locked (TVL) has reached $261 million. The blockchain also claimed that its ecosystem is under expansion, with its all-time high TVL recorded at $299 million.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April. In May, EOS is changing hands at $0.72.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-04 18:55:00

You’d configure a machine, install the software, and let it run. It was decentralized in theory, but in practice? It favored people with the right tech and the time to set it up. That same model pushed everyday users out of the equation. Bitcoin Solaris flips that on its head. With a working mobile-first approach to mining, it allows anyone to participate from a smartphone. And that shift — from hardware-intensive to mobile-native — might be the most important factor in widening who actually gets to benefit from crypto projects in 2025. From CPU Farms to Phones Monero was known for its resistance to ASICs and its focus on privacy. But even with those values in place, the barriers to entry stayed high. You still needed a dedicated system. Mining wasn’t something you did casually — it was an operation. Bitcoin Solaris breaks that model by design. The Solaris Nova App allows users to mine BTC-S from a regular mobile phone. You open the app, activate mining, and earn rewards every day. It doesn’t drain your battery or spike your processor. It runs lightly in the background — designed for daily use, not server rooms. This is what modern accessibility looks like: full network participation from your pocket. For a walk-through of how the Solaris Nova App works, and how it compares to earlier mining models like Monero’s, check out this overview by Crypto Royal . How Mobile Mining Works The network’s architecture runs on a Layer-2 solution using Solana infrastructure, giving it the throughput needed to support fast, low-cost interactions. The result is a blockchain that can handle mobile traffic without delay — something older mining chains were never built for. Rewards are tied to usage and interaction. You don’t need to compete on hash rate. You don’t need to configure GPUs. You mine because you’re active, and you get rewarded based on time and consistency, not hardware advantage. More importantly, frictionless mining doesn’t mean compromised structure. The smart contracts behind Bitcoin Solaris have been fully audited by: Cyberscope Freshcoins And the team is KYC verified , adding public accountability that’s usually missing in anonymous mining projects. Token Supply and Entry Points Bitcoin Solaris uses the same capped model that made Bitcoin reliable: a maximum supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens. 4.2 million tokens are available during BTC-S presale. At this stage — Phase 1 — the entry price is locked at 1 USDT per token, but that won’t last. When Phase 1 ends, tokens will cost 2 USDT each. No preferential rounds, no tiered pricing — just a simple rule: move early or pay more. Getting Started Is Simple If you’re ready to mine BTC-S from your phone: Go to bitcoinsolaris.com Connect a Solana-compatible wallet and join the presale Buy BTC-S at 1 USDT each Use your referral code to invite others and multiply returns What Monero once required in CPU farms, Bitcoin Solaris now runs through smartphones. It means more people can earn, more consistently, without needing anything but a phone and a few minutes of setup.

The story seems to be changing again for the premier cryptocurrency, as it builds on recent bullish momentum and looks to reclaim the $100,000 level. When Will BTC Price Reach The Cycle Top? In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Brett put forward an interesting analysis of the Bitcoin price structure and its potential trajectory in what remains of the current cycle. This evaluation looks at the price of BTC from the cycle “bottom to present” and “present to top.” Related Reading: Solana Rebound To $900 Is Coming, But This Resistance Stands In The Way Using the previous two cycles as a foundation, Brett was able to calculate the number of days it took the Bitcoin price to travel from the bottom to the present and from the present to the top. In the chart below, the “blue” box represents the amount of time since the last bottom, while the “green” box represents the amount of time from “present” to the cycle tops. Brett noted that the amount of time between the Bitcoin price bottom in 2022 and the present day is exactly 903 days. As observed in the highlighted chart, the analyst transposed this same period on the previous two cycles (starting at the 2015 and 2018 bottoms, respectively). In the previous two cycles, the Bitcoin price reached a new all-time high or the cycle peak 161 days after the highlighted 903-day period (after the bottom). In 2017, it took the flagship cryptocurrency 161 days to reach a then-all-time high of around $16,000. Similarly, the BTC price also reached the cycle top around $69,000 after 161 days in 2021. From this historical perspective, this pattern suggests that the current cycle’s top for the Bitcoin price could be just 161 days away. If the pattern holds and the current price trajectory continues, this would place the premier cryptocurrency’s peak at exactly October 11, 2025. However, it is worth mentioning that there have been questions about the Bitcoin price following the typical cycle theory. With the bull run initially pronounced over at the start of 2025, the recent positive price action in the market seems to oppose the expected cyclical price movement. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,500, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

Stellar (XLM) crypto coin has also jumped 9% after a strong volume spike and new partnership with AEON Group. Both ARB and XLM have large user bases and years of development behind them. What they likely cannot deliver now are gains beyond 1,000% to 1,500%. That kind of growth usually comes from early-stage entries, though these can be hard to spot. Web3 ai ($WAI) helps with that. It uses AI to study each new crypto presale, searching for strong potential before the rest of the market reacts. The system is now analyzing its own live presale, where early participants could lock in a planned 1,747% ROI. Arbitrum Technical Analysis Shows a Possible Turn Recent Arbitrum technical analysis suggests ARB might be setting up for a real reversal. After months in a downward channel, the token climbed 18% over the last week and is now trading close to $0.33. This move is similar to what was seen in September 2024, raising questions: is this the start of a true recovery or just a short-term bounce? The RSI is now above 50 for the first time this year, and MACD indicators are starting to flip positive. If momentum continues, the Arbitrum technical analysis points to $0.47 as the next barrier, and possibly $1.20 if the wider market improves. Stellar Crypto Coin Sees Uptick After New Deal The Stellar (XLM) crypto coin has jumped 9% after breaking resistance at $0.2495 and is now holding near $0.2725. Volume rose over 50% in the last day, signaling higher interest and placing XLM in a potential breakout position. This move is also tied to its new deal with AEON Group, a major South Asian retailer planning to roll out XLM payment support in Malaysia by year-end. With increased trading and a strong technical setup, the Stellar crypto coin may test the $0.31 mark if this pace keeps up. Web3 ai Breaks Down What Makes a New Crypto Presale Worth It Presales often deliver the biggest returns. But they also bring the most confusion. Every project seems exciting. Every roadmap sounds big. Every token looks like the next hit, until it falls short. Web3 ai’s ICO & Token Sale Advisor helps clear that up. It reviews each new crypto presale in detail: token setup, wallet movement, team records, contract safety, and how people are talking about it online. The AI checks if the numbers make sense, if the liquidity holds up, if the users are real, and whether the project can actually build what it promises. The system also reads the tone and focus of the online talk using natural language processing. It tracks wallet activity and liquidity flows. If something feels off, it flags it early. Though it’s made to review outside projects, Web3 ai’s own launch is now getting attention too. The $WAI token is in Stage 1 of its presale at $0.0003. By the time it lists, the price is expected to hit $0.005242. That means a 1,747% ROI for early-stage buyers. In crypto, it’s often hard to tell what’s real. Web3 ai helps make that clearer with tools designed to separate signals from hype. Quick Recap on What’s Moving ARB has jumped 18% in a week, and the latest Arbitrum technical analysis shows a chance for a move toward $0.47. Stellar (XLM) crypto coin is rising too, up 9% on a strong volume push and new partnership news with AEON. But even solid moves like these don’t match the potential of new crypto presales. That’s where Web3 ai stands out. Its AI tools review and rank the best presale cryptos , and now the platform is launching its own. The $WAI token is priced at $0.0003 in Stage 1 and is projected to reach $0.005242. That points to a 1,747% ROI for those who understand one thing: in crypto, timing is everything.

Solana (SOL) is once again testing upper resistance zones, but it’s not the only name showing strength. Ethereum (ETH) , XRP , VeChain (VET) , and Cardano (ADA) are all making compelling moves—while rising contender MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly positioning as a top early-stage opportunity. MAGACOINFINANCE – A Rising Force in Early-Stage Strategy Away from the high-profile headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as a smart alternative with serious upside. Backed by over $7.8 million raised , organic traction, and consistent ecosystem development, this project is not riding hype—it’s building substance. Early discussions across online forums, social analytics, and influencer watchlists suggest MAGACOINFINANCE may become one of the standout stories of 2025 . For investors entering at this stage, the positioning could be optimal before broader market exposure. Buyers stepping in now receive an exclusive 50% token bonus —activated using promo code MAGA50X . This reward is available for a short period before official listings begin, allowing early adopters to maximize potential ROI ahead of public exchange access. Solana and Ethereum Maintain Institutional Appeal Solana has reclaimed major support, now hovering just above $150 . Analysts are watching for confirmation of a breakout, which could push targets toward $205 and $250 in Q2. Ethereum holds firm near $1,837 , driven by growing staking participation and the anticipated proto-danksharding upgrade. XRP Drive Real-World Integration XRP is trading around $2.15 , gaining traction as ETF-backed futures and institutional integration become reality. A confirmed move past $2.45 could signal the next wave of bullish activity, especially as Ripple continues expanding its global payment solutions. Cardano and Optimism Expand Utility Cardano (ADA) recently broke past $0.70 , supported by over 130,000 active smart contracts and expanding infrastructure. The focus on scalable dApps through Plutus has strengthened ADA’s position heading into summer, with targets around $0.75–$0.80 now in play. Optimism (OP) continues to benefit from Ethereum’s broader adoption wave. With TVL rising and major apps like Uniswap , Synthetix , and Base relying on its scaling framework, Optimism remains a top Layer-2 contender with room to grow in Q2. Final Thoughts Solana may be leading the charge, but it’s far from the only asset gaining traction in 2025. Ethereum, XRP, VeChain, Cardano, and Optimism each bring credible upside, rooted in utility and adoption. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE continues to rise—purposefully, strategically, and with growing conviction from smart investors seeking the next breakout narrative .

All eyes are fixed on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of expected timelines for a decision concerning these products. At the moment, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP remain key for several institutional players seeking exposure to the market. Solana ETF Odds Top The Chart Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas posted the current odds for possible spot altcoin ETF approvals. In a recent X post, Solana bagged a 90% approval chance after several filings from firms including Grayscale, VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, Canary, etc. Similarly, Litecoin holders expressed optimism as the chances of the asset’s ETF approval are also at 90%. With upcoming SEC deadlines, traders have repositioned holdings along the prevailing sentiments. Final SEC deadline for Solana is Oct 20, while the Commission will make a decision for Litecoin products before Oct 2. Meanwhile institutional favorite asset XRP trails the top two with odds at 85%. This year, speculations on Polymarket also hit similar figures. After the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF till June 17, users sparked a conversation on the approval process. Balchunas also tipped the confirmation of SEC Chair Paul Atkins as a major determinant for approval. “ We also had the SEC delay decisions on Ethereum Staking and Dogecoin ETFs today. I am expecting more delays today, or at least this week, on some Solana and Hedera/HBAR ETF filings. This is expected IMO. Final deadlines for most of this stuff are in October 2025 or later,” Bloomberg’s James Seyffart added. In recent months, institutional appetite for altcoin products has soared after the massive success of Bitcoin products. Last year, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded nearly $40 billion, pushing the asset to new all-time highs. The Trump Effect Boosts Odds Approval odds are soaring as high as 90% as the White House takes a friendly approach to crypto regulation. Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum products got approved before Trump’s second term, but came with a major hassle, including lawsuits before the approval. Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler imposed stricter restrictions, which many considered roadblocks to innovation. However, Trump’s second term has turned the tide in the industry’s favor with pro-crypto appointments and policies. The formation of a crypto task force alongside a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve fueled market optimism.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Litecoin|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|LTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-04 19:07:19

Qubetics Joins Top Altcoins for Big Return Potential in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-eos-early-qubetics-joins-top-altcoins-for-big-return-potential-in-2025/,"Remember when EOS came out swinging and then skyrocketed past $20, leaving early buyers grinning and everyone else watching from the sidelines? If you’re still kicking yourself for letting that early opportunity pass, you’re not alone. So many people wrote off EOS back when it was still under the radar, thinking they had time — until they didn’t. The real sting wasn’t just in the price surge, but in the fact that EOS showed what happens when a high-utility blockchain project gets real traction. It’s the same pattern repeating now — just with a different name. That name? Qubetics . And unlike EOS, this one’s still in its presale phase, but not for long. This isn’t one of those meme-fueled, short-burst coins. Qubetics is solving serious problems with serious tech — built to support secure, efficient tokenization of real-world assets. With over $16.6 million raised and the Qubetics presale already in its 32 stage, it’s already proven there’s demand for its vision. But here’s the kicker: the next stage is just around the corner, with each one increasing the price by 10%. That means buyers today are still getting a discount most will miss out on if they wait another week. If you’re looking at the top altcoins for massive return potential in 2025, this presale is your second chance — and second chances don’t stick around forever. Qubetics Presale: One of the Top Altcoins for Massive Return Potential in 2025 Missed the whitelist phase? Yeah, that one stung. Early participants scooped $TICS for just $0.01 when Qubetics kicked off its presale back in September 2024 — and they didn’t even need to spend upfront. That opportunity’s long gone, but you haven’t completely missed the train. Top altcoins for massive return potential are starting to reveal themselves, and Qubetics is making some serious noise right now. The Qubetics presale is live at its 32nd stage, offering $TICS tokens for just $0.2093. With over $16.6 million already raised, 25,600+ community members backing it, and more than 510 million tokens snapped up, it’s clear this isn’t just hype. If you’re eyeing the best crypto presale, this is your window — because once the mainnet drops in Q2 2025, the early movers could be sitting on some wild gains. ROI projections show that a $1 price after launch would already mean a 377.76% return, but if $TICS hits $5, $10, or even $15, the returns shoot up to 2,288.80%, 4,677.59%, and a jaw-dropping 7,066.39% respectively. To make it real simple: if you tossed just $100 into the Qubetics presale today, you would lock in around 477.80 $TICS tokens. If Qubetics only reaches $5, your $100 turns into $2,288.80. Push it to $10, and you’re looking at $4,677.59. And if it really rides the momentum toward $15 post-mainnet, that same $100 would become a crazy $7,066.39. It’s these kinds of setups that separate the dreamers from the doers — and why Qubetics is already ranking among the top altcoins for massive return potential in 2025 . The real standout, though, is Qubetics’ application: its tokenization marketplace. This isn’t some future roadmap promise — it’s already in motion. Qubetics lets users tokenize physical and digital assets, creating a secondary market where value can be exchanged securely and efficiently. Think about an art collector in New York who wants to fractionalize ownership of a $500,000 painting, or a property owner in Dubai who needs to open up their real estate to global buyers. With Qubetics, both can do it — and manage ownership digitally through a wallet built right into the platform. Even small businesses, like a startup selling intellectual property or licensing deals, can raise funds by offering tokenized shares of their IP. It’s this kind of real-world use that separates hype from utility, and Qubetics is one of the only presales right now offering this kind of tangible value. That’s exactly why it’s being called the best crypto presale of 2025. EOS: A Lesson in Missed Crypto Goldmines EOS is the classic example of how quickly doubt can turn into regret. Launched in June 2017 with a token sale that stretched over a full year, EOS made headlines for raising more than $4 billion — and then went on to surge past $20. That might sound like a distant memory now, but back then, a ton of people shrugged it off at its ICO price, which was just about $1. When it finally took off, early buyers saw insane gains that changed their whole financial picture. Those who dismissed EOS as “just another ETH clone” missed out on one of the biggest returns the crypto market had ever seen at the time. But EOS also shows how important timing is. By the time most people started paying attention, the price was already in double digits, and the low-hanging fruit was gone. Even now, EOS has a solid presence in the space with a highly active developer community and growing support for decentralized applications. It hasn’t disappeared — it matured. And it serves as a sharp reminder: if a token has solid fundamentals and solves real problems, early adoption always pays. The people who bet on EOS before it exploded didn’t have to wait years for returns. They just had to be early. Sounds familiar? That’s because Qubetics is starting to walk the same path. Your Last Chance Before It’s Another “I Could’ve Bought It Cheap” Story Regret has a funny way of repeating itself in crypto. One minute you’re watching a token sit under $0.25, and the next, you’re reading articles about how it became one of the top altcoins for massive return potential. EOS taught us that. Now Qubetics is handing you a similar setup — and this time, you’ve got all the data in front of you. The Qubetics presale has raised over $16.6 million, with 510 million tokens already distributed across more than 25,600 holders. It’s not a theory. It’s happening right now, and you still have a window to get in. This is your chance to join this best crypto presale before the next price jump. The projected ROI speaks for itself: 377.76% at just $1, and an insane 7,066.39% if $TICS hits $15. If you’re looking to position yourself in one of the top altcoins for massive return potential, then Qubetics shouldn’t just be on your radar — it should be in your wallet.

At the same time, Bitcoin Pepe, an innovative layer 2 solution on the Bitcoin network, is making waves with its ongoing presale , promising to revolutionise meme coin trading. In this article, we look into the price predictions for both Arcblock and Bitcoin Pepe, exploring their recent performances and potential future trajectories. Arcblock price prediction Arcblock (ABT), a pioneering platform in the blockchain 3.0 space, has ignited the crypto community with a staggering 46.4% price surge in just 24 hours, reaching a high of approximately $1.38 according to CoinMarketCap data . This explosive growth is underscored by a substantial increase in trading volume, which soared to $12.78 million, signalling heightened market interest and investor enthusiasm. From a technical analysis point of view, ABT has achieved a massive breakout above key moving averages—MA-7, MA-50, and MA-100—indicating strong bullish momentum that could propel the token even higher. Currently trading around $1.19–$1.21, ABT is bouncing back from a crucial support level at $0.61, with its sights set on the $1.92 target. The rising volume, coupled with Bitcoin’s continued strength, is adding fuel to this upward trajectory, suggesting that ABT’s rally may be just beginning. As a blockchain 3.0 platform, Arcblock is positioned at the forefront of decentralised innovation, and its recent performance reflects growing confidence in its long-term potential. Traders should keep a close eye on Bitcoin dominance, as shifts in market sentiment could fine-tune entry points for maximising gains. With a market cap of approximately $117.43 million and a circulating supply of 98.55 million tokens, ABT’s fully diluted valuation stands at $221.63 million, offering room for further appreciation. The token’s all-time high of $4.69, reached in May 2024, serves as a reminder of its potential, even as it currently trades 74.7% below that peak. However, with its all-time low of $0.0495 in March 2020, ABT has already demonstrated a remarkable 2297.7% recovery, underscoring its resilience and growth trajectory. Bitcoin Pepe outlook Away from Arcblock, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is a groundbreaking layer 2 solution built on the Bitcoin network, designed to bring the high-octane meme coin trading experience to crypto’s most secure and established blockchain. By fusing Bitcoin’s unparalleled security with Solana-like speed and scalability, Bitcoin Pepe aims to become the ultimate hub for meme coin enthusiasts, offering lightning-fast transactions and ultra-low fees. Currently in its presale phase, BPEP is generating significant buzz as the first-ever meme-centric ICO on the Bitcoin ecosystem, with the potential to unlock $2 trillion in dormant BTC capital for meme trading. The presale is structured into 30 stages, each featuring a 5% price increase, providing early investors with a unique opportunity to capitalise on incremental gains. As of now, the presale has raised $7,626,945 out of a $7,787,500 target, with the current price at $0.031 and set to rise to $0.0326 in the next stage. Notably, early investors stand to gain over 300% by the launch date, making it an enticing prospect for those seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Beyond the presale, Bitcoin Pepe’s roadmap includes a DEX and CEX listing in Q2 2025, followed by the launch of its layer 2 bridge and DEX unveiling, positioning it for substantial growth. The PEP-20 token standard, a key Bitcoin Pepe’s innovation, allows for the seamless launch of meme coins on Bitcoin, ensuring the network’s longevity and relevance in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. With a total supply of 2.1 billion BPEP tokens, 50% allocated to the presale, and additional allocations for staking, liquidity, and development, the project is well-structured for sustainable growth. Bitcoin Pepe’s mission to onboard the next billion users by providing a retail-friendly trading experience, backed by Bitcoin’s security, makes it a compelling investment opportunity. As the crypto market gears up for what could be the final year of the bull cycle, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as a project that bridges the gap between meme culture and Bitcoin’s enduring legacy, offering investors a chance to be part of the future of meme coin trading.

(ZachXBT Weighs In),https://cryptopotato.com/did-a-330-million-scam-fuel-moneros-xmr-50-price-surge-zachxbt-weighs-in/,"A social engineering scam has resulted in the loss of over $330 million in BTC from an elderly investor based in the United States. The stolen amount, totaling 3,520 BTC, was drained from a wallet that has been mainly inactive since 2017. Details of The Exploit According to findings shared by blockchain detective ZachXBT on April 28, following the theft, the stolen crypto was moved through at least six centralized exchanges before being converted into Monero (XMR), a privacy-focused digital currency that makes tracking transactions difficult. Further, the large volume of the transaction caused the token’s price to spike by 50% due to limited liquidity. The on-chain investigator later revealed that the victim was an elderly individual living in the United States. The theft took place over the weekend through a highly deceptive social engineering attack that led the target to give up access to their wallet unknowingly. Such scams often use emails or phone calls to fraudulently extract personal or confidential information. Hackers Identify Remains Unknown The investigation into the theft remains ongoing, with ZachXBT actively tracking the situation. He previously noted that the stolen BTC originated from “interesting” sources, raising suspicions about how the funds were initially acquired. Further, while some X users speculated that North Korea’s Lazarus Group may have been involved, the sleuth has ruled them out. He instead suggested that independent bad actors were the most likely culprits. This isn’t the first major social engineering attack in the crypto space this year. In February, ZachXBT also uncovered a scheme that involved Coinbase users getting their crypto stolen through such exploits. Between December 2024 and January 2025, these individuals collectively lost $65 million in such incidents. Overall, the crypto industry has been heavily hit in the first quarter of 2025. According to a recent report by blockchain security firm PeckShield, over $1.6 billion in digital assets were stolen through hacks during the period. Most of those losses came from the Bybit exploit, which accounted for more than 92% of the total, making the case one of the largest crypto thefts on record. In January, bad actors made off with over $87 million, but February saw a surge in activity, with $1.53 billion stolen. Further incidents added another $126 million in losses, including a $50 million exploit targeting Infini, a $9.5 million hack on zkLend, and an $8.5 million breach at Ionic.

The correlation between Bitcoin and other major digital assets like XRP suggests that broader market movements driven by Bitcoin could significantly impact XRP’s valuation. Ark Invest’s Updated Bitcoin Forecast Ark Invest, a leading investment management company, recently revised its long-term outlook for Bitcoin in its “Big Ideas 2025” report. The firm outlines three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s performance by the year 2030. In the most conservative case, Bitcoin could rise to between $300,000 and $500,000. The base case anticipates a price of approximately $1.2 million. However, in the most optimistic projection, Ark Invest expects Bitcoin to reach $2.4 million, implying a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72% from current levels. At present, Bitcoin trades at around $96,199. Achieving the $2.4 million mark would represent an increase of 2,394.83%. Such a surge would likely influence the broader cryptocurrency market, particularly assets with historical price correlations to Bitcoin, including XRP. The Relationship Between XRP and Bitcoin Movements Historical data shows a strong directional link between the performance of Bitcoin and XRP. Over recent months, XRP has consistently mirrored Bitcoin’s price trends, although some minor deviations have occurred. This trend suggests that major rallies in Bitcoin typically coincide with upward momentum in XRP. This correlation indicates that if Bitcoin were to experience exponential growth, XRP could also undergo a significant price increase. However, this dependency also means that XRP remains vulnerable to potential downturns in Bitcoin’s value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Potential Based on Bitcoin’s Projected Growth Should the token track Bitcoin’s 2,394.83% growth trajectory, its price could increase proportionally. With XRP currently trading at $2.20, a comparable gain would elevate its value to approximately $56.75. Achieving this valuation would position the token’s market capitalization at around $3.3 trillion, surpassing the current total capitalization of the entire crypto market. Some analysts support the possibility of XRP reaching such levels. Market commentator Cryptominder has forecasted that the asset may enter the $50 price range by 2030. Meanwhile, analysts at Changelly also consider this level attainable but expect the timeline to extend further. Their projections estimate a maximum XRP price of $50.12 by February 2033. At the time of reporting, the token holds a market share of roughly 4.31%. If this dominance remains constant as the token appreciates to $56.75, the global crypto market capitalization would need to expand to approximately $72.5 trillion. In this scenario, Bitcoin , assuming it maintains its current dominance of 63.9%, would have a market cap of about $46.6 trillion. Although speculative, these figures highlight the possible market dynamics if Ark Invest’s bullish prediction for Bitcoin materializes and XRP follows a similar growth pattern.

Analysts are crunching numbers to predict future prices for major coins. Solana and Ethereum are under the spotlight. Could Solana reach $600 and Ethereum hit $10,000 in this cycle? This article delves into the potential growth of these digital assets and assesses their realistic targets. Solana Price Action and Key Market Levels Solana gained nearly 25% in the past month while losing about 7% over the past six months. A small one-week dip of 2% shows short-term fluctuations amid stronger monthly gains. The performance figures point to active investor participation in a fast-changing market. Recent price moves indicate upbeat momentum over the month but challenges on a longer-term basis, resulting in mixed overall results. The current price sits between $109 and $171, with key levels to watch at a support area around $71.65 and resistance near $194.93. Market signals are mixed as the neutral RSI combines with a slightly negative momentum reading. Bulls and bears are contesting control, suggesting sideways movement. Traders might consider opportunities within these ranges and look for breaks above resistance for further upside. Ethereum's Recent Gains Amid Long-Term Downturn Over the past month, Ethereum has shown a modest increase of 1.46%. In contrast, the last six months marked a notable decline of 23.01%. Price activity indicates short-term momentum nudging prices higher within a range from $1,468 to $2,037.37. These figures suggest some resilience amid significant long-term pressure. Current levels show key thresholds with support at $1,142.20 and primary resistance around $2,280.58. A secondary resistance is identified at $2,849.77, with lower support near $573.01. Indicators like an RSI of 58.50 and a nearly neutral recommendation point to a market lacking a clear trend, presenting trading opportunities within these ranges. Conclusion Both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to show potential for significant growth. While $600 for SOL and $10,000 for ETH are ambitious targets, market dynamics and technological advancements make these figures achievable. Monitoring their developments and adoption rates will be key to understanding their future. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While its current price action has remained relatively stable, interest in its future growth remains strong. A recent theoretical comparison involving the U.S. M1 money supply sheds light on just how high the value of XRP could climb if it were to capture a significant portion of the global liquidity used for transactions. Evaluating XRP in the Context of M1 The M1 money supply in the United States includes the most liquid forms of money: physical currency in circulation and demand deposits such as checking accounts. According to CEIC Data , the M1 supply stood at $18.4559 trillion as of January 2025, reflecting a slight increase from the previous month. This figure has been used by analysts to gauge potential upper-limit valuations for cryptocurrencies with aspirations to serve as global payment solutions. XRP, often promoted as a real-time settlement asset with cross-border capabilities, has been included in these discussions. As of early 2025, XRP trades around $2.23 and has a market capitalization of approximately $130.4 billion. The token has a circulating supply of roughly 58.39 billion, with a total supply approaching 100 billion. Projected Values Based on M1 Equivalence Assuming XRP’s market capitalization were to equal the U.S. M1 money supply of $18.4559 trillion, two scenarios emerge depending on the supply figure used in the calculation. If the calculation is based on the total supply of 99.98 billion XRP tokens, the resulting price would be around $186 per token. Alternatively, if only the circulating supply of 58.39 billion is considered, the projected price per token would rise significantly to $316. These estimates are hypothetical and rely on the assumption that XRP could command a market capitalization equivalent to the entire U.S. M1 money supply. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Long-Term Analyst Forecasts Some cryptocurrency analysts maintain a bullish outlook on XRP’s future price potential. According to forecasts from the crypto exchange Changelly , XRP could reach a maximum price of $315 by February 2040, which closely aligns with the $316 theoretical target based on the circulating supply calculation. Changelly also predicts that XRP could hit the $186 level as early as January 2040, reflecting its potential based on total supply valuations. However, not all analysts share this optimistic perspective. Telegaon, a digital asset forecast platform, offers a more conservative view. Their estimates suggest that XRP might reach a maximum of $160 by 2040. While they believe $186 may be attainable, they project that it would occur sometime between 2040 and 2050. Telegaon analysts remain doubtful that the $315 valuation is achievable, even in the decades beyond 2050. While the notion of XRP reaching valuations in the hundred s of dollars may seem speculative, comparing its potential market cap to benchmarks like the U.S. M1 money supply provides a useful framework for understanding its theoretical ceiling. The real-world likelihood of such growth depends on adoption rates, regulatory clarity, and the token’s role within the broader financial ecosystem. As it stands, the asset remains a topic of debate among analysts, with predictions ranging from cautious optimism to bold long-term expectations.

According to a report from the Financial Times, the agreement, which was signed on May 4, was done in the hopes of moving the Maldives away from reliance on tourism and fisheries by attracting foreign direct investment into blockchain and Web3 technologies. The project outlines plans for the Maldives International Financial Centre, an 830,000-square-meter facility that will reportedly employ up to 16,000 individuals. Completing the project will take an estimated five years and the capital requirements for the ambitious development are more than the $7 billion in annual gross domestic product (GDP) of the Maldives. The geographic location of Maldives. Source: Worldometer The planned crypto hub reflects the growing importance of the crypto industry worldwide. However, the Maldives' ambitions to become a global center for financial technology must contend with well-capitalized, established jurisdictions like Dubai, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Related: Slovenia’s capital of Ljubljana ranked as world’s most crypto-friendly city Established crypto and fintech hubs already on the scene Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is a rapidly growing crypto and Web3 hub thanks to its positive regulatory environment that encourages innovation and a local government willing to explore blockchain technology in real-world applications. On April 6, Dubai's Land Department (DLD) and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) signed an agreement to connect the land registry to blockchain , allowing for more comprehensive real estate tokenization. Hong Kong has also positioned itself as a crypto hub through proactive regulations that have attracted hundreds of Web3 and fintech firms. According to Ivan Ivanov, global CEO of WOW Summit, a blockchain conference in Hong Kong, the special economic zone leverages its position as a bridge between Western economies and China to attract investment and serves as a regulatory sandbox. Singapore is also a major international crypto center , with dozens of digital asset exchanges based inside the country and hundreds of Web3 firms headquartered there. The country continues to attract global investment through a regulatory approach that encourages technological experimentation without fear of regulatory reprisal.

Experts Think So,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-one-of-these-2-cryptos-repeat-dogecoins-doge-legendary-2021-run-experts-think-so/,"Pepe Coin (PEPE) is gaining traction as a potential successor to Dogecoin’s legendary 2021 run. Analysts predict that PEPE’s price can reach as high as $0.00006 by mid-2025, proposing over a 500% gain from the current level. PEPE’s recent breakout above a multi-month downtrend and the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, typically suggestive of strong upside momentum, reinforce this bullish forecast. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also attracting investor interest with its promising prospects in the DeFi lending and borrowing sector. Already in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025 per token, the project has attracted over 9,400 investors and has raised over $7.5 million. There is a 20% price increase to $0.03 in Phase 5, and a 140% return at launch for investors who buy today. Investor interest in Mutuum Finance is rising fast as its presale gains serious traction. At the current price of $0.025, buyers are positioning themselves for a 20% gain when Phase 5 launches and pushes the token to $0.03. With a planned market launch at $0.06, Phase 4 investors are eyeing a potential 140% ROI. Over $7.4 million has already poured into the project from more than 9,400 backers, and that number continues to grow. Buy-and-Distribute Model Driving Long-Term Value One of the platform’s standout innovations is its Buy-and-Distribute strategy. Through this mechanism, Mutuum Finance actively purchases market tokens and redistributes them to stakers, ensuring constant engagement and strengthening the project’s tokenomics. This system not only manages supply in a smart way, but also offers sustained rewards, making it appealing for long-term participants. In a market often dictated by hype and volatility, Mutuum Finance introduces a stabilizing force grounded in continuous utility. To deepen user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently launched a leaderboard dashboard that highlights the top 50 MUTM holders in real-time. Those who maintain their positions will receive additional rewards, adding a gamified edge that boosts loyalty and community involvement. CertiK Audit Brings Added Security and Trust Security is another key focus for Mutuum Finance. The team has partnered with blockchain security leader CertiK to carry out a full smart contract audit. Once completed, the audit results will be published on Mutuum’s social media channels to give the community full visibility and peace of mind about the safety of their investments. mtToken System Unlocks Passive Yield Without Locking Assets Mutuum’s mtToken technology also raises the bar for passive income in DeFi. This feature allows users to tokenize assets like ETH and DAI into mtTokens that earn yield while remaining fully liquid and accessible. It’s a flexible, high-return system that lets users put their crypto to work without giving up control. For borrowers, Mutuum’s system is just as appealing. It offers loans like $5,000 USDT backed by $7,000 in ETH collateral, using a secure loan-to-value ratio that keeps the process transparent and low-risk. The protocol’s approach to lending is both practical and progressive, offering a clear alternative to outdated centralized systems. Pepe Coin (PEPE) is generating buzz as a potential Dogecoin successor, with analysts predicting a 500% gain by mid-2025. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also catching the eye of investors, thanks to its strong DeFi lending model. With $7.5M raised from 9,400+ investors, MUTM is priced at $0.025 in Phase 4, set to rise by 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5, offering 140% ROI when it lists at $0.06. Mutuum Finance’s Buy-and-Distribute strategy and ongoing CertiK audit add value, while its mtToken technology allows users to earn passive yield without locking assets. With growing interest and unique features, Mutuum Finance could be your next big opportunity, get in now before prices rise further.

Injective cryptocurrency jumped nearly 10%, breaking out of a six-month slump and reaching $9.49, but it now tests major resistance at $10. The SUI price surge and Injective’s uptrend show strength, but markets often react fast to rumors and short-term spikes. Web3 ai ($WAI) is built to give users more clarity, combining market data, liquidity flow, and sentiment analysis in one tool. As traders guess what comes next, Web3 ai’s presale stays focused on numbers. It offers a Stage 1 price of $0.0003 with a launch target of $0.005242. That points to a 1,747% ROI. Could this make WAI the best presale crypto to buy now? Keep reading for more insight. SUI Price Surge of 26% Follows Pokémon Crossover Buzz The SUI price surge of 26% came after online talk began about a possible link between the Sui blockchain and Pokémon. This followed new privacy terms and deleted blog content, leading some to believe a partnership may be in progress. As a result, SUI broke above $3.00. The excitement pushed daily volume above $128 million and brought increased whale activity. Analysts say that if the trend continues, the SUI price surge could extend to $3.80 or even $4.00 by early May, depending on how the rumors develop. Injective Cryptocurrency Shows Strength, $18 in Sight Injective cryptocurrency broke its six-month downtrend, gaining nearly 10% in a day and pushing toward a possible new trend. INJ now trades at $9.49, and volume jumped to $135 million, showing buyer interest is rising again. Analysts are watching the $10 level. If Injective cryptocurrency breaks this line, the next key target could be $18 in the weeks ahead. If not, it could drop toward $6, meaning price action in the coming days may shape INJ’s direction for the near future. How Web3 ai Connects Fast Data to Fast Trades in One Step Finding the right data in crypto is one challenge. Acting on it quickly is another. Many investors get stuck between the two. They end up switching between news updates, portfolio tools, DEX trackers, and wallet apps just to keep up. Web3 ai removes that delay. This platform helps traders go from signal to action without extra steps. It pulls in real-time data from blockchains, liquidity flows, sentiment trends, and market news, turning it into direct insights. If a trade opportunity shows up, users see it when it matters. If risks shift, the system gives immediate portfolio advice using predictive tools instead of guesswork. No need to check five tabs or worry about missing key signals. Web3 ai connects research, analysis, and execution in one place. Each tool feeds the next, making trading decisions possible in microseconds. The $WAI token gives full access to this setup after Web3 ai launches. It’s now priced at $0.0003 in Stage 1 of the presale, with a planned launch price of $0.005242. That jump points to a 1,747% return for those who join before Stage 1 ends. Web3 ai is more than a tool for faster trading. It is also a presale path where early users could secure one of the strongest ROIs in today’s crypto space. Quick Changes Show Why Timing Still Matters The 26% SUI price surge on Pokémon news shows how fast sentiment can grow, and how much of crypto still depends on speculation. Injective cryptocurrency’s rise is more stable, but now INJ must pass $10 to reach $18. If it fails, it could fall back to $6. This is what crypto investing looks like. Even when things seem strong, weak points can show up fast. Web3 ai helps traders deal with that. It connects research, risk checks, and execution in one system, so trades happen before the chance disappears. For those asking what the best presale crypto to buy now is, Web3 ai’s Stage 1 presale gives a clear option: a 1,747% ROI locked in before launch.

33767162,[object Object],1746388804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Bill Backlash: Senators Warn Stablecoin Act Isn’t Safe,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bill-backlash-senators-warn-stablecoin-act-isnt-safe/,"What began as a promising effort to apply transparent rules to crypto and stablecoins has run into a serious roadblock. On May 4, 2025, ten US Senators came out swinging against the revised version of the “GENIUS Act,” stating that it might do more harm than good. The action, according to an X post by crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett, caught many off guard, particularly because some of the individuals on the list had supported the bill just weeks earlier. Among the opposing critics are four Democrats—Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Marilyn Strickland Kim, and Lisa Blunt Rochester—who were all in support of the bill in March in the Senate Banking Committee hearing. NEW: Senator @RubenGallego and nine other senators just issued a joint statement regarding the updated text of the GENIUS Act that was released last week, saying they cannot support the bill in its current form. The group notes several concerns, including insufficient… pic.twitter.com/876m4wCVda — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) May 3, 2025 Their change adds fresh weight to mounting concerns the proposed rules have the potential to undermine anti-money laundering protections and put financial stability at risk. Angela Alsobrooks, a co-sponsor of the bill from its inception, refused to sign the opposition letter. Senators’ Alarm Bells Ring Over National Security And AML Loopholes From the joint statement issued by the senators, the latest draft bill omits essential safeguards. The concerns of theirs are most prominent regarding national security and a weak presence of anti-money laundering (AML) protections. They also cautioned against ambiguous regulations that may expose crypto markets to exploitation. The legislation, technically titled the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act ,” was proposed in February 2025. Supporters said it would allow the US to remain competitive in financial technology without endangering consumers. But this latest backlash is an indication lawmakers are not all on the same page when it comes to “safe.” Crypto Investors Left In The Dark Again? The backlash adds more unpredictability into an already volatile crypto market. Only one day before the senators issued their statement, the new language in the bill was revealed. Traders and investors who were awaiting clarity are now left waiting once again. If lawmakers cannot make up their minds on the gist of the bill, it may be months before any version gets signed. That sort of delay can be damaging. Payment stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar and are frequently employed as a haven in times of turbulent market fluctuations. Without clear direction from legislators, crypto exchanges and developers might be reluctant to develop or expand within the US. The backlash is notable because it occurs as the Senate is attempting to rush the bill through — and as news organizations investigate US President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures and potential connections involving his relatives. AI And Blockchain Projects Could Feel The Heat Among the bill’s objectives are spurring innovation where blockchain and artificial intelligence intersect. That’s why opposition from the senators is causing eyebrows to be raised in the tech community, as well. Tokens backing AI programs created on blockchain could be indirectly impacted if money and policy backing become mired in Washington’s political stalemates.

Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 522,200 followers on the social media platform X that he’s looking at a setup that has previously triggered a 6x surge for BTC. According to TechDev, Bitcoin went on a rampage in 2020 as global liquidity erupted and gold ignited a huge upside burst. “Time to realize you’ve been right here before. Last time gold went parabolic as global liquidity surged out of its retested breakout… Bitcoin launched 500%.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev supports his bullish stance on Bitcoin by pointing out that BTC has historically witnessed huge upside gains whenever global liquidity goes parabolic, just as the business cycle bottoms out. Global liquidity refers to the amount of money sloshing in the world’s financial system, while the business cycle tracks the rise and fall of economic activity over time. “This chart says the largest Bitcoin move in five years has begun.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst believes that the abundance of funds amid surging global liquidity and the reallocation of capital from gold to Bitcoin would serve as tailwinds for BTC’s ascent to new record levels. “Gold goes parabolic > Liquidity breaks out > Flows to BTC + rotation from gold sends BTC parabolic Not an original story.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $95,925.

This development comes after an old man in his late fifties had his fingers chopped off by his abductors, who demanded ransom from his son, who was a crypto millionaire. Paris Man Mutilated in Targeted Attack on Crypto Family According to a report , the man whose identity was not revealed had been kidnapped on Thursday morning around 10:30 a.m., as he walked along a street in Paris. Four men in ski masks forcibly took him into a delivery van to a house in the south of Paris. The police rescued the man after two days in captivity with his abductors. Notably, the French police stormed the house, which is about 20 KM south of Paris, at 9 p.m. on Saturday. The authorities arrested five suspects in the house, all in their twenties. Local reports stated that the kidnappers demanded a ransom of €5 – 7 million from the son, who is a crypto millionaire. The money they demanded was wired to them, but it had reportedly not been paid before the arrest. The man’s wife informed police investigators that her husband and son jointly owned a firm in Malta that was into crypto marketing. She explained that they had received threats before the current incident. Previous Case Involved Ledger Co-Founder David Balland This is not the first incident of crypto-related abduction in the country. Notably, on January 21, 2025, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, was also abducted along with his partner from their home in the early hours of the morning. Although Balland was released the next day, the kidnappers also chopped off his finger, while his partner was found tied up inside the trunk of a car. Balland’s abductors had demanded about €10 in ransom to be paid in cryptocurrency from his business partner. The criminals had sent a video of the chopped finger to Balland’s business partner along with their demand. Are Criminals Shifting from Online Hacks to Physical Threats? Outside of France, Dean Skurka, WonderFi Technologies CEO, was also abducted in Toronto and had to part with $720,000 to secure his release. These developments suggest that criminal elements likely target crypto holders and demand payments due to its anonymity. It also highlights a daring shift from online hacking attacks, which resulted in over $9 billion in losses , to an offline strategy.

That’s exactly the opportunity traders see unfolding now. With Ethereum (ETH) price analysis showing strength above $1820 and the latest XRP price prediction pointing toward a liquidity-driven rally, eyes are now turning to BlockDAG . Its Buyer Battles feature has transformed its presale into a high-stakes game of rewards and rapid growth. BDAG is holding at a limited price of $0.0019 until May 13, with whales already stacking up while daily rewards hit upto $62,500. Analysts are calling for $1+ after launch, and this might be the final moment to buy under a cent. For those seeking bullish crypto coins 2025 , this might just be the biggest sleeper hit hiding in plain sight. BlockDAG Buyer Battles Push $0.0019 Offer Into Final Countdown Among all bullish crypto coins 2025 , BlockDAG is creating the most buzz right now. Its presale offer sits at just $0.0019, but only until May 13, 2025. This ultra-low entry is creating serious urgency, especially with exchange listings projected to debut at $0.05 and long-term forecasts aiming beyond $1. Traders are seeing this presale as their final shot to get in before the market wakes up. What’s adding fuel to the fire is BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles system. Each day, 25 million BDAG are up for grabs. If the daily allocation doesn’t sell out, the biggest buyer scoops up the remaining bonus. Some participants have already claimed up to $62,500 in extra BDAG just by topping the leaderboard. This daily contest is attracting whales, all racing to buy while prices remain low and rewards are still flowing. To date, BlockDAG has raised over $225 million and sold more than 19.6 billion coins. The X1 Miner App has already been downloaded over 1 million times, proving that adoption is underway. With the mainnet approaching, momentum across the app and presale continues to climb. If you’re serious about building a winning portfolio of bullish crypto coins 2025 , now might be the time to act. Once listings go live, the window to score those sub-cent multipliers could close for good. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis: Bulls Eye $3,000 After Breaking $1,875 Fresh Ethereum (ETH) price analysis reveals ETH consolidating above $1820 after a strong move up to $1857. On-chain data looks mixed but tilts bullish, supported by ETF activity like Fidelity’s $5.8 million inflow and indicators such as a 4-hour MACD crossover and an RSI reading of 53.72. Both gas fees and trading volume are up, while selling pressure continues to drop, a clear sign of growing confidence ahead of the May 7 Pectra upgrade, which aims to boost scalability and staking performance. Key resistance to watch is $1875, which aligns with a major long-term trendline. Breaking that opens the door to $2,000, $2,300, and potentially $3,000+. On the downside, strong support lies near $1,500, so as long as ETH stays above that, bulls are in control. Based on this Ethereum (ETH) price analysis , the coin still has solid upside potential, especially if it breaks $1875 and rides the momentum from the upcoming network upgrade. XRP Price Prediction: Liquidity Plays Hint at Major Breakout Potential The latest XRP price prediction highlights a smart liquidity move that swept both ends of the spectrum before reacting at a major supply zone. Price dipped just low enough to trigger stop losses below, then reversed sharply to tap upper liquidity before reacting at a pre-mapped resistance area. Traders following this move scored a textbook 1:3 risk-to-reward play. This is a prime example of how technically tuned XRP has become. Right now, price sits between key liquidity levels above and below, creating tension for the next breakout. This XRP price prediction presents three possible outcomes: a quick dip lower before a strong rally, a fake breakout up before reversing, or continued range-bound action. Success isn’t about guessing, it’s about preparing. Liquidity remains the key driver, and those watching structure and reaction zones are the ones spotting real opportunities. Main Takeaways According to current Ethereum (ETH) price analysis , ETH is building strength above $1820, with bulls targeting $1875 for a breakout that could carry it to $3,000. The newest XRP price prediction shows the token hovering between liquidity traps, setting up for a major move. Both offer solid setups, but neither comes close to the sheer upside potential now forming around BlockDAG. At $0.0019 until May 13, BDAG is drawing attention from serious buyers. But the real buzz is around its Buyer Battles, a daily competition offering $62,500 in rewards and access to a pool of 50 million BDAG. With listings approaching and $1+ price targets gaining momentum, this could be the final chance to claim one of the top bullish crypto coins 2025 before prices leap. ETH and XRP are both worth watching. But if you’re looking for the biggest upside, BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles might just be the move you can’t afford to miss.

In contrast, Cold Wallet ($CWT) takes a different approach with its privacy-first design. It operates on a zero-knowledge basis, ensuring that user data is not tracked, logged, or exposed. With a strong emphasis on user control and discretion, Cold Wallet offers a clear alternative in the ongoing debate between privacy and ease of use in digital asset management. Polkadot (DOT) Breakout Potential Polkadot (DOT) has recently formed a bullish double falling wedge pattern, signaling possible upward price movement. After bouncing back from a key support level at $3.72, DOT is showing signs of gaining momentum, with analysts predicting a breakout toward $10. This optimism is supported by a $100 million asset into Polkadot’s ecosystem and its shift to a zero-inflation model, which is boosting buyer confidence. Additionally, the adoption of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) within Polkadot’s framework is driving increased interest from developers and users. Sui (SUI) Market Watch Update Sui (SUI) is currently consolidating around $2.10, following a decline from its recent peak of $2.60. This drop was triggered by consecutive Break of Structure (BOS) and Change of Character (CHoCH) patterns, leading to a test of the $2.00 support level. Buyers are now watching this zone, trying to absorb selling pressure. In a positive development, Sui has outpaced Arbitrum in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, reaching $432.9 million, compared to Arbitrum’s $203.9 million. Additionally, Sui saw a $60 million stablecoin inflow, boosting its stablecoin holdings to over $800 million. Cold Wallet: The Privacy-First Alternative Web3 Needs Mainstream wallets have prioritized sleek designs and complex analytics, but in doing so, they’ve turned users into mere data points. Every click, transaction, and interaction with decentralized apps (dApps) leaves behind a trail of on-chain activity that is often logged, tracked, and sold. Privacy, once a fundamental principle of cryptocurrency, has become an afterthought. This is where Cold Wallet takes a strong stand. Cold Wallet is more than just another product; it’s a response to the privacy compromises made by popular wallets. Built with a zero-knowledge architecture and designed with a cold-storage mentality, it rejects the surveillance-first approach that dominates the market. There are no trackers, no hidden analytics, and no data collection in the background. Users aren’t just holding keys, but they are also regaining control over their digital footprint. Central to this movement is $CWT, the coin powering Cold Wallet’s privacy-first infrastructure. Currently in its presale stage 2, priced at $0.00714, $CWT grants early supporters access to Cold Wallet’s secure features and governance. When it launches at approximately $0.3571, early adopters stand to see over a 4,900% return on their asset. But this isn’t solely about profit. It’s about backing the only wallet that treats its users as people, not products. Cold Wallet stands in stark contrast to MetaMask. There are no leaks, no exposure, and no compromises. For those who are tired of sacrificing privacy for convenience, $CWT represents more than just a coin. It’s a vote for a new kind of Web3. A Web3 where privacy is built-in, not an afterthought. A Web3 where participation isn’t at the cost of surveillance. This is the counter-narrative, and it’s gaining momentum. A Choice Between Privacy and Control In the ongoing debate of privacy versus participation, the key lies in what the person is willing to give up. MetaMask and similar wallets have prioritized convenience at the expense of data, habits, and on-chain identity. Cold Wallet challenges that model. It doesn’t just store assets, but also safeguards what others often overlook: one’s digital footprint. As surveillance grows in Web3, Cold Wallet doesn’t just provide features; it offers a statement. For users and buyers, the real question isn’t which wallet has more integrations, but which one can be trusted when privacy is at stake.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-futures-traders-on-binance-lean-strongly-bullish-heres-the-implication/,"In a striking show of confidence, over 71.5% of traders with open positions on Binance Futures are currently positioned bullish on XRP , according to insights shared by crypto analyst Ali on X . This data point underscores growing optimism among derivatives traders, reflecting a potential shift in market sentiment as XRP continues to draw attention in broader crypto discussions. A Snapshot of Derivatives Market Sentiment The Binance Futures platform serves as one of the largest venues for cryptocurrency derivatives trading globally, often seen as a bellwether for investor mood in real-time. The latest figures suggest that more than two-thirds of traders anticipate upside price movement for XRP in the near term. This heavily skewed bullish positioning highlights not only investor conviction but also a possible buildup toward increased market volatility. 71.54% of traders on Binance Futures with open $XRP positions are leaning bullish! pic.twitter.com/zDHbN1o1sl — Ali (@ali_charts) May 4, 2025 Such sentiment data is crucial in understanding short-term expectations. Futures markets often reflect the collective outlook of informed speculators, many of whom base their positions on a combination of technical indicators, macroeconomic factors, and institutional news flow. In XRP’s case, this shift comes at a time when developments surrounding ETFs, legal clarity, and increased institutional use cases continue to gather momentum. Driving Forces Behind the Optimism XRP’s growing utility narrative, alongside Ripple’s expanding enterprise network and recent developments in its legal battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has revived investor enthusiasm. Traders may be reacting to speculation surrounding a potential XRP ETF approval and the increasing number of partnerships Ripple has been forging with financial institutions globally. Moreover, as XRP continues to establish itself as a real-time settlement asset within cross-border payment systems, its perceived long-term value proposition strengthens. This underlying use case could be playing a role in shaping sentiment within the derivatives market, where traders often bet on future price direction based on expected catalysts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What It Means for XRP’s Price Action While bullish positioning doesn’t guarantee upward price movement, it reflects a market bias that could amplify moves in either direction. If the bullish expectations are validated by price action or positive news, this positioning could lead to aggressive buying and a sharp rally. On the other hand, overly crowded long positions also raise the risk of rapid liquidations in the event of a sudden downturn, making the market susceptible to sharp corrections. Ali’s observation offers a critical lens into how futures traders are interpreting XRP’s current trajectory. As the market awaits key developments such as ETF approvals and broader crypto adoption trends, sentiment metrics like this will continue to be closely watched by analysts and investors alike. Ultimately, the 71.54% bullish stance on Binance Futures is a snapshot of a market leaning forward, confident, but also exposed to the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency landscape.

Technical signals, market sentiment, and institutional activity are converging across these assets. And while they draw attention at the top, a rising force— MAGACOINFINANCE —is steadily becoming one of the most discussed early-stage altcoins across investor communities. MAGACOINFINANCE – Precision, Clarity, and Early-Stage Momentum While the majors shape market headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining momentum through structured growth and strategic investor engagement. The project has now raised over $7.8 million , reflecting increasing early interest from investors seeking long-term opportunity—not short-term hype. What sets MAGACOINFINANCE apart is its disciplined rollout, consistent branding, and growing community traction. As traders look beyond surface-level marketing and hype cycles, MAGACOINFINANCE is emerging as a rare early-stage altcoin with a compelling foundation, sustainable visibility, and expanding support. XRP and Bitcoin Lead Institutional Narrative XRP , currently priced around $2.15 , is benefiting from increased institutional exposure following the approval of multiple futures-based ETF products. Market watchers have their eyes on the $2.45 resistance level—if breached, a significant inflow of new capital could trigger the next rally phase for XRP. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading just below $95,000 , holding strength after a robust 14.5% gain in April. Analysts now anticipate a move toward the $132,000 level as May unfolds. As ETF participation grows and macro conditions remain uncertain, Bitcoin’s role as a digital macro hedge continues to expand—bringing broader support to the crypto sector as a whole. Solana and Kaspa Offer High-Upside Alternatives Solana (SOL) remains in focus, holding between $145 and $150 following its recent Canadian ETF approval. With growing developer activity and user adoption, analysts are targeting $180 as the next breakout level—and possibly $221 shortly after if volume sustains. Kaspa (KAS) , trading near $0.10 , continues to gain traction as a scalable, proof-of-work-based altcoin using unique blockDAG architecture. Market sentiment remains bullish, with targets in the $0.30–$0.33 range widely discussed among mid-cap investors positioning for asymmetric upside this quarter. Final Thoughts As May continues, the crypto sector is offering multiple entry points across both established assets and emerging contenders. XRP and Bitcoin are solidifying their positions with institutional support. Solana and Kaspa add technical strength and scalability to the mix. But MAGACOINFINANCE is where early-mover advantage may deliver the most dynamic returns. With fundamentals, structure, and vision all aligning—this could be one of the most strategic times to explore what MAGACOINFINANCE is building.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April. In May, TRX is trading near $0.24.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT|BNB|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-04 20:15:00

However, beneath that calm, the network has continued to expand its infrastructure , deepen its DeFi presence, and solidify its reputation for peer-reviewed, secure, and scalable blockchain development. With signs of broader crypto market recovery, ADA appears poised to benefit from renewed capital inflows and bullish investor outlooks. Burke’s forecast—pointing to price levels of $2, $5, $7, and even $12—underscores this shift in sentiment. These figures, while ambitious, are not entirely unfounded given ADA’s historical performance and the ongoing enhancements within the Cardano ecosystem. Network Fundamentals Support Optimism The fundamental growth of the Cardano network may offer validation for the optimism expressed by analysts like Tyler Burke. Over the past 12 months, Cardano has achieved several developmental milestones, including major smart contract upgrades, the growing adoption of sidechains like Hydra, and increasing DeFi total value locked (TVL). These advancements improve scalability and lower fees, positioning Cardano as a serious contender in the next wave of decentralized finance. Moreover, Cardano’s emphasis on academic rigor and methodical updates through its hard fork combinator model ensures network upgrades are not only technically robust but also sustainable. This steady, research-first approach has earned the project a loyal community and long-term credibility among developers and institutional observers. Market Position and Price Targets ADA currently trades well below its all-time high of $3.10 reached in 2021, leaving room for a substantial upside should momentum continue. Burke’s forecast of an eventual climb to $12 represents a potential 10x return from current levels—an outcome that would require not only market enthusiasm but also macroeconomic conditions favorable to crypto adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Still, the speculative nature of such predictions should be tempered with realism. ADA’s future depends not only on Cardano’s technical development and community strength but also on wider adoption, institutional participation, and global regulatory clarity around blockchain assets. Outlook: The Breakout Setup With bullish voices like Tyler Burke’s gaining traction, the market’s eyes are once again turning to Cardano. As the network continues to mature and its ecosystem diversifies, ADA’s price may begin to reflect the underlying value that has been building quietly over the past two years. Whether the token reaches the $12 target or not, one thing is clear— Cardano’s breakout potential is back in the conversation. And with renewed investor interest and promising fundamentals, ADA might just be preparing for its next leg higher.

XRP and MAGACOINFINANCE May Hold the Key,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-820-grow-into-1-5-million-xrp-and-magacoinfinance-may-hold-the-key/,"In a space where timing defines legacy, two tokens are generating investors’ attention— MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and XRP . From historical surges to early-stage hype, the question isn’t just about what to buy, but when to enter. And right now, smart investors are laser-focused on the moment—and the momentum. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is already showing signs of early dominance. With strong organic growth and ongoing analyst chatter, it’s proving to be more than another fleeting trend. It’s quietly becoming a serious contender—and the markets are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token deserves your attention—but this one does. MAGACOINFINANCE is building with consistency: growing wallet adoption, investor retention, and traction across key channels. MAGACOINFINANCE is taking a focused, execution-driven approach—building a utility-first, community-backed ecosystem. That alone sets it apart from countless short-cycle projects looking for quick exits. And now, with XRP also back in the spotlight following bullish ETF sentiment, both tokens are positioned to benefit from a broader shift toward early-entry, high-conviction investments. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a force in decentralized trading—but its upside is now baked into its size and market maturity. Polkadot continues to innovate around cross-chain tech, but it’s on a slower-growth path tied to infrastructure. Bitcoin Cash has use-case strength in peer-to-peer payments, yet its best moments may be in the rearview. Litecoin, though a staple of low-cost, high-speed transactions, is no longer an emerging opportunity. These tokens are battle-tested, but no longer early plays. In contrast, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers ground-floor exposure—something XRP had in its early years and could now be seeing again with renewed energy. Final Thought Can $820 become $1.5 million ? With the right token and the right entry, history says it’s possible. Both MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and XRP have the structure, sentiment, and setup to deliver on that kind of vision. But timing is everything—and early windows don’t stay open for long.

According to crypto analyst Ali , addresses holding large amounts of ADA snapped up over 410 million tokens during the month, taking advantage of the token’s price volatility. Whales accumulated over 410 million #Cardano $ADA in April! pic.twitter.com/8Qa6xCaWtb — Ali (@ali_charts) May 2, 2025 Despite swings triggered by macroeconomic headlines and initial excitement around a crypto reserve initiative, ADA ended April with a 4.6% monthly gain. The scale of accumulation indicates increased confidence in ADA’s mid-term trajectory, particularly from investors with long-term capital. Such buying activity typically precedes structural price movement and reflects repositioning by entities prepared to absorb volatility without immediate liquidity needs. Whale Takeaways: 410 million ADA added to whale wallets in April Price ranged from $0.6247 to $1.19 during the month April closed with a 4.6% net price increase Cardano Price Holds Crucial Support ADA is currently trading around $0.6876, having recently dipped below its ascending trendline support. The 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) now sits slightly overhead at $0.6966, capping bullish attempts. With the price hovering just beneath $0.70, Cardano is testing a zone that could define its short-term trajectory. Momentum indicators are flashing warning signs. The MACD histogram has flipped red, and both signal lines have dropped below zero, pointing to potential weakness. However, support at $0.6704 remains intact—for now. If bulls can push the price back above $0.70, ADA may reclaim its uptrend and retest resistance levels at $0.7268 and $0.7470. A rejection, on the other hand, could drive price action lower toward $0.6430. Key Levels to Watch: Immediate resistance: $0.7014 Upside targets: $0.7268 → $0.7470 Support levels: $0.6704 → $0.6430 Cardano Trade Outlook: Wait for Confirmation For traders looking to capitalize on this setup, patience remains critical. A confirmed breakout above $0.7014 on rising volume would offer a compelling bullish entry, particularly if accompanied by a MACD crossover. Until then, the risk of false breakouts lingers. Cardano Price Chart Source: Tradingview Trade Setup: Entry: Close above $0.7014 Target: $0.7268 → $0.7470 Stop Loss: Below $0.6700 Volume and momentum confirmation will be key signals to watch before entering. With whale support behind the scenes and a potential structural breakout brewing, ADA could be positioning for a strong move—if bulls step up at the right time. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5.28M as Flexible 78% Staking Yield Draws Investors BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is continuing its rapid ascent in the crypto presale landscape, crossing $5.32 million in USDT raised, edging closer to its $6.07 million hard cap. Priced at $0.002495, the token has drawn attention for its practical staking utility, positioning itself as more than a speculative meme coin. As of now, only about $744,000 remains before the cap is reached—highlighting growing demand among retail and yield-seeking investors. Utility-Driven Tokenomics Fuel Demand Unlike typical meme tokens, BTCBULL blends crypto culture appeal with tangible staking rewards. Investors can currently earn an estimated 78% APY while keeping their tokens fully liquid—unstaking is allowed at any time without penalties or lockup periods. This model has resonated with investors who seek yield without sacrificing access, especially in a volatile crypto environment.

After stalling near $95,000 for over a week, Bitcoin broke out to $97,000 before reversing and forming a fair value gap. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Infinity? Venture Capitalist Says Crypto’s Value Vs. Dollar Has No Ceiling This has led to a surge in activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, and the next outlook is whether the current structure holds for a continuation to $100,000 or if this momentum could falter at a zone of resistance. Bitcoin Reaches 6-Month Peak In Network Activity One of the most notable shifts in market dynamics came from the on-chain side. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin just recorded its highest number of active addresses in the past six months. As shared in a post on social media platform X, Martinez noted that 925,914 BTC addresses were active within a single day, which is an unusually high level of engagement on the Bitcoin blockchain. The accompanying Glassnode chart reveals how steep this surge has been, building on a gradual climb that started in the last week of April. Interestingly, the spike in Bitcoin activity coincides with its recent reclaim of the $95,000 price range. Image From X: @ali_charts Adding to the bullish case, crypto analyst TehThomas shared a compelling technical analysis that pointed to a breakout continuation toward $100,000. Interpretation of the BTCUSDT 4-hour timeframe shows an almost identical structure to the one seen in mid-April. Back then, Bitcoin consolidated near $86,000, broke out, left behind a fair value gap (FVG), retested the gap, and rallied nearly $10,000. A mirror image of this pattern is currently unfolding. The Bitcoin price compressed below $95,000, broke through resistance, and created a fresh FVG between $94,200 and $95,000. TehThomas noted that the key is not to chase the breakout but to wait for a clean retest of the new FVG. If buyers defend that area as they did earlier this month, the road to $100,000 is structurally intact. However, even though the structure currently favors the bulls, the situation could turn bearish if Bitcoin drops back into the old range below $94,000. Chart from TradingView Bearish Golden Pocket Setup Highlights Risk Ahead Not all analysts are convinced that Bitcoin will reach $100,000 again without a shakeout first. A counterview on the TradingView platform highlights a possible short-term bearish setup based on the BTCUSDT 15-minute chart. According to the analyst, the current upward retracement appears corrective rather than impulsive, forming a classic short setup within a strong fair value gap resistance zone. Technical analysis shows that Bitcoin has retraced into a region that aligns with a bearish fair value gap and the golden pocket zone defined by the 0.618 to 0.65 Fibonacci levels.

The fundraising move by the firm is an attempt to boost its expansion into HPC and cloud services, as traditional Bitcoin mining becomes less profitable due to tightening margins. The proposed ATM offering would allow Bit Digital to issue and sell shares of its common stock over time through investment bank H.C. Wainwright & Co., which will act as the sales agent and receive a commission of up to 3% on any shares sold. The offering’s size is more than Bit Digital’s current market capitalization of approximately $429 million, and may potentially require existing shareholders to dilute their holdings. According to Bit Digital , the proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures on new mining and cloud servicing equipment, working capital, and potential acquisitions. This fundraising initiative comes amid challenging economics for Bitcoin miners with challenges such as the 2024 Bitcoin halving event, network issues, and increasing operational costs. Mining companies diversify to adjacent sectors In response, many mining companies have pursued equity offerings, debt financing, or convertible notes to support operations and pivot into adjacent sectors like AI and HPC. In the fourth quarter of 2024 alone, public mining companies raised over $1.6 billion via equity financing and more than $4.6 billion via debt financing. Bit Digital’s pivot involves investments in HPC and cloud services. In October 2024, the company acquired Enovum Data Centers , a Tier 3 HPC data center operator, for approximately CAD $62.8 million (USD $46 million). Additionally, Bit Digital entered into a master service agreement (MSA) with Boosteroid Inc ., one of the largest cloud gaming providers, in August 2024. The agreement initiated an initial deployment of 300 GPUs expected to generate approximately $4.6 million in revenue over five years. Cloud and HPC services to the rescue as mining falters For its 2024 fiscal year report, Bit Digital reported a total revenue of $108.1 million, a 141% increase from the prior year’s results. Bit Digital attributed the increase to the commencement of its HPC services business. The company’s liquidity stood at approximately $260.7 million, with shareholders’ equity of $463.5 million. It also made $58.6 million from Bitcoin mining , which was a 32% increase from 2023. Cloud services accounted for $45.7 million in 2024. Thanks to its acquisition of Enovum Data Corp, it made $1.4 million from colocation services. Its ETH staking revenue increased by 169% after it brought in $1.8 million in revenue. Digital Asset mining accounted for 54% of Bit Digital’s revenue source in 2024, which is a major contrast from 2023, where it was responsible for 98% of the company’s revenue. Bit Digital’s HPC business lines, along with its cloud services, generated 42% of its revenue for 2024, with a major portion of the haul coming during the fourth quarter of the year.

According to insights shared by crypto analyst Mintern on X, this emerging paradigm will enable developers to build applications that function fluidly across Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Bitcoin, and other blockchains—all without being confined to the complexities of individual network infrastructures. BREAKING NEWS: CHAIN ABSTRACTION WILL UNITE ETHEREUM, SOLANA, CARDANO & BITCOIN @IOHK_Charles reveals that with chain abstraction, developers can build hybrid applications that operate seamlessly across #Ethereum , #Solana , #Cardano , #Bitcoin , and more, all while paying… pic.twitter.com/J47O32kd1W — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) May 3, 2025 A New Frontier in Blockchain Interoperability Chain abstraction proposes a future where developers can deploy hybrid applications across multiple chains, allowing them to choose the infrastructure that best suits their use case while still offering seamless user experiences. This paradigm doesn’t merely connect blockchains—it fundamentally redefines how applications interact with them. Instead of requiring users or developers to manage wallets, tokens, and transaction fees specific to each network, abstraction layers can streamline operations so that fees and interactions remain localized within a developer’s preferred ecosystem. Hoskinson emphasized that this model empowers developers to create dApps that are not locked into any single chain’s constraints, marking a leap toward true interoperability. “Imagine building a dApp where a user interacts with Bitcoin, but the fees are paid on Cardano,” Hoskinson previously remarked. This shift in design logic would allow for an unprecedented level of flexibility, scalability, and user accessibility in the decentralized application space. Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Bitcoin: United by Abstraction The implications of uniting Ethereum’s robust DeFi ecosystem, Solana’s high-speed performance , Cardano’s academic rigor, and Bitcoin’s liquidity and security are immense. Chain abstraction doesn’t just blur the lines between ecosystems—it potentially dissolves them. By doing so, it enables users to navigate Web3 without being bogged down by the current friction of managing cross-chain assets or understanding the nuances of various protocols. Mintern’s report captures the growing excitement around this movement, hinting that the building blocks for seamless cross-chain interaction are already being laid. With technologies such as sidechains, zero-knowledge proofs, and smart contract compilers becoming more advanced, the concept of chain abstraction is quickly moving from theoretical to practical implementation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities While the vision is bold, the road to complete chain abstraction remains challenging. Critical to its success is the development of secure, scalable middleware that can interface reliably with each blockchain protocol. Furthermore, standardization, governance, and developer tooling must evolve in tandem to ensure that this model doesn’t compromise the decentralization or security of the underlying chains. Still, the progress is encouraging. Projects across the Web3 ecosystem are already working on elements that support this vision, from interoperability protocols like IBC and LayerZero to Cardano’s own Midnight and Mithril initiatives. Charles Hoskinson’s remarks, amplified by Mintern’s coverage, highlight an industry increasingly aligned toward collaboration over competition. The notion that Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Bitcoin could coexist within a unified application framework was once unthinkable. Now, it’s rapidly becoming inevitable. The era of isolated blockchains may soon be behind us. In its place, chain abstraction could usher in a new digital architecture where borders between chains are not barriers, but bridges.

According to Joseilbo, this opportunity will be offered on the condition that institutions establish internal audit mechanisms and strengthen anti-money laundering investigations. The 4th Virtual Asset Committee, chaired by FSC Vice Chair Kim So-young, was held at the Seoul Government Complex on the morning of May 1. The meeting finalized the draft virtual asset sales guidelines for NGOs and exchanges as part of the “Institutional Participation Roadmap” announced at the previous meeting. According to the new guidelines, virtual asset sales will only start with external audit institutions whose operating period exceeds 5 years. However, relevant institutions will be required to establish a “Donation Review Committee” to evaluate the appropriateness of donations and cash-out plans in advance. At the same time, the purpose of the transactions and the source of funds must also be verified. The guidelines for NGOs aimed to create a solid donation culture and prevent money laundering, especially for virtual assets received through donations and sponsorships. The assets subject to donation were limited to those traded on at least three Korean Won exchanges. It was also made mandatory for these assets to be converted into cash immediately upon receipt. Related News: Bad News for Bitcoin (BTC) from Arizona: It Would Have Been a First in History In order to prevent money laundering, verification of the purpose and source of transactions has been strengthened, while a cross-customer verification mechanism has been established between banks, exchanges and institutions by only allowing donations and transfers made through local won exchanges. The guidelines for virtual asset exchanges focused on preventing conflicts of interest with users and minimizing market influence. Only virtual asset operators registered under the “certain financial transaction information law” will be able to make sales, and these sales will only be made to cover operating expenses. The assets that can be sold will be limited to those in the top 20 in terms of market value on the five major Korean won exchanges. In addition, the daily sales limit will not exceed 10% of the total sales plan, and exchanges will be prohibited from selling on their own platforms. *This is not investment advice.

Back then, its modular blockchain architecture was still under the radar. Fast forward to today — those who grabbed a seat early are now sitting on massive gains. It’s a classic crypto déjà vu moment. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines while coins like Celestia blew past expectations, now is the time to stop watching and start acting. The market doesn’t wait around forever, and if history has taught us anything, it’s that the next big breakout doesn’t look obvious… until it already happened. That brings Qubetics into the spotlight — a project that’s flying under just enough radars to still be accessible, yet powerful enough to catch major waves once its mainnet drops. Built to streamline real-world Web3 interactions and unify fragmented blockchain systems, Qubetics offers something most projects don’t: true, working utility. It’s not hype-based — it’s application-focused, and with the Qubetics presale already 32 stages deep, time is slipping fast. This might be your last real window to catch one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025 before it moves into unaffordable territory. Qubetics Presale Isn’t Over — But It’s Almost Too Late to Grab One of the Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025 Those who jumped in early on Qubetics walked away with something rare: the power of hindsight, without needing to wait. Back in September 2024, the whitelist phase quietly opened at just $0.01 per token. No upfront payment. Just a shot to lock in a game-changing asset early. Now? That opportunity’s mostly in the rearview. But not entirely. Qubetics is currently in Stage 32, with $TICS priced at $0.2093, and over 510 million tokens already snapped up. The tally has crossed $16.6 million, with 25,600+ holders showing that serious eyes are already on this project — and why it’s being ranked among the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Let’s talk numbers — because that’s what builds conviction. If $TICS hits just $1, you’re looking at a 377.76% ROI. Push that to $5 post-launch and it climbs to 2,288.80%. At $10? 4,677.59%. And if it mirrors the rise of top Layer 1s and reaches $15, that’s a jaw-dropping 7,066.39% ROI. Let’s say someone throws in $200 at today’s rate — they’re getting 955.66 tokens. If $TICS goes to $10 after mainnet, that’s $9,556.60. That’s the power of entering before the breakout. And here’s the kicker: every 7 days, the price increases by 10%, so delaying even a week can hurt your margin. This is why the Qubetics presale is being tagged as the best crypto presale of 2025 by many early adopters. Beyond numbers, Qubetics is building something with real-world teeth. Its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet simplifies how people handle cross-chain swaps, store assets, and convert to fiat without ever losing control of their funds. And for global businesses? The cross-border payment solution hits differently. Imagine a Dubai-based exporter sending payments to an EU supplier in minutes — without banks, fees, or delays. Or a freelancer in Nigeria getting paid instantly by a U.S. client in stablecoins — minus the mess of centralized exchanges. Qubetics bridges that gap. This is utility in motion, not theory. It’s the kind of thing that turns speculation into long-term value — and exactly why it’s climbing the ranks of top cryptos to buy for 2025 . Celestia: From Early Whispers to Breakout Modular Star Back when Celestia launched, most of the crypto crowd was distracted by Layer 2 hype and meme coin buzz. Meanwhile, early Celestia adopters quietly positioned themselves into one of the smartest bets in recent cycles. Its modular blockchain design wasn’t just new — it was game-changing. Developers could now separate consensus from execution, making it way easier and more efficient to build custom blockchains. The ICO phase was subtle, but those who got in back then have now watched Celestia climb to some of the most talked-about charts across the ecosystem. From launch to its all-time high, Celestia’s journey has been all about defying expectations. It transformed from an underdog to a framework that other ecosystems now want to integrate with. The growth has been organic — driven by dev adoption, high-profile partnerships, and community commitment. Missed that run? You’re not alone. Most didn’t take the modular thesis seriously until it was already mooning. That’s why Qubetics feels eerily familiar. When something is built right but still accessible, it’s not a question of if it’ll take off — just when. Why Qubetics and Celestia Both Prove Timing Is Everything in Crypto If there’s one rule that crypto keeps repeating, it’s this: early conviction pays, hesitation doesn’t. Celestia rewarded the bold. Qubetics is now dangling a similar opportunity, except it’s still early enough for smart moves. Both projects underline one truth — utility-driven blockchains win when others stall. The window to act before mass adoption closes is slim, and right now, Qubetics still offers that edge. Between rising ROI, clear presale metrics, and an actual mainnet launch on the horizon, the math and timing speak for themselves. So if you’re on the hunt for the top cryptos to buy for 2025, don’t let Qubetics slip past your radar like Celestia did for many. It’s not too late to join this best crypto presale , but that won’t stay true for long. Every cycle has a few names that define the year. Qubetics is shaping up to be one of them.

Altcoins including XRP , Polygon (MATIC) , Sei (SEI) , and Arbitrum (ARB) are also drawing increased attention as investor interest spreads across Layer-1 and Layer-2 ecosystems. And while large-cap assets build strength, early-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE are quietly becoming the talk among growth-focused traders. MAGACOINFINANCE – An Emerging Altcoin With a Clear Growth Path Amid all this, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning as one of the most promising early-stage entries of 2025. With over $7.8 million raised , the project is executing with a focus on utility, branding strength, and community-led expansion. What separates MAGACOINFINANCE from speculative trends is its methodical strategy. The project is building visibility not through hype, but through consistent performance and growing traction across digital channels. As altcoin cycles reset, more investors are recognizing the value of discovering early-stage names with strong foundational metrics. Ethereum and Bitcoin Build the Foundation for Broader Market Moves Ethereum (ETH) is currently priced around $1,739 , supported by steady whale accumulation and stronger Layer-2 performance with analysts eyeing a potential push toward $2,500. Bitcoin (BTC) remains above $95,000 , having closed April with a 14.5% gain . Institutional flows through ETFs and growing macro demand have positioned BTC to potentially break new highs in May, with projections targeting $132,000 . Trending Altcoins: XRP, MATIC, SEI, and ARB in Focus XRP is currently around $2.15 , bolstered by ETF approval and growing institutional inflows. Analysts are monitoring the $2.45 resistance level, which could open the door to a multi-week rally. Polygon (MATIC) trades in the $1.02–$1.04 range and remains central to Ethereum scaling narratives. Its partnerships and growing enterprise integrations suggest long-term strength despite recent consolidation. Sei (SEI) holds a stable price near $0.213 . The platform continues to build under the radar, with its infrastructure tailored for high-frequency trading and on-chain finance applications. Arbitrum (ARB) sits near $0.35 after a pullback linked to its departure from Nvidia’s accelerator program. While near-term sentiment is mixed, Layer-2 sector growth could help restore momentum. Final Thoughts With Ethereum and Bitcoin reinforcing the market’s backbone, attention is turning to quality altcoins like XRP , MATIC , SEI , and ARB —each with unique upside potential. But for those seeking something still in its discovery phase, MAGACOINFINANCE may offer the clearest opportunity to enter ahead of the curve.

As the market buzzes with speculation, eyes turn to Shiba Inu and PEPE , wondering if they can ride the wave. This article explores the potential for growth and what might be in store for these promising cryptocurrencies. DOGE Price Movement Reflects Steady Gains Amid Fluctuation DOGE prices showed an 8.19% gain over the past month and a 10.65% increase over the last six months, despite a slight 3.36% drop in the previous week. The price movement indicates gradual gains with brief pullbacks, reflecting ongoing fluctuation and consolidation. Overall, there has been no extreme volatility, showcasing a relatively stable performance. Current trading finds DOGE moving between $0.1371 and $0.2002. Key resistance is at $0.2281, while support stands near $0.1019. The market shows a balance between bullish efforts and cautious selling pressure. It may be beneficial to consider buying near support and watching for a breakout above resistance, as the trend remains uncertain. Pepe Coin: Recent Gains, Weekly Drop, and Six-Month Flat Trend PEPE saw a 21.79% increase over the past month paired with a recent 11.11% weekly decline. Over the past six months, the coin edged up by about 2.46%, reflecting a mix of quick gains and steep pullbacks that underscore its volatile nature. Price movements during these periods display alternating bursts of strength and marked corrections. Currently, the price trades between $0.00000647 and $0.00001057, with resistance at $0.00001223 and support at $0.00000404. Bears appear to hold sway in the shorter term, yet the monthly recovery hints at some bullish activity. Traders could consider entering near support and taking profits at resistance while keeping a close watch on developing trends. Shiba Inu Analysis: Recent Gains Amid Bears and Key Levels SHIB recorded a 7.36% gain over the past month alongside a 22.17% decline over the last six months. Price movements show a mix of short-term strength and longer-term setbacks. The coin displayed volatility with upward bursts countered by deeper retracements, underscoring a fluctuating market sentiment. Current action centers on a resistance at $0.00001789 and support near $0.00000795, with additional levels at $0.00002286 and $0.00000298. A weekly loss of 7.21% and a negative momentum indicator point to bearish pressure despite an RSI of 51.25. Cautious trading is recommended within these bounds, focusing on potential rebounds or breakdowns between key levels. Conclusion Dogecoin 's recent surge could set a trend for other cryptocurrencies. SHIB and PEPE might rise if they follow the same pattern. Observing their market moves and trends is crucial. The growth of DOGE may inspire confidence in these tokens. This positive momentum might encourage more investments and development in SHIB and PEPE. However, past patterns are essential to consider in predicting future outcomes. All three are worth keeping an eye on in the evolving market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to reporting from Le Monde, the May 3 raid resulted in five arrests. Local outlet Le Parisien also said the kidnappers demanded between 5 million and 7 million euros, or up to $7.9 million, to release the captive man. Although the details on the identity of the victims remain scant, likely for security reasons, the crypto entrepreneur and his father co-owned a crypto marketing firm based in Malta, French media reports. This incident features similarities to the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland in France in January 2025. Balland was also held for a crypto ransom until he was freed by law enforcement officers in a rescue operation. Unfortunately, this latest incident also follows a string of similar ransom attempts around the world targeting crypto users and their loved ones in an attempt to extort funds from individuals perceived to hold a sizable amount of wealth.

Six individuals in Chicago, Illinois were charged in February 2025 with the kidnapping of a family and their nanny in exchange for a crypto ransom. According to an FBI report, the kidnappers forced their way inside the Chicago home by pretending they had accidentally damaged the family's mechanical garage door. Once inside, the suspects forced the family into a van and abducted the family for five days before forcing them to surrender $15 million worth of cryptocurrencies to secure their release. Online streamer Amouranth was the victim of a home invasion in March 2025 when several armed suspects held her at gunpoint and demanded the keys to her cryptocurrency.

According to Wedson, movement has begun in the altcoin market and this trend may accelerate further in the coming months. Wedson defined June and July as the starting point of the altcoin season, and evaluated this period as the process of “exit from the accumulation zone.” The CEO, who predicted that interest in altcoins would peak in August and September, described this period as a phase in which Memecoin, GameFi and DeFi projects would shine. Expecting the Bitcoin dominance to fall rapidly, Wedson claimed that the altcoin rally would continue.

Stating that Bitcoin is not preferred for daily transactions due to its technical limitations, the CEO used the following statements: “Today, the vast majority of crypto transactions occur over networks like Ethereum, Tron, and BSC.

This marks a 27.3% increase compared to the $72.6 million reported last year in the same month. Compared to previous months in 2025, the figure more than doubled from March’s total of $41.4 million. Losses Surpass 2024’s Full-Year Total According to the latest report from the blockchain security platform Immunefi, the year-to-date total stands at $1.74 billion. This is already higher than the full-year total of $1.49 billion in 2024, which was previously considered the worst hit year in crypto-related hacks. Further, the survey highlighted that the figure represents a fourfold increase from the $420 million recorded during the same period last year. Most of April’s setbacks came from just two incidents; blockchain payments platform UPCX suffered the largest single hit, losing $70.0 million, while decentralized exchange KiloEx followed with $7.5 million in losses. Other affected platforms included Loopscale ($5.8 million), ZKsync ($5.0 million), and Term Labs ($1.5 million). Additional cases were recorded across Bitcoin Mission ($1.3 million), The Roar ($790,000), Impermax ($152,200), Zora ($140,800), and ACB ($84,100). Hacks continue to be the predominant cause of losses as opposed to fraud, with 100% of the attacks being exploits. Notably, no incident recorded in April targeted centralized platforms. The affected players were exclusively from the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sector. Ethereum and BNB Chain were the most targeted blockchain networks, together accounting for 60% of the total. The former recorded five incidents, representing 33.3% of the total, while the latter followed with four, or 26.7%. Base experienced three incidents (20%), while Arbitrum, Solana, Sonic, and ZKsync each recorded one. More 2025 Exploits Outside of April, the crypto industry has been heavily hit in the first quarter of 2025, with the Bybit hack standing out as the largest. In this incident, bad actors took advantage of a vulnerability in the exchange’s hot wallet infrastructure, executing multiple transactions to steal $1.46 billion. Infini was also targeted , with the attackers making away with $50 million after they manipulated vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. The exploit caused major disruptions, leaving users unable to access their funds for several days. Meanwhile, DeFi lending platform zkLend fell victim to a $9.5 million flash loan attack that drained its liquidity pools. Ionic also experienced an $8.5 million loss after exploiters compromised a private key, gaining unauthorized access to wallets and transferring funds externally.

Maldives signs $9 billion deal to become international crypto hub The government of the Maldives signed a $9 billion deal with Dubai-based family office MBS Global Investments to develop a crypto hub in the island nation's capital of Malé and to attract foreign investment opportunities. Part of the development deal includes plans for an 830,000-square-meter facility used to house and host blockchain, crypto, and Web3 firms. Maldives sits between Africa, Asia, and Australia. Source: Worldometer According to the Financial Times, which first reported the story, the deal was signed in the hopes of diversifying the Maldives' economy away from tourism and low-margin exports like providing fishing stock. The project's total funding will exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Maldives, which is around $7 billion annually. Pro-crypto Democrats pull support for stablecoin bill in last minute A group of US Senate Democrats known for supporting the crypto industry have said they would oppose a Republican-led stablecoin bill if it moves forward in its current form. The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico. Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made. Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March. The bill, introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty , is formally known as the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. A copy of the statement.

I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post. Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,” Xu said. In what is now an unavailable X post, but was screenshotted by Xu, Sun had earlier claimed that OKX has not responded to a “freeze notice” sent to its official email address from a “relevant law enforcement agency.” Sun said that he had no other way to contact OKX’s compliance department. “These stolen funds do not belong to me; I’m acting to protect the community,” Sun said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-04 21:47:02

This surge in accumulation has caught the eye of many in the crypto community. Could this lead to a strong upward trend for these coins? Find out which cryptocurrencies might be on the brink of notable growth and what this could mean for the market. Cardano: Surge Over Six Months with Recent One-Month Correction Cardano experienced a decline of 0.71% in the past week but has grown by 7.67% in the last month and risen by 115.33% over the past six months. The price data reflects a trend of steady growth, with short-term fluctuations indicating that the coin has gained significant momentum. Despite this impressive performance, recent trends show a mild correction, creating a potential shift in market sentiment. Currently, the coin trades between $0.547 and $0.781, with resistance around $0.88 and a further level at $1.11. Support levels are identified at 0.41 dollars and a lower level near $0.18. The indicators suggest a lack of a clear trend, with bulls attempting to break above $0.88 while bears may look to test the $0.41 support for short-term opportunities. Polkadot Price Momentum Hits Key Levels Amid Market Adjustments DOT experienced a modest 1.23% decline over the past month with a sharper weekly dip near 5.87%. A 6.65% gain over the last six months signals underlying strength. Price action has ranged between $3.41 and $4.54, reflecting a mix of corrections and gradual build-up over time. Current levels place immediate support at $2.77 and resistance at $5.03, with further limits at $1.64 and $6.16. The coin shows neither a clear bullish nor bearish trend, as indicators signal a mix. Traders may find opportunities by watching these critical levels for a reversal or continuation pattern, especially with expectations for broader altcoin season enthusiasm. Conclusion Recent movements in the crypto market show increased accumulation of ADA and DOT by large holders. This often indicates strong confidence from major investors. Such behavior has historically preceded significant price rises for these coins. If past trends are any guide, ADA and DOT may be on the verge of entering a bullish phase. This could present a notable opportunity for those tracking market dynamics and looking for broader growth signals. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While giants like Cardano (ADA), Floki (FLOKI), and Toncoin (TON) have carved their niches, all eyes are on an underdog that’s performing well, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.025, MUTM is rapidly gaining traction, and experts predict a jaw-dropping 60x upside as it disrupts the DeFi market. Its decentralized lending platform is already turning heads, attracting over 9,400 investors and raising more than $7.5 million in its ongoing presale. Currently priced at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token is set to climb to $0.03 in Phase 5, a 20% increase, before its projected launch at $0.06. For Phase 4 participants, that could mean a 140% return on investment. Cardano, Floki, and Toncoin: Strong Coins for Crypto Growth in 2025 Cardano (ADA), sitting at around $0.69, remains the long-term investor’s favorite as far as scalability and sustainability are concerned in blockchain technology. As a focus on smart contracts and decentralized applications, ADA has an incredibly solid groundwork that continues to make it center stage, especially with upcoming improvements. Floki (FLOKI), however, sitting at a paltry $0.000084, has been rapidly developing a passionate following, all due to its highly community-centric approach and ever-growing ecosystem. Its meme-based origins combined with novel utility projects cause it to possess vast growth potential. Lastly, Toncoin (TON) at $3.19 is also cementing itself as one of the leading decentralized networks with great speed and scalability. As all these projects toil towards milestone milestones, their growth trends in 2025 are optimistic. But of course, they all have great futures, and investors need to keep an eye out for future alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is going to cause a stir in the next couple of months. Presale Momentum Builds in Phase 4 The excitement around Mutuum Finance keeps building as its presale gains traction. Selling at $0.025 during Phase 4, the token has already attracted strong interest from more than 9,400 participants and continues to pull in capital, crossing the $7.5 million mark. With the next phase set to raise the token price by 20%, early investors are positioning themselves for significant gains. To further boost user engagement, Mutuum Finance recently rolled out a new dashboard that features a live leaderboard of the top 50 token holders. Those ranked in the top 50 will be eligible for bonus tokens, adding a gamified twist that not only incentivizes holding but also builds community loyalty and long-term participation. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is breaking new ground in decentralized lending by combining the benefits of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models into a single, powerful hybrid framework. In the P2C model, users can earn passive income by staking stablecoins like USDT in smart contract-managed liquidity pools, while also enabling fast, permissionless borrowing for others. On the other side, the P2P option eliminates intermediaries altogether, letting borrowers and lenders negotiate directly and privately. This dual-model setup brings a higher level of decentralization, flexibility, and efficiency. Whether you’re a cautious investor looking for predictable returns or someone seeking more control and yield, Mutuum Finance offers a tailored solution that meets both ends of the risk spectrum. It’s a DeFi platform built for inclusivity and autonomy, two pillars the current financial system often lacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set for 60x upside, currently priced at $0.025. With $7.5 million raised from 9,400+ investors, the token is set to rise to $0.03 in phase 5 and $0.06 at launch, offering 140% ROI for early investors. While ADA, FLOKI, and TON have growth potential, Mutuum’s unique hybrid lending model and gamified incentives make it a standout. Get in now before it’s too late.

However, the altcoin failed to end the month in profit, making April its fourth consecutive month with a negative performance. According to the latest on-chain data, the Ethereum price seems to be sitting above a crucial support level, which could determine the altcoin’s trajectory over the next few weeks. ETH Price At Risk Of Falling To $1,772 In a May 3 post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the price of Ethereum might be at a critical juncture that could decide its short-term future. Based on the latest on-chain data, the altcoin is at risk of falling to around $1,500 should it lose this support level in the coming days. This on-chain evaluation of the Ethereum price revolves around the average cost bases of several Ethereum investors. In crypto trading, cost-basis analysis determines a price level’s capacity to serve as support or resistance based on the volume of coins last acquired by investors in the region.

The larger the circle, the higher the amount of tokens bought in and around the price zone, and the stronger the resistance or support level. According to data from IntoTheBlock, more than 6.36 million ETH tokens were purchased by 4.5 million addresses within the price range of $1,772 and $1,824 (at an average price of $1,799). As explained earlier, the high buying activity within this price zone has led to the formation of a major support level just beneath the current price. The Ethereum price is expected to bounce back when it falls to this level. The rationale behind this expectation is that when the ETH price returns to around $1,772, investors with their cost bases in and around this level are likely to defend their positions by buying more tokens, helping the price to stay afloat the support region. However, the highlighted chart shows that the price levels beneath the $1,772 support level have significantly less investor activity. This suggests that the Ethereum price could fall to around $1,500 without catching a break if $1,772 is breached. On the flip side, the price of ETH could travel to as high as $2,100 if this support level remains unbreached, as no significant resistance lies ahead. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the ETH token is valued at around $1,830, reflecting an almost 1% increase in the past 24 hours.
