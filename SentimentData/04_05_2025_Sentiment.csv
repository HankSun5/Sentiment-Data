This is reflected in the recent rise of the Fear and Greed Index, a popular tool that measures market sentiment. A higher score typically signals increased optimism, which often leads to stronger buying activity. Bitcoin has also broken through the 94000 resistance level and is moving closer to reaching its all-time high. Historically, when Bitcoin gains upward momentum, it tends to spark activity across the altcoin market. As capital shifts from Bitcoin into other tokens, altcoins begin to rise. In many past cycles, memecoins have outperformed the rest of the market, delivering some of the highest returns. With sentiment improving and Bitcoin climbing, the conditions are setting up for another potential altcoin season where memecoins may once again take the lead. A strong contender for the next 1000x token of 2025 is capturing attention as investor interest in altcoins returns. SOLAXY offers solutions to Solana’s long-standing network bottlenecks Solaxy is stepping into the spotlight with a mission to solve Solana’s most pressing issues, including congestion, low throughput, and scalability hurdles. Its goal is to deliver a faster, more sustainable blockchain environment. While the project appeals to developers and infrastructure-focused backers, another rising token is gaining serious momentum with a more narrative-driven and utility-first approach. That project is Pepeto. PEPETO rises as a top memecoin pick with real use cases and early-stage accessibility At a presale price of just $0.000000126, Pepeto presents a low-barrier entry for investors seeking high upside. With the launch of PepetoSwap, a zero-fee trading platform, and the rollout of Pepeto Exchange, the project is building an ecosystem that supports more than just memes. It’s combining functionality with cultural relevance. Pepeto also leans into its mythology. With a total token supply identical to Pepe’s 420 trillion, speculation suggests a connection to someone formerly involved with Pepe. The storyline goes that Pepe stole four foundational components, but failed to capture two critical ones: Technology and Optimization. Pepeto, on the other hand, embodies Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, a more complete vision. Pepe may have walked away thinking he took everything, but by leaving the last two keys behind, he left the true core untouched. PEPETO presale enters final phase with major exchange updates approaching Investors can still buy $PEPETO at $0.000000126 directly from pepeto.io . Purchases can be made using USDT, ETH, BNB, or with credit/debit cards via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. As PepetoSwap nears its public rollout and listing announcements continue, early holders are in line to receive staking rewards and exclusive benefits within the growing ecosystem. Pepeto is shaping up to be one of the standout tokens of the coming bull cycle.

This previously improbable recovery is now accentuated by the premier cryptocurrency’s likely return to above the important $100,000 level. However, the Bitcoin price appears to have its hands full in its quest for a six-figure valuation in the near future. The latest on-chain data suggests that the market leader’s price is currently wedged within a significant range, which could determine its movement over the next few weeks. ‘Pretty Much Blue Skies Above $100’ For BTC – Analyst In his recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Checkmate shared an interesting on-chain insight, saying that the Bitcoin price is “working its way” through the $93,000 and $100,000. This on-chain observation is based on the supply distribution heatmap, which shows the concentration of coins acquired at different price ranges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally The deep red shades on the distribution heatmap represent high volumes of coin activity, indicating that large clusters of investors have their cost bases in this price range. These cost bases clusters act as psychological and technical resistance zones, as investors are likely to sell when prices return to their purchase prices. As shown in the chart above, there is a significant supply barrier for the Bitcoin price in the $93,000 – $100,000 region. This suggests that the premier cryptocurrency faces significant potential selling pressure due to investors looking to break even after being in the red for so long. Interestingly, the distribution heatmap shared by Checkmate shows that beyond the $100,000 threshold, the Bitcoin supply significantly declines. This suggests low historical buying activity (lower coin amounts being held) above this price level, meaning relatively less significant resistance. Ultimately, a breach above the $100,000 mark could be the beginning of a strong upward rally for Bitcoin price, as Checkmate noted that “blue skies” is what lies beyond the psychological price level. However, failure to break out of the $93,000 – $100,000 region could result in another extended consolidation period. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,680, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the flagship cryptocurrency is up by more than 2% on the weekly timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Running Out Of Time’?

In the past few days, we have seen a consistent outflow of Ether from centralized exchanges, and that is reinforcing the bullish narrative. It seems that more and more, investors are choosing to store their assets off exchanges. Not only is this a typical sign of reduced short-term selling pressure, but it also seems to indicate increased confidence among investors in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Net outflows from centralized platforms over the past week alone have totaled nearly $380 million worth of ETH. This sizable move adds more fuel to the fire of our ongoing accumulation trend, one whose early stages resemble a bullish cycle. In historical terms, when we see large outflows from exchanges, it typically means price increases are on the way. The most likely reason for this is that holders are moving their assets either to cold storage or to staking contracts, which means they’re not planning to sell anytime soon. Ether keeps flowing out of centralized exchanges. In the last seven days alone, net outflows have topped roughly $380 million worth of ETH, adding weight to the ongoing accumulation trend pic.twitter.com/bpTmTNvSFa — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) May 2, 2025 Whales Step In as DeFi Bridges Capital for ETH Buys Several prominent whale deals have emerged that reveal just how much Ethereum is being bought up by the wealthy and, in some cases, even the super-wealthy (thanks to recent drops in the NFT markets, we’re looking at at least one DeFi platform in the very near future that will make none of us wealthy). On-chain monitoring service Lookonchain recently let the world know about a handful of big ETH buys that they figure involve some sort of leverage. In one such deal, an address known as 0xDdb4 took out a loan for 3.44 million USDC from Aave and right away used the immediately available cash to purchase 1,856 ETH. This is aggressive buying and shows that the investor has strong conviction in ETH’s near- to mid-term potential; otherwise, why not go for something safer when deploying from a leveraged position? The 0xDdb4 address didn’t just do leveraged buying—it did so with a large amount of ETH. Whales have been buying $ETH in the past 2 hours! 0xDdb4 borrowed 3.44M $USDC from Aave, then spent 3.44M $USDC to buy 1,856 $ETH . 0xf84d borrowed 1.64M $USDC from Aave, then spent 2.34M $USDC to buy 1,259 $ETH . A newly created wallet(0x69D0) withdrew 2,250 $ETH ($4.12M) from… pic.twitter.com/r3kvW8N32i — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 1, 2025 Similarly, wallet 0xf84d borrowed 1.64 million USDC but spent 2.34 million USDC to acquire 1,259 ETH — which means the investor either added their own capital to the borrowed funds or went for several rounds of borrowing. More than a hunch, these back-to-back, big-money buys signal something else: the sophisticated investors behind these wallets are positioning for an imminent upwards move in the value of ETH. On-chain drama in the crypto world intensified on December 13 as a wallet labeled 0x69D0 emerged to withdraw 2,250 ETH from the Binance exchange. That single transaction saw the new wallet take possession of a sum worth approximately $4.12 million at the time of withdrawal. It’s unusual for a freshly created wallet to handle such a large sum, and the large withdrawal serves to heighten the mystery of where all that Ethereum is actually going. A transaction of this sort, especially when coming from a wallet just set up for the occasion, could naturally invite speculation. On May 1, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $422 million, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading the day with $351 million in net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $6.4932 million, with only Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) experiencing a net… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 2, 2025 Spot Ethereum ETFs Begin to Attract Capital From an institutional perspective, Ethereum is making strides in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) arena. The latest data from May 1 shows that spot Ethereum ETFs have seen a total net inflow of $6.4932 million, indicating a swell of interest from traditional investors who want ETH exposure without the fuss of directly holding the asset. While the amount is slight when contrasted with the influx into Bitcoin ETFs, it nonetheless establishes Ethereum as a more favored target for institutional investment than it was just a couple of years ago. Inflows into the Grayscale Ethereum Trust on the same day, by contrast, looked rather unimpressive, with the slow-moving vehicle essentially suffering from a lack of confidence. The fund’s discount to NAV and its not-so-young structure seemed to have more to do with the trust’s woeful approximation of a true investment vehicle for ETH than any sort of serious doubts about ETH itself. Spot ETFs provide a gateway into the world of cryptocurrencies that is regulated and safe. This is something we have not had up till now. And in the United States, the regulatory environment is everything but safe and certain for hedge funds, pension plans, and other large institutional investors looking to open up shop in the world of cryptocurrencies. These three types of investors—the traditional financial world in which we all live—are the ones for whom this adoption metric really matters. Conclusion: Strength Behind the Scenes Although Ethereum’s price action remains bound to shakeouts from the broader crypto market or regulatory run-ins, the signals coming from the on-chain data and institutional inflows are putting together a pretty clear bull case. From whales deploying millions in leveraged buys to on-ramping by ETFs to consistent outflows from exchanges, there’s a pattern of accumulation underway. Should these trends continue, not only might Ethereum put in a strong performance in the months ahead, it might do so on a basis that is not merely speculative. The retail and institutional players in this market might be making and might be about to make, in numbers that are way more than just a couple of punchlines in a Twitter thread, the kind of informed bets that suggest real and not just apparent moves in the market.

The video featured Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, explaining the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to drop its appeal against Ripple in the long-running enforcement action. Why did the SEC dropped its appeal against Ripple? pic.twitter.com/SbtnikhBYj — Uphold (@UpholdInc) May 2, 2025 Alderoty Raises Concerns About the SEC’s Approach In the video, Alderoty acknowledges the toll the case has taken. Rather than simply focusing on why the agency abandoned its appeal , he challenged the SEC’s rationale for bringing the lawsuit in the first place. His message emphasized that the SEC had acted without providing legal clarity, targeting crypto companies under laws that had not been clearly defined. Alderoty pointed out that the SEC had ended its action against Ripple and had “dropped every case against every crypto company in the United States.” The regulator began this trend shortly after Donald Trump’s inauguration in late January, dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase , Gemini, and many other crypto companies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Alderoty said the shift reveals a fundamental flaw in the agency’s enforcement strategy: it pursued penalties without establishing clear legal standards. According to him, the law must be communicated before it is enforced. “You can’t bring enforcement actions for violating the law without first explaining what the law is,” he said. Ripple Plans to Refocus on Business and Policy With the SEC’s legal efforts concluded, Alderoty said Ripple will now focus on resuming normal operations and advocating for clear legislation. He noted the importance of stepping away from litigation and returning to business, while helping to shape the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. This includes working with lawmakers to promote a policy framework that protects consumers and the broader financial system while supporting innovation. Alderoty and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse have also met with Trump personally , and the community is excited about where the crypto market is heading. Alderoty stated that Ripple will “clean up the mess” caused by years of legal uncertainty and plans to contribute to crafting smart regulations that protect customers, preserve the market’s integrity, and keep bad actors out. This next phase will emphasize collaboration with Congress to develop regulatory clarity for digital assets. As attention now turns to Congress, the focus will be on enacting legislation that supports innovation while protecting consumers.

These are the projects that get attention not just from developers and enthusiasts but from entire industries. XRP and Immutable X have earned their reputations for different reasons: one reshaped global finance, the other redefined NFT infrastructure. But a new name is buzzing across Latin American circles and beyond— Qubetics . And this one isn’t just showing potential; it’s living it. From presale stats to multi-chain wallet functionality, Qubetics is checking all the right boxes for the next 100x candidate. Qubetics (TICS): Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Puts It Among Top Cryptos with 100x Potential For a crypto project to offer true breakout potential, it has to solve practical issues—not just technical ones. Qubetics is leading that charge with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet , a tool that gives users full control over their assets across different blockchains, all in one place. Picture a logistics startup in Panama working with smart contracts on Ethereum, payment systems on Solana, and supply chain data on Avalanche. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and platforms, they can now manage, move, and monitor assets securely using the Qubetics wallet. It’s designed for speed, ease, and serious control—no middlemen, no third-party risk, and no logins that compromise user sovereignty. Even for casual adopters or solo freelancers in places like Lima or Bogotá, the wallet makes crypto simple and safe. Whether it’s swapping tokens, staking, or signing contracts, everything flows through a single dashboard that supports multi-chain interaction and real-time tracking. It’s also mobile-optimized, so users aren’t tied to desktop environments that can lag or fail during high-volume periods. That blend of security, autonomy, and flexibility is why Qubetics is making waves as one of the top cryptos with 100x potential. The infrastructure is already running, and its presale performance is setting records. Qubetics Presale Details & Analyst Forecasts The Qubetics crypto presale is in Stage 32. So far, more than 510 million tokens have been sold to over 25,600 holders, raising upwards of $16.6 million. $TICS is currently available at $0.2093. Analysts across Latin America and Europe are spotlighting this early-stage momentum. If $TICS reaches $1, early adopters could be looking at a 377% ROI. If the token hits $5, returns climb to 2,288%. At $6, $10, and $15, buyers could see potential gains of 2,766%, 4,677%, and 7,066%, respectively. With a working product, growing community, and demand-driven adoption curve, Qubetics isn’t speculating. It’s building—and it’s one of the clearest contenders for a 100x breakout. XRP: The Standard for Global Payments and Institutional Integration XRP is far from a new face in crypto, but its relevance hasn’t faded. Developed by Ripple Labs, XRP is best known for its use in cross-border payments and remittance services that challenge outdated systems like SWIFT. It delivers low-cost, near-instant international transfers, with liquidity provided by its native token. Its primary appeal lies in partnerships. From major financial institutions to central banks, XRP has built relationships that many projects only dream of. In countries with complicated banking systems, like Argentina or Venezuela, XRP’s use in remittance corridors has opened access to faster, cheaper money transfers that traditional banks simply can’t match. It also runs on the XRP Ledger, which is lightweight, scalable, and designed for enterprise-grade financial movement. Unlike many proof-of-work chains, it offers high throughput and stability without sacrificing decentralization. Among Latin American community members, XRP is often viewed as one of the few cryptos that blends compliance with disruption. That makes it a staple in any conversation about infrastructure-ready projects—and a long-term contender in discussions about the top cryptos with 100x potential when factoring in scale. Immutable X: Where NFTs Meet Speed and Scalability Immutable X has positioned itself as the gold standard for NFT infrastructure—especially for high-volume, gas-free transactions. Built on Ethereum Layer-2 via zk-rollup technology, it enables creators, studios, and marketplaces to mint and trade NFTs with zero gas fees while maintaining security and immutability. Where many Layer-1 chains fumbled under NFT congestion, Immutable X thrived. Its protocol is specifically designed for scalable NFT deployment. Think about a game developer in Buenos Aires building a fantasy RPG that issues thousands of in-game NFT assets. Immutable X offers a platform where those items can be minted and traded without wrecking the user experience. From top-tier gaming partnerships to integrations with DeFi and entertainment platforms, Immutable X is more than hype—it’s infrastructure. Its commitment to environmental sustainability (carbon neutrality) and its frictionless minting model make it accessible for creators and powerful for platforms. The combination of tech and adoption means Immutable X continues to be a heavyweight in the Web3 development scene. And while it may not be as flashy as some meme tokens, its architecture, performance, and purpose land it firmly among the top cryptos with 100x potential in the near future. Final Thoughts XRP, Immutable X, and Qubetics are all bringing something powerful to the table. XRP continues to lead global financial dialogue with banks and payment systems. Immutable X is defining the rules for NFT ecosystems. But Qubetics is quietly building the glue that could connect them all. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet doesn’t just offer another way to hold tokens. It gives users, businesses, and developers real autonomy in a cross-chain world. When combined with the momentum of its presale, the technology behind Qubetics is something early adopters aren’t ignoring—they’re acting on it. For those searching for the top cryptos with 100x potential , Qubetics isn’t just in the conversation—it’s controlling the mic. And with Stage 32 still open, there’s time to grab $TICS before the window narrows.

At this moment, sharp investors are monitoring five names that may drive the 2025 narrative: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , Ethereum , and the rising force that is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While the dominant players continue to show resilience, it’s newer tokens like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the outsized upside potential. The early-stage window is narrowing—and those who’ve played this game before know that timing can define outcomes. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Plenty of projects launch with noise and vanish. Not this one. MAGACOINFINANCE is methodically building momentum—organically and strategically. Wallet growth is climbing. The community is expanding. And deeper circles of capital are quietly accumulating before wider awareness takes hold. This isn’t hype—it’s real structure, planned expansion, and long-term alignment. The project is walking the same early path as many of today’s leaders did in their first cycles: clear goals, consistent updates, and a growing base of long-term holders—not quick flippers. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana is rising again, driven by high-speed functionality and widespread dApp integration. Toncoin is gaining fast in the mobile-first blockchain segment, unlocking access for non-native users with simplicity. Optimism leads the way in Ethereum’s Layer-2 growth story, improving speed and cost without compromise. Sei is positioning itself around trader-optimized infrastructure, appealing to users focused on performance and reliability. These are all strong bets—but for asymmetric upside from an early starting point, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining the edge. Final Word From $777 to $777K ? While ambitious, that’s exactly how major wins have happened in crypto. Bitcoin , XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum are well-established anchors in the space. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors a chance to position early—before the spotlight finds it.

Berkshire Hathaway CEO and notable investor Warren Buffett to step down by the end of 2025 Warren Buffett, the CEO and founder of the Berkshire Hathaway investment firm, announced he is stepping down by the end of 2025 and letting his successor Greg Abel, the company's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, take the helm. The decision is still subject to the approval of the company's board of directors. However, Buffett said he was confident that the board would fully back the decision to elevate Abel, who has been groomed for this position for years, to the position of CEO. Speaking at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder meeting on May 3, 2025, Buffett announced his decision: ""The time has arrived when Greg should become the Chief executive officer of the company at year-end, and I want to spring that on the directors effectively and give that as my recommendation."" Although investors have long anticipated the move, Buffett's announcement officially signals the end of an era at the publicly traded investment company.

The Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill, which would have permitted Arizona to invest seized funds into Bitcoin ( BTC ) and create a reserve managed by state officials, was formally struck down on Friday, according to an update on the Arizona State Legislature’s website. “Today, I vetoed Senate Bill 1025. The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments,” Hobbs wrote in a statement aimed at Warren Petersen, the President of the Arizona Senate.

Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,” US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said in an April 30 court filing. “Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with users, nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases,” Rogers added. Rogers reiterated, “This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.

According to a damning new study by CoinGecko, these Q1 failures account for nearly half of all token deaths in the last five years. Rise and Fall of Instant Tokens The numbers captured in the report are sobering: nearly one in four tokens launched since 2021 are now considered dead. At the heart of this token extinction event is a storm triggered by a market correction following Bitcoin’s brief post-inauguration rally in January 2025 and the unchecked rise of token generators like Pump.fun. While the platform, launched in early 2024, has democratized token creation, critics argue that it has also contributed to diluting the industry’s integrity. It allows users to launch coins in mere minutes without needing any coding knowledge, fueling a meme coin gold rush that overwhelmed crypto platforms and flooded markets with short-lived speculative assets. Since mid-2021, GeckoTerminal has listed nearly 7 million tokens, but according to the report, 52.7%, amounting to more than 3.7 million cryptocurrencies, have now stopped trading and have officially been categorized as “failed.” While the sharp uptick in failures started in 2024, Q1 2025 has been particularly brutal, with at least 1.8 million tokens going dark by March 31. A Market in Crisis Historically, the rate at which crypto projects collapsed was relatively modest. Per the CoinGecko survey, out of more than 428,000 tokens listed in 2021, only 2,584 failed. The number of listed crypto assets increased to 724,706 in 2022, with failures also growing significantly to 213,075. These figures remained fairly consistent in 2023, with 835,183 created and about 245,000 dying. However, in 2024, the number of launched tokens skyrocketed, going past the 3 million mark thanks in part to Pump.fun. Such was the amount of activity on the platform that at one point it became the main driver behind Solana’s recent dominance of the decentralized exchange (DEX) market. Still, the high number of coins churned resulted in just as many deaths, hitting north of 1.3 million by the end of that year. 2025 seems to have picked up where 2024 left off. Only slightly more than 117,000 tokens out of the 1.93 million that were created in the first three months of the year have survived, meaning just under 94% fizzled out unceremoniously.

MAGACOINFINANCE – A Rising Altcoin With Early-Stage Momentum While legacy coins anchor portfolios, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a serious early-stage contender. With a growing base of supporters and increasing visibility across media and social channels, the project is drawing comparisons to early successes in previous market cycles. Now backed by over $7.8 million raised , MAGACOINFINANCE is executing a deliberate strategy—building infrastructure, expanding community engagement, and preparing for its public listing.

It’s gaining technical strength, crossing key moving averages and supported by a record 130,000+ smart contracts deployed across its ecosystem. Sei (SEI) , priced at $0.208 , is enjoying a 4.52% daily uptick, with 127% growth in trading volume. Its steady $415 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) signals consistent ecosystem participation and investor confidence. Optimism (OP) is navigating a scheduled token unlock of 31.34 million OP , valued above $24 million . Despite the short-term implications, the network’s core metrics show rising activity and recovery trends, positioning it well for future growth. Final Thoughts With Bitcoin, XRP, Cardano, Sei, and Optimism showing solid performance, and MAGACOINFINANCE rapidly gaining attention, the market is offering diverse pathways for upside. For investors working with an entry-level allocation of $139 , a combination of established strength and strategic early positioning could generate meaningful returns.

However, the path to these highs may be gradual, as Cardano (ADA) continues to build on its methodical development approach. In contrast, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are expected to soar 1500% before ADA can reach $5. While both ADA and DOGE have their merits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention with their ambitious growth projections. Investors are currently purchasing MUTM tokens at presale for $0.025, and over $7.4 million has been raised so far. Over 9,300 participants are already onboard ahead of a 20% price jump to $0.03 in the next presale phase. Investors who join now can realize a 140% gain upon the token hitting the projected launch price of $0.06. Over 50% of phase 4 has sold out faster than expected. Investors have less time remaining before the phase closes. Mutuum Finance Ignites Its Presale: The Dawn of a New DeFi Frontier Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a top performer to reckon with in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, thanks to its innovative crypto lending products. The presale has already accumulated over $7.4 million, with more than 9,300 investors having already participated. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM tokens will transition to $0.03 in the next presale phase, and early investors stand to earn up to 140% profit when the token hits its projected launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending platform is transforming decentralized markets through disruption which solidifies the platform as one of the leading DeFi projects. The upcoming Certik smart contract audit will provide investors with extra details and security through its release. Empowering Early Backers & Growing the Mutuum Finance Ecosystem Mutuum Finance offers attractive rewards for early adopters in an attempt to build a strong, active community. Under the program, the platform is conducting a $100,000 giveaway contest, in which ten participants will be awarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Additionally, the referral program encourages users to invite others to the ecosystem, promoting organic growth. Early adopters gain exclusive access to other features like priority platform updates, making them significantly invested in the project’s development. To additionally promote price stability, Mutuum Finance is set to launch a USD-backed stablecoin. This eliminates the instability issues associated with algorithmic-backed stablecoins. Mutuum Finance’s utilization of modern lending innovations is ushering in lasting changes in the DeFi ecosystem. Two Paths, One Goal: Mutuum’s Twin-Engine Crypto Lending Model One of the features of Mutuum Finance is the double-lending model of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks. In the P2C framework, it leverages the smart contract pools to offer stablecoin lending with the option for users to earn passive income during lending. In contrast, the P2P framework removes intermediates, offering direct interaction between borrowers and lenders, giving both parties greater freedom. Auto-adjusting interest rates also make the platform more efficient, with better balance between returns for lenders and borrowing costs for users. While Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) position themselves for steady and slow gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is racing ahead with relentless momentum. With over $7.4 million already generated and more than 9,300 investors on board, Phase 4 of the presale is over 50% sold out and time is ticking. Opportunities like this don’t wait, secure your position in one of DeFi’s most explosive new projects before the door slams shut. Act now or watch from the sidelines as others ride the wave.

As May kicks off, four names are drawing renewed attention — XRP, SUI, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE — each offering a different path to potential upside. XRP Hovers at $2.19 With Resistance Ahead XRP is currently priced at $2.19 , posting a modest +0.37% gain over the last hour, but showing a -0.68% decline over 24 hours . Its 7-day chart is nearly flat at +0.01% , suggesting the asset is locked in a tight range. While XRP remains a dominant force in cross-border payments, analysts say it faces tough resistance near $2.30. Despite its global utility and institutional support, near-term momentum appears muted, leaving tactical traders searching for more dynamic setups. Solana Dips Despite Strong Network Activity Solana (SOL) trades at $147.87 , with a +0.44% move in the last hour but a -1.50% drop over 24 hours . The 7-day change of -0.54% reflects a slight downtrend despite ongoing developer activity and ecosystem growth. While Solana maintains a top-tier position among Layer 1 chains, its recent dip could indicate exhaustion following earlier rallies. With many believing Solana has already priced in most of its mid-term gains, investors are considering alternative Layer 1 plays or undervalued microcaps. SUI Slides to $3.36 With Broader Weakness Sui (SUI) is currently trading at $3.36 , posting a minor +0.06% hourly uptick but down -2.53% over 24 hours and -2.11% over the week . While it still commands attention for its unique Move-based infrastructure and scalable architecture, market confidence appears to be cooling. Technical traders note SUI’s drop below recent support levels could open up further downside if sentiment weakens. Still, its fundamentals remain strong enough to keep it on radar for a recovery play in Q2. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges With Rare Upside While top altcoins tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a focal point for those seeking serious returns. Still trading below major listings, the project is gaining traction thanks to its unique structure, early scarcity, and roadmap designed for exponential growth. Analyst buzz is growing as projections estimate 34x–35x ROI potential from current price levels. The token avoids VC influence, embraces a limited-access model, and is already capturing early community momentum. In addition to its ROI potential, what makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is its combination of aggressive tokenomics and a viral grassroots push. Unlike speculative meme coins or overleveraged DeFi tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a calculated growth vehicle — engineered to deliver long-term upside without early-stage dilution. It’s the kind of asymmetric setup investors look for before major listings drive mass adoption.

Among them Ruvi AI is a pioneer inspired by Cardano. While Cardano is known for scalability, sustainability and systematic innovation, Ruvi AI is taking this vision to the next level by merging AI with blockchain. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform with a dual focus on blockchain and AI designed to solve real world problems. At its core Ruvi combines the transparency of blockchain with AI tools to deliver solutions across industries. It can handle creativity, predictive analytics, fraud detection and process optimization so businesses can operate smarter and better. This unique combination makes Ruvi AI stand out in a crowded blockchain space. By addressing challenges in logistics, finance and supply chain Ruvi AI ensures its platform is not just technology driven but practical and adaptable. The goal is to have tools that work for everyone from small businesses to global enterprises. Impressive Presale Start Ruvi AI has made a strong start with the presale . Over 10 million tokens sold in just a few days and over $100,000 in investments. This is a huge trust from the blockchain community in Ruvi AI’s vision and potential. Currently priced at $0.01 per token in Phase 1 this is a great entry point for early adopters. With a 50% price increase in Phase 2 the presale window is an opportunity to maximize returns before the next phase of growth begins. Ruvi AI has delivered on its promises and launched a functional beta platform shortly after the presale. This shows Ruvi’s commitment to its roadmap and provides concrete evidence of the platform’s capabilities. The beta features showcase the full spectrum of possibilities from AI powered decision making tools to blockchain backed transparency. VIP Tier 5 Benefits For those looking to get into Ruvi AI’s ecosystem the VIP tiers are a great opportunity. VIP Tier 5 is for big investors looking to maximize returns.To get into this tier you need to hold 500,000 RUVI tokens which is an investment of $5,000 at Phase 1 presale prices. The rewards for this tier are huge. VIP Tier 5 investors get a 100% token bonus so they will have 1,000,000 RUVI tokens. These numbers are impressive. At the initial listing price of $0.07 the value of these tokens is $70,000. And at the projected valuation of $1 per token this $5,000 investment is worth $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for strategic investors who want to commit to the project and get long term benefits. Leaderboard Rewards Another great initiative from Ruvi AI is the Leaderboard rewards program designed to reward contributors across all investment levels. This is an inclusive system so everyone in the Ruvi AI community benefits from the project’s success. For example the Top 10 investors get 500,000 RUVI tokens each. At the initial listing price of $0.07 these tokens are worth $35,000. But if the token reaches its projected valuation of $1 this is worth $500,000. The Top 50 contributors get 250,000 RUVI tokens. At the $0.07 listing price this is worth $17,500 but if Ruvi AI reaches its $1 projection this is worth $250,000. These rewards not only incentivize participation but also shows Ruvi AI’s appreciation to its investor community. It’s a system to share success broadly so everyone can celebrate with Ruvi AI. Shaping the Future of Blockchain Technology Ruvi AI is not just a platform it’s a vision of how technology can transform industries and generate long term value. By combining blockchain’s transparency with AI’s analytical power Ruvi AI is building a system that solves problems and creates opportunities. Ruvi’s strong fundamentals, bonuses and focus on its community makes it a project set to become the next success story. Joining now, while the price is still at a reduced price secures a ticket for life-changing gains.

Experts Predict 9,900% Price Increase in 2025",https://timestabloid.com/could-ruvi-ai-ruvi-steal-trons-trx-spotlight-experts-predict/,"TRON (TRX) has been catching attention this May 2025 with game-changing upgrades and bullish price movements. The recent TRON ecosystem updates, including a massive transaction milestone and a 7.2% price surge following its latest upgrade, have fueled growing optimism among investors. TRX is consolidating above $0.24, with analysts predicting further gains ahead. However, while TRON makes waves, another project is rapidly gaining traction behind the scenes. Meet Ruvi , the cryptocurrency tipped to revolutionize blockchain with AI at its core. If you’re impressed by TRON’s success, Ruvi’s potential could blow you away. With its one-of-a-kind presale bonuses and groundbreaking tech, Ruvi is the project smart investors can’t afford to ignore in 2025. TRON’s Momentum vs. Ruvi’s Rising Power TRON’s transaction record now exceeds 10 billion, solidifying its place as a leading blockchain for stablecoins and dApps. But while TRON remains focused on its current blockchain prowess, Ruvi compares by offering a futuristic twist with artificial intelligence deeply woven into its structure. Ruvi is not just about processing transactions or strengthening network activity; it aims to solve real-world problems like fraud detection, predictive business analytics, and cross-industry applications. Why Ruvi Stays Ahead of the Game Unique Use Cases Unlike TRON, which depends on its reputation in stablecoins and transactions, Ruvi creates utility in logistics, finance, and other major sectors, making its adoption broader and richer. Deflationary Token Supply Ruvi’s capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens ensures a constant scarcity factor that grows demand and price over time. TRON, on the other hand, lacks deflationary models. AI-Powered Infrastructure By utilizing artificial intelligence, Ruvi offers tools that predict market trends, prevent fraud, and optimize corporate strategies.

SUI’s price prediction is climbing, thanks to a strong resurgence in DeFi and the much-anticipated SuiPlay 0X1 launch. Solana (SOL) continues to impress with a strong long-term outlook, supported by record-breaking network activity and steady developer engagement. On the presale front, BlockDAG (BDAG) is stealing the spotlight with what many traders are calling the best deal right now at just $0.0019. With confirmed CEX listings and growing speculation of a $1 breakout, the excitement is palpable. Whether it’s gaming, infrastructure, or hot presale opportunities, traders have plenty of options and plenty to gain. SUI Price Gains Momentum with DeFi and Gaming Boost The buzz around SUI’s price prediction is growing louder after a strong recovery from its April dip. Following a 40% bounce from $1.93 to $3.60, analysts are shifting their views to a more bullish outlook. Supporters highlight key factors like DeFi growth, impressive performance metrics, and the launch of the SuiPlay 0X1 gaming platform as major catalysts for potential price gains. Many now see year-end targets between $5.05 and $6.25, depending on broader market conditions and adoption rates. If staking demand and gaming activity continue to rise, SUI’s 2025 price prediction could put it in direct competition with leading Layer 1 tokens. There’s also speculation that SUI’s gaming-first strategy might give it an edge in certain niches. SOL’s Strong Network Usage Drives Optimistic Outlook Solana’s (SOL) long-term outlook is still solid, despite some short-term fluctuations. While technical indicators are sending mixed signals, the fundamentals remain strong. Solana recently passed 400 billion transactions, a milestone that shows its scalability and growing adoption. The network’s outlook is further boosted by a 44% surge in decentralized exchange volume and new user activity surpassing expectations. Although the $145 support level is under pressure, many traders are eyeing a possible rebound to $157 and beyond. Moving forward, analysts believe Solana’s future will hinge on network stability and the ability of decentralized apps (dApps) to generate fees, fueling growth and attracting more developers. BlockDAG’s $0.0019 Presale Deal Sparks Buying Frenzy Before CEX Debut! BlockDAG (BDAG) just dropped a major update: it’s heading to centralized exchanges (CEX), and the news has the crypto world buzzing. Early backers are celebrating, seeing this move as confirmation of their wise decision to back this promising project . But it’s not just the early birds who are getting in on the action. Latecomers are rushing to secure their spot, especially with BlockDAG offering an unbeatable price of just $0.0019 until May 13. This is a dramatic cut from the current batch price of $0.0262 and far below the anticipated $0.05 launch price. With over $225 million raised and more than 19.6 billion coins sold during its presale, BlockDAG is gaining traction fast. Early supporters from batch 1 are now eyeing a 2,520% return on their investment. Many are doubling down, taking advantage of this final chance to buy before the token goes public. As BlockDAG prepares for its exchange debut, analysts predict the price will skyrocket, potentially surpassing $1 in no time as more investors gain access. For those who’ve been watching from the sidelines, this is the last opportunity to grab tokens at this incredibly low price. After the presale ends, the price will be determined by the open market, and that $0.0019 deal will be gone for good. Final Thoughts SUI’s price prediction is gaining momentum, while Solana’s long-term outlook continues to impress traders who value network strength over short-term fluctuations. But these two aren’t the only projects stealing the spotlight. BlockDAG is climbing fast in the rankings, and with confirmed exchange listings on the horizon, it’s drawing major attention. The early investors have already scored a 2,520% return, and now latecomers are jumping in, eager to secure their position at the special $0.0019 price before it’s too late. Once BlockDAG hits the open market, these presale deals will be gone for good. If you want to grab one last chance at this incredible pricing, now’s the time!

After enduring four consecutive months of sideways trading and bearish closes, technical indicators and sentiment data are flashing warning signs of an impending correction in the coming weeks. Ethereum Price Crash To $1,526 Incoming According to CoinCodex’s latest Ethereum price prediction, ETH is expected to decline by 16.47% over the coming weeks, potentially reaching $1,526.06 by June 2, 2025. This bearish projection comes amidst a turbulent market cycle in which investor sentiment and confidence have wavered due to rising macroeconomic pressures and unexpected declines in Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View Notably, Ethereum’s technical outlook continues to deteriorate as it just wrapped up its fourth consecutive monthly red candle. Cryptorank’s data shows that Ethereum experienced a dip of 1.27% in January, followed by sharper losses of 32.2% in February and 18.4% in March. The downtrend continued into April, with the cryptocurrency closing the month in red with another 1.58% decline. Despite brief intra-month rallies that saw its value rise sharply, Ethereum has consistently failed to sustain gains, closing each month with rising selling pressure and leading the wider market drawdown. CoinCodex’s data further paints a grim picture, highlighting that the top altcoin has recorded 16 green days out of the last 30, signaling unstable market strength. Its price volatility, measured at 6.43%, also reflects a choppy market that lacks clear bullish conviction. Moving forward, CoinCodex not only predicts that Ethereum could break down to $1,526 but also expects a steeper price crash to $1,447.96 by August 1, 2025. This would represent a decline of approximately 20.75% from current market prices. The machine learning algorithm has declared that broader market sentiment for ETH is currently bearish, implying that traders and investors still anticipate further corrections and limited upward momentum in the near term. Overall, this indicates a cautious outlook for Ethereum’s price prospects. CoinCodex Says Now Is A Bad Time To Buy ETH Given its bearish forecast for the Ethereum price, CoinCodex suggests that now may not be the best time to buy Ethereum. Interestingly, while investor sentiment remains cautious, the Fear and Greed index is at 65, reflecting a state of “Greed” and suggesting that market optimism may be outpacing the underlying bearish fundamentals.

Recent reports reveal that a single whale purchased 30,000 ETH tokens worth approximately $54 million. With price momentum fading and macro uncertainty still high, ETH bulls may need to wait for market stabilization and clearer reversal signals before re-entering the market. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the Ethereum price is currently trading at $1,827, marking a yearly decline of over 38%.

Bitcoin and XRP are already legends in their own right. Solana continues expanding across Web3. And Ethereum (ETH) remains central to everything from smart contracts to institutional adoption. But now, one name is quietly joining that elite conversation: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Momentum is rising, and the real question now is whether one of these five tokens could deliver that rare multi-million-dollar return for those positioned early enough. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Catching Fire—and the Early Signs Are Hard to Ignore It’s easy to miss the early signals—until it’s too late. But right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is flashing every indicator of a breakout in motion. Wallet counts are ticking upward fast. Community growth is unfolding naturally, without gimmicks. And on-chain trackers are beginning to highlight MAGACOINFINANCE as one of the few early-stage plays with meaningful activity and traction. This isn’t temporary attention. It’s foundational progress—and those entering now may be catching the inflection point before the next phase begins. Rising Players to Watch: Kaspa, Polkadot, and Their Growing Ecosystems Kaspa is gaining ground with a high-speed, proof-of-work blockDAG model that’s built for real-time payments and scalable infrastructure. Polkadot continues leading the way in cross-chain functionality, giving developers the tools to launch scalable projects across a multi-chain future. Both names have real utility—but when it comes to asymmetric upside potential, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for its early strength and rising investor activity. Final Word Could $1.9 million truly be within reach? History suggests that those who moved early on Bitcoin , Solana , Ethereum , and XRP made that a reality.

This metric is designed to gauge how investors feel about the market, and when it rises, it often signals increased trust in the market’s direction. Bitcoin has broken through a key level at 94000 and is closing in on its highest historical price. Movements like this have frequently kicked off strong altcoin rallies. As attention shifts from Bitcoin to other tokens, altcoins begin to climb, with memecoins frequently leading the charge due to their ability to capture hype and generate quick returns. One of the most talked-about potential 1000x tokens for 2025 is gaining momentum as the next altcoin season draws closer. SOLAXY takes aim at Solana’s technical shortcomings Solaxy is designed to improve the overall performance of the Solana blockchain by tackling long-standing issues such as congestion, speed limitations, and limited scalability. Its development roadmap targets sustainable network efficiency and future-proof architecture. While this technical focus resonates with developers and investors alike, another rising star is drawing attention with a unique story, strong utility, and market excitement. That project is Pepeto. PEPETO stands out as a 1000x memecoin candidate combining affordability and real functionality With its presale price set at just $0.000000126, Pepeto offers an early opportunity to join a project that’s gaining serious traction. The upcoming rollout of PepetoSwap, a zero-fee trading platform, along with the Pepeto Exchange, reflects its broader ambition to deliver a working ecosystem. Pepeto is building more than just hype — it is establishing long-term value for holders. A major point of intrigue around Pepeto is its origin story. With a token supply of 420 trillion, identical to Pepe, some speculate a former member of the Pepe team may be behind it. According to the story, Pepe took four core documents but left behind the final two — Technology and Optimization — making his version incomplete. Pepeto, built on Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, retained the full foundation. Pepe assumed he had everything to lead the memecoin space. But missing critical elements left the vision unfinished. PEPETO presale window closing as exchange debut nears Investors can still access $PEPETO tokens at $0.000000126 through pepeto.io. Supported payment methods include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. As PepetoSwap nears deployment and exchange announcements continue, early adopters are set to benefit from staking rewards and exclusive platform utilities. Pepeto is quickly shaping up to be one of the standout memecoins in this cycle. A potential 1000x breakout token for 2025 is gaining momentum as the market gears up for the next altcoin season. SOLAXY focuses on enhancing Solana’s blockchain infrastructure Solaxy is being developed to address Solana’s core challenges, including network congestion, limited scalability, and transaction bottlenecks. Its aim is to create a more robust and efficient ecosystem for developers and users alike. While this mission earns it credibility among blockchain enthusiasts, another emerging project is stealing the spotlight with its distinct story, growing utility, and surging interest. That project is Pepeto. PEPETO emerges as a powerful 1000x memecoin backed by utility and early entry potential At just $0.000000126 during its presale, Pepeto provides an opportunity for early supporters to get involved before its exchange listing. It introduces more than meme hype, offering real products like PepetoSwap — a zero-fee trading platform — and the Pepeto Exchange. Together, these features aim to form a complete ecosystem that supports usability and growth. What makes Pepeto even more compelling is its background. With a 420 trillion token supply, matching that of Pepe, speculation continues that a former insider may be involved. According to the project’s story, Pepe stole four symbolic elements but missed the final two — Technology and Optimization — leaving his build incomplete. Pepeto, representing Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, is said to have kept what really mattered. Pepe thought he had taken the foundation for success, but what he left behind could prove to be the most important parts. PEPETO presale nearing completion with launch on the horizon Investors can still join the Pepeto presale at the $0.000000126 price point via pepeto.io. Payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, or card access through MetaMask or Trust Wallet. With its exchange listing approaching and PepetoSwap development advancing, early holders will benefit from staking rewards and full ecosystem participation. Pepeto continues to gain recognition as one of the most exciting upcoming memecoin launches.

Brown University filed an institutional investment manager holdings report with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), citing it had acquired $5 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Academic Institution Seeks Exposure to Crypto The $5 billion gives the Ivy League school up to 105,000 iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) shares, worth $4,915,050, as of March 31. This holding was stated in its recently listed 13F-HR form. VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matt Sigel pointed out that Brown University is the third academic institution to gain exposure to BTC via an ETF. The other two are Emory, which holds Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF, and the University of Austin. Brown University is gaining exposure to cryptocurrency for the first time. Its 13F-HR filings show other investments in firms like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and investments in different sectors totaling $216 million. BlackRock Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Lead Counterparts The broader spot Bitcoin ETF sector continues to record massive inflows . Launched in January 2024, IBIT is the most prominent spot Bitcoin ETF, with some $56.81 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). In Q1 2025, both BlackRock BTC and Ethereum ETFs recorded declines in inflows. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) ETF declined approximately 83%. Based on their stellar reputation, the dip for two crypto ETFs, leading their counterparts, was quite notable. However, Juan Leon, Senior Investment Strategist at Bitwise, believes that Q2 2025 will be better than the previous quarter. The Bitcoin ETF niche may record up to $3 billion in inflows in the second quarter . Improved Crypto Regulatory Framework in the US By several standards, the broader cryptocurrency market has seen appreciable growth since Donald Trump won the United States presidential elections. The new administration has introduced policies in favour of the burgeoning sector. The new stance has encouraged several asset management firms to request approval from the SEC to list other crypto ETFs. Various asset managers are filing to launch Dogecoin , Solana, XRP, Litecoin, Sui , Polkadot, and even Aptos ETFs. In the meantime, the Commission has not responded favorably to any of these crypto ETFs that followed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Early participants saw ATOM surge from its modest launch to triple-digit gains, turning quiet believers into headline success stories. That early window didn’t last long, and those who waited too long were forced to chase the rally — often too late to catch meaningful profits. Now, in 2025, the cycle feels eerily familiar, and another project is drawing eyes for the exact same reasons. This time, it’s Qubetics — and if you missed Cosmos, you may not want to sit this one out. Qubetics is quietly climbing its way into becoming the most popular cryptocurrency in today’s presale frenzy. It’s not just about hype; this platform is fusing long-term usability with aggressive early-stage accessibility. The Qubetics presale kicked off in September 2024, and since then, multiple low-priced stages have passed — each one giving early buyers an ROI boost. But don’t think you’ve missed your window completely. Stage 32 is still active, and the price remains affordable. With the mainnet set to go live in Q2 2025, and a 10% price increase every seven days, urgency isn’t just a feeling — it’s baked into the system. This may be your last chance to join the best crypto presale before it breaks out as the most popular cryptocurrency of the year. Qubetics Might Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency You Don’t Want to Miss The earliest supporters of Qubetics had it good — no cap. Some even locked in tokens at just $0.01 during the stealthy whitelist phase back in September 2024. There was no upfront payment required, just early conviction. Fast forward to now, and Qubetics has blown through dozens of stages. While the ultra-low entry points are gone, the project is still in reach — currently in Stage 32, priced at $0.2093 per $TICS. Over $16.6 million has already been raised, 510 million tokens sold, and more than 25,600 token holders have jumped in. Every new stage increases token price by 10%, and the stages are short — just seven days. So yeah, the window is shrinking fast. If you grab $TICS at today’s price and it hits $1 post-launch, you’re already staring at 377.76% ROI. But that’s just the conservative outlook. At $5, the return jumps to 2,288.80%. A $6 value brings 2,766.55%. And if Qubetics reaches $10 — a realistic scenario post-mainnet launch — you’re looking at 4,677.59%. That’s the kind of potential that turns $500 into over $26,000. Just check the presale projections — $500 at today’s price gives you 2,388.80% ROI if $TICS hits $5. Numbers like these are making it one of the most popular cryptocurrency opportunities right now. But it’s not just about numbers — Qubetics is built to solve real problems. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet is already getting attention. Think about this: a freelancer in the Philippines gets paid in USDT, a small business in Germany accepts ETH from global clients, and a digital nomad in Dubai holds SOL and BTC. Qubetics’ wallet unifies all these assets, allowing borderless control without giving up custody. It’s safe, smart, and simplifies cross-chain access for everyday users and businesses alike — this kind of utility is why Qubetics is being tagged as the most popular cryptocurrency project by those who know where the space is heading. And when you combine functionality with a presale this strong, it’s no surprise many are calling it the best crypto presale to join in 2025. Cosmos Proved the Power of Patience — But Only for Early Participants Back in 2019, Cosmos launched its token ATOM at around $0.10 during early phases. Most ignored it. Those who didn’t? They watched as Cosmos became a key player in the interoperability game — a chain that linked chains. By early 2021, ATOM was already climbing fast, and by 2022, it crossed the $40 mark, delivering one of the biggest ROI runs in Layer-1 history. The missed opportunity still stings for many. Cosmos’ focus on cross-chain communication made it indispensable to countless blockchain networks — it wasn’t just another smart contract platform, it was the infrastructure others began relying on. But not everyone got in early. And those who waited until Cosmos made headlines often bought the top or saw weak upside. Today, Cosmos is still a respected name, but its most aggressive gains are in the rear-view. It’s maturing — no longer the scrappy outsider, but now more of a foundation-layer tech. That makes it stable, sure, but also limits its explosive upside. If you’re the kind of participant still chasing those 10x returns, you’re probably not going to get them from ATOM anymore. That’s why newer, utility-driven projects like Qubetics are taking over the spotlight in 2025. This Might Be the Most Popular Cryptocurrency You Still Have Time To Join Cosmos changed the game once — but Qubetics might be the one changing it now. The difference? You haven’t missed Qubetics yet. The current stage of the Qubetics presale offers early access at a price still low enough to capture serious upside. Those who locked in early are already on track for huge returns, but the opportunity hasn’t fully disappeared — not yet. With a system that increases prices stage-by-stage and ends each phase in just 7 days, waiting too long might mean watching this one pass you by like Cosmos did. Qubetics isn’t just gaining buzz — it’s gaining traction as the most popular cryptocurrency this cycle because of its real use case, growing community, and structured presale model. The numbers speak for themselves, and if you’re ready to make a move, now’s the time to join this best crypto presale . Because once the mainnet drops and $TICS hits those projected post-launch values, the only thing left to do will be look back and regret missing it — again.

The funds passed through Dubai banks, prompting calls for regulatory intervention. Named individuals include TrueCoin, FDT, Finoport, and ARIA Commodities executives. TRON founder Justin Sun has issued an update on what he describes as a “$500 million fraud” involving misappropriated TrueUSD (TUSD) reserves. The alleged scheme centers around a web of individuals and entities linked to First Digital Trust (FDT), Legacy Trust, and ARIA Commodities, with funds reportedly flowing into financial institutions in Dubai. Sun Names Individuals, Entities Allegedly Involved In his statement, Sun credited the newly launched Web3Bounty.io platform for advancing transparency in tracking large-scale fraud across the crypto ecosystem. He named five individuals allegedly involved: Christian Alexander Boehnke De Lorraine Elbouef: Head of Finance & Operations at TrueCoin, the former operator of TrueUSD (TUSD) Vincent Chok: CEO of First Digital Trust (FDT) and Legacy Trust Yai Sukonthabhund: Former CEO of Crossbridge, now a partner at Fi… The post Justin Sun Shares Major Update on $500M TUSD Reserve Misappropriation: Calls Out ARIA-FDT Scam and Dubai Banks appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Crypto Scam|First Digital USD (FDUSD)|Justin Sun,EN,0,0,COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|TUSD,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-05-03 22:45:00

In a post on X after regaining control, the team acknowledged that hackers used the account to promote a contract address. According to the post , the hackers posted the contract address and also sent direct messages to multiple people while also following unknown accounts. The team now asked that users should ignore and delete any DM from its account on May 2. It said: “Please be reminded: TRON DAO will never post contract addresses or send unsolicited DMs. If you received a DM from our account on May 2, please delete it and consider it the work of the attacker.” The post added that the attack is due to a social engineering attack on one of the TRON DAO team members. It noted that the hackers gained control of the member’s account, allowing them to continue contacting other people and offering posts for payments even after the team regained control. TRON DAO is now investigating the incident and has already identified several addresses allegedly connected to the perpetrator on X and Telegram. It added that it has also contacted law enforcement agencies on the matter. OKX debunks Sun’s claims reporting incident Meanwhile, TRON founder and crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun asked centralized exchange OKX to freeze funds connected to the address behind the hack, noting that the hackers transferred stolen funds to the wallet on the exchange. In a now-deleted post, Sun said he expected OKX to act quickly to resolve the issue and prevent the hackers from further moving the funds. Although he did not mention the sum stolen, Sun claimed that law enforcement agencies had already sent the freeze notice to OKX’s official mail and TRON had followed the exchange’s procedures for reporting such incidents. However, OKX’s CEO, Star Xu, debunked Sun’s claims, saying that the exchange had not received any official communication to confirm the freezing order. He further asked that Sun share a screenshot of the request from the law enforcement agency. He said: “Dear Mr H.E. Justin Sun, our LE cooperation team just checked the email including spam box, we haven’t received any request related with this case. Can you give us the screenshot to show when the enforcement agency sent the request to us?” It appeared that the comments were instrumental to Sun’s decision to delete his initial post requesting a freeze of the account. Tron network sees upgrade as network lead in generated fees Outside of the recent compromise of its account, TRON is actually in the middle of a positive trend. It recently released a new version of its Kant mainnet upgrade, which improves its compatibility with Ethereum and strengthens network security. According to the announcement, the upgrade made changes to the network at its underlying level and will make it more efficient. Some of the changes include the reconstruction of the contract event system and the optimization of nodes and API performance. The network stated that these upgrades, which are not obvious to everyday users, are necessary to make the blockchain a global settlement layer. Interestingly, the network has seen increased activity and recently reached the milestone of 304 million total addresses. The increased activity also reflected in the network generating the highest fees of all blockchains in April. Tron ranks as the network with most fees generated in April (Source: CryptoRank) According to CryptoRank , TRON recorded $51.7 million in fees last month, while Hyperliquid had $49.2 million. Solana was third with $36.9 million. With its fees, TRON not only surpassed Solana but also pulled more than the combined fees of Ethereum and Bitcoin, which had $21 million and $15.4 million, respectively. Meanwhile, TRX has solidified its position as a top ten crypto asset with a market cap of $23.29 billion.The token is up 4% in the last 30 days and remains a fair performer this year, with only a 3.78% decline year-to-date.

33767162,[object Object],1746313208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,History Rhymes: Will Bitcoin Repeat Classic Breakout Pattern To Surge Above $104K?,https://bitcoinist.com/will-bitcoin-repeat-breakout-pattern-surge-104000/,"Market prices of Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded as high as $96,000 to mark a bullish end to April and the potential start to a price uptrend. However, despite breaking key resistances, BTC is yet to return to the present market peak price, which would ultimately confirm the resumption of the bull market. Interestingly, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has shared a potential price trajectory through which Bitcoin could realize its bullish potential, leading to new price discovery. From $93,500 To $104,500 – Critical Levels To Watch In 2025 In a recent post on X, Rekt Capital shares an intriguing price prediction on the BTC market following recent price gains. The market expert explains that Bitcoin’s price rally in late April allowed the asset to recover from its downside deviation and return to a bullish trading range. Following this development, the premier cryptocurrency is now facing a black lower high resistance at the $99,000 price region. Interestingly, BTC experienced a similar situation in mid-October 2024, resulting in an 80% price rally. As historical data are strong factors in price prediction, Rekt Capital states that for Bitcoin to repeat the price surge seen in Q4 2024 from this similar position, the asset will experience a price rejection at $99,000, which is expected to force prices as low as $93,500. The analyst explains that Bitcoin bulls must hold price movement at this support level before launching another price rally to break through the $97,000 – $99,000 region. Thereafter, BTC could likely face another rejection at $104,500 and return to find support around $97,000 – $99,000. After forming an ascending price channel, Rekt Capital then predicts Bitcoin to launch a price surge from this support level, moving past $109,000 to establish a new all-time high. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $96,500 following a price loss of 0.25% in the last 24 hours. However, Bitcoin has now entered comfortable bullish territory with gains of 1.84% and 15.55% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively. This development is confirmed by other factors, including the Bitcoin Bull Index Score , which is now at 80 – the highest it has ever been since January 30. According to Rekt Capital’s analysis, the immediate price resistances for the premier cryptocurrency lie at $99,000 and $104,500, with the most critical support set at $93,500. However, barring any negative macroeconomic developments, Bitcoin looks poised to complete its price recovery and launch into new price territory.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin breakout|Bitcoin Price Target|btcusd|BTCUSDT|downside deviation|Historical data,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-03 23:00:08

Flare is pulling back after a brief rally, while Worldcoin is still recovering from a 90% crash. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) continues to gain ground with a presale that’s raised an impressive $225 million, selling 19.6 billion BDAG coins. Right now, the $0.0019 entry price remains available, offering a 92.34% discount compared to the current batch 28 price. However, while Flare stalls below resistance and Worldcoin’s price prediction hinges on recovery, BlockDAG is setting itself apart with rare transparency. Its newly launched podcast provides real-time updates on its roadmap and next steps, turning openness into a strategic advantage. In a market full of uncertainty, this level of clarity stands out as a valuable asset for investors. Flare’s Rally Hits a Roadblock at Key Resistance Level Flare (FLR) made a solid breakout from its descending wedge, surging nearly 10% before hitting strong resistance around $0.020. This level, also at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, has kept the price in check as buying pressure slows down. The current price action suggests Flare might be hitting a local top, with a pullback now forming. Short-term support is sitting at $0.01705, which will be key to maintaining the uptrend. If it holds, a move back to $0.02164 could be in play. However, if the support fails, we could see the price dip further toward the $0.015 range. Worldcoin’s Price Struggles After 90% Drop After hitting a high of $11.74 in early 2024, Worldcoin has dropped over 90%, now hovering around $1.10. Despite the sharp decline, some traders are taking another look as altcoin market sentiment begins to shift positively. According to CoinCodex’s latest price prediction, Worldcoin could reach $3.13 by the end of May, assuming current trends continue. While this short-term forecast is supported by a few bullish signs, the longer-term outlook is more uncertain. Predictions for 2025 vary, ranging from under $1 to over $4, and 2030 targets are even more scattered. For now, WLD remains a high-risk, high-reward asset with a lot of potential for both gains and losses. BlockDAG Drops New Podcast: Unmatched Transparency! In a world where much of the crypto space operates behind closed doors, BlockDAG is flipping the script. The team is bringing transparency to the forefront with the launch of an official podcast that gives listeners exclusive access to their thought process, strategies, and upcoming plans. It’s more than just another update; this podcast opens the curtain to BlockDAG’s vision and provides real-time insight into key decisions, including the roadmap, exchange listings, and post-launch ecosystem. This podcast is not your typical technical jargon or impersonal whitepapers. It’s about keeping communication clear and accessible, letting listeners in on the team’s plans and thoughts as they unfold. With so much happening behind the scenes, it’s refreshing to hear directly from the team about what’s coming next and how they’re positioning BlockDAG in the market. And the timing couldn’t be better. BlockDAG’s presale has already surpassed $225 million, with over 19.6 billion BDAG coins sold and more than 170,000 holders onboard. Exchange listings are fast approaching, and the current presale tier is still at an incredible $0.0019, down from the $0.0262 price of batch 28. While other projects may go silent at such a crucial stage, BlockDAG is staying ahead of the curve. With a commitment to openness and ongoing updates, this podcast is the perfect way to stay in the loop, no guessing, no cryptic updates, just real-time, straightforward communication. Final Thoughts While many cryptos are stuck in uncertainty, BlockDAG is charging forward with clarity and momentum. Flare just broke out but is now stalled under resistance at $0.020, and Worldcoin has dropped over 90% from its highs, barely finding its way back. Meanwhile, BlockDAG stands out with a solid roadmap and real traction. The newly launched BlockDAG podcast offers rare transparency in a space where most projects go quiet ahead of major milestones. With over $225 million raised and the $0.0019 entry price still live (down from batch 28’s $0.0262), BlockDAG is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get in early. But hurry, this deal won’t last long; once it’s gone, the price will never be this low again!

Projects like Ethereum (ETH) , Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and Kaspa (KAS) are showing renewed momentum based on strong fundamentals and expanding ecosystems. Meanwhile, early-stage contender MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious ground—emerging as one of the most-watched altcoins heading into the new market cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE: Quietly Becoming 2025’s Breakout Narrative MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer under the radar—it’s accelerating. With over $7.8 million raised and a growing global community, this project is proving that early-stage execution matters. Its appeal lies in a powerful combination: professional rollout, high engagement, and rising traction across both influencers and analysts. While other altcoins are climbing from established baselines, MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare discovery-phase potential. Early buyers are already benefiting from insider positioning—supported further by an exclusive 50% bonus using the code MAGA50X during checkout. The listing target remains $0.007 , making the entry point today extremely attractive. Bitcoin (BTC): The Macro Foundation Keeps Growing Bitcoin continues to lead the market narrative. With ETF inflows pushing institutional demand and supply-side constraints after the halving, Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH): Strengthening Through Upgrades and Institutional Backing Ethereum has climbed over 11% in the past week, fueled by increased DEX volume and ecosystem activity. With upcoming Layer-2 integrations and ETF traction, ETH could challenge $2,100 in the short term, with projections reaching up to $5,174 by year-end. Solana (SOL): Powering the DeFi and NFT Landscape Solana continues to thrive in high-performance blockchain applications. As developers lean toward its fast, low-fee architecture, price forecasts suggest a move toward $400 by late 2025. Kaspa (KAS): Momentum Grows with Unique Architecture Kaspa is riding a bullish wave, with recent price surges and continued adoption. Its blockDAG model differentiates it from other proof-of-work coins, and analysts are watching closely as it targets $0.222 later this year. Final Thoughts For investors targeting high-performance portfolios in 2025, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana remain essential. But it’s MAGACOINFINANCE that’s drawing growing attention as the standout early-stage play with structured upside. When the market shifts, those positioned early often see the most substantial returns.

The Stellar (XLM) price is stuck inside a descending channel, facing strong rejection at $0.29. Meanwhile, the SUI price prediction is climbing again after a sharp rebound, with analysts eyeing a $6.25 target if gaming momentum continues. Both have solid narratives, but neither offers early entry. That’s what sets Unstaked apart. It’s not just building another AI token, it’s building an agent economy that could automate work across DAOs, Telegram, and X. From content to community, Unstaked agents will run it all. Unstaked could this redefine redefine work in web3, and UNSD is the ticket in before the 200x wave hits. A $100 buy at batch 1 could already be worth $2700 at listing, and that’s without even counting agent utility. This might be the only early-stage entry among the cryptos to dominate the next cycle. Unstaked Builds the AI Engine for Web3 Work Unstaked is building something much bigger than just a token. It’s laying the foundation for fully autonomous AI agents that can manage entire online communities, handle DAO operations, and drive growth on platforms like X and Telegram, without needing constant human input. These agents can post updates, respond to questions, and engage users 24/7. For creators, founders, and teams, that’s a major shift in how work gets done in Web3. What makes Unstaked stand out is that none of its utility is live yet, on purpose. The platform is holding back deployment until its UNSD token launches, which means every buyer in the presale is getting in before the utility switch flips. The presale is now in stage 2 with prices at $0.006695 and has raised more than $900k so far. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are already looking at a 27x setup. That’s before any price movement from hype or demand kicks in. This positioning makes Unstaked one of the cryptos to dominate the next cycle, especially as AI and automation go mainstream in blockchain. The team isn’t promising vague features later. The AI agents are ready. The launch just unlocks them. Once they go live, demand could spike quickly, especially from DAOs, NFT communities, and DeFi projects looking to scale operations without growing headcount. If you believe that automation will define the next wave of crypto productivity, Unstaked isn’t optional, it’s early. And among the cryptos to dominate, UNSD might be the only one offering a pre-launch shot at the full upside. Will the Next Move in the Stellar (XLM) Price Be a Breakout? The Stellar (XLM) price has been trapped in a descending channel since late December, with lower highs and lows forming a tight downtrend. In April, it dropped to the key $0.22–$0.24 support zone before bouncing 15% to hit $0.2702. Right now, the price is testing the upper channel boundary at $0.28–$0.29, where it has been rejected before. A clean break above that range could shift the trend. Whether the Stellar (XLM) price moves up or down next will depend on volume and broader market momentum. If Bitcoin keeps holding above $94K and volume flows into altcoins, XLM could push toward the $0.30–$0.32 range. But without that breakout, it risks dropping back to retest $0.24. Traders are watching this level closely, because the next rejection or breakout could set the tone for May. Gaming Hype and Rebounds Fuel the SUI Price Prediction After a strong start to 2025, the SUI price prediction is back in focus. The token hit an all-time high of $5.35 in January, crashed to $1.93 in April, then rebounded over 40% to $3.60 by month-end. Much of this momentum is tied to the upcoming launch of SuiPlay 0X1, the first physical gaming device tied to a blockchain network, which could drive a new phase of growth in crypto gaming. Looking ahead, analysts put the SUI price prediction at $6.25 by year-end, with a $10.25 average forecast for 2030. Key drivers include growth in DeFi, stablecoin adoption, and tokenized gaming ecosystems built directly on the Sui network. With strong TVL growth and rising developer activity, Sui is quietly building one of the most active ecosystems among newer Layer-1 chains. Why Unstaked Could Be the Biggest Win of This Cycle The Stellar (XLM) price is facing a tough breakout zone near $0.29, while the SUI price prediction is gaining strength again with renewed momentum from SuiPlay 0X1 and rising DeFi activity. Both are well-positioned, but they’re already listed, and the upside now depends on broad market moves. Unstaked, on the other hand, is still in presale and preparing to flip the switch on its full AI agent ecosystem. It’s not just another token, it’s infrastructure for automating work across DAOs, Telegram, and X. With its cutting-edge tech, Unstaked could redefine work in web3, and the UNSD token is the ticket in before the 200x wave hits. UNSD presale price is now $0.006695 and is set to list at $0.1819, a 27x on price alone. Among all the cryptos to dominate, this might be the last one offering a shot at pre-launch gains.

He warned about the U.S. fiscal deficit , calling it “unsustainable” and highlighting the threat it poses to long-term stability. Despite concerns, Buffett remains optimistic , saying the U.S. is still the best place for investment and praising capitalism’s success. Buffett, who chaired his 60th shareholder meeting for Berkshire Hathaway, shared views on everything from investment strategy to global trade. He emphasized that balanced trade is essential and that the U.S. must remain connected to the world economically. Despite market turbulence and political challenges, he noted, “I would not get discouraged.” Reflecting on America’s economic power, Buffett called himself lucky for being born in the U.S. and stressed the strength and resilience the country has shown through wars, recessions, and historic developments. On investing, he revealed Berkshire nearly spent $10 billion recently and is open to spending even more when the right opportunity arises, admitting, “We're running a business which is very, very, very opportunistic.” He contrasted this with real estate, which he finds slow and less attractive due to complex ownership issues and long negotiations. Buffett also touched on the U.S. energy grid, saying major improvements are needed and comparing the situation to the urgency and innovation seen during World War II. He believes Berkshire’s unique capital and know-how can help reshape it. Regarding market behavior, Buffett downplayed recent volatility, advising investors to keep emotions in check and remember that building wealth doesn’t require taking unnecessary risks: “You only have to get rich once.” On global currencies, he cautioned against owning assets tied to devaluing currencies and hinted at future foreign investments being financed locally. Closing the session, Buffett reaffirmed his belief in capitalism’s success despite its flaws , acknowledging that while it's produced unmatched prosperity, it also carries the risks of turning into a ""massive casino.""",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-05-03 23:01:04

And investors tuned into early momentum are already paying attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader While many new tokens enter the market, few manage to gain meaningful early traction. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving to be an exception. Rapid wallet growth, increased community engagement, and disciplined rollout strategies are already visible. The project’s leadership is actively engaging, and investor interest is rising steadily—quietly but significantly. This is a token being built with purpose. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just structured growth and strategic delivery. For those who recognize early-stage patterns, MAGACOINFINANCE is looking more like a contender than a question mark. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron continues to dominate in volume-based on-chain activity, particularly across markets demanding low fees and high-speed settlement. Sei is gaining developer attention for its speed-oriented infrastructure—tailored specifically for high-frequency trading applications. These are strong ecosystem players—but their early growth phase has already passed. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just getting started—where real upside often lies. Final Word Can XRP , Bitcoin , Solana , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM set new highs in the next cycle? Momentum is aligning, sentiment is improving, and early entries are becoming harder to find. Of them all, MAGACOINFINANCE may be the one still hidden in plain sight—quietly preparing to lead the next wave.

With the premier cryptocurrency seemingly back on the bullish track, a prominent crypto analyst has emerged with a warning of sorts for BTC investors extremely optimistic about the coin’s future trajectory. BTC Price Could Continue Upward Movement If Support Holds In a May 2 post on the X platform, crypto platform Burak Kesmeci has put forward an interesting outlook on the current Bitcoin setup, identifying a price level that may be critical to the coin’s long-term health. The online pundit dove into BTC’s price structure and its potential future movements based on the Pi Cycle Top indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Warming Up: Analyst Maps 3 Scenarios That Could Trigger the Next Big Rally The Pi Cycle Top indicator is a forecasting tool that uses two major moving averages (a short-term 111-day moving average and the 350-day moving average) to pinpoint the peaks of Bitcoin bull cycles. Historically, a crossover of the short-term MA above the long-term MA signals a potential price top in the Bitcoin market. As it stands, these two Pi Cycle moving averages are moving in opposite directions, suggesting that the price of Bitcoin might still have some room for upward growth in this cycle. At the same time, the 111-day moving average can act as a support level, often signaling buying opportunities for investors looking to enter the market or double down. As observed in the chart below, the price of Bitcoin tends to bounce back whenever it hits the short-term moving average. According to Kesmeci, this 111-day moving average is hovering around the $91,200 level, which represents the most crucial support zone as the Bitcoin price approaches a close on the weekly timeframe. The on-chain analyst expects the flagship cryptocurrency to continue its current upward price run if it manages multiple weekly closes above the short-term moving average. Bitcoin Price Overview As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $96,685, reflecting a mere 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours. While the premier cryptocurrency has not replicated its previous week’s red-hot form this week, it did make a strong start to the new month.

Inspired by Ripple’s achievements, Ruvi AI is taking it to the next level with a revolutionary approach that combines blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI). Ruvi AI is going to change industries by bringing transparency, efficiency and scalability to the forefront. What Is Ruvi AI and What Does It Offer? Ruvi AI is a forward thinking platform that merges the power of AI with the transparency and decentralization of blockchain. Its mission is to provide practical tools and solutions to real world problems faced by businesses in various industries. Ruvi AI uses blockchain’s secure infrastructure to create a transparent environment for data sharing and uses AI to generate advanced insights and improve decision making. The platform is particularly useful in fields like logistics, finance and supply chain management where predictive analytics, fraud detection and operational optimization are key. By integrating AI directly into its blockchain based ecosystem Ruvi AI stands out from other projects in the crypto space. It’s committed to delivering solutions that improve efficiency and create tangible benefits for businesses worldwide. A Strong Start to the Presale Ruvi AI has got off to a flying start with its presale . Within days of launch the project sold over 10 million tokens and raised over $100,000. This is a testament to the growing confidence in Ruvi AI’s vision and its long term potential. Ruvi AI tokens are available in Phase 1 for just $0.01 per token. But time is of the essence as the price will increase by 50% in Phase 2 so get in early to maximize your returns. Ruvi AI has shown its commitment to progress by launching its beta platform just after the presale started. The beta showcases the platform’s core features including AI powered tools for data analysis and blockchain backed solutions for transparency. This is a major milestone in Ruvi AI’s roadmap and proves they are delivering results. VIP Tier 4 Benefits For serious investors looking for big returns, VIP Tier 4 is the opportunity. This tier requires investors to accumulate 200,000 Ruvi AI tokens which gets them an 80% bonus. For example, by investing $2,000 at the current token price of $0.01, investors will get 200,000 tokens as base. The 80% bonus adds another 160,000 tokens, making it 360,000 tokens. With the listing price already confirmed at $0.07, this would be worth $25,200, 12.6x return. The growth potential is even more obvious when you consider Ruvi AI’s long term target of $1 per token which would value the same investment at $360,000. Leaderboard Rewards for the Community Ruvi AI is going to share its success with its growing community and its Leaderboard rewards program is a proof of that. Designed to reward investors at all levels of contribution the program is accessible and generous to top contributors. For example the Top 10 investors will get 500,000 RUVI tokens. At $0.07 this is worth $35,000. If Ruvi AI reaches its projected token value of $1 this will be worth $500,000. Unbeatable returns for early supporters. Those in the Top 50 contributors will get 250,000 RUVI tokens. At $0.07 this is worth $17,500. But at $1 token value this will be worth $250,000. These rewards show the powerful incentives Ruvi AI is offering to its community so even smaller investors can benefit big time from the platform. Shaping the Future of Blockchain Ruvi AI is quickly becoming a leader in blockchain innovation inspired by Ripple XRP’s pioneering work. Its ability to integrate AI with blockchain sets it apart in a crowded space. By delivering real world solutions to real world problems Ruvi AI is more than just another blockchain project. With its successful presale, great VIP tier program and robust Leaderboard rewards Ruvi AI is open to a global community of investors and tech enthusiasts. Its commitment to transparency, efficiency and scalability makes it a part of the future of blockchain.Get in now.

In a new announcement, Binance says that on May 2nd, it rolled out support for the decentralized omnichain protocol StakeStone ( STO ). “Binance is excited to announce the 17th project on the HODLer Airdrops page – StakeStone, a decentralized omnichain liquidity infrastructure protocol designed to transform how liquidity is acquired, distributed, and utilized across blockchain ecosystems.” The HODLer Airdrops program, which launched in June 2024, rewards those holding Binance’s native asset BNB with crypto based on previous snapshots of their balances. News of the addition caused STO to explode, as it went from a May 2nd low of $0.118 to a peak of $0.204 just hours later. The digital asset has since retraced and is trading for $0.197 at time of writing, a 64.3% increase during the last 24 hours. The project’s whitepaper says it aims to solve the issue of liquidity fragmentation within the digital assets industry. “The fragmentation of liquidity across different chains and protocols across the blockchain ecosystem results in billions of dollars in trapped capital and missed yield opportunities, reducing value creation and ecosystem growth. Users face complex workflows and high costs when moving assets between chains, while protocols struggle to maintain deep liquidity pools. StakeStone serves as a foundational infrastructure layer that enables efficient liquidity distribution across the entire blockchain ecosystem. By providing a standardized framework for cross-chain liquidity management, StakeStone empowers both established and emerging networks to access and deploy capital efficiently.” STO was also a part of Binance Alpha, a wallet feature that started in December 2024. At the time, the crypto exchange said it was “a new platform within the Binance Wallet that shines a spotlight on early-stage crypto projects with the potential to grow within the Web3 ecosystem.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

MANTRA’s price outlook is improving after the platform confirmed a large 300 million coin burn. The move comes after a sharp 90% price decline in April. Traders see this as a positive step to help bring balance to the project. Meanwhile, PEPE has jumped 16.25%, gaining strong momentum as it nears critical resistance. Market watchers are closely tracking whether it can break through upcoming levels. BlockDAG is making waves in the presale scene, with over $225 million raised so far. A limited-time $0.0019 entry price is available until May 13. With Batch 28 priced at $0.0262 and a launch price set at $0.05, BDAG stands out as a top presale option. Keep reading to understand why BlockDAG is attracting attention from over 17,000 miner buyers. MANTRA Forecast Looks Up After Major Burn Announcement The 300 million coin burn from MANTRA is giving its price outlook a much-needed boost. The platform hopes this move can reduce sell pressure and bring long-term growth back on track. This came after a tough drop of 90% earlier this month. As of now, $OM trades near $0.4482. The coin faces resistance at $0.560 and has support at $0.517. If that support breaks, a dip to $0.505 could be next, based on recent price forecasts. While the burn may create short-term optimism, experts believe long-term gains will only come if trading volumes and market conditions improve. PEPE Surges 16.25%, Testing Resistance at $0.00001 The price of PEPE has made a strong move, rising 16.25% this week to $0.000009086. This is a bounce from its recent low of $0.000007841. With trading activity increasing, all eyes are now on the $0.00001 resistance mark. If PEPE clears this level, it could climb to $0.00001050. However, analysts expect some price swings before stability returns. PEPE has followed this pattern before, where big gains were followed by brief corrections. If the resistance breaks cleanly, the coin might be in for another rally phase. PEPE remains one of the top trending coins this week. BlockDAG Raises $225M and Offers $0.0019 Limited Entry Until May 13 BlockDAG has now raised more than $225 million, making it one of the most successful ongoing crypto presales. A major factor behind this rise is a new entry price of just $0.0019, available until May 13. This offer has created major excitement, especially since Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262 with a $0.05 launch target. The project recently held an AMA session revealing new updates. It completed audits by CertiK and Halborn, proving its commitment to security. Users also got a look at the Beta Testnet, which performs twice as fast as the earlier version. A live demo of the X1 miner further confirmed that BlockDAG is delivering real progress, not just ideas. Over 19.7 billion BDAG coins have been sold and 17,269 miners purchased, adding to the project’s growing community. With over $6.9 million in miner sales, interest is clearly strong. Analysts suggest BDAG could hit $1 this year. If that happens, the returns from the current entry point could exceed 2,520%. A major update is also expected once the offer closes, which could push the price even higher. PEPE and MANTRA Show Strength, But BDAG Grabs the Spotlight The MANTRA burn event may help its recovery, but more time is needed for a clearer trend. PEPE has momentum and could move higher if it clears the next resistance. Still, BlockDAG is the name everyone’s watching. With a confirmed $0.0019 offer live until May 13 and massive support already behind it, BDAG looks ready for a strong breakout. The price setup, product demos, and large-scale buying activity all point toward BlockDAG being one of the most watched presales right now.

That’s exactly what’s happening with Bitcoin , Ethereum , Solana , and the rising contender, MAGACOINFINANCE . As the heavyweights strengthen their base, its early-stage players like MAGACOINFINANCE offer something even more compelling: early positioning before wider market recognition kicks in. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment The quiet accumulation phase is often the most important—and MAGACOINFINANCE is deep in that zone right now. Wallet growth is increasing steadily, community expansion remains organic, and every update aligns with disciplined execution rather than overhyped noise. The signs are clear: this project is focused on longevity, not short-term swings. It’s moving like many successful early plays have before—purposefully, structurally, and with staying power. Those entering now aren’t chasing—they’re positioning. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin (BTC) continues to serve as the leading store of value in the crypto space, with institutional backing and ETF integration reinforcing its role in long-term portfolios. Ethereum (ETH) remains the infrastructure backbone for decentralized applications, with recent upgrades driving new levels of scalability and security across its ecosystem. Solana (SOL) is holding strong with developer momentum, fast execution speeds, and renewed attention from builders migrating to low-cost, high-performance networks. These three continue to define the top layer—but early-stage projects like MAGACOINFINANCE represent where the outsized return potential still exists. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism is expanding Ethereum’s utility by reducing cost and congestion across smart contract activity. Aptos appeals to developers and users looking for next-gen performance and an improved user experience across decentralized platforms. Chainlink dominates the oracle space, integrating real-world data into blockchain environments with ever-growing reach and reliability. Each of these projects is valuable—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rare combination of early momentum and undervalued market position that few others still provide. Final Word Is a $1.3 million path truly unfolding? The combination of consolidation among market giants and strategic early-stage movement often leads to some of the crypto market’s most remarkable outcomes. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana are showing strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the one creating fresh momentum today. Those watching now may be the ones leading tomorrow.

Right now, four assets are catching the attention of strategic investors: XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE . While the larger caps hold steady, it’s early-phase entries like MAGACOINFINANCE that could define the next growth wave—and the window may still be open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off Spotting a strong project before the crowd is rare—but MAGACOINFINANCE is offering just that kind of window right now. Wallet growth is consistent. Community engagement is rising without artificial spikes. Developer updates are arriving on time, and early-stage capital is quietly moving in before mainstream exposure. There’s no shortcut being taken—just disciplined execution and strategic growth. For investors seeking uninflated value and authentic early-stage positioning, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the final high-upside opportunities in this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano continues to lead with its research-driven approach to secure smart contract deployment and sustainability. NEAR Protocol is accelerating adoption through its developer-friendly design and seamless onboarding for dApp builders. Kaspa appeals to performance-focused users with its proof-of-work blockDAG model—offering speed, scalability, and security. Arbitrum is dominating the Ethereum Layer-2 space, delivering efficient scaling and lower gas costs for decentralized applications. While each of these platforms is building critical infrastructure, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early-stage, undervalued momentum that is increasingly rare. Final Word Can $650 really become $800K ? For those who’ve studied crypto cycles, it’s clear: timing and early conviction matter. XRP , Bitcoin , and Ethereum offer enduring strength. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM offers discovery-phase growth—and that’s exactly where major wealth shifts have historically begun.

While each asset brings its own strengths, market participants are growing cautious amid mixed technical signals — and many are turning their focus to emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE for more aggressive upside potential. Ethereum Holds Above $1,830, But Struggles for Direction Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $1,832.06 , with a +0.48% move in the past hour, but down -0.27% over the last 24 hours. Its 7-day performance is slightly positive at +2.01% , showing modest resilience. Despite its role as the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum’s growth has slowed. With major upgrades priced in and gas fees still an issue, investors are beginning to question how much more upside remains in the short term. ETH remains a long-term pillar of DeFi, but near-term traders are now seeking sharper ROI plays. Cardano Slips Under Pressure at $0.7031 Cardano (ADA) is currently priced at $0.7031 , gaining +0.99% in the last hour but falling -0.59% in 24 hours and -1.09% for the week. Despite ADA’s loyal base and consistent ecosystem upgrades, price action has failed to reflect long-term enthusiasm. With resistance forming near $0.72 and a lack of high-volume buying, ADA’s sideways action may continue unless a significant technical breakout occurs. Many traders are rotating capital into underexposed alternatives with higher growth ceilings. Shiba Inu Drops Sharply Despite Meme Coin Buzz SHIB is trading at $0.00001324 , with a +0.73% hourly bump, but down -1.50% over 24 hours and a steeper -7.39% on the 7-day chart. Shiba Inu remains one of the most talked-about meme tokens, but its recent performance suggests fading interest from short-term holders. With no major catalyst on the horizon and momentum waning, SHIB is under pressure as traders begin exploring fundamentally stronger microcaps. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Strength as Altcoin Rotation Intensifies While larger caps stall, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming a favored early-stage target among investors looking for long-term upside. Still under the radar, the project is gaining recognition for its smart release structure, clean tokenomics, and a community-led approach that avoids VC dominance. The project’s growth potential is drawing comparisons to early-stage tokens that later surged 30x or more. Forecasts point to 30x upside from current levels, with early entry still available through its official site. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its positioning before broader exchange exposure. With the crypto cycle entering a new phase and capital rotating out of fatigued majors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum as a fresh, institutional play. With institutional-grade branding, real-time traction, and a growing community of over 14,000 holders, the project is quickly climbing up the 2025 altcoin watchlist.

Analysts suggest that if ADA maintains its current momentum, it could rally toward $0.94. Dogecoin (DOGE), trading around $0.18, has experienced a 12.26% increase over the last week. While both ADA and DOGE exhibit potential for growth, investors are also turning their attention to emerging token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is gaining traction in the crypto community. The project is currently in Phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. The price of MUTM token will climb to $0.03 during Phase 5 locking in a 20% ROI for phase 4 buyers. From its launch the project has managed to secure 9300 investors and raise more than $7.4 million. Phase 4 has already sold out over 50% of it. Investors should enter now before its over. Cardano (ADA) Struggles With Key Support at $0.65 Amid Market Correction Cardano (ADA) has corrected heavily, falling to a key support level of $0.65. This followed a general market decline that affected most cryptocurrencies. Despite the bearish momentum, some indication of possible recovery is beginning to surface. The daily time frame MACD indicator has recorded a bullish crossover, suggesting that the buying pressure is returning. If ADA remains firm at $0.65 and continues to show this resilience, it can cause a reversal to resistance levels of $0.70 and $0.80. Any failure to maintain the $0.65 level support can, however, cause further losses. Investors are also eyeing other near-future projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are popular in the present market situation. Dogecoin Targets $0.27 Break on Meme Coin Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) is up 12% this week and stands at $0.18 currently, with analysts looking for a breakout point of $0.27. The move here is fueled by robust meme coin sentiment, but DOGE still grapples with high resistance. Even though potentially, even younger projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are drawing upside-focused investors.

After an extensive price correction that began in December 2024, the prominent altcoin may have finally found some bullish momentum to turn around investors’ fortunes. Interestingly, prominent crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has shed some positive light on this development. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms Long-Legged Doji On Monthly Chart – Reversal Or Just A Pause? Ethereum Retail Investor Inflows Support Bullish Case In an X post on May 2, Burak Kesmeci postulates that Ethereum may be entering a prolonged price uptrend based on the short-term holders’ activity. According to the seasoned analyst, the number of ETH short-term holders or traders is headed for a particular threshold that historically signifies a long-term price rally. In the ETH market, short-term holders refer to wallets or addresses that have recently acquired ETH, usually less than 155 days. These investors are usually sensitive to market trends and price volatility, often driven by speculation and quick profit-taking rather than long-term conviction. Typically, a rising number of short-term investors indicates renewed market interest due to new market entrants. However, Kesmeci states that ETH short-term holders, presently at 3.92 million, must cross above 4 million to suggest the ETH market possesses sufficient bullish strength for a robust uptrend. Notably, Ethereum produced strong price rallies when STH numbers previously rose above 4 million, as seen in 2022 and 2024. Kesmeci states that as long as ETH short-term holders remain below this threshold, it may reflect insufficient market demand to sustain Ethereum’s current rally. Meanwhile, the number of Ethereum long-term holders has now reached 104.24 million, indicating a strong market confidence in the asset’s price appreciation prospects. A rise in LTH generally occurs due to coin maturation as short-term holders opt against selling for over 155 days.

Ethereum SMA 365 Presents Another Barrier Alongside developments in the short-term holders cohort, Burak Kesmeci notes that Ethereum remains far below its 365-day simple moving average (SMA 365), suggesting that market bulls are yet to take full control of the market. As the name implies, the SMA 365 measures the average closing price over the last 365 days. It is used to indicate price trends and often acts as a resistance in bearish markets or support in bullish markets. Despite recent market gains, ETH must move above its SMA 365 at $2,849 to confirm any intent of a strong uptrend. At press time, Ethereum trades at $1,835, reflecting a price decline of 0.80% in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s trading volume is down by 15.01%.
