On the spotlight today is the meme coin BONK. If the meme coin breaks $0.000041 in October, it will have already made history because it set a new milestone and secured a tough spot for itself in the market — and setting the stage for what an analyst says is the “start of the dog season.” Related Reading: ETF Hopes Propel Litecoin 12% Higher, Bullish Predictions On The Cards BONK: Recent Price Movements Signal A Shift Recently, the price activity of BONK suggests a trend reversal. After hitting bottom at $0.000001567, the coin recently started gaining traction upward and grabbed the attention not only of the retail but also of the institutional market. Of interesting note here, the last increase in price was 8.59%. Until the date of this rise, it hasn’t changed much from this percentage. $BONK – This setup is now ready, cat season is over it’s time for the dogs. pic.twitter.com/Hbr9owNcoz — Astekz (@astekz) October 16, 2024 Over the past week, BONK has surged almost 20% and traded from $0.000001917 to nearly $0.000002395. Technical Indicators suggest it forms a rising wedge and may follow through with the double bottom pattern formed on June 24 at the level of $0.000001984. An upward-pointing MACD with a bullish crossover further complements its upward momentum. Key Resistance Levels And Analyst Predictions BONK has met strong resistance at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, which stands at $0.000002265, ignoring the recent rally. If it cannot break through this level, the coin will proceed into a consolidation rather than upwards. The next resistance that BONK needs to break through is the 50% Fibonacci retracement standing at $0.0000025. According to estimations from the analysts, at this level, the price will advance to a high of either $0.0000035, $0.0000048, or $0.0000070. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Potential Setbacks And Market Volatility However, BONK does not have an easy ride ahead. On one hand, the coin recently faced a minor 1.07% intraday drop in price accompanied by signs of price rejection, this may speak to or lead to possible short-term volatility, which can further detriment the growth of the meme coin. Another retest of the broader falling channel pattern might thus lie ahead, which could precede yet another breakout attempt. With meme coins back on the map in the crypto sphere, everything about BONK in October will be followed closely as the market waits to see if the coin continues upward, hitting new heights, or runs into new low points in the weeks to come.

This relates to the short positions that could be liquidated if the flagship crypto hits that price target, a development that will be bullish for BTC. Almost $33.14 Billion Will Be Wiped Out If Bitcoin Price Hits $72,462 Ash Crypto mentioned the liquidation alert in an X post, revealing that $33.14 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price hits $72,462. These BTC bears are already in danger of getting liquidated, considering that the flagship crypto is fast approaching the $70,000 price level. This could pave the way for an extended rally to this liquidation price and even beyond. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Turn Bullish As ‘Something Big Is Coming’, Here’s What The liquidations of these Bitcoin shorts could be bullish for the flagship crypto, leading to an extended rally to new highs, especially with the current ATH of $73,00 being in sight once the price hits $72,462. However, there is also a scenario where the Bitcoin price could correct to flush out overleveraged longs before it continues with its move to the upside. For now, the Bitcoin price undoubtedly boasts a bullish outlook, considering how the flagship crypto has rallied since the start of this week. BTC briefly touched $69,000 on October 18, further providing optimism that the crypto could reach a new ATH soon enough. Standard Chartered recently predicted that it will likely happen before the November 5 US elections. Although that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s demand is again on the rise, which could fuel this rally to a new ATH. Specifically, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which fueled the run to a new ATH earlier in the year, are again actively accumulating. SpotOnChain data shows that these Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $2.13 billion this week. BlackRock, in particular, added $1.14 billion worth of BTC to its holdings. Bear Analyst Warns Crypto Traders Analyst Justin Bennett, known for bearish analysis, has warned traders to be cautious about trading amid this recent Bitcoin price rally. He stated that things do not add up and that staying cautious during periods like this is the best way to survive. He added that he won’t be making any bold predictions at the moment because the data is conflicting. Related Reading: Expert Calls On Ripple Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 However, he suggested that market participants shouldn’t be excited about Bitcoin’s breakout from the seven-month range.

Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, who has been a Bitcoin bear lately, also warned that the Bitcoin price rally is being driven by the perpetuals market. In a recent X post, he noted that open interest has officially surpassed the level it was at before the last BTC drop from $70,000 to $49,000.

The buzz of a Bitcoin price upsurge is making headlines as two crypto experts raised the possibility of it hitting the six-figure mark per coin, intensifying the discussion on the coin’s future. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Bitcoin: On The Road To $100,000 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted that Bitcoin price will likely breach the six-figure level, saying that it is inevitable for the coin to reach that milestone. Hougan said, in his X post, that the bullish sentiment on the digital asset put Bitcoin on a path towards trading above $100,000. He explained that several favorable factors fuel the coin’s amplified growth, exciting traders and enthusiasts on what lies ahead for the virtual currency. We’re heading to six-figure bitcoin. * ETF flows reaccelerating * Election approaching * Infinite deficits (bipartisan agreement!) * Economic stimulus in China * Global rate cuts (Fed, ECB) * Halving supply shock starting to bite * Whales accumulating — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 18, 2024 Keiser’s Projection Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser shared the same sentiment about the future of BTC price, but his prediction is more than twice the price estimate given by Houghan. Keiser, who is also an advisor to El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, made a bold statement that Bitcoin price would surge to $220,000, saying that the coin is on track to reach a new all-time record for its price. The new ATH Gold price is predicting Bitcoin will trade over $220,000 very soon. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 18, 2024 Key Factors For The Six-Figure Price Houghan explained that a surge in BTC price is more likely due to several factors driving its price appreciation such as institutional interest, on-chain factors, and macroeconomics. All of these, he said, greatly contribute to the crypto’s price moving upward. On the other hand, Keiser believed that the alpha coin’s price would skyrocket because of gold, saying it is another “safe haven asset.” Currently, gold reached a new record of $2,713.88 per ounce, the first time it has happened in the last four years. Keiser suggested a correlation between gold and the crypto, arguing that once gold price hits an all-time high, Bitcoin will follow and reach a similar milestone.

Hence, he is confident that Bitcoin can quickly reach the $220,000 level in the near future. Bitcoin And The US Election The looming US presidential election in November is seen as another catalyst in Bitcoin’s price appreciation. It has been observed that Bitcoin has been one of the key issues that US political candidates face in this year’s elections, wherein it has become necessary to stipulate their stance on cryptocurrencies. However, some believe that BTC prices will continue to have a strong performance regardless of who wins the presidential race.

This price action has fueled optimism among analysts and investors, who now anticipate significant gains in the coming weeks. Investors believe Bitcoin is ready for a strong rally after seven months of sideways accumulation. Critical data from Santiment reveals that the number of Bitcoin whales—large holders of BTC—grew substantially just as the price bottomed out around $59,000 on October 10th. Related Reading: Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs This increase in whale activity is often seen as a sign of “smart money” positioning for a major move. Large investors accumulating BTC during a low suggests that they are preparing for something big in the coming weeks. As excitement builds, market participants watch closely for further signals that Bitcoin could be headed for new all-time highs. With momentum on its side, Bitcoin appears ready to lead the market into the next phase of this cycle. Bitcoin Whale Activity Supports Bullish Outlook Bitcoin is trading near the historically reactive price level of $70,000. A critical zone that has consistently acted as resistance, pushing the price down five times over the past seven months. Each time Bitcoin approached this level, it triggered sell-offs or corrections, leading to caution among traders and investors. However, recent data from Santiment reveals that this resistance may be weakening due to increasing whale activity. Between October 10th and 13th, a net rise of +268 wallets holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC, signaling that large players are accumulating Bitcoin as the price rallies. Analysts often see an increase in whale wallets as a strong bullish indicator, suggesting that influential investors are positioning themselves for potential upside in the coming months. The timing of this accumulation is crucial, as it coincides with Bitcoin’s upward momentum, signaling that these big players expect further gains. As more large holders continue to enter the market, the window to buy Bitcoin at a favorable price narrows. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? This accumulation suggests that whales are betting on a sustained bull run, potentially weakening the $70,000 resistance level and allowing Bitcoin to push higher. With Bitcoin trading near this critical price zone, the next few weeks could be decisive, either breaking through $70,000 or facing another correction. BTC Testing Supply Levels Bitcoin is trading at $68,383 after several days of consistent highs, steadily pushing toward new supply levels. The price recently halted at $68,998 and now appears primed for a challenge to new all-time highs. This surge has created a wave of optimism, but analysts caution that a healthy retrace may be on the horizon. The 200-day moving average (MA), currently sitting at $63,322, is a key level to watch. If Bitcoin retraces to this support zone, it could signal strength for a renewed push higher, as this level has historically acted as a strong support during uptrends. Holding above the 200-day MA is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum. Related Reading: Strong Buy Signal For DogWifHat (WIF) – Key Indicator Hints At Rally To $4 If Bitcoin fails to break above the $70,000 resistance in the coming week, a retrace to lower demand is expected. This pullback would allow the market to regain liquidity and reset for a potential new rally. Investors are closely watching as the price action in the next few days will determine Bitcoin’s long-term outlook.

This sudden sell signal comes as the Dogecoin price jumped 10% following a recent comment by SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk. Dogecoin Price Flashes Sell Signal Dogecoin recently caught the interest of investors after its price dramatically surged by over 10%, surpassing the $0.127 mark in one day. The massive price increase was driven by social media hype and ongoing speculation about future endorsements from Musk, following his statements of a “Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E)” proposal. Related Reading: Expert Calls On Ripple Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 Despite the considerable surge in Dogecoin, analysts are cautioning that the price jump may be signaling an impending sell-off. Particularly, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn users that the meme coin was currently flashing a sell signal on the Dogecoin daily chart. While optimism for Dogecoin turned bullish after its price increase, it seems investors may have to get out of the market fast to preserve their new profits. While some loyal Dogecoin investors may hold on to their assets for the long term, short-term investors may be tempted to cash in on the recent gains. Based on the Dogecoin sell signal chart, Martinez predicts that the meme coin may experience a brief period of decline typically seen when meme coins experience sharp spikes. However, the analyst has also forecasted that after this short correction, Dogecoin may continue its upward momentum to reach new levels. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.1446, a significant increase from its price earlier this month which was standing at around $0.11 at some point. CoinMarketCap’s data has also revealed that Dogecoin soared by a whopping 30.49% over the past week and increased by 38.81% in the last month. It’s clear that the popular meme coin is on a major uptrend, as its chart has been in the green for some time now. Although Dogecoin did see some declines previously, investors’ optimism regarding the meme coin is high as its daily trading volume has increased by 12.29%. Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Going To $1 A crypto analyst identified as ‘Crow’ on X has confidently predicted a major bullish rally for Dogecoin. On October 18, the analyst predicted that the price of Dogecoin was going to $1 soon, possibly riding the wave of the upcoming crypto bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First The analyst shared a distinctive historical Dogecoin chart, covering the period from 2014 to the present, highlighting how the cryptocurrency had previously experienced strikingly similar market movements before hitting a price high. In line with this trend, Dogecoin seems to have created another unique triangle pattern that started in 2021 and has continued into 2024. It is possible that with the complete formation of this triangle pattern, Dogecoin may see a potential spike to $1. While the predictions remain ambitious speculations, Crow has remained confident, emphatically declaring that Dogecoin is the Bitcoin of meme coins.

After initially showcasing potential, the altcoin’s upward momentum has stalled, leading to a possible downturn. With key support levels at risk and bearish forces gaining traction, the outlook for LayerZero’s recovery appears increasingly uncertain. In this article, we will analyze LayerZero’s recent challenges, focusing on its stalled recovery amid intensified bearish pressure. It examines key technical indicators and market sentiment contributing to the downturn, providing insights into how these factors may impact ZRO’s price trajectory. Additionally, the article assesses critical support levels that could affect the token’s ability to navigate the current environment and explore the prospects for a potential rebound in the midst of ongoing market challenges. Current Market Landscape: Understanding The Bearish Pressure Recently, ZRO’s price has shown a bearish turn on the 4-hour chart, retracing below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after struggling to break above this key technical level. This inability to maintain upward momentum suggests a shift in market sentiment, with selling pressure outweighing buying interest. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a decline in the signal line, which has fallen to 44% after previously rising to 47%, indicating a shift in strength toward the neutral zone. A level of 44% means that the asset is nearing oversold territory, raising concerns about possible further declines. Related Reading: LayerZero Bounces Amid Market Retrace, ZRO Soars 20% Also, the daily chart for LayerZero reveals negative momentum, highlighted by multiple bearish candlesticks and a drop below the 100-day SMA. The formation of several pessimistic candlesticks and the breach below the SMA suggest that negative sentiment is strengthening as sellers exert downward pressure. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI has declined below the crucial 50% threshold, currently sitting at 44%. A reading under 50% implies that sellers are gaining dominance, which may lead to the asset approaching oversold territory and heightening concerns about more price declines. What’s Next For LayerZero? Based on current market activities, the price of LayerZero appears poised for an additional drop toward the $3.5 support level. If it breaches this level, it could lead to an extended downward movement for the cryptocurrency, pushing it toward other significant support levels. Related Reading: LayerZero Surges over 7% As Bulls Ignite Fresh Rally, A $4.5 Breakout Looms? However, if ZRO’s price stabilizes and regains bullish momentum, it may climb toward the $4.5 resistance mark. Should it successfully breach this level, it could lay the foundation for further gains, potentially targeting even higher resistance levels as market sentiment shifts back in favor of the bulls.

Despite XRP price experiencing persistent stagnation, the analyst has projected a major price increase as high as 4,800% for the popular cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Analysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto’s Future Major Resistance And Support Targets For XRP On 17 October, Egrag Crypto shared three major targets for the XRP price based on Channel B, a distinctive boundary XRP has struggled to breach for years. In the monthly time frame, XRP faces three primary resistance targets and three support marks. XRP price action within Channel B is constrained by key resistance levels that may dictate whether the cryptocurrency can break free from its long-term consolidation cycle. According to the analyst’s XRP price chart, the first major resistance level is seen around the $0.6450 price mark. Over the past few months, XRP has risen above $0.6, fueling hopes of a potential breakout but ultimately declining back to $0.5. A significant breakout from the $0.6450 level could signal a potential bullish momentum, but it would still remain within the bounds of Channel B. The second price target, $0.85 is a key target that XRP price has also struggled to maintain over the years. It also represents a mid-range of the entire XRP Channel B. Lastly, at the top end of Channel B and highlighting the most crucial resistance level is the $1.1 threshold. A sustained break from this critical resistance could mean XRP may finally escape Channel B and rally to new levels. Additionally, assisting these key resistance levels are three major support levels. The first line of defense if XRP fails to hit $0.645 is the support level at $0.48. If the cryptocurrency also breaks down below $0.85, the next support can be seen at $0.38. Finally, if XRP fails to break through $1.1 resistance, it may find support around new lows at $0.28. XRP Bullish Price Targets While highlighting key resistance and support levels for XRP, Egrag Crypto also emphasized three bullish price targets for XRP if it can successfully close the monthly candle inside Channel B. The first major breakout target sees XRP potentially skyrocketing to $7.5, at the 1.236 Fibonacci retracement level. The next major cycle target is the 1.414 Fibonacci retracement level, with XRP price possibly surging to $13 and marking explosive all-time highs. The ultimate and final cycle target, according to Egrag Crypto, is the 1.618 Fibonacci retracement level. If XRP can reach this level, its price could skyrocket to $27, marking a monumental increase for the cryptocurrency and potentially positioning it among the top-performing digital assets in the market.

Based on Messari’s tracking for Q3 2024, TRX’s market capitalization increased by 24%, from nearly $11 billion to $13.5 billion. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which the token has increased its circulating market cap, pushing the company into the Top 10 biggest cryptos by market cap. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst TRX’s price surge also extended to TRX/BTC pairing, which also notched a 25% increase. The token sits below XRP and Dogecoin in the list of top cryptos by market cap. It is powered primarily by USDT transactions and is launching on SunPump, the first ‘meme fair and online platform’. TRON Gets A Boost From SunPump The TRON network saw a massive increase in transaction volume in the third quarter thanks to the launching of SunPump. According to reports, TRX transactions increased 29% this third quarter to $151 million. In August alone, over 270 million TRX valued at $42 million was burned on SunPump. It’s considered the largest single-day burn for TRON. As a deflationary token, TRX is burned every time it’s used in a transaction to prop up its value. TRON Supply Dips In Q3 TRON sets a fixed supply of 100 billion coins to protect its value and prevent inflation. TRX’s market supply dipped from 87.20 billion in the third quarter to 86.62 billion. The network’s burning schedule, which outpaces the minting of new tokens, supports this. In short, TRX’s annualized inflation rate hit -2.7% compared to -2.4% from the previous quarter. TRON strives to find a balance between burning and printing new tokens. The network aims to decrease the token’s circulating supply, which can benefit holders and investors. Also, the yield in staking TRX has increased 13% quarter-on-quarter, which attracts more users and investors.

Holders and users can expect sustained growth for the network, thanks to increasing revenue, partly driven by the launching of a new meme coin fair and platform. Also, the network’s token-burning policy currently outpaces minting, thus boosting the potential value of the token. Finally, stats from Dune suggest that over 90,000 meme coins have been launched through TRON’s network using SunPump. August 20th was the most active day, with over 7,500 coins released, highlighting the meme coins’ platform role in sustaining TRON.

Cloud mining is an advantageous business model for BitFuFu because it provides ongoing working capital for the company. Q2 unaudited financial results show a 69.7% YoY growth in total sales and 66.8% YoY growth in cloud mining sales. BitFuFu's revenue has grown at an impressive ~66% CAGR, and the Bitcoin miner is on track to maintain or surpass that growth rate for fiscal year 2024. I initiated coverage on BitFuFu (FUFU) in June. That article, titled: BitFuFu: The Lesser-Known Bitcoin Miner With Growth Potentials , was the first coverage of the stock here on Seeking Alpha. I went into detail about the company's business model and operations, and the Q1 financial results in that coverage. Seeking Alpha Following my initial coverage on June 6 at a stock price of $3.59, FUFU has seen a volatile price movement, mainly due to Bitcoin’s volatility in recent times. Shortly after that publication, FUFU surged by 86%, reaching $6.71 two weeks later on June 25. Following that initial price surge, FUFU witnessed a series of volatility, recording a high of around $5.80 in July and a low of $3.90 the same month. FUFU currently trades at $4.60. We’ll find out in this article if FUFU is currently undervalued relative to peers and if the current price would be a good buy for the stock. For readers not familiar with the company, BitFuFu is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company headquartered in Singapore. The company has close ties with Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing giant BITMAIN, an existing partnership with one of the biggest Bitcoin mining pools in the world ANTPOOL, and has a founder and CEO who is very experienced in the crypto mining business. The founder and CEO Leo Lu headed the cloud mining division at BITMAIN for several years, before going on to found BitFuFu in December 2020. Several other key members of BitFuFu’s team were former members at BITMAIN and Bitdeer ( BTDR ). Leo Lu’s experience in cloud mining from his time at BITMAIN reflects on BitFuFu operations today. Cloud mining has been an innovative business line for BitFuFu and is becoming the main growth driver for the company, now accounting for about 60% of the company's total revenue as of Q2 2024. FUFU started trading on Nasdaq in March this year, following a successful business combination with Arisz Acquisition in a $1.5 billion deal. A Look At BitFuFu Q2 Financial and Operational Highlights Q2 results highlights (BitFuFu) BitFuFu released their unaudited Q2 results on August 20. The financial result showed increase in sales, surge in cloud mining users, and impressive sales record from the cloud mining segment. For self-mined BTC production, the total BTC mined from the self-mining operations decreased 23.1% YoY, from 1,014 BTC in Q2 2023 to 780 BTC in Q2 2024. This decline in BTC produced during the quarter doesn't come as a surprise as virtually every Bitcoin miner has recorded a decline in BTC production since the Bitcoin halving event in April. Revenue and EBITDA trend (BitFuFu) Zooming out and examining BitFuFu’s revenue trend, BitFuFu's total revenue has grown at an impressive ~66% CAGR since 2021. In the latest financial result , BitFuFu recorded $129.4 million in total revenue for Q2 2024 - which is a 69.7% YoY increase and a noteworthy feat, considering the effects of the April 2024 halving event on the mining industry. BitFuFu’s full-year revenue in 2021 was $103 million. In 2022 revenue grew by 92%, bringing the full-year 2022 revenue to $198 million. In 2023 revenue grew by 43%, reaching $284.1 million for the full year . BitFuFu is already on track to surpass 2023 full-year $284.1 million revenue by a significant margin because the revenues recorded so far in Q1 2024 and Q2 2024 totals $273.8 million, which already nearly matches the 2023 full-year revenue. With such performance in the first half of 2024 alone, if we extrapolate the sales figure for the year we can make a valid assumption that BitFuFu is on track to maintain the same impressive 66% CAGR or even higher for the 2024 fiscal year. In our extrapolation, we still have to keep risk factors like market volatility and macro factors at the back of our minds. With these factors in mind, and assuming other factors remain constant, I believe that this assumption isn't far-fetched. Historically, BitFuFu has recorded slightly higher revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half, which is in line with this revenue extrapolation. Net asset trend (Author) On the liquidity front, BitFuFu has managed its balance sheet impressively. BitFuFu has achieved one of the best fleet efficiencies without a heavy balance sheet leverage, and has consecutively maintained a positive net asset since 2022, and still maintained a positive net asset in Q2 2024, despite the impact of the April 2024 halving on the mining industry. Total assets in Q2 2024 was $293.2 million. Total liabilities was $175.43 million, resulting in a net asset of $117.77 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and digital assets held by BitFuFu at the end of Q2 was $155 million, implying a healthy short-term and long-term liquidity position. BitFuFu’s cloud mining business model is an advantage for BitFuFu's ongoing liquidity. The cloud mining segment provides BitFuFu with active working capital as users subscribe to Bitcoin cloud mining services. As users pay upfront to subscribe to cloud mining services, it generates immediate cash inflow for BitFuFu, which can be used to fund ongoing operations. Mining fleet efficiency trend overtime (BitFuFu) Since Q2 2022, BitFuFu has scaled its hosting capacity by more than 500%, which was at 100 MW in Q1 2022 and at 522 MW as of the end of Q2. BitFuFu’s mining capacity has also grown from 3.0 EH/S in Q1 2022 to 24.7 EH/S as of the end of Q2. BitFuFu's mining capacity growth has been matched with improved fleet efficiency. BitFuFu's mining fleet has recorded reduced Joules per Terahash (J/Th) values over the quarters stands at ~21.1 J/Th. This is proof of BitFuFu's expertise in scaling resources to achieve better efficiency. At an average fleet efficiency of 21.1 J/Th, BitFuFu currently boasts one of the lowest joules per terahash value (best fleet) in the industry. The joules per terahash metric simply shows how much electricity a miner’s fleet consumes per terahash of hashrate. The less electricity consumed, the better it is for the miner’s operations. Hence, lower Joules per terahash means better efficiency. How BitFuFu Stacks Up to Peers In terms of production capacity and efficiency, BitFuFu stacks up high in the industry. As mentioned earlier, BitFuFu’s average fleet efficiency stands at around 21.1 J/Th, surpassing larger mining peers in terms of efficiency. MARA Holdings (former Marathon Digital) ( MARA ) currently averages 23.5 J/Th in efficiency, Bitdeer sees 31.6 J/Th in efficiency, and Hut 8 ( HUT ) has an average efficiency of 31.7 J/Th. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts From a relative valuation standpoint, BitFuFu currently trades at 1.82x P/S ratio and 1.72x EV/Sales. Peers like MARA trade at 7.98x P/S ratio and 9.55x EV/Sales. HUT trade at 3.49x P/S and 4x EV/Sales. A cloud mining peer BTDR trades at 2.31x P/S and 2.92x EV sales. FUFU is currently undervalued to the peer group based on its sales figure, and if we further go by the extrapolated value for full year 2024 potential sales of ~$547 million, forward P/S sales and EV/sales for BitFuFu would be 1.37x and 1.47x respectively. This would make FUFU one of the most undervalued stocks among Bitcoin miners. Risks As reiterated on Bitcoin stocks covered on Seeking Alpha, crypto assets and stocks linked to crypto exhibit a higher amount of price instability. Volatility in Bitcoin's price can also affect the financial standing of mining companies as well, as they typically hold large amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Takeaway Revisiting FUFU, a “buy” is recommended for this mining stock for investors interested in the Bitcoin mining sector because BitFuFu has maintained its track record of strong operational and financial performance. BitFuFu has plenty of room to scale its operations and grow its business, and its business model allows for such expansion with ease. The cloud mining user base growth, currently 395,000+ registered cloud mining users, bodes well for the company as it provides active working capital for the company when users purchase mining contracts, reducing the need to leverage its balance sheet. With the growing interest in gaining crypto exposure among retail and institutional investors, BitFuFu could turn out to be the star mining company of this Bitcoin market cycle, mainly because of cloud mining.",BTC-USD|FUFUW|BTDR|FUFU,EN,0,0,MINING|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-20 09:01:21

Despite the quiet performance in the past day, the premier cryptocurrency has managed to hold its own above $68,000. However, a prominent crypto pundit on social media platform X has said that the price of BTC might not be able to hang on to this level for too long. This has left several investors wondering if this potential correction is only a hiccup or a complete turnaround in the latest bull run resurgence. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price To Face Brief Correction — What Next? In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an interesting prognosis for the price of Bitcoin, saying that the premier cryptocurrency might be set for a brief correction in the short term. According to the pundit, the “Tom Demark” (TD) Sequential has flashed a sell signal for the BTC price on the daily chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Away With 9% Surge: Why This Could Trouble Bitcoin The TD Sequential is an indicator in technical analysis used to identify potential points of trend exhaustion and price reversal. This technical analysis tool comprises two major phases; namely the TD Setup phase and the TD Countdown phase. Specifically, the Setup phase is made up of nine candles of the same polarity (bearish and bullish). In a bullish Setup phase, the starting number “1” is plotted on a candle that closes higher than the close of the candle four periods ago. Meanwhile, a bearish “Setup” is characterized by the starting number “1” on a candle that closes lower than the close of the candle four periods ago. A potential point of reversal can be identified when the TD Sequential plots figure on the top or bottom of a candle in a bullish or bearish trend. As shown in the chart above, the number “9” has only just been printed on top of a candlestick on the Bitcoin daily chart, signaling the completion of the Setup phase. Considering that the Bitcoin price was originally in a bullish trend, it appears that the flagship cryptocurrency is set for a brief correction for a few days. In recent days, there have been heavy discussions around the price of BTC revisiting and perhaps surpassing its current all-time high. Nevertheless, Martinez advised investors to anticipate the Bitcoin price experiencing a brief pullback “before higher highs.” Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $68,272, reflecting a mere 0.5% dip in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by nearly 9% in the last seven days.

Meanwhile, their Ethereum counterparts have finally turned the corner registering their third positive weekly inflows since their trading debut in July. Related Reading: Analyst Backs Spot Bitcoin ETFs To Surpass Gold ETFs In Cumulative Net Inflows Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record Highest Daily Inflow Since June After a return to positive net flows in the second week of October, the spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted massive levels of investments in the past week which began with $555.86 million worth of inflows recorded on Monday, October 14, representing the highest daily inflows witnessed by these ETFs since June 4. According to data from SoSoValue, these Bitcoin ETFs experienced positive investments of similar sizes for the rest of the week culminating in a total inflow of $2.18 billion, which is the fourth-highest weekly net flow registered by these investment funds since their launch in January. Of these reported figures, over $1.14 billion was invested in BlackRock’s IBIT, which retains its position as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with cumulative net inflows of $22.84 billion. Unsurprisingly, Fidelity’s FBTC came a distant second with inflows valued at $318.82 million. Bitwise’s BITB also attracted investments valued at $149.81 million while Grayscale’s GBTC broke a 21-week streak of outflows, recording its largest weekly inflow of $91.47 million. All other spot Bitcoin ETFs except Hashdex’s DEFI also experienced significant levels of inflows albeit below $50 million. Presently, the cumulative total net inflows of the spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $20.98 billion. Meanwhile, these investment funds hold total net assets of $66.11 billion i.e. 4.89% of the Bitcoin market cap. These figures being achieved within ten months of trading demonstrate the enormous potential of these ETFs in driving Bitcoin adoption.

Similar to their Bitcoin counterpart, BlackRock’s ETHA accounted for the majority of the reported figures with a $49.76 million inflow while Fidelity’s FETH emerged second, attracting investments valued at $43.52 million. The spot Ethereum ETFs continue to report a negative cumulative total net outflow of $479.99 million while holding 2.31% of the Ethereum market cap represented in $7.35 billion ETH.

A ""Bull Flag"" pattern has formed, with a breakout above $68,426.11 suggesting a potential bullish trend-wave target of $117,361.68. Historical examples, like Nvidia, show that these chart patterns can be accurate within a range, though exact precision isn't expected due to heightened cryptocurrency volatility. I remain bullish on BTC-USD unless prices fall below $64,778.44, with current momentum potentially driving prices above $100,000 for the first time in market history. When I last covered Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on April 26th with “ Bitcoin: Future Results, Not Past Performance ”, the market’s central cryptocurrency pairing was attempting to recover from significant losses that developed during a recent crash from the all-time highs of $73,835.57 posted on March 14th, 2024. Ultimately, this bearish trend wave would go on to generate losses of more than -21.06% before finding a bottom on August 5th (with lows of $58,282.83): BTC-USD: Prior Market Price Declines (Income Generator via Trading View) Since then, BTC-USD has traded mostly within a sideways range that cryptocurrency bears might consider to be directionless in nature. Overall, this recent parallel channel has been defined by resistance levels near $70,125, while support zones during this trading period have been largely defined by levels near $53,400: BTC-USD: Trading Range Develops (Income Generator via Trading View) However, whenever I have heard this criticism of the preeminent cryptocurrency, I have generally taken a bit of a different viewpoint. Rather than viewing this recent price action as “stalling” or as being “directionless”, I have often presented counter-arguments using the phrase “period of consolidation”. In many instances, periods of consolidation are often followed by trending price movements that are much more substantial and decisive in nature. Of course, these types of conditions can occur in both bullish and bearish directions. In this case, I believe that the most probable outcome is one that could center BTC-USD valuations in a decisively bullish direction, and I will make the case for this optimistic argument using a powerful technical analysis chart pattern formation that is called a “Bull Flag”: BTC-USD: Bull Flag Pattern Emerges (Income Generator via Trading View) In the chart above, I have outlined the original chart pattern formation that I identified near the end of September. As we can see, the base of the “flag pole” is defined by August-September 2024 support zones near $24,900 and the peak of the structure is formed by the $73,835.57 high posted on March 14th. What follows is a period of sideways consolidation within a parallel price channel that shows a moderately downward trajectory. As a general rule, these price patterns are triggered once we see a convincing break above the top of the “flag” structure, and I prefer to wait until I see a daily or weekly close above these price regions before I execute trading strategies accordingly. Ultimately, I waited to publish this trading idea until I saw a more convincing break of the price pattern because bullish projections are not actually confirmed until market prices break above the top of the “flag” structure. BTC-USD: Critical Upside Breakout Point (Income Generator via Trading View) In this next price chart, we can see that a more convincingly bullish trigger-signal has finally occurred. Specifically, we will zoom into the most recent daily close (October 18th) in BTC-USD, which was seen at $68,426.11 per coin. Here, we can see that broader trends within the cryptocurrency market have been forceful enough to finally overcome the downward parallel price channel that defines the flag structure, and we must now assess upside projection levels that are typically associated with this type of activity. Bull Flag Pattern Example: NVDA (Income Generator via Trading View) Conventional charting analysis techniques will typically measure the price distance of the initial rally that defined the early structural formations. As an example, we will look at prior price action seen with Nvidia Corp. ( NVDA ), where a very similar chart pattern occurred earlier this year. I covered this event with a much more in-depth an analysis in my article “ Nvidia: Bull Flag Signals Another Major Breakout ” published on April 26th, 2024. In the chart image shown above, I outlined the initial price structure (which projected an ultimate upside price target of $138.41). Ultimately, this price projection was based on the April 26th highs (at $88.33) which were then added to the total price distance of the “flag pole” structure (which was $50.08): Bull Flag Pattern: Projected Price Targets (Income Generator via Trading View) Finally, we must visualize the ways these chart projections actually developed in real-time because the results were quite astonishing. For readers that are interested, I covered this outcome in a more in-depth way in my follow-up article “ Nvidia: Bull Flag Aftermath ”, which was published on October 1st, 2024: Bull Flag Pattern: Highly Accurate Trading Outcome (Income Generator via Trading View) Suffice it to say, Nvidia stock would go on to post a new all-time high of $140.76 on June 26th (trend wave movement is shown in the chart above). Of course, this means that the $138.41 price target that was projected by the chart pattern ultimately missed the actual highs by $2.35. Of course, achieving total accuracy in volatile assets like tech stocks or cryptocurrencies can be quite a difficult task. Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets in the entire financial market, so I would not expect the current chart formation to be accurate within a few dollars of the ultimate projection. However, I think that these types of chart patterns can be incredibly useful in terms of their ability to give us a better sense of the trend directions that are most probable at any given moment. In this case, the bottom of the flag pattern in BTC-USD can be found at $24,900 because this is the price low from September 11th, 2023. This specific trend wave formed highs of $73,835.57 before reversing to form the sideways-downward parallel price channel shown in the initial chart images. Interestingly, this gives us a “flag pole” price distance of $48,935.57 and if we add this figure to the recent pattern breakout point found at $68,426.11 (October 18th highs), we arrive at a bullish trend-wave target of $117,361.68. Of course, it must be understood that I do not expect these price projections to be accurate down to the penny. Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile assets that will quite often encounter slippage that will almost always prevent that type of accuracy from being possible. Overall, these price patterns are meant to use be used as a guide that allows us to identify potential price trends and possible reversal points within those trends. In the prior example seen with Nvidia earlier this year, the projected bullish price target wound up being accurate within a range of 1.66%. Bitcoin is obviously a much more volatile asset when compared to a mega-cap company that is counted within the coveted MAG-7 group, so I would not expect these projections to be quite as accurate. BTC-USD: Bearish Reversal Point (Income Generator via Trading View) In order for me to reverse my position and adopt a more bearish outlook for BTC-USD, I would need to see market prices fall below the October 15th, 2024 lows of $64,778.44. Of course, this area closely aligns with a near-term 38.2% Fibonacci retracement zone when analyzing the move from $58,863.90 (October 10th low) to the October 18th highs of $69,000.62 (which is located near $65,160). Overall, however, the cryptocurrency’s current price structure is looking quite bullish, in my view, and these types of price patterns have already shown incredible success rates earlier this year. Now, that we have seen the critical price break in the upward direction, I think that current momentum levels have the ability to send BTC-USD prices above the coveted $100,000 mark for the first time in market history. We shall see if similar accuracy and success rates will be seen with this newly developed trend movements in cryptocurrency markets.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-20 14:00:00

This can be seen in the strong performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the previous week. Similarly, the Bitcoin derivatives market appears to be witnessing increased risk-taking behavior from traders as shown by recent on-chain data. Bitcoin Market Now In ‘A Risk Zone’ — What’s Happening? Leverage is a tool that allows traders to control substantial positions with a relatively small amount of capital. While leverage helps traders and investors bolster their potential profits, it also opens them up to significant risks, especially when the market volatility is elevated. Related Reading: Solana Struggles To Break $160 Resistance As Top Analyst Predicts A Coming Surge In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Crazzyblockk revealed that there has been increased leverage use amongst Bitcoin market participants. This on-chain observation is based on the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) metric, which measures the ratio of open interest in futures contracts to the coin reserves on exchanges. Crazzyblockk noted that the reserves of some large-cap stablecoins are also considered in the calculation of the Estimated Leverage Ratio. “This is based on the concept that stablecoins have been increasingly used as collateral for derivative trading in recent years,” the analyst added. The Estimated Leverage Ratio serves as a valuable indicator in assessing the amount of leverage used by market participants for trading derivatives. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the ELR metric has witnessed a notable upswing over the past few months, which signals increasing open interest and dwindling exchange reserves, particularly Bitcoin. Furthermore, the Bitcoin derivatives market has now seemingly entered a risk zone due to the sharp increase in the leverage being used by market participants. According to the Quicktake post, this implies that the market is susceptible to spontaneous price movements in any direction. Hence, short-term traders might want to approach the market with caution. Has BTC Price Established A Local Top? As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $68,400, reflecting no significant change in the past day. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by over 8% in the past week. Related Reading: Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Social Dominance At 5-Month High — Can FOMO Stall Price Growth? In a separate Quicktake post, an analyst revealed that the price of Bitcoin might be readying for a brief correction after printing a local top. This analysis is based on the increasing non-realized profits of Bitcoin traders in recent weeks. According to CryptoQuant data, the unrealized profits of BTC traders have surpassed $7 billion, which suggests potential selling pressure in the near future. And the risk of a price pullback rises when investors sit on such significant unrealized gains, as there is an increased temptation of taking a profit.

As the entire crypto market gains strength, optimism is growing among investors, who are eagerly waiting for Ethereum to catch up with Bitcoin’s recent rally. The sentiment is positive, and traders are closely watching to see if ETH will make its move soon. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared a technical analysis highlighting an optimistic outlook for Ethereum in the coming days. He believes that a successful breakout above $2,640 could push ETH to much higher levels, aligning with the market’s overall bullish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales ‘Grew Substantially’ During Last Dip, Data Shows Large-Holder Accumulation As the market strengthens, the next week will be crucial, not just for Ethereum but for the entire crypto space, as investors prepare for what could be the start of a new rally. With key resistance being tested and momentum building, Ethereum’s next move will likely set the tone for its performance in the short to mid-term. Investors and analysts are keeping a close watch, as the outcome of this resistance battle could determine the direction of Ethereum’s price action in the near future. Ethereum Needs A Clean Breakout Ethereum looks ready for a significant rally, with price action suggesting a move to new highs. The market is buzzing with excitement as greed rises and bullish momentum takes hold, pushing ETH toward a potential breakout. After weeks of accumulation, Ethereum is now flirting with breaking out of a bullish pattern, setting the stage for a possible surge. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting that Ethereum needs a clean breakout from its current ascending triangle pattern. According to Runefelt, the upside target is $2,800, which marks the last major resistance level from the two-month accumulation phase ETH has experienced. A successful breakout from this key structure would signal the start of a potential rally, fueling optimism across the market. Runefelt also emphasized the importance of this lower timeframe price action, calling it crucial for Ethereum’s long-term development. Breaking above $2,800 could open the door to even higher levels, aligning ETH with the broader bullish sentiment seen across the crypto market. Related Reading: Solana Struggles To Break $160 Resistance As Top Analyst Predicts A Coming Surge With the bullish sentiment continuing to build, traders and investors are watching closely, anticipating whether ETH will finally catch up to Bitcoin’s recent rally and set a course for new highs. Key Levels To Watch Ethereum is trading at $2,640 after six days of choppy price action, just below the key $2,650 resistance level. A breakout above this level is essential for bulls to regain momentum, followed by a reclaim of the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,797. However, there remains a risk that ETH could fail to break through this resistance, leading to a search for liquidity in lower demand zones. If the price cannot clear $2,650, a deeper retrace might occur as the market seeks support. Despite this risk, as long as Ethereum holds above the $2,500 mark, the broader bullish outlook remains intact, giving hope to investors expecting an eventual rally.

The Dogecoin price has been on an unprecedented rally in October, taking many investors who have been on the sidelines by surprise. However, according to a take by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the meme coin might actually undergo some price correction in the short term before a continuation of the uptrend.

Analysts Predict 6-Figure Milestone His insights are grounded on the signal provided by the TD Sequential indicator, a technical tool known for identifying market exhaustion points. Dogecoin Might Be Overbought In a recent post on X, Martinez highlighted the TD Sequential setup on the Dogecoin/TetherUS daily candlestick chart. This analysis reveals that Dogecoin is currently experiencing its ninth consecutive bullish close on the daily candlestick, aligning with the ninth count by the TD Sequential indicator. While this sustained surge in the Dogecoin price has been impressive, it also indicates that the meme coin may be reaching a pivotal moment where a price retracement could occur. Adding to the caution, this sell signal coincides with a newly established overbought condition for Dogecoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has shown that the recent buying momentum has pushed Dogecoin deep into the overbought territory. At the time of writing, the RSI 14 close sits at an elevated 75.80, having recently peaked at 78.36, which is its highest level since March. This overbought condition suggests that the buying frenzy may be unsustainable, raising the likelihood of a pullback very soon. Is It Time To Sell DOGE? Martinez’s observations serves as a crucial reminder of Dogecoin’s volatility leading into the new week. At the time of his analysis, Dogecoin was trading at $0.14575. However, at the time of writing, Dogecoin has fallen to $0.1424, translating into a 2.3% decline in the few hours. Despite this, the meme coin is still on a 29% gain in the past seven days. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remain patient with the Dogecoin outlook, especially as the RSI is now pointing to an overbought condition. On the other hand, Dogecoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency in overbought condition, as the entire market is now in a greed condition, according to the Fear and Greed Index. If the 24-hour correction for DOGE were to extend for the rest of the weekend, it could cascade into a break below $0.14 in the short term and a return into $0.13 territory.

This suggests that any corrections may be temporary, and there is a high chance for the uptrend to resume as the new week unfolds. According to one crypto analyst, Dogecoin is on track for a price rally with a return of over 400%.
