On the spotlight today is the meme coin BONK. If the meme coin breaks $0.000041 in October, it will have already made history because it set a new milestone and secured a tough spot for itself in the market — and setting the stage for what an analyst says is the “start of the dog season.” Related Reading: ETF Hopes Propel Litecoin 12% Higher, Bullish Predictions On The Cards BONK: Recent Price Movements Signal A Shift Recently, the price activity of BONK suggests a trend reversal. After hitting bottom at $0.000001567, the coin recently started gaining traction upward and grabbed the attention not only of the retail but also of the institutional market. Of interesting note here, the last increase in price was 8.59%. Until the date of this rise, it hasn’t changed much from this percentage. $BONK – This setup is now ready, cat season is over it’s time for the dogs. pic.twitter.com/Hbr9owNcoz — Astekz (@astekz) October 16, 2024 Over the past week, BONK has surged almost 20% and traded from $0.000001917 to nearly $0.000002395. Technical Indicators suggest it forms a rising wedge and may follow through with the double bottom pattern formed on June 24 at the level of $0.000001984. An upward-pointing MACD with a bullish crossover further complements its upward momentum. Key Resistance Levels And Analyst Predictions BONK has met strong resistance at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, which stands at $0.000002265, ignoring the recent rally. If it cannot break through this level, the coin will proceed into a consolidation rather than upwards. The next resistance that BONK needs to break through is the 50% Fibonacci retracement standing at $0.0000025. According to estimations from the analysts, at this level, the price will advance to a high of either $0.0000035, $0.0000048, or $0.0000070. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Potential Setbacks And Market Volatility However, BONK does not have an easy ride ahead. On one hand, the coin recently faced a minor 1.07% intraday drop in price accompanied by signs of price rejection, this may speak to or lead to possible short-term volatility, which can further detriment the growth of the meme coin. Another retest of the broader falling channel pattern might thus lie ahead, which could precede yet another breakout attempt. With meme coins back on the map in the crypto sphere, everything about BONK in October will be followed closely as the market waits to see if the coin continues upward, hitting new heights, or runs into new low points in the weeks to come.

This relates to the short positions that could be liquidated if the flagship crypto hits that price target, a development that will be bullish for BTC. Almost $33.14 Billion Will Be Wiped Out If Bitcoin Price Hits $72,462 Ash Crypto mentioned the liquidation alert in an X post, revealing that $33.14 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price hits $72,462. These BTC bears are already in danger of getting liquidated, considering that the flagship crypto is fast approaching the $70,000 price level. This could pave the way for an extended rally to this liquidation price and even beyond. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Turn Bullish As ‘Something Big Is Coming’, Here’s What The liquidations of these Bitcoin shorts could be bullish for the flagship crypto, leading to an extended rally to new highs, especially with the current ATH of $73,00 being in sight once the price hits $72,462. However, there is also a scenario where the Bitcoin price could correct to flush out overleveraged longs before it continues with its move to the upside. For now, the Bitcoin price undoubtedly boasts a bullish outlook, considering how the flagship crypto has rallied since the start of this week. BTC briefly touched $69,000 on October 18, further providing optimism that the crypto could reach a new ATH soon enough. Standard Chartered recently predicted that it will likely happen before the November 5 US elections. Although that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s demand is again on the rise, which could fuel this rally to a new ATH. Specifically, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which fueled the run to a new ATH earlier in the year, are again actively accumulating. SpotOnChain data shows that these Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $2.13 billion this week. BlackRock, in particular, added $1.14 billion worth of BTC to its holdings. Bear Analyst Warns Crypto Traders Analyst Justin Bennett, known for bearish analysis, has warned traders to be cautious about trading amid this recent Bitcoin price rally. He stated that things do not add up and that staying cautious during periods like this is the best way to survive. He added that he won’t be making any bold predictions at the moment because the data is conflicting. Related Reading: Expert Calls On Ripple Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 However, he suggested that market participants shouldn’t be excited about Bitcoin’s breakout from the seven-month range.

Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, who has been a Bitcoin bear lately, also warned that the Bitcoin price rally is being driven by the perpetuals market. In a recent X post, he noted that open interest has officially surpassed the level it was at before the last BTC drop from $70,000 to $49,000.

The buzz of a Bitcoin price upsurge is making headlines as two crypto experts raised the possibility of it hitting the six-figure mark per coin, intensifying the discussion on the coin’s future. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Bitcoin: On The Road To $100,000 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted that Bitcoin price will likely breach the six-figure level, saying that it is inevitable for the coin to reach that milestone. Hougan said, in his X post, that the bullish sentiment on the digital asset put Bitcoin on a path towards trading above $100,000. He explained that several favorable factors fuel the coin’s amplified growth, exciting traders and enthusiasts on what lies ahead for the virtual currency. We’re heading to six-figure bitcoin. * ETF flows reaccelerating * Election approaching * Infinite deficits (bipartisan agreement!) * Economic stimulus in China * Global rate cuts (Fed, ECB) * Halving supply shock starting to bite * Whales accumulating — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 18, 2024 Keiser’s Projection Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser shared the same sentiment about the future of BTC price, but his prediction is more than twice the price estimate given by Houghan. Keiser, who is also an advisor to El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, made a bold statement that Bitcoin price would surge to $220,000, saying that the coin is on track to reach a new all-time record for its price. The new ATH Gold price is predicting Bitcoin will trade over $220,000 very soon. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 18, 2024 Key Factors For The Six-Figure Price Houghan explained that a surge in BTC price is more likely due to several factors driving its price appreciation such as institutional interest, on-chain factors, and macroeconomics. All of these, he said, greatly contribute to the crypto’s price moving upward. On the other hand, Keiser believed that the alpha coin’s price would skyrocket because of gold, saying it is another “safe haven asset.” Currently, gold reached a new record of $2,713.88 per ounce, the first time it has happened in the last four years. Keiser suggested a correlation between gold and the crypto, arguing that once gold price hits an all-time high, Bitcoin will follow and reach a similar milestone.

Hence, he is confident that Bitcoin can quickly reach the $220,000 level in the near future. Bitcoin And The US Election The looming US presidential election in November is seen as another catalyst in Bitcoin’s price appreciation. It has been observed that Bitcoin has been one of the key issues that US political candidates face in this year’s elections, wherein it has become necessary to stipulate their stance on cryptocurrencies. However, some believe that BTC prices will continue to have a strong performance regardless of who wins the presidential race.

This price action has fueled optimism among analysts and investors, who now anticipate significant gains in the coming weeks. Investors believe Bitcoin is ready for a strong rally after seven months of sideways accumulation. Critical data from Santiment reveals that the number of Bitcoin whales—large holders of BTC—grew substantially just as the price bottomed out around $59,000 on October 10th. Related Reading: Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs This increase in whale activity is often seen as a sign of “smart money” positioning for a major move. Large investors accumulating BTC during a low suggests that they are preparing for something big in the coming weeks. As excitement builds, market participants watch closely for further signals that Bitcoin could be headed for new all-time highs. With momentum on its side, Bitcoin appears ready to lead the market into the next phase of this cycle. Bitcoin Whale Activity Supports Bullish Outlook Bitcoin is trading near the historically reactive price level of $70,000. A critical zone that has consistently acted as resistance, pushing the price down five times over the past seven months. Each time Bitcoin approached this level, it triggered sell-offs or corrections, leading to caution among traders and investors. However, recent data from Santiment reveals that this resistance may be weakening due to increasing whale activity. Between October 10th and 13th, a net rise of +268 wallets holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC, signaling that large players are accumulating Bitcoin as the price rallies. Analysts often see an increase in whale wallets as a strong bullish indicator, suggesting that influential investors are positioning themselves for potential upside in the coming months. The timing of this accumulation is crucial, as it coincides with Bitcoin’s upward momentum, signaling that these big players expect further gains. As more large holders continue to enter the market, the window to buy Bitcoin at a favorable price narrows. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? This accumulation suggests that whales are betting on a sustained bull run, potentially weakening the $70,000 resistance level and allowing Bitcoin to push higher. With Bitcoin trading near this critical price zone, the next few weeks could be decisive, either breaking through $70,000 or facing another correction. BTC Testing Supply Levels Bitcoin is trading at $68,383 after several days of consistent highs, steadily pushing toward new supply levels. The price recently halted at $68,998 and now appears primed for a challenge to new all-time highs. This surge has created a wave of optimism, but analysts caution that a healthy retrace may be on the horizon. The 200-day moving average (MA), currently sitting at $63,322, is a key level to watch. If Bitcoin retraces to this support zone, it could signal strength for a renewed push higher, as this level has historically acted as a strong support during uptrends. Holding above the 200-day MA is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum. Related Reading: Strong Buy Signal For DogWifHat (WIF) – Key Indicator Hints At Rally To $4 If Bitcoin fails to break above the $70,000 resistance in the coming week, a retrace to lower demand is expected. This pullback would allow the market to regain liquidity and reset for a potential new rally. Investors are closely watching as the price action in the next few days will determine Bitcoin’s long-term outlook.

This sudden sell signal comes as the Dogecoin price jumped 10% following a recent comment by SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk. Dogecoin Price Flashes Sell Signal Dogecoin recently caught the interest of investors after its price dramatically surged by over 10%, surpassing the $0.127 mark in one day. The massive price increase was driven by social media hype and ongoing speculation about future endorsements from Musk, following his statements of a “Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E)” proposal. Related Reading: Expert Calls On Ripple Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 Despite the considerable surge in Dogecoin, analysts are cautioning that the price jump may be signaling an impending sell-off. Particularly, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn users that the meme coin was currently flashing a sell signal on the Dogecoin daily chart. While optimism for Dogecoin turned bullish after its price increase, it seems investors may have to get out of the market fast to preserve their new profits. While some loyal Dogecoin investors may hold on to their assets for the long term, short-term investors may be tempted to cash in on the recent gains. Based on the Dogecoin sell signal chart, Martinez predicts that the meme coin may experience a brief period of decline typically seen when meme coins experience sharp spikes. However, the analyst has also forecasted that after this short correction, Dogecoin may continue its upward momentum to reach new levels. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.1446, a significant increase from its price earlier this month which was standing at around $0.11 at some point. CoinMarketCap’s data has also revealed that Dogecoin soared by a whopping 30.49% over the past week and increased by 38.81% in the last month. It’s clear that the popular meme coin is on a major uptrend, as its chart has been in the green for some time now. Although Dogecoin did see some declines previously, investors’ optimism regarding the meme coin is high as its daily trading volume has increased by 12.29%. Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Going To $1 A crypto analyst identified as ‘Crow’ on X has confidently predicted a major bullish rally for Dogecoin. On October 18, the analyst predicted that the price of Dogecoin was going to $1 soon, possibly riding the wave of the upcoming crypto bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First The analyst shared a distinctive historical Dogecoin chart, covering the period from 2014 to the present, highlighting how the cryptocurrency had previously experienced strikingly similar market movements before hitting a price high. In line with this trend, Dogecoin seems to have created another unique triangle pattern that started in 2021 and has continued into 2024. It is possible that with the complete formation of this triangle pattern, Dogecoin may see a potential spike to $1. While the predictions remain ambitious speculations, Crow has remained confident, emphatically declaring that Dogecoin is the Bitcoin of meme coins.

After initially showcasing potential, the altcoin’s upward momentum has stalled, leading to a possible downturn. With key support levels at risk and bearish forces gaining traction, the outlook for LayerZero’s recovery appears increasingly uncertain. In this article, we will analyze LayerZero’s recent challenges, focusing on its stalled recovery amid intensified bearish pressure. It examines key technical indicators and market sentiment contributing to the downturn, providing insights into how these factors may impact ZRO’s price trajectory. Additionally, the article assesses critical support levels that could affect the token’s ability to navigate the current environment and explore the prospects for a potential rebound in the midst of ongoing market challenges. Current Market Landscape: Understanding The Bearish Pressure Recently, ZRO’s price has shown a bearish turn on the 4-hour chart, retracing below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) after struggling to break above this key technical level. This inability to maintain upward momentum suggests a shift in market sentiment, with selling pressure outweighing buying interest. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a decline in the signal line, which has fallen to 44% after previously rising to 47%, indicating a shift in strength toward the neutral zone. A level of 44% means that the asset is nearing oversold territory, raising concerns about possible further declines. Related Reading: LayerZero Bounces Amid Market Retrace, ZRO Soars 20% Also, the daily chart for LayerZero reveals negative momentum, highlighted by multiple bearish candlesticks and a drop below the 100-day SMA. The formation of several pessimistic candlesticks and the breach below the SMA suggest that negative sentiment is strengthening as sellers exert downward pressure. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI has declined below the crucial 50% threshold, currently sitting at 44%. A reading under 50% implies that sellers are gaining dominance, which may lead to the asset approaching oversold territory and heightening concerns about more price declines. What’s Next For LayerZero? Based on current market activities, the price of LayerZero appears poised for an additional drop toward the $3.5 support level. If it breaches this level, it could lead to an extended downward movement for the cryptocurrency, pushing it toward other significant support levels. Related Reading: LayerZero Surges over 7% As Bulls Ignite Fresh Rally, A $4.5 Breakout Looms? However, if ZRO’s price stabilizes and regains bullish momentum, it may climb toward the $4.5 resistance mark. Should it successfully breach this level, it could lay the foundation for further gains, potentially targeting even higher resistance levels as market sentiment shifts back in favor of the bulls.

Despite XRP price experiencing persistent stagnation, the analyst has projected a major price increase as high as 4,800% for the popular cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Analysts On Bitcoin: 2024 US Election Could Steer The Crypto’s Future Major Resistance And Support Targets For XRP On 17 October, Egrag Crypto shared three major targets for the XRP price based on Channel B, a distinctive boundary XRP has struggled to breach for years. In the monthly time frame, XRP faces three primary resistance targets and three support marks. XRP price action within Channel B is constrained by key resistance levels that may dictate whether the cryptocurrency can break free from its long-term consolidation cycle. According to the analyst’s XRP price chart, the first major resistance level is seen around the $0.6450 price mark. Over the past few months, XRP has risen above $0.6, fueling hopes of a potential breakout but ultimately declining back to $0.5. A significant breakout from the $0.6450 level could signal a potential bullish momentum, but it would still remain within the bounds of Channel B. The second price target, $0.85 is a key target that XRP price has also struggled to maintain over the years. It also represents a mid-range of the entire XRP Channel B. Lastly, at the top end of Channel B and highlighting the most crucial resistance level is the $1.1 threshold. A sustained break from this critical resistance could mean XRP may finally escape Channel B and rally to new levels. Additionally, assisting these key resistance levels are three major support levels. The first line of defense if XRP fails to hit $0.645 is the support level at $0.48. If the cryptocurrency also breaks down below $0.85, the next support can be seen at $0.38. Finally, if XRP fails to break through $1.1 resistance, it may find support around new lows at $0.28. XRP Bullish Price Targets While highlighting key resistance and support levels for XRP, Egrag Crypto also emphasized three bullish price targets for XRP if it can successfully close the monthly candle inside Channel B. The first major breakout target sees XRP potentially skyrocketing to $7.5, at the 1.236 Fibonacci retracement level. The next major cycle target is the 1.414 Fibonacci retracement level, with XRP price possibly surging to $13 and marking explosive all-time highs. The ultimate and final cycle target, according to Egrag Crypto, is the 1.618 Fibonacci retracement level. If XRP can reach this level, its price could skyrocket to $27, marking a monumental increase for the cryptocurrency and potentially positioning it among the top-performing digital assets in the market.

Based on Messari’s tracking for Q3 2024, TRX’s market capitalization increased by 24%, from nearly $11 billion to $13.5 billion. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which the token has increased its circulating market cap, pushing the company into the Top 10 biggest cryptos by market cap. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst TRX’s price surge also extended to TRX/BTC pairing, which also notched a 25% increase. The token sits below XRP and Dogecoin in the list of top cryptos by market cap. It is powered primarily by USDT transactions and is launching on SunPump, the first ‘meme fair and online platform’. TRON Gets A Boost From SunPump The TRON network saw a massive increase in transaction volume in the third quarter thanks to the launching of SunPump. According to reports, TRX transactions increased 29% this third quarter to $151 million. In August alone, over 270 million TRX valued at $42 million was burned on SunPump. It’s considered the largest single-day burn for TRON. As a deflationary token, TRX is burned every time it’s used in a transaction to prop up its value. TRON Supply Dips In Q3 TRON sets a fixed supply of 100 billion coins to protect its value and prevent inflation. TRX’s market supply dipped from 87.20 billion in the third quarter to 86.62 billion. The network’s burning schedule, which outpaces the minting of new tokens, supports this. In short, TRX’s annualized inflation rate hit -2.7% compared to -2.4% from the previous quarter. TRON strives to find a balance between burning and printing new tokens. The network aims to decrease the token’s circulating supply, which can benefit holders and investors. Also, the yield in staking TRX has increased 13% quarter-on-quarter, which attracts more users and investors.

Holders and users can expect sustained growth for the network, thanks to increasing revenue, partly driven by the launching of a new meme coin fair and platform. Also, the network’s token-burning policy currently outpaces minting, thus boosting the potential value of the token. Finally, stats from Dune suggest that over 90,000 meme coins have been launched through TRON’s network using SunPump. August 20th was the most active day, with over 7,500 coins released, highlighting the meme coins’ platform role in sustaining TRON.

Cloud mining is an advantageous business model for BitFuFu because it provides ongoing working capital for the company. Q2 unaudited financial results show a 69.7% YoY growth in total sales and 66.8% YoY growth in cloud mining sales. BitFuFu's revenue has grown at an impressive ~66% CAGR, and the Bitcoin miner is on track to maintain or surpass that growth rate for fiscal year 2024. I initiated coverage on BitFuFu (FUFU) in June. That article, titled: BitFuFu: The Lesser-Known Bitcoin Miner With Growth Potentials , was the first coverage of the stock here on Seeking Alpha. I went into detail about the company's business model and operations, and the Q1 financial results in that coverage. Seeking Alpha Following my initial coverage on June 6 at a stock price of $3.59, FUFU has seen a volatile price movement, mainly due to Bitcoin’s volatility in recent times. Shortly after that publication, FUFU surged by 86%, reaching $6.71 two weeks later on June 25. Following that initial price surge, FUFU witnessed a series of volatility, recording a high of around $5.80 in July and a low of $3.90 the same month. FUFU currently trades at $4.60. We’ll find out in this article if FUFU is currently undervalued relative to peers and if the current price would be a good buy for the stock. For readers not familiar with the company, BitFuFu is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining company headquartered in Singapore. The company has close ties with Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturing giant BITMAIN, an existing partnership with one of the biggest Bitcoin mining pools in the world ANTPOOL, and has a founder and CEO who is very experienced in the crypto mining business. The founder and CEO Leo Lu headed the cloud mining division at BITMAIN for several years, before going on to found BitFuFu in December 2020. Several other key members of BitFuFu’s team were former members at BITMAIN and Bitdeer ( BTDR ). Leo Lu’s experience in cloud mining from his time at BITMAIN reflects on BitFuFu operations today. Cloud mining has been an innovative business line for BitFuFu and is becoming the main growth driver for the company, now accounting for about 60% of the company's total revenue as of Q2 2024. FUFU started trading on Nasdaq in March this year, following a successful business combination with Arisz Acquisition in a $1.5 billion deal. A Look At BitFuFu Q2 Financial and Operational Highlights Q2 results highlights (BitFuFu) BitFuFu released their unaudited Q2 results on August 20. The financial result showed increase in sales, surge in cloud mining users, and impressive sales record from the cloud mining segment. For self-mined BTC production, the total BTC mined from the self-mining operations decreased 23.1% YoY, from 1,014 BTC in Q2 2023 to 780 BTC in Q2 2024. This decline in BTC produced during the quarter doesn't come as a surprise as virtually every Bitcoin miner has recorded a decline in BTC production since the Bitcoin halving event in April. Revenue and EBITDA trend (BitFuFu) Zooming out and examining BitFuFu’s revenue trend, BitFuFu's total revenue has grown at an impressive ~66% CAGR since 2021. In the latest financial result , BitFuFu recorded $129.4 million in total revenue for Q2 2024 - which is a 69.7% YoY increase and a noteworthy feat, considering the effects of the April 2024 halving event on the mining industry. BitFuFu’s full-year revenue in 2021 was $103 million. In 2022 revenue grew by 92%, bringing the full-year 2022 revenue to $198 million. In 2023 revenue grew by 43%, reaching $284.1 million for the full year . BitFuFu is already on track to surpass 2023 full-year $284.1 million revenue by a significant margin because the revenues recorded so far in Q1 2024 and Q2 2024 totals $273.8 million, which already nearly matches the 2023 full-year revenue. With such performance in the first half of 2024 alone, if we extrapolate the sales figure for the year we can make a valid assumption that BitFuFu is on track to maintain the same impressive 66% CAGR or even higher for the 2024 fiscal year. In our extrapolation, we still have to keep risk factors like market volatility and macro factors at the back of our minds. With these factors in mind, and assuming other factors remain constant, I believe that this assumption isn't far-fetched. Historically, BitFuFu has recorded slightly higher revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half, which is in line with this revenue extrapolation. Net asset trend (Author) On the liquidity front, BitFuFu has managed its balance sheet impressively. BitFuFu has achieved one of the best fleet efficiencies without a heavy balance sheet leverage, and has consecutively maintained a positive net asset since 2022, and still maintained a positive net asset in Q2 2024, despite the impact of the April 2024 halving on the mining industry. Total assets in Q2 2024 was $293.2 million. Total liabilities was $175.43 million, resulting in a net asset of $117.77 million. Cash, cash equivalents, and digital assets held by BitFuFu at the end of Q2 was $155 million, implying a healthy short-term and long-term liquidity position. BitFuFu’s cloud mining business model is an advantage for BitFuFu's ongoing liquidity. The cloud mining segment provides BitFuFu with active working capital as users subscribe to Bitcoin cloud mining services. As users pay upfront to subscribe to cloud mining services, it generates immediate cash inflow for BitFuFu, which can be used to fund ongoing operations. Mining fleet efficiency trend overtime (BitFuFu) Since Q2 2022, BitFuFu has scaled its hosting capacity by more than 500%, which was at 100 MW in Q1 2022 and at 522 MW as of the end of Q2. BitFuFu’s mining capacity has also grown from 3.0 EH/S in Q1 2022 to 24.7 EH/S as of the end of Q2. BitFuFu's mining capacity growth has been matched with improved fleet efficiency. BitFuFu's mining fleet has recorded reduced Joules per Terahash (J/Th) values over the quarters stands at ~21.1 J/Th. This is proof of BitFuFu's expertise in scaling resources to achieve better efficiency. At an average fleet efficiency of 21.1 J/Th, BitFuFu currently boasts one of the lowest joules per terahash value (best fleet) in the industry. The joules per terahash metric simply shows how much electricity a miner’s fleet consumes per terahash of hashrate. The less electricity consumed, the better it is for the miner’s operations. Hence, lower Joules per terahash means better efficiency. How BitFuFu Stacks Up to Peers In terms of production capacity and efficiency, BitFuFu stacks up high in the industry. As mentioned earlier, BitFuFu’s average fleet efficiency stands at around 21.1 J/Th, surpassing larger mining peers in terms of efficiency. MARA Holdings (former Marathon Digital) ( MARA ) currently averages 23.5 J/Th in efficiency, Bitdeer sees 31.6 J/Th in efficiency, and Hut 8 ( HUT ) has an average efficiency of 31.7 J/Th. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts From a relative valuation standpoint, BitFuFu currently trades at 1.82x P/S ratio and 1.72x EV/Sales. Peers like MARA trade at 7.98x P/S ratio and 9.55x EV/Sales. HUT trade at 3.49x P/S and 4x EV/Sales. A cloud mining peer BTDR trades at 2.31x P/S and 2.92x EV sales. FUFU is currently undervalued to the peer group based on its sales figure, and if we further go by the extrapolated value for full year 2024 potential sales of ~$547 million, forward P/S sales and EV/sales for BitFuFu would be 1.37x and 1.47x respectively. This would make FUFU one of the most undervalued stocks among Bitcoin miners. Risks As reiterated on Bitcoin stocks covered on Seeking Alpha, crypto assets and stocks linked to crypto exhibit a higher amount of price instability. Volatility in Bitcoin's price can also affect the financial standing of mining companies as well, as they typically hold large amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Takeaway Revisiting FUFU, a “buy” is recommended for this mining stock for investors interested in the Bitcoin mining sector because BitFuFu has maintained its track record of strong operational and financial performance. BitFuFu has plenty of room to scale its operations and grow its business, and its business model allows for such expansion with ease. The cloud mining user base growth, currently 395,000+ registered cloud mining users, bodes well for the company as it provides active working capital for the company when users purchase mining contracts, reducing the need to leverage its balance sheet. With the growing interest in gaining crypto exposure among retail and institutional investors, BitFuFu could turn out to be the star mining company of this Bitcoin market cycle, mainly because of cloud mining.",BTC-USD|FUFUW|BTDR|FUFU,EN,0,0,MINING|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-10-20 09:01:21

Despite the quiet performance in the past day, the premier cryptocurrency has managed to hold its own above $68,000. However, a prominent crypto pundit on social media platform X has said that the price of BTC might not be able to hang on to this level for too long. This has left several investors wondering if this potential correction is only a hiccup or a complete turnaround in the latest bull run resurgence. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price To Face Brief Correction — What Next? In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an interesting prognosis for the price of Bitcoin, saying that the premier cryptocurrency might be set for a brief correction in the short term. According to the pundit, the “Tom Demark” (TD) Sequential has flashed a sell signal for the BTC price on the daily chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Away With 9% Surge: Why This Could Trouble Bitcoin The TD Sequential is an indicator in technical analysis used to identify potential points of trend exhaustion and price reversal. This technical analysis tool comprises two major phases; namely the TD Setup phase and the TD Countdown phase. Specifically, the Setup phase is made up of nine candles of the same polarity (bearish and bullish). In a bullish Setup phase, the starting number “1” is plotted on a candle that closes higher than the close of the candle four periods ago. Meanwhile, a bearish “Setup” is characterized by the starting number “1” on a candle that closes lower than the close of the candle four periods ago. A potential point of reversal can be identified when the TD Sequential plots figure on the top or bottom of a candle in a bullish or bearish trend. As shown in the chart above, the number “9” has only just been printed on top of a candlestick on the Bitcoin daily chart, signaling the completion of the Setup phase. Considering that the Bitcoin price was originally in a bullish trend, it appears that the flagship cryptocurrency is set for a brief correction for a few days. In recent days, there have been heavy discussions around the price of BTC revisiting and perhaps surpassing its current all-time high. Nevertheless, Martinez advised investors to anticipate the Bitcoin price experiencing a brief pullback “before higher highs.” Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $68,272, reflecting a mere 0.5% dip in the past day. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency is up by nearly 9% in the last seven days.
