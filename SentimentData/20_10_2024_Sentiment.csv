On the spotlight today is the meme coin BONK. If the meme coin breaks $0.000041 in October, it will have already made history because it set a new milestone and secured a tough spot for itself in the market — and setting the stage for what an analyst says is the “start of the dog season.” Related Reading: ETF Hopes Propel Litecoin 12% Higher, Bullish Predictions On The Cards BONK: Recent Price Movements Signal A Shift Recently, the price activity of BONK suggests a trend reversal. After hitting bottom at $0.000001567, the coin recently started gaining traction upward and grabbed the attention not only of the retail but also of the institutional market. Of interesting note here, the last increase in price was 8.59%. Until the date of this rise, it hasn’t changed much from this percentage. $BONK – This setup is now ready, cat season is over it’s time for the dogs. pic.twitter.com/Hbr9owNcoz — Astekz (@astekz) October 16, 2024 Over the past week, BONK has surged almost 20% and traded from $0.000001917 to nearly $0.000002395. Technical Indicators suggest it forms a rising wedge and may follow through with the double bottom pattern formed on June 24 at the level of $0.000001984. An upward-pointing MACD with a bullish crossover further complements its upward momentum. Key Resistance Levels And Analyst Predictions BONK has met strong resistance at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement, which stands at $0.000002265, ignoring the recent rally. If it cannot break through this level, the coin will proceed into a consolidation rather than upwards. The next resistance that BONK needs to break through is the 50% Fibonacci retracement standing at $0.0000025. According to estimations from the analysts, at this level, the price will advance to a high of either $0.0000035, $0.0000048, or $0.0000070. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Potential Setbacks And Market Volatility However, BONK does not have an easy ride ahead. On one hand, the coin recently faced a minor 1.07% intraday drop in price accompanied by signs of price rejection, this may speak to or lead to possible short-term volatility, which can further detriment the growth of the meme coin. Another retest of the broader falling channel pattern might thus lie ahead, which could precede yet another breakout attempt. With meme coins back on the map in the crypto sphere, everything about BONK in October will be followed closely as the market waits to see if the coin continues upward, hitting new heights, or runs into new low points in the weeks to come.

This relates to the short positions that could be liquidated if the flagship crypto hits that price target, a development that will be bullish for BTC. Almost $33.14 Billion Will Be Wiped Out If Bitcoin Price Hits $72,462 Ash Crypto mentioned the liquidation alert in an X post, revealing that $33.14 billion worth of shorts will be liquidated if the Bitcoin price hits $72,462. These BTC bears are already in danger of getting liquidated, considering that the flagship crypto is fast approaching the $70,000 price level. This could pave the way for an extended rally to this liquidation price and even beyond. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Turn Bullish As ‘Something Big Is Coming’, Here’s What The liquidations of these Bitcoin shorts could be bullish for the flagship crypto, leading to an extended rally to new highs, especially with the current ATH of $73,00 being in sight once the price hits $72,462. However, there is also a scenario where the Bitcoin price could correct to flush out overleveraged longs before it continues with its move to the upside. For now, the Bitcoin price undoubtedly boasts a bullish outlook, considering how the flagship crypto has rallied since the start of this week. BTC briefly touched $69,000 on October 18, further providing optimism that the crypto could reach a new ATH soon enough. Standard Chartered recently predicted that it will likely happen before the November 5 US elections. Although that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that Bitcoin’s demand is again on the rise, which could fuel this rally to a new ATH. Specifically, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which fueled the run to a new ATH earlier in the year, are again actively accumulating. SpotOnChain data shows that these Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $2.13 billion this week. BlackRock, in particular, added $1.14 billion worth of BTC to its holdings. Bear Analyst Warns Crypto Traders Analyst Justin Bennett, known for bearish analysis, has warned traders to be cautious about trading amid this recent Bitcoin price rally. He stated that things do not add up and that staying cautious during periods like this is the best way to survive. He added that he won’t be making any bold predictions at the moment because the data is conflicting. Related Reading: Expert Calls On Ripple Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 However, he suggested that market participants shouldn’t be excited about Bitcoin’s breakout from the seven-month range.

Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, who has been a Bitcoin bear lately, also warned that the Bitcoin price rally is being driven by the perpetuals market. In a recent X post, he noted that open interest has officially surpassed the level it was at before the last BTC drop from $70,000 to $49,000.

The buzz of a Bitcoin price upsurge is making headlines as two crypto experts raised the possibility of it hitting the six-figure mark per coin, intensifying the discussion on the coin’s future. Related Reading: 100% Uptick For Shiba Inu? Experts Eye Global Reversal As Catalyst Bitcoin: On The Road To $100,000 Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicted that Bitcoin price will likely breach the six-figure level, saying that it is inevitable for the coin to reach that milestone. Hougan said, in his X post, that the bullish sentiment on the digital asset put Bitcoin on a path towards trading above $100,000. He explained that several favorable factors fuel the coin’s amplified growth, exciting traders and enthusiasts on what lies ahead for the virtual currency. We’re heading to six-figure bitcoin. * ETF flows reaccelerating * Election approaching * Infinite deficits (bipartisan agreement!) * Economic stimulus in China * Global rate cuts (Fed, ECB) * Halving supply shock starting to bite * Whales accumulating — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 18, 2024 Keiser’s Projection Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser shared the same sentiment about the future of BTC price, but his prediction is more than twice the price estimate given by Houghan. Keiser, who is also an advisor to El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, made a bold statement that Bitcoin price would surge to $220,000, saying that the coin is on track to reach a new all-time record for its price. The new ATH Gold price is predicting Bitcoin will trade over $220,000 very soon. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) October 18, 2024 Key Factors For The Six-Figure Price Houghan explained that a surge in BTC price is more likely due to several factors driving its price appreciation such as institutional interest, on-chain factors, and macroeconomics. All of these, he said, greatly contribute to the crypto’s price moving upward. On the other hand, Keiser believed that the alpha coin’s price would skyrocket because of gold, saying it is another “safe haven asset.” Currently, gold reached a new record of $2,713.88 per ounce, the first time it has happened in the last four years. Keiser suggested a correlation between gold and the crypto, arguing that once gold price hits an all-time high, Bitcoin will follow and reach a similar milestone.

Hence, he is confident that Bitcoin can quickly reach the $220,000 level in the near future. Bitcoin And The US Election The looming US presidential election in November is seen as another catalyst in Bitcoin’s price appreciation. It has been observed that Bitcoin has been one of the key issues that US political candidates face in this year’s elections, wherein it has become necessary to stipulate their stance on cryptocurrencies. However, some believe that BTC prices will continue to have a strong performance regardless of who wins the presidential race.

This price action has fueled optimism among analysts and investors, who now anticipate significant gains in the coming weeks. Investors believe Bitcoin is ready for a strong rally after seven months of sideways accumulation. Critical data from Santiment reveals that the number of Bitcoin whales—large holders of BTC—grew substantially just as the price bottomed out around $59,000 on October 10th. Related Reading: Solana Targets $160 Resistance As TVL Hits New Yearly Highs This increase in whale activity is often seen as a sign of “smart money” positioning for a major move. Large investors accumulating BTC during a low suggests that they are preparing for something big in the coming weeks. As excitement builds, market participants watch closely for further signals that Bitcoin could be headed for new all-time highs. With momentum on its side, Bitcoin appears ready to lead the market into the next phase of this cycle. Bitcoin Whale Activity Supports Bullish Outlook Bitcoin is trading near the historically reactive price level of $70,000. A critical zone that has consistently acted as resistance, pushing the price down five times over the past seven months. Each time Bitcoin approached this level, it triggered sell-offs or corrections, leading to caution among traders and investors. However, recent data from Santiment reveals that this resistance may be weakening due to increasing whale activity. Between October 10th and 13th, a net rise of +268 wallets holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC, signaling that large players are accumulating Bitcoin as the price rallies. Analysts often see an increase in whale wallets as a strong bullish indicator, suggesting that influential investors are positioning themselves for potential upside in the coming months. The timing of this accumulation is crucial, as it coincides with Bitcoin’s upward momentum, signaling that these big players expect further gains. As more large holders continue to enter the market, the window to buy Bitcoin at a favorable price narrows. Related Reading: Cardano Bullish Pattern Suggests A Breakout – Can ADA Reach $0.54? This accumulation suggests that whales are betting on a sustained bull run, potentially weakening the $70,000 resistance level and allowing Bitcoin to push higher. With Bitcoin trading near this critical price zone, the next few weeks could be decisive, either breaking through $70,000 or facing another correction. BTC Testing Supply Levels Bitcoin is trading at $68,383 after several days of consistent highs, steadily pushing toward new supply levels. The price recently halted at $68,998 and now appears primed for a challenge to new all-time highs. This surge has created a wave of optimism, but analysts caution that a healthy retrace may be on the horizon. The 200-day moving average (MA), currently sitting at $63,322, is a key level to watch. If Bitcoin retraces to this support zone, it could signal strength for a renewed push higher, as this level has historically acted as a strong support during uptrends. Holding above the 200-day MA is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum.

Investors are closely watching as the price action in the next few days will determine Bitcoin’s long-term outlook.

This sudden sell signal comes as the Dogecoin price jumped 10% following a recent comment by SpaceX and Tesla Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Elon Musk. Dogecoin Price Flashes Sell Signal Dogecoin recently caught the interest of investors after its price dramatically surged by over 10%, surpassing the $0.127 mark in one day. The massive price increase was driven by social media hype and ongoing speculation about future endorsements from Musk, following his statements of a “Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E)” proposal. Related Reading: Expert Calls On Ripple Community To Collectively Send XRP Price On 1,800x Rally To $1,000 Despite the considerable surge in Dogecoin, analysts are cautioning that the price jump may be signaling an impending sell-off. Particularly, Ali Martinez, a popular crypto analyst took to X (formerly Twitter) to warn users that the meme coin was currently flashing a sell signal on the Dogecoin daily chart. While optimism for Dogecoin turned bullish after its price increase, it seems investors may have to get out of the market fast to preserve their new profits. While some loyal Dogecoin investors may hold on to their assets for the long term, short-term investors may be tempted to cash in on the recent gains. Based on the Dogecoin sell signal chart, Martinez predicts that the meme coin may experience a brief period of decline typically seen when meme coins experience sharp spikes. However, the analyst has also forecasted that after this short correction, Dogecoin may continue its upward momentum to reach new levels. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.1446, a significant increase from its price earlier this month which was standing at around $0.11 at some point. CoinMarketCap’s data has also revealed that Dogecoin soared by a whopping 30.49% over the past week and increased by 38.81% in the last month. It’s clear that the popular meme coin is on a major uptrend, as its chart has been in the green for some time now. Although Dogecoin did see some declines previously, investors’ optimism regarding the meme coin is high as its daily trading volume has increased by 12.29%. Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Going To $1 A crypto analyst identified as ‘Crow’ on X has confidently predicted a major bullish rally for Dogecoin. On October 18, the analyst predicted that the price of Dogecoin was going to $1 soon, possibly riding the wave of the upcoming crypto bull run. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To $95,000? Here’s What Needs To Happen First The analyst shared a distinctive historical Dogecoin chart, covering the period from 2014 to the present, highlighting how the cryptocurrency had previously experienced strikingly similar market movements before hitting a price high. In line with this trend, Dogecoin seems to have created another unique triangle pattern that started in 2021 and has continued into 2024. It is possible that with the complete formation of this triangle pattern, Dogecoin may see a potential spike to $1. While the predictions remain ambitious speculations, Crow has remained confident, emphatically declaring that Dogecoin is the Bitcoin of meme coins.
