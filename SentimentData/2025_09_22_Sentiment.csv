At press time, Ethereum was trading at $4,480, posting modest gains of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, however, the asset has corrected by nearly 3%. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Notably, Etheruem is sitting above both its 50-day SMA of $4,298.89 and its 200-day SMA of $2,935.01. This alignment indicates a strong bullish trend, as the price remains comfortably above key support levels on both the short- and long-term moving averages. The 14-day RSI stands at 52.06, placing it in the neutral zone, indicating Ethereum is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for further upside without immediate risk of a technical correction. Regarding the price prediction, the Ethereum Rainbow Chart, a long-term logarithmic model that maps ETH’s price history with color-coded zones, projects valuation bands for October 1, 2025. The chart gives investors a broad sense of whether Ethereum is undervalued, fairly priced, or in bubble territory, with each band reflecting sentiment ranging from extreme undervaluation at the bottom to speculative excess at the top. ETH price prediction For October 1, 2025, the chart places “Maximum Bubble Territory” between $14,819.59 and $21,112.66, while the “But have we earned it?” band stretches from $10,370.14 to $14,819.59.

Moving lower, the “Steady…” band runs from $3,414.11 to $4,915.41, followed by the “Still cheap” zone at $2,402.36 to $3,414.11. Beneath that, the “Accumulate” band spans $1,712.5 to $2,402.36, the “Undervalued” range covers $1,241.5 to $1,712.5, and finally, the “Fire Sale” zone sits at the very bottom between $917.97 and $1,241.5. As of September 21, 2025, Ethereum is trading at $4,480, placing it within the “Steady…” band of $3,414.11 to $4,915.41. This positioning suggests that Ethereum is currently fairly valued relative to its long-term historical trend, leaving room to potentially climb into the “HODL!” range if bullish momentum extends into October.

The U.S. chip giant hit a $4.33 trillion market cap, overtaking India’s entire economy, which sits at $4.19 trillion, according to data from Yahoo Finance and IMF. That number comes just as India posted a stronger-than-expected 7.8% GDP growth for the quarter ending in June. Even with that, India’s nominal GDP, not adjusted for inflation, fell to 8.8%, down from 10.8% the previous quarter. Manufacturing rose 7.7%, services hit 9.3%, and construction added 7.6%. Doesn’t matter. Nvidia, a single company, is now more “valuable” on paper than all of that. It became the first company ever to cross $4 trillion in value, powered by the explosion in artificial intelligence. Over the last decade, Nvidia went from a gaming graphics chip maker to the core supplier of AI hardware. Nvidia vs. India Every major AI platform, from chatbots to enterprise tools, runs on its chips. That shift didn’t happen by accident. It came from years of product development and market control. But instead of letting it keep running, Donald Trump’s administration has started interfering. Trump steers Nvidia into Intel deal While Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s chief executive, was in the UK taking part in Trump’s state visit last week, the company quietly confirmed it’s putting $5 billion into Intel. That deal caught eyes , especially since the U.S. government bought 10% of Intel just a month ago. None of that feels coincidental. The pressure is obvious. Jensen didn’t just wake up and decide to support a company that’s lost its tech lead and bled market share for years. Intel’s stock did bounce 20% on the news, but before that, it had been on a long decline. Now, the top chip company on earth is being roped into helping a weaker competitor, backed by the government. That’s not actually business, it’s politics. And it’s not the only example. Over the summer, Nvidia also agreed to give up 15% of all revenues from advanced chip sales in China, straight to the U.S. government. That was the price for export licenses. In effect, Washington has become a silent partner in its China business. The White House claimed it was for national security. But they didn’t say how taking money from Nvidia protects anything. White House pressures Nvidia to move production That wasn’t the end. In April, Nvidia said it will start building chips inside the U.S. for the first time. Until now, almost all of it came from Taiwan. But new fabs are already being built in Texas and Arizona. Again, the move lines up perfectly with Washington’s goals, not necessarily Nvidia’s. This is no longer a company operating on its own terms. Everything from how Nvidia earns, where it builds, and who it partners with is now tied to the U.S. government. From the outside, it looks like Trump is calling the shots. Nvidia is now a partially state-directed company. None of the moves (whether it’s backing Intel, sharing Chinese revenue, or relocating fabs) makes sense commercially. Before all this, Nvidia’s only job was to lead the AI hardware race. And it did. Like how every PC once ran on “Intel Inside,” every modern AI system now runs on Nvidia. That dominance created trillions in value, huge paydays for staff, and years of U.S. tech leadership.

It is a good idea to employ strategies that are not obvious in order to safeguard yourself and maximize gains. In 2025, market experts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the number one pick for smart investors , with its presale already raising over $15 million. But while MAGACOIN FINANCE captures attention, new investors also need less-talked-about methods that can make a real difference in how they manage their portfolios. Track Token Unlock Schedules The Supply of unlocked tokens, is one of the underrated factors that tend to crash the price of tokens. Once a large quantity of locked tokens is released into the market, it will flood the market and push prices down. Beginners must continually look at the vesting schedule of a project so that they do not purchase immediately before a giant unlock. Tools like TokenUnlocks or project whitepapers usually reveal these timelines. Follow Exchange Reserve Data A rising amount of coins held on exchanges usually signals that investors are preparing to sell, while falling reserves suggest accumulation and scarcity. Beginners can track exchange reserves through on-chain data platforms like Glassnode or CryptoQuant. This gives a clearer picture of supply pressure than just watching price charts. Look for Whales, not Just Headlines Smart money often moves quietly before the news breaks. Following whale wallets, beginners will be in a position to identify the build-up patterns within projects even before the hype sets in. For example, the flow of whales into presale tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE was noted by analysts recently, which was an early indicator of confidence. On-chain activity indicates more than most of the chatter on social media. Pay Attention to Presale Participation Speed The speed with which a presale sells out often indicates actual demand. When rounds close within hours or days, it is a strong indication of community momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s record-breaking presale success is an ideal case of this – investors jumped in and created scarcity even before the token would reach major exchanges. Beginners who know how to recognize and respond to such signals usually reap the largest returns. Use Stablecoin Yields to Stay Active Rather than keep the money in waiting as they consider the correct entry, beginners can lock money in stablecoins and have passive income by staking or DeFi protocols. This way, your capital grows even when you’re not actively trading. Then, when the right opportunity comes along, you have more to deploy. Rather than leaving money idle as they wait to make the appropriate entry, beginners can park their funds in stablecoins and receive passive income through staking or DeFi protocols. By doing so, your capital will grow even when you are not actively trading. Then, once the right opportunity arises, you have more to deploy. Focus on Community-to-Developer Ratio It is not merely a matter of a project having a huge community, but the relative level of engagement of the developers.compared to that community size. A strong ratio means the project isn’t just hype; it has real builders pushing it forward. Beginners who spot projects where developer activity matches or exceeds hype often find longer-lasting winners. The Smart Money’s Presale MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being proclaimed the best presale of 2025 as it offers an audited ecosystem and exponential growth of the community. Additionally, having already raised more than 15 million, retail investors and whales are flocking to it because of its structure that is ready to 50x growth before the bull market reaches its end. The speed at which its presale rounds sell out reflects the kind of demand rarely seen outside legendary launches like ADA or SHIB in their early days. This is why experts are naming MAGACOIN FINANCE the standout opportunity for beginners and veterans alike. Don’t Ignore Liquidity Depth Beginners often chase tokens without realizing they can’t sell large amounts without moving the price. Checking a token’s liquidity pools and order book depth ensures good entry and exit positions smoothly, where even a strong project can trap you if liquidity is thin. Understand Market Correlation Not every token operates independently, several follow Bitcoin or Ethereum closely. The awareness of the correlation of the coin to larger assets will make you better manage expectations. For instance, when Bitcoin falls by 10%, other altcoins that are correlated to it could fall by 20%. Therefore, a more balanced portfolio is created by selecting a combination of correlated and uncorrelated assets. Secure Early Exchange Listings An additional useful tactic is positioning just before a token makes its first major exchange listing. Listing day is associated with high price spikes and huge numbers of buyers bidding. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a perfect case: investors are piling in presale now because they know exchange listings usually bring exponential gains. Conclusion Preserving and expanding the crypto portfolio is to think beyond the basics. Beginners who track the unlock schedules of tokens, monitor exchange reserves, follow whale wallets and use liquidity checks are already doing better than most of the retail investors. Their advantage is further increased by adding stablecoin yield and concentrating on the projects where the developers are actually engaged. Currently, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the strongest presale of 2025 with its audited ecosystem, $15 million raised and its projections of 50x returns making it the undisputed first choice for early investors.

Armstrong, speaking on Fox Business’ ""The Claman Countdown,"" told Liz Claman that momentum in Congress is the strongest he has seen, with lawmakers from both parties advancing frameworks for the industry. A move that boosts Coinbase's momentum towards building the super app. He explained how his company wants to approach the buildout during the interview. Coinbase intends to integrate services people typically get from banks and fintechs and deliver them on crypto rails. He pointed to a recently launched Coinbase credit card that pays 4% back in bitcoin as an early example and argued card networks’ 2%–3% swipe fees show why payments need an overhaul. The longer-term target, he said, is a comprehensive application that handles spending, savings, payments and investing, not just trading. Armstrong spelled out the ambition explicitly: “We want to be a bank replacement for people, we want to be their primary financial account,” adding that Coinbase aims to “provide all types of financial services,” not only crypto. He agreed with the framing that this amounts to becoming a super app and said crypto rails make that feasible by offering faster, cheaper settlement. Washington and big banks According to Armstrong, the path to the super app starts with lawmakers. He pointed to the recent passage of the “Genius Act,” which established rules for stablecoins, and a separate market-structure bill now under debate in the Senate that would define how tokens like bitcoin and ether are regulated. “This freight train has left the station,” Armstrong said, describing growing bipartisan interest in putting clear rules on the books. He argued that clarity could resolve years of conflict with regulators under the previous administration, who often treated crypto tokens as unregistered securities. However, despite lawmakers' historical push to help set a regulatory framework, one last hurdle needs to be cleared: The lobbying by big banks. Some institutions, he explained, have sought to restrict rewards programs on stablecoins, claiming they would undermine the traditional payments business. Armstrong dismissed those concerns, saying crypto rewards are no different from airline miles or credit card points. “American consumers want to earn more money on their money — that should be totally allowed,” he said. While he criticized lobbying efforts to block competition, Armstrong also stressed that Coinbase partners with major banks such as JPMorgan and PNC to provide custody and payments services, showing parts of the sector are embracing crypto rails. Staying ahead of rivals While building a super app is a monumental task that has gained momentum, Coinbase still needs to look out for rivals who might be fighting for market share. However, Armstrong isn't worried; rather, he welcomes the competition. With new exchanges entering the U.S. market, including platforms launched by Gemini and others, Armstrong said Coinbase benefits from its head start. He argued that a thriving ecosystem is essential for mainstream adoption, and Coinbase’s advantage comes from trust. According to Armstrong, Coinbase now stores more crypto than any other provider, which encourages customers to use its broader suite of services from trading to payments. He said the ambition is not just to facilitate transactions but to eventually become the platform people use as their “primary financial account.” Armstrong’s “primary account” vision echoes remarks from Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, who asked at the All-In Summit 2025, “Can we be your comprehensive financial platform?” and outlined banking and wealth features as steps toward that goal, according to a report by Business Insider published on Sept. 15. The comparison suggests multiple U.S. fintechs are angling to expand beyond trading into everyday finance. Bitcoin outlook The interview also touched on the broader market. Armstrong avoided short-term predictions but said he sees “a good chance” that bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. He cited three major tailwinds: regulatory clarity, the creation of a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve, and heavy inflows into the newly launched bitcoin ETFs, 80% of which rely on Coinbase for custody. He likened bitcoin’s role in portfolios to a hybrid of gold and equities, noting that many investors now view it as both a hedge against uncertainty and a long-term growth asset.",Markets|Coinbase|Robinhood|Bitcoin|Stablecoins|crypto regulation|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-21 21:00:00

Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum products were converted to Spot Bitcoin ETFs, and now the company is now taking the same playbook to the next biggest assets. According to a recent filing with the US SEC, Grayscale is now looking to convert its existing Grayscale Dogecoin Trust (GDOG) into a Spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale has managed this DOGE Trust since 2021 and the latest filing, if approved, will convert it to the public ETF format. The conversion of the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust into a Spot ETF would make DOGE exposure available to a broader range of investors, including those who may not be comfortable holding crypto directly. According to the S-1 filing, the proposed Dogecoin ETF would be listed on NYSE Arca under the ticker ‘GDOG.’ The ETF will track the price of DOGE based on the CoinDesk DOGE Reference Rate, which sources pricing from leading exchanges including Kraken, Gemini, Coinbase, and Bitstamp. Grayscale has also chosen Coinbase to serve as the official custodian of the DOGE held by the ETF. The filing also specifies that ETF shares will be created and redeemed in blocks of 10,000 shares, known as “Baskets.” Market Impact And What Comes Next Grayscale’s move into a Spot Dogecoin ETF comes during a period when investors are on the outlook for the next crypto ETF that will hit the market. Grayscale already has pending applications to convert its Cardano and XRP Trusts into Spot ETFs, but those are yet to be approved. As it stands, there is no specific deadline for the SEC to give its approval. The nature of the S-1 filing means the agency will review the filing, issue comment letters, and wait for the issuer to respond with amendments until it is satisfied. Billions of dollars have already flowed into Bitcoin and Ethereum through their Spot ETFs. If Grayscale’s filing is approved, Dogecoin could be the next benefactor of these institutional inflows. Institutional investors, who have largely stayed away from meme coins, would have a regulatory-compliant channel to gain exposure to Dogecoin. At the time of writing, Dogecoin was trading at $0.265.

Economists and policy officials describe the pattern as a “no hire, no fire” phase, where companies mainly hold on to current staff, add few positions, and seldom cut jobs, rather than a sudden shock from artificial intelligence. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave that view public weight at his regular press conference after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. He called it an “interesting labor market,” noting that “kids coming out of college and younger people, minorities, are having a hard time finding jobs.” He pointed to a low job-finding rate paired with a low redundancy rate, “you’ve got a low firing, low hiring environment”, which makes it tougher than usual for first-time jobseekers to get in the door. Deutsche Bank has dubbed recent months “the summer AI turned ugly,” and some studies link AI uptake to pressure on entry-level hiring. Powell, however, said AI “may be part of the story,” while arguing the main drivers are a cooler economy and tighter hiring plans. Economists at Goldman Sachs and UBS soon echoed that reading, concluding that this is not primarily an AI event , at least not yet. On Friday, UBS chief economist Paul Donovan released an analysis titled “The Kids Are Alright?” As reported by Fortune, he argued that the U.S. spike in youth unemployment runs counter to trends abroad and cannot be laid solely at the feet of automation. Decline in job reallocation slows opportunities Goldman Sachs economist Pierfrancesco Mei wrote on Thursday that “finding a job takes longer in a low-turnover labor market.” He examined “job reallocation”, the creation and destruction of roles, and showed it has fallen since the late 1990s, though more gradually in recent years. Today, most movement is “churn,” or switching among existing jobs. Goldman reported that in 2025 churn sits well below its pre-pandemic pace across industries and states, and the drag “mostly fall[s] on younger workers.” In 2019, a young unemployed person in a low-churn state typically landed work in about 10 weeks; now it takes about 12 weeks on average. Donovan writes that “it might be tempting to blame technology,” since stories of machines replacing people are common. He concludes, in line with Goldman, that the U.S. pattern “more convincingly fits a broader hiring freeze narrative, affecting new entrants to the workforce.” Trade careers offer a safer path Donovan also argues this helps explain why less-educated young workers seem less exposed. Many high school dropouts secure full-time roles earlier, and a number likely did so before the 2025 slowdown set in. With college enrollment trending lower over time, more young people are opting for skilled trades. Some build blue-collar businesses earning six-figure incomes, while classmates take on student-loan debt. Past experience shows the risks for new graduates during “no fire, no hire” periods. In the Great Recession, when hiring stalled across entire sectors, those finishing college between 2007 and 2011 faced too few entry-level openings. A Stanford briefing found they earned less than cohorts graduating in normal times, and the gap lingered for 10–15 years. That history raises the stakes for Gen Z and for minority job seekers now. Economists warn about “scarring effects”, lasting hits to pay, the ability to buy a home, and wealth building. Starting out in a slump often means lower wages and a tougher climb. Powell, speaking Wednesday, also pointed to other forces weighing on labor supply, including stricter immigration policies, and said minorities are having a harder time finding work in the 2025 freeze.

The coin’s daily support is present around $4.58 to $4.63. Short-term buy entries remain near $4.66 to $4.70. ICP 1-day price analysis As seen on the daily price chart for September 21, ICP is trading at $4.71, down slightly after consecutive attempts to hold above $4.80. The Bollinger mid-band resistance sits at $4.83, which has capped upside momentum for the last two candles. The RSI at 45.98 is neutral but leaning bearish, while MACD remains flat with no strong momentum shift. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView ICP’s support level is present at $4.63 – $4.58. If the coin closes below that area, we could see further downside toward $4.40. However, if the bulls reclaim $4.83, ICP might push to the upside around $4.99 and $5.16. ICP 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, ICP shows clearer short-term weakness. Price is holding just under $4.74, while the Alligator lines remain in bearish alignment, suggesting the trend is not yet ready to reverse. The Money Flow Index is at 38.13, indicating outflows and that the market isn’t yet oversold. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Short-term support lies at $4.70, but today’s wick to $4.66 highlights that liquidity is probing lower. To flip short-term sentiment bullish, ICP must break $4.77 – $4.80 resistance zone. Otherwise, the pressure could extend toward $4.60.

Canada’s Largest Crypto Crackdown Leaves Users Furious",https://cryptopotato.com/40m-seized-trust-destroyed-canadas-largest-crypto-crackdown-leaves-users-furious/,"The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Federal Policing – Eastern Region has announced the largest cryptocurrency seizure in Canadian history, after seizing more than 56 million Canadian dollars (approximately $40 million) from the platform TradeOgre. The operation was carried out by investigators specializing in financial crime, cybercrime, and cryptocurrencies. It is also the first time Canadian law enforcement has dismantled a cryptocurrency exchange. Historic Crypto Bust In the latest press release, the RCMP said that the case was initiated in June 2024 after a Europol tip led the Money Laundering Investigative Team (MLIT) to probe the platform’s activities. Authorities discovered that TradeOgre violated Canadian financial laws, particularly for failing to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a money services business and for neglecting to verify its clients’ identities. Investigators believe the majority of funds passing through the platform were tied to criminal activity, and noted that privacy-driven exchanges are often used by organized crime groups to launder illicit money. Transaction data collected from the exchange will undergo further analysis, and officials have indicated that charges could follow as the investigation remains ongoing. “Straight Up Theft”? The seizure sparked heated reactions within the community, as many users expressed anger and concern about the fate of legitimate funds. Reuben Yap, co-founder of Firo (formerly ZCoin), questioned whether Canadian authorities intend to confiscate balances that originated from lawful sources. He argued that penalizing all account holders simply because the exchange did not enforce know-your-customer (KYC) procedures would amount to theft from innocent users. Yap further compared the situation to the notorious BTC-e case, where claimants faced a burdensome process requiring extensive evidence to recover funds, and warned that TradeOgre users may fare even worse since reports needed to support claims are no longer accessible. Other community voices echoed this outrage. For instance, prominent influencer CaptainCrypto called the move “fucking crazy” and stressed that users who engaged in no wrongdoing are now at risk of losing their assets. He argued that such blanket seizures undermine trust in the financial system and framed it as “straight up theft,” urging the broader crypto community to unite against what he views as an overreach of law enforcement authority. Meanwhile, MetaMask security lead Taylor Monahan tweeted , “Sorry to contradict your “beliefs” but last time I checked my friends and I are not criminals. Very much looking forward to seeing the evidence, and for you to provide recourse to ALL innocent parties you stole money from without notification and without due process.” The post $40M Seized, Trust Destroyed?

With token burns and community power on the table, SHIB has the potential to make the headlines of the 2025 bull run. But whereas SHIB relies disproportionately on hype cycles, a different project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is quietly garnering investors’ attention with a utility-based model. Still available in presale for just $0.035, MUTM’s lending-and-borrowing protocol makes it a DeFi player with much more long-term potential than meme-based tokens. For some, the real question isn’t whether SHIB pumps, but whether MUTM is the wiser wager for huge returns in 2025. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001316 as of today, with recent price action having it hit resistance at $0.00001400 levels, and strong support coming in at $0.00001290-$0.00001310. Social media sentiment and token burns in the recent few days have stoked whispers that SHIB is about to make a major move, perhaps replaying past swings in its history. Yet, the high volatility that comes with meme-based tokens means the gains can arrive suddenly and withdraw just as rapidly if volume dries up or if sentiment in wider markets turns risk-negative. In contrast to SHIB’s speculative dynamics, investors regard new Mutuum Finance, as having better prospects for lasting growth in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Rise Mutuum Finance is now at stage six of its presale standing at $0.035 following its 16.17% increase from the previous stage. The market is witnessing record-breaking demand for the project where more than 16,450 investors have subscribed and crossed $16.05 million raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for the platform’s security. The bugs have been categorized on four levels namely, critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance maintains strong safety measures on any asset that is collateralized in such a way that the safety of the protocol and user are not in jeopardy. They maintain target collateral ratios, lending limits and deposit limits. Off close undercollateralized positions are incentivized as a means of ensuring systemic stability to get liquidated in a timely manner with call penalties and charge liquidation guarantee remediation. Collateral efficiency is maximized in the collateralized securities, i.e., lending efficiency is maximized in Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios of highly collateralized finance. Reserve problems are introduced as a buffer against unnormal market situations, and over-spilling reserves can be levied on highly volatile assets to counteract the volatility. Reshaping Lending Mutuum Finance’s long-term goal is to shake up the DeFi model as it currently exists. In pursuit of this goal, the project is promoting early adoption by hosting a $100,000 giveaway that will give 10 people a $10,000 MUTM reward. Mutuum Finance is a two-way DeFi lending platform, and its benefit is to borrowers and lenders. It is an institutional investor and retail investor open protocol, as well as manipulative-resistant. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the smarter long-term investment compared to Shiba Inu (SHIB). While SHIB may witness temporary rallies driven by hype and burns, its speculative nature makes long-term growth uncertain. The presale of MUTM, however, is at $0.035 in Stage 6 and will increase in the next stage, with over $16.05M raised and 16,410+ investors already on board. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, a $100K community airdrop, and a strong collateral protection, Mutuum Finance offers a proven, utility-driven DeFi model with real adoption potential. Lock in your tokens now at presale prices before the next stage increase.

That number sounds huge, and it is, but it barely touches the mess. In August alone, the U.S. posted a $345 billion deficit, the biggest monthly shortfall so far this year. That same month, it also collected $31 billion in tariffs, a new all-time monthly record. But do the math. Tariffs covered less than 10% of the damage. This has been the trend for months. Every single one has brought in $300 billion-plus in new deficit spending. And we’re not slowing down. If this pace keeps up, the 2026 deficit could shoot past $2.7 trillion. The government is clearly earning more on trade, but it’s still spending way more than it’s taking in. Tariffs are at record levels, but they’re not even close to filling the gap. Tariffs surge to 90-year highs but can’t fix the numbers The annual tariff revenue, now sitting at $350 billion, has gone up 355% since last year. That puts it at 18% of household income taxes, a level not seen in over eight decades. Before 2025, this share averaged just 4%. It never crossed 10%, not even during Donald Trump’s first trade war in office. And now? This is the highest effective tariff rate the country has seen since 1935, sitting at 17.3%. Even though people keep hearing about “trade deals,” the tariffs haven’t gone anywhere. The U.S.-China tariffs have been paused since May 12, but the White House is pushing for a 90-day extension of the agreement. These changes haven’t stopped the money from pouring in. Still, they haven’t done a thing to slow the deficit. Despite all this, markets seem unfazed. The S&P 500 has climbed $16 trillion in value since April and has posted nearly 30 all-time highs in 2025 alone. Carson Group says it’s now seen its sixth 5-month stretch of 30%+ gains since 1975. Every time this happened in the past, the next year averaged a return of 18.1%. But it wasn’t always green candles. Earlier this year, the index dropped 10.2% in the first 73 trading days, when investors were pricing in tariff shocks. That pricing is now gone. Investors have moved on. While all this tariff cash comes in and inflation remains above 3%, Jerome Powell’s team is pushing ahead. The long end of the Treasury yield curve hasn’t dropped because bond markets don’t believe this can last. Everyone watching knows the deficit is not getting better. Donald Trump is doubling down on trade diplomacy, but it’s not changing the fact that government spending is running wild. If there was any hope that tariffs would help balance things out, August killed that. The U.S. made history collecting $31 billion in tariffs in one month, and still had a $345 billion gap to fill. That’s eleven times more red ink than tariff gold. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The rally has put the Binance-linked token in price discovery, fueling speculation about whether it can extend its upward trajectory in the weeks ahead. Short-Term Risks From Overbought Levels The latest rally pushed BNB’s relative strength index (RSI) into overbought territory on the four-hour chart. This typically signals the risk of a cooling-off period or correction. The token has already slipped nearly 3% from its intraday peak of $1,083.50. Technical indicators point toward a potential retest of the 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) on the four-hour chart, which currently sits near $1,012. That level also aligns with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement zone, strengthening the case for a short-term pullback. If selling pressure intensifies, the correction could extend deeper, with support at the 50-period EMA around $974. Analyst Sees Strong Support at $970 Despite the overbought risks, analysts remain optimistic about BNB’s broader trend. Market commentator Gael Gallot pointed out that BNB’s ability to stay above $970 is a sign of resilience, citing surging trading volumes and long positions dominating the derivatives market. “BNB broke the 1000 mark and set a new high at 1074 before settling near support at 987 to 990,” Gallot noted. “Trading volume hit 3.28 billion during the move, and momentum remains strong with a long short ratio of 17.71, showing bullish positioning.” This $970 zone also coincides with the lower boundary of BNB’s ascending channel pattern, which has guided price action since June. Historically, each retest of this trendline has triggered rebounds ranging between 20% and 35%. October Target Above $1,150 If this pattern repeats, BNB could be on track to surpass $1,150 in October. That would represent a 10% gain from current levels, even if the token first consolidates closer to the $970 support. The channel’s historical reliability adds weight to this projection. At the same time, the breakout has revived comparisons to earlier BNB rallies. In 2020–2021, the token skyrocketed more than 2,600% after breaking through an ascending triangle pattern. Year-End Prospects Point to $1,250 and Beyond On longer-term charts, BNB is forming what analysts describe as a bullish cup-and-handle structure. The recent move above the 1.618 Fibonacci extension near $1,037 has flipped that level into support. Upside targets now include $1,250, projected from the cup-and-handle breakout, and potentially $1,565, based on the 2.618 Fibonacci extension. If momentum holds, BNB could see its strongest phase of the cycle in the final months of the year. On-Chain Indicators Support Optimism BNB’s on-chain data appears to support the bullish technical outlook. The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric has returned to the optimism-anxiety zone. This level was last observed during the 2020–2021 bull market, when BNB rallied from under $50 to more than $600. The metric suggests that most holders are in profit and lean optimistic, conditions often associated with mid-cycle strength. While short-term corrections are still possible, both technical and on-chain signals indicate that BNB could be gearing up for its most decisive rally since the last major bull run.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-09-21 22:29:19

Chinese fintech firm AnchorX has launched AxCNH, a groundbreaking yuan stablecoin poised to transform the landscape of cross-border trade. This pivotal move, as reported by Cointelegraph, signals a major leap forward in digital finance, offering a fresh perspective on international transactions. What Makes This Yuan Stablecoin a Game-Changer? AnchorX’s AxCNH is not just any digital currency; it is a yuan-pegged stablecoin, meaning its value is directly tied to the Chinese yuan. This peg provides essential stability, a crucial factor for businesses engaged in international commerce. Notably, AxCNH is also ‘over-collateralized.’ This means it is backed by more assets than its total value, offering an extra layer of security and trust to users. Unveiled at the prestigious Belt and Road Summit in Hong Kong on September 17, its introduction underscores its strategic importance for facilitating global commerce and fostering economic connectivity. Boosting Efficiency with AxCNH for Cross-Border Payments The primary objective of AxCNH is to streamline international transactions, particularly for cross-border payments and trade among nations participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. Traditional cross-border payments often involve lengthy settlement times, high fees, and complex reconciliation processes. This new yuan stablecoin aims to mitigate these challenges significantly. Consider the tangible benefits it brings: Faster Settlements: Transactions can be processed in minutes, not days. Reduced Costs: Lower fees compared to conventional banking channels. Increased Transparency: Blockchain technology provides a clear, immutable record of all transactions. Greater Accessibility: Potentially opens up trade opportunities for businesses in regions with limited access to traditional financial services. By leveraging AxCNH, businesses can anticipate a more efficient and cost-effective way to conduct trade, fostering stronger economic ties across borders. The Mechanics Behind This Revolutionary Yuan Stablecoin At its core, AxCNH operates on blockchain technology, which provides the secure and immutable ledger necessary for stablecoin functionality. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility, usually by pegging its value to a reserve asset like a fiat currency. In this case, the reserve is the Chinese yuan. The ‘over-collateralized’ nature means that AnchorX holds more than 100% of the value of issued AxCNH in reserve assets.

The number of suspected illegal transactions involving digital currencies in South Korea has seen an unprecedented surge this year, signaling a critical moment for the nation’s financial integrity. This dramatic rise in suspicious activity, including potential money laundering and unlicensed remittances, highlights growing concerns within the burgeoning crypto sector. What’s Behind the Surge in South Korean Crypto Reports? The latest figures from South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) paint a stark picture. Between January and August alone, virtual asset service providers (VASPs) filed an astounding 36,684 Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs). To put this into perspective, this eight-month total has already surpassed the combined 35,734 reports filed over the entire previous two years. This data, revealed by Democratic Party lawmaker Jin Sung-joon, underscores a significant shift in the detection and reporting of illicit crypto activities. Unprecedented Volume: More STRs filed in eight months than in the preceding 24 months. Growing Scrutiny: Increased awareness and reporting by VASPs. Potential Risks: Indicates a heightened risk of financial crimes within the crypto ecosystem. This surge in South Korean crypto reports suggests a dual reality: an increase in actual illicit activity, coupled with more robust reporting mechanisms. Regulators and financial institutions are becoming more vigilant, leading to better identification of questionable transactions. Understanding Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) and Their Impact What exactly constitutes a Suspicious Transaction Report? STRs are crucial tools in combating financial crime. They are filed by financial institutions, including crypto service providers, when they detect transactions that appear unusual or potentially linked to illegal activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, or fraud. The significant rise in these South Korean crypto reports has several implications: Regulatory Pressure: Authorities are intensifying their efforts to monitor and regulate the virtual asset space. Enhanced Compliance: VASPs are likely improving their internal compliance systems to identify and report suspicious patterns. Investor Confidence: While alarming, these reports can ultimately lead to a more secure and trustworthy crypto environment, fostering long-term investor confidence. The data points to a maturing regulatory landscape where transparency is becoming paramount. It’s a challenging but necessary step towards integrating crypto assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: Challenges and Insights The sheer volume of South Korean crypto reports presents both challenges and opportunities. For regulators, the challenge lies in effectively investigating and prosecuting the sheer number of reported cases. For VASPs, it means continuously upgrading their compliance frameworks to meet evolving standards without stifling innovation. Key insights from this trend include: Technological Advancements: The need for advanced AI and machine learning tools to detect complex money laundering schemes. International Cooperation: Illicit crypto transactions often cross borders, necessitating greater collaboration between international financial intelligence units. Public Awareness: Educating users about the risks of illicit crypto activities and promoting responsible usage. These reports are not just numbers; they represent ongoing efforts to clean up the crypto space. They highlight the persistent battle against those who exploit the anonymity and speed of digital assets for nefarious purposes. The vigilance shown in these South Korean crypto reports is a testament to the nation’s commitment to financial integrity. The Road Ahead for South Korean Crypto Reports The trend of increasing South Korean crypto reports is likely to continue as the virtual asset market expands and regulatory frameworks become more sophisticated. This proactive approach by South Korean authorities and VASPs is crucial for establishing a safer and more legitimate digital economy. While the numbers may seem daunting, they ultimately contribute to a healthier ecosystem where legitimate innovation can thrive, and illicit activities are systematically rooted out. This commitment to transparency and stringent oversight will undoubtedly shape the future of cryptocurrency adoption and regulation, not just in South Korea, but potentially serving as a model for other nations grappling with similar challenges. Frequently Asked Questions About South Korean Crypto Reports Q1: What are Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) in the context of crypto? A1: STRs are reports filed by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to financial intelligence units when they identify transactions that appear unusual or potentially linked to illegal activities like money laundering, terrorist financing, or fraud. Q2: Why have South Korean crypto reports surged so dramatically? A2: The surge is attributed to a combination of factors, including a potential increase in actual illicit crypto activities and enhanced vigilance and improved compliance reporting mechanisms by VASPs and financial authorities in South Korea. Q3: What are the implications of these increased reports for crypto users in South Korea? A3: While indicating heightened risks, these reports also signal a push towards a more regulated and secure crypto environment. This could lead to increased investor confidence in the long run, but also means stricter scrutiny of transactions. Q4: How does South Korea combat crypto-related money laundering? A4: South Korea combats crypto money laundering through robust regulatory frameworks, mandating STRs from VASPs, increasing financial intelligence unit oversight, and promoting international cooperation to track cross-border illicit transactions. Q5: Will this trend impact the future of cryptocurrency adoption in South Korea? A5: This trend is likely to foster a more mature and legitimate crypto market in South Korea. While it may introduce stricter compliance, it aims to create a safer ecosystem, potentially encouraging broader and more responsible adoption in the long term.

If you’ve been following the cryptocurrency market, you might have noticed increased activity, but the scale of growth in this region is truly remarkable. The Asia-Pacific crypto trading volume has seen a phenomenal surge, capturing the attention of investors and analysts worldwide. What’s Driving the Explosive Asia-Pacific Crypto Trading Volume?

On the one hand, optimists think that the stage is being set to historically rally as Bitcoin prices consolidate around all-time highs and ETFs inject billions into the industry. Skeptics on the other hand, cite decelerating adoption trends in some networks and predict future volatility as global markets are still fragile. In the middle of this debate, analysts see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the number one presale of the year. BTC Bulls Make Their Case Crypto bulls argue that the ingredients for another leg up are already here. Bitcoin ETFs are also experiencing institutional inflows, which assist in keeping BTC price above $117,000 even in times of macroeconomic uncertainty. Ether ETFs are also growing, leading to exposure and increased trust in the second biggest crypto. Historically, capital rotation into altcoins is driven by strong ETF inflows, and this initiates altcoin season. Bulls think this will occur in late 2025, which will establish a foundation to see projects such as Solana, XRP and Cardano take big steps. This rotation has produced some of the highest returns in the last few cycles to investors who have entered early.. Bears Highlight Warning Signs Conversely, bears caution that euphoria may end up being too soon. Already, some altcoins are experiencing decreased activity, while whale cashing out in tokens such as XRP and BNB is an indicator that profit-taking can begin to pick up. According to the onchain data, the number of daily active addresses is decreasing in some ecosystems, which begs the question whether the number of users is keeping up with the expectations of the market. As the world recession worry increases, bears are confident that risk assets such as crypto will be pressured should liquidity tighten further. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Wild Card While bulls and bears debate the broader market, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the wild card that could steal the spotlight .It has already broken records on its presale, attracting both retail and whale investors who want to enter early. Its audited structure also renders the project credible while its scarcity-driven model and the accelerated community growth is generating the kind of buzz that is typically reserved to tokens which later turn into household names. MAGACOIN FINANCE growth trajectory is the most exciting part to the analysts. Furthermore, it is yet another type of opportunity with a predicted 50x upside until the end of the bull market. To ADA and SHIB holders, it is becoming a means to diversify into a project that is full of hype and good fundamentals. It is a market in which bulls and bears both have a point to make, but MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a very hard-to-find consensus: early positioning may be life-changing.. Altcoin Rotation Could Decide the Outcome The last months of 2025 will likely hinge on altcoin rotation. If Bitcoin dominance begins to ease, capital could flow aggressively into altcoins. In that scenario, established tokens like XRP and Cardano could rally significantly, while emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE could multiply many times over. If Bitcoin dominance remains high, however, altcoins may lag behind, leaving only the strongest projects with meaningful gains. This is why investors are closely monitoring ETF flows, whale activity, and market sentiment — the signals that often foreshadow rotation. How Retail and Whales Are Positioning Retail traders are flooding to low-cost altcoins, in search of the next breakout. The Meme-driven coins such as Dogecoin and SHIB continue to be popular yet, the transition to presales indicates that retail investors desire early exposure before mainstream adoption. Whales statistics indicate that they are swapping out of peak altcoins such as BNB following recent highs, for ventures that have greater growth opportunities. This has been especially pronounced in MAGACOIN FINANCE where whales view scarcity as well as momentum as a reason to accumulate prior to listings. Conclusion The fight between bulls and bears will define the way crypto closes out the year 2025. Bulls believe that ETF-based liquidity and altcoin rotation drives a historic rally while bears warn of the macroeconomic headwinds and reduced network activity. However, there is one theme that cuts across both camps: MAGACOIN FINANCE has turned into the hottest presale of the year due to its audited ecosystem, record-breaking $15 million raise and prediction of 50x gains. To the investors, the decision is simple, regardless of whether the market will end the year in a bull frenzy or bear pullback, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be the token that could define the cycle.

Reports have revealed that frustration grew even louder after a major data breach exposed sensitive details of more than 69,000 customers. Now, the company is promising to change how it handles support. Four-Pillar Plan To Fix Service Senior Director Wes Griffith admitted that customers have not been satisfied. He announced a four-pillar strategy aimed at repairing the relationship with users. The first step is to catch problems in the product itself before people need to ask for assistance. The second step will push more automation and self-service options so simple problems can be solved without contacting an agent. The third part of the plan is to make it easier to reach a real human when needed. Many users have complained about getting stuck in loops with chatbots, repeating their issues without getting real answers. The fourth pillar focuses on live support quality, with training and better tools promised for staff. Coinbase says fewer transfers between agents are already helping customers get their issues solved faster. We know customer support at Coinbase has been criticized. We hear you, we are consistently improving and want to bring you along the way. Here’s how we’re making it happen: 1. Saving customers’ time by fixing product issues early and removing roadblocks before they turn into… — Wes-G.eth (@jwesgriffith) September 19, 2025 Data Breach Fueled Anger The backlash reached a peak after a TaskUs employee working for Coinbase was accused of stealing and selling customer records. According to reports, as many as 200 customer files a day were photographed and offered for sale. Names, phone numbers, emails, and even government ID images were taken. Coinbase has stressed that no passwords, private keys, or funds were touched. The company ended ties with those involved in the breach and is working more closely with law enforcement. It is also moving toward creating a US-based customer service hub, a move that could help cut reliance on outside vendors. Early Signs Of Change Based on the latest numbers, customer satisfaction improved by around 20% in August compared to the previous months. The rate of contact transfers, when a customer’s case is handed off between agents, has dropped to about 10%. Coinbase says these early results show progress, but the effort is far from complete. Security and service remain under the lens. Regulators are still investigating, and users continue to question whether the changes will hold over time. Many customers want to see faster response times and more transparency on how issues are tracked. Coinbase’s promise is simple: listen more closely and respond faster. Whether the company can turn that pledge into lasting improvement is something both customers and regulators will be watching closely.

Currently trading around the $116,000 mark, Bitcoin is at a pivotal moment, searching for clear short-term direction. The big question on everyone’s mind is whether it can overcome the formidable Bitcoin $117K Resistance level. This isn’t just another price point; it’s a critical barrier that could dictate BTC’s next major move. Understanding the Bitcoin $117K Resistance Challenge For weeks, market participants have observed Bitcoin’s price action with bated breath. The area around $117,000 has emerged as a significant hurdle, a level where selling pressure tends to increase, making it difficult for buyers to push the price higher. Overcoming this Bitcoin $117K Resistance is seen by many as essential for a sustained upward trend. Why is this specific level so important? Resistance levels often represent previous highs or points where a large number of sell orders were placed, creating a ‘ceiling’ for the price. A successful breach of such a level can signal strong bullish momentum and pave the way for further gains. What Are Analysts Saying About the Bitcoin $117K Resistance? Top crypto analysts are weighing in, offering valuable perspectives on the current market dynamics. Their insights collectively highlight the significance of the Bitcoin $117K Resistance . Rekt Capital , a well-known crypto analyst, pointed out that while the $114,000 support level appears solid, the true test lies in whether BTC can conquer its $117,200 resistance. This suggests that while there’s a strong floor, the ceiling is proving to be a tougher challenge. Daan Crypto Trades further refined the short-term outlook, identifying the key trading range for Bitcoin as being between $112,000 and $118,000. This range encapsulates the current tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, with the upper boundary directly touching our key resistance level. Ted Pillows , another respected voice in the crypto space, projected that a significant rally could be on the horizon, but only if BTC manages to break above $117,000. However, he added a crucial caveat: a failure to breach this level would likely lead to a correction before any potential rebound might occur in the fourth quarter. These expert opinions underscore the consensus that the ability to move past the Bitcoin $117K Resistance is not merely desirable but absolutely critical for short-term bullish continuation. What Happens Next: Rally or Retracement for Bitcoin? The immediate future for Bitcoin hinges on its interaction with the $117,000 resistance. There are two primary scenarios that traders and investors are closely watching: Scenario 1: A Successful Breakthrough If Bitcoin successfully breaks above and holds the Bitcoin $117K Resistance , it would be a powerful bullish signal. This could: Trigger a fresh wave of buying interest. Invalidate previous bearish outlooks. Potentially lead to a rapid ascent towards higher price targets. Such a move would likely confirm the underlying strength of the market and encourage more aggressive participation from investors. Scenario 2: Failure to Break and a Potential Correction Conversely, if Bitcoin struggles at the Bitcoin $117K Resistance and fails to sustain a move above it, the market could see a different outcome. This might involve: Increased selling pressure as traders take profits or exit positions. A retest of lower support levels, such as the $114,000 mark mentioned by Rekt Capital, or even lower within Daan Crypto Trades’ defined range. A period of consolidation or a deeper correction, as suggested by Ted Pillows, before any renewed attempt at a rally in the coming months. This critical juncture demands careful observation. The coming days will likely provide clarity on which path Bitcoin chooses, making it an exciting time for anyone involved in the crypto market. Conclusion: The Defining Moment for Bitcoin’s Short-Term Trajectory The current market landscape emphasizes the profound importance of the Bitcoin $117K Resistance . Analysts are unified in their view that this level is not just a technical hurdle but a psychological barrier that will determine Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Whether we witness an exhilarating breakthrough leading to new highs or a strategic retreat for consolidation, the market is poised for significant movement. Staying informed and understanding these critical levels is paramount for navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a resistance level in cryptocurrency trading? A resistance level is a price point where an upward trend is expected to pause or reverse due to a concentration of selling interest. It acts as a ceiling that the price struggles to break above. Why is the $117K level considered critical for Bitcoin? Analysts identify the $117K level as critical because a sustained break above it could signal strong bullish momentum and lead to a rally, while a failure to do so might trigger a correction or consolidation. What is the significance of a ‘breakthrough’ at the Bitcoin $117K Resistance? A breakthrough signifies that buying pressure has overcome selling pressure at that price point. It often leads to accelerated price movement in the direction of the break, as it can trigger stop-loss orders and attract new buyers. What happens if Bitcoin fails to break the $117K resistance? If Bitcoin fails to break the $117K resistance, it typically indicates that sellers are still dominant at that level. This can lead to a price pullback, a retest of lower support levels, or a period of sideways trading as the market seeks a new equilibrium. Did you find this analysis helpful?

He posted a document that examines how XRP has behaved differently from Bitcoin and Ethereum over the years. The research, based on academic analysis, concludes that XRP shows no signs of forming a value bubble, setting it apart from the two largest digital assets. It highlighted XRP’s rank as the third largest cryptocurrency by market value, following Bitcoin and Ethereum, and cited studies measuring price changes from 2013 to 2016, which found notable bubbles in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, XRP’s price patterns during that period showed no such distortion. This conclusion links XRP’s market stability to its technological foundation. XRP SHOWS NO SIGNS OF A VALUE BUBBLE AS RIPPLE TECHNOLOGY OUTSHINES BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM Documented. pic.twitter.com/6olOq42qmc — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 20, 2025 Technological Edge Over Bitcoin The excerpt explains that XRP’s system operates differently from Bitcoin’s. Instead of relying on proof-of-work, XRP uses a consensus mechanism through the Unique Node List (UNL). For a transaction to be confirmed, at least 40% of over one hundred nodes must align. Once 80% agreement is achieved, a block is validated. This mechanism enables transactions to be completed efficiently while maintaining transparency and anonymity in records. This is one of the reasons why XRP has been described as 120,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin . Ripple CTO David Schwartz has also argued that XRP is more decentralized than proof-of-work blockchains due to its design. The analysis explains that Ripple’s approach offers advantages that limit the formation of speculative bubbles. Fry, a researcher, noted that “the reason why no bubble exists in Ripple stems from the technological superiority of Ripple over Bitcoin.” This statement positions XRP as not just another cryptocurrency but as one with structural resilience against the kinds of market distortions seen in other leading digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP’s Trajectory The absence of a bubble in XRP reflects both stability and credibility, qualities that can strengthen investor confidence. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced volatility linked to speculative surges, XRP has maintained a market pattern less prone to such extremes. That resilience carries significance as digital assets continue to gain attention from financial institutions and policymakers. The research also emphasizes that macroeconomic and financial conditions did not significantly impact XRP’s value during the study period, further suggesting its independence from external influences. This reinforces the view that XRP’s design provides a practical alternative for payments and settlements , aligning with its focus on utility rather than speculation. For XRP holders, the findings signal a positive trajectory. If XRP continues to show structural resistance to bubbles while operating on efficient and scalable technology, it stands well-positioned as the cryptocurrency landscape evolves.

Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) are also attracting investors with great fundamentals and on-chain development. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving to be a smart money breakout amongst traders who are looking to take the next break. These three assets are promising long-term returns as experienced traders tend to place their bets early. Cardano (ADA) price prediction ADA price rose by 2% within the past 24 hours, allowing it to reach approximately $0.87, provoking new technical indicators that analysts consider to be bullish. Market guru Ali Martinez marked a TD Sequential buy indicator, a strategy that is reputed to identify reversals of trends. Cardano support is close to $0.85, with resistance in the zone between $0.89 and $0.90. A daily closing above this level may clear the path to $0.92 and $1.15. Another comparison Martinez made was the alignment of ADA with its 2018-2021 cycle, where the token went several months holding before a higher break. Major targets of an uptrend in the long run are at $1.15, $1.78, and $3.09. ADAUSD 1-Day Chart Additionally, Trader Joe Swanson noted that uptrend depends on the range between $0.88 and $0.90. Control of this level would propel ADA to $1 and above, and failure would result in a retest of $0.75-$0.70. TapTools on-chain data indicated that Cardano owners have surpassed 3.125 million holders, supporting the idea of network expansion despite temporary fluctuations. Polkadot DAO sets a supply cap of 2.1 billion DOT Polkadot is becoming popular among investors, with its DAO deciding to create a permanent cap on the supply of DOT at 2.1 billion. This change is a substitute for the former inflationary type that printed 120 million DOT each year with no limit on supply. Supply would have gone beyond 3.4 billion by 2040 if a cap did not exist. The new model cuts regular issues every two years, beginning on March 14 (Pi Day), which forms a long-term scarcity narrative. Polkadot Issuance and Supply Over Time | Source X Further, minimalized inflation and foreseeable tokenomics will draw in institutional investors and long-term holders as difficulties to supply will be reduced. DOT is also trading at approximately $4.1, down over 60% since the highs in December 2024. Although price has fallen, a fixed supply can put Polkadot in a position of recovery with increasing demand. On August 19, Polkadot enhanced its institutional connections by establishing Polkadot Capital Group, which established a direct connection to Wall Street. This project introduces a new impetus to the project as banks, asset managers, and venture capital firms have easier access to its blockchain. It is against this backdrop that investors are looking at other options to ADA and DOT such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , a scarcity-driven tokenomics project with high ROI in mind. Why smart money traders are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE is speeding up on the deflationary model, where it burns 12% of every transaction, and the total supply is restricted to 170 billion tokens. This architecture reflects the scarcity of Bitcoin, making use of Ethereum programmability. Institutional quality security is integrated as an external audit of CertiK and HashEx to ensure that investors have faith in the transparency of the project. In addition, whale inflows emphasize rising faith. An investor has already shown confidence by investing 72.95 ETH. This indicates that whales are positive on the long-term price of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts believe that the token will yield a 700% ROI because of the burn mechanism and its scarcity. Since Ethereum staking unlock will be released sometime in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE can experience capital aimed towards high-growth, scarcity-based projects. Conclusion The best crypto to purchase in September is Cardano, Polkadot, and MAGACOIN FINANCE, with Polkadot supply cap and ADA bullish cycle trends pointing to good fundamental characteristics. In the meantime, MAGACOIN FINANCE has unrivalled deflationary mechanics and institutional trust of up to 700% ROI. These three assets offer a wide range of prospects to smart money investors in a market that is about to experience the next big shift.

XRP has eyes set on $5 after breaking through the $3 barrier on the back of legal clarity in its SEC battle. The growth of whale wallets, added custody partnerships, and the new CME options related to XRP combine to create one of the most optimistic views on the token in years. While XRP garners the spotlight, analysts seek other undervalued plays in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gradually emerging in the conversation and is being referred to by analysts as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. Price Predictions: XRP Eyes the $5 Mark XRP price is gaining bullish momentum above the $3 resistance zone. According to technical analysis, the price of the token may rise to $3.50. After this, it may experience higher rises towards $4.70. Some forecasts are even suggesting a price target of $5 and even $10 if the conditions remain favourable. This outlook is being reinforced by a win-win cooperation feedback loop. The legal certainty that has come about after the Ripple SEC settlement has wiped out one of the biggest negative factors for the token. ETF inflows are thus creating another layer of institutional demand while banks are consistently expanding their adoption of XRP in their payment and settlement networks. Reaching $5 is more than a technical milestone. XRP would once again become a prominent topic of discussion, not just among retail traders but also among institutional investors looking for regulated assets with real-world use cases in finance. Whale Moves: Wallets Signal Institutional Confidence Whale activity is becoming a key factor in the XRP price rise. According to reports, wallets that hold more than 1 million XRP reached a new all-time high of 2,743 with a cumulative of 47.32 billion XRP. This increase in extensive wallet holdings reflects confidence among institutional-style investors. Despite the sale of tens of millions of tokens by traders, the general trend is still towards accumulation. Whales tend to be the market leaders. The fact that the whales are buying further validates calls for XRP to test $5 price level. The dynamics of this wallet also indicate that there is less circulating supply, and such a factor can enhance price movement when demand rises, like CME options. Analyst Picks: Beyond XRP, Hidden Gems Emerge Given XRP’s revival, it is one of the most-watched altcoins. However, analysts advise diversifying into hidden gems, which could outperform during the next cycle of capital rotation and MAGACOIN FINANCE is a name that often comes up in discussions. MAGACOIN FINANCE is not like many other projects, which are mere speculation. It is a project with strong fundamentals attracting new and experienced investors. Its fixed supply and community-driven approach makes it stand out in the crypto market. Many analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE has a good balance of security, scarcity, and high adoption potentials. Thus, it is in a good position to exhibit the same kind of breakout performance as other tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin did in prior cycles. Furthermore MAGACOIN FINANCE is an easy choice alternative for investors seeking early entry into a project to achieve credible upside. Conclusion Whale activity and institutional catalysts such as CME options support XRP’s path toward $5. At the same time, analyst attention is broadening beyond XRP to highlight opportunities in undervalued projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a prime candidate in this category, combining community energy, transparency, and security. For investors, the message is clear: XRP may lead the charge in 2025, but the biggest rewards lie in spotting the hidden gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE with immense upsides.

The widely-followed Crypto Fear & Greed Index just dipped four points to a score of 45. This moves market sentiment from “neutral” into “fear” territory. Understanding this crucial indicator provides valuable insight into the collective emotional state of crypto investors. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a powerful tool measuring market sentiment. Developed by Alternative.me, it gauges investor exuberance (greed) or caution (fear) on a scale from 0 to 100: 0 signifies Extreme Fear: Investors are worried, often leading to selling. 100 signifies Extreme Greed: Investors are overly optimistic, potentially indicating a market correction. This index aggregates data from various sources for a comprehensive view: Volatility (25%): Bitcoin price movements. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Trading volume and momentum compared to averages. Social Media (15%): Sentiment analysis from platforms. Surveys (15%): Weekly polls (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Rising dominance often signals fear, as investors flee altcoins for Bitcoin’s safety. Google Trends (10%): Search queries related to Bitcoin. By combining these elements, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a snapshot of the prevailing mood, a strong counter-indicator for savvy investors. Why Has the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Shifted to Fear? The recent drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 45 reflects worsening investor sentiment. Several interconnected factors likely contribute: Increased Volatility: Significant price swings, especially for Bitcoin, quickly trigger fear. Decreased Trading Volume: Lower volumes indicate a lack of buyer conviction, suggesting hesitant investors. Negative Social Media Buzz: A surge in negative discussions amplifies fear rapidly. Bitcoin’s Dominance: Rising dominance often means investors move from altcoins to Bitcoin for perceived safety. General Economic Concerns: Broader macroeconomic factors (inflation, geopolitics) can dampen crypto confidence. This collective market response is precisely what the index captures. A reading of 45 actively expresses caution and apprehension. Navigating the Fear: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index points to fear, it presents both challenges and opportunities. Consider these actionable insights: Don’t Panic Sell: Extreme fear often precedes market recoveries. Avoid rash, emotional decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in crypto’s long-term potential, a fearful market can be opportune to gradually accumulate assets at lower prices. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Review your investment strategy. Ensure holdings align with your risk tolerance and goals. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed: Monitor market news, but avoid sensationalism. Focus on fundamental developments and long-term trends. Look for Contrarian Opportunities: Some view “extreme fear” as a “buy signal.” This requires careful research and risk management. Understanding the index empowers you to make more informed, less emotional decisions, even in uncertain markets. The recent dip of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 45 undeniably signals a shift into fear territory. This powerful metric, drawing on diverse data, serves as a crucial barometer for investor sentiment. While a fearful market can be unsettling, it also offers a chance for strategic reflection and calculated moves. By staying informed and disciplined, investors can navigate these turbulent waters more effectively, turning apprehension into a foundation for future growth. Frequently Asked Questions About the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 45 mean?

This innovative digital asset has made an explosive debut, capturing the attention of investors worldwide with its stunning performance. If you’re keen on understanding what’s driving this impressive surge and what it means for the broader market, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive into the details of River’s journey from a highly anticipated token generation event to a record-setting pre-market listing. What is the River Token and its Explosive Debut? River (RIVER) token represents a significant milestone in the crypto space. It stands as the inaugural project emerging from Binance Wallet’s BuildKey token generation event (TGE), signaling its strong foundation and backing. The project’s highly anticipated listing on Bitget’s pre-market on September 21 marked a pivotal moment, immediately setting the stage for its dramatic price action. Following its pre-market introduction, the River token experienced an astounding surge, skyrocketing over 8,000% from its initial DEX offering (IDO) price. This meteoric rise propelled its value to an impressive high of $4.15. Furthermore, the token demonstrated substantial market interest, accumulating a cumulative trading volume of $1.13 million within a short period. This rapid ascent underscores the intense demand and positive sentiment surrounding this new asset. Why Did River Token’s Demand Outstrip Expectations? The overwhelming demand for the River token became evident even before its Bitget pre-market listing. Initially, the project faced a unique challenge on the Aspecta pre-market. The team behind River acknowledged that a price cap implemented on Aspecta could not adequately satisfy the burgeoning trading demand from eager investors. This limitation inadvertently created a bottleneck, preventing many from acquiring the token at their desired levels. Consequently, a significant number of investors, seeking more unrestricted trading opportunities and better liquidity, opted to migrate to other platforms. This strategic move by investors played a crucial role in funneling demand towards platforms like Bitget, where the River token could be traded more freely. This shift highlights the dynamic nature of crypto markets, where investor behavior can profoundly influence a token’s trajectory and market accessibility. The Phenomenal Success of River Token’s Binance Wallet TGE Before its sensational pre-market performance, the River token had already showcased its immense potential through its first BuildKey TGE on Binance Wallet. This event, held on September 19, was nothing short of historic. Within a mere two hours, the TGE witnessed an astonishing influx of over $100 million in BNB deposits. This remarkable achievement set an unprecedented record, marking the highest deposit amount ever recorded in the history of Binance Wallet IDOs. Such a monumental response from the community underscores the deep trust and excitement investors hold for projects emerging from the Binance ecosystem. The TGE is scheduled to culminate on September 22, at which point BuildKey holders will have the opportunity to exchange their keys directly for RIVER tokens , completing the initial distribution phase. What Does This Mean for Future River Token Holders? The journey of the River token , from a record-breaking TGE to an explosive pre-market listing, offers valuable insights for both current and prospective holders. For those who participated in the BuildKey TGE or acquired tokens early, the initial returns have been substantial, validating their early belief in the project and its underlying technology. This early success often builds strong community confidence and can attract further interest from a broader investor base, contributing to sustained growth and visibility in the competitive crypto market. However, it is crucial to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid fluctuations. While the initial surge of the River token is impressive, future price movements will depend on various critical factors. These include ongoing project development and innovation, evolving market sentiment, regulatory changes, and broader macroeconomic trends. Potential investors should always conduct thorough due diligence, meticulously research the project’s roadmap, understand its utility, and carefully consider their personal risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Observing how the project delivers on its promises, expands its ecosystem, and evolves post-TGE will be key to its long-term viability and success. In conclusion, the debut of the River token has been nothing short of spectacular, setting new benchmarks for token launches within the Binance ecosystem and on platforms like Bitget. Its rapid ascent, fueled by strong investor demand and a successful TGE, paints a picture of a project with significant initial momentum. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, River token’s performance will undoubtedly be a focal point for many, demonstrating the potential for innovation and growth in the decentralized finance space. This journey serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic opportunities that exist within the world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the River token (RIVER)?

Understanding key financial market events is not just for traditional investors; it is absolutely vital for anyone navigating the fast-paced world of digital assets. This week brings a series of high-profile speeches and critical economic data releases that demand your attention. From central bank pronouncements to vital inflation reports, these events often dictate market sentiment, investor behavior, and ultimately, the price action of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Let’s break down the crucial moments ahead, so you can stay informed and make smarter decisions. Kicking Off the Week: Central Bank Insights and Their Impact on Financial Market Events The week begins with powerful voices from the world’s leading central banks. Their words carry immense weight, often signaling future monetary policy shifts that can either boost or dampen investor confidence across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Sept. 22, 4:00 p.m. UTC: Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran speaks. Miran’s remarks will offer insights into the Fed’s current economic outlook and potential policy trajectory. Investors will be listening for any hints regarding interest rates or quantitative easing, which directly influence liquidity in the broader financial system. Sept. 22, 6:00 p.m. UTC: Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey speaks. Bailey’s address will shed light on the UK’s economic health and the BoE’s approach to inflation and growth. Global macroeconomic stability, or lack thereof, can certainly sway risk assets like crypto. These speeches are more than just formalities; they are indicators. They help us gauge the global economic temperature and anticipate how major central banks plan to respond to ongoing challenges. Any unexpected hawkish or dovish comments can trigger immediate market reactions. Mid-Week Momentum: Powell’s Crucial Remarks and Key US Financial Market Events As the week progresses, the spotlight intensifies on the United States, with a highly anticipated speech from the Federal Reserve Chair and a critical economic data release. These moments are often pivotal for market direction. Sept. 23, 4:35 p.m. UTC: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks. Powell’s statements are arguably the most influential. His tone and specific comments on inflation, employment, and future interest rate hikes can send shockwaves through both traditional and crypto markets. Investors will scrutinize every word for clues about the Fed’s next moves, which profoundly affect risk appetite. Sept. 25, 12:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. final Q2 GDP data release. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the broadest measure of economic activity. This final Q2 reading will confirm the health of the U.S. economy. A stronger-than-expected GDP might suggest a robust economy, potentially leading the Fed to maintain a tighter monetary policy. Conversely, a weaker reading could signal a slowdown, possibly prompting a more dovish stance. Both of these financial market events provide crucial pieces of the economic puzzle. They help investors understand the fundamental health of the largest economy in the world, which invariably impacts global capital flows and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. Wrapping Up: Lagarde’s Perspective and Inflationary Financial Market Events The week concludes with more insights from Europe and a particularly important inflation metric from the U.S. These final events will shape the narrative going into the following week. Sept. 26, 9:30 a.m. UTC: European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde speaks. Lagarde’s speech will offer the ECB’s perspective on the Eurozone’s economic situation and inflation. Her comments could influence the strength of the Euro, which indirectly affects the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). A stronger DXY often puts pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Sept. 26, 12:30 p.m. UTC: U.S. August Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data release. This is perhaps one of the most critical financial market events of the week. Core PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. This data will reveal whether inflationary pressures are subsiding or persisting. A higher-than-expected Core PCE could reinforce the Fed’s commitment to higher interest rates, which typically weighs negatively on crypto valuations. A lower reading, however, might offer some relief to markets. These concluding events provide the final pieces of information for investors to digest. The Core PCE, in particular, often dictates short-term market sentiment due to its direct relevance to the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Stay Informed, Stay Agile: Navigating the Week’s Financial Market Events This week is undoubtedly significant for anyone tracking global markets. From central bank speeches to crucial economic data, each event carries the potential to influence market trends and investor sentiment. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these broader financial market events is key to anticipating market movements and managing risk effectively. By staying informed about these developments, you can better prepare for potential volatility and make more strategic decisions in your crypto investments. Remember, the world of finance is interconnected, and what happens in one corner often sends ripples to another. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why are central bank speeches important for crypto investors? Central bank speeches often signal changes in monetary policy, such as interest rate hikes or cuts. These policies directly affect liquidity in the financial system and investor risk appetite. When liquidity tightens, investors often move away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is the significance of US GDP data for the crypto market? GDP data indicates the overall health of the U.S. economy. A strong economy might prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance, which can negatively impact crypto. Conversely, a weakening economy might lead to more dovish policies, potentially benefiting crypto as investors seek alternative assets. Q3: How does the Core PCE data influence cryptocurrency prices? Core PCE is the Fed’s preferred inflation metric. If Core PCE comes in higher than expected, it suggests inflation is persistent, which could lead the Fed to continue raising interest rates. Higher interest rates typically make traditional investments more attractive and can reduce demand for speculative assets like crypto. Q4: Should I make immediate trading decisions based on these financial market events? While these events can cause short-term volatility, it’s generally advisable to avoid impulsive decisions. Instead, use the information to understand the broader market context and adjust your long-term strategy. Consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals before acting.

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with significant news today as Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a notable Bitcoin price drop , falling below the critical $115,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $114,985.48 on the Binance USDT market. This movement has naturally sparked discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about the underlying causes and potential future implications for the world’s leading digital asset. What Triggered This Latest Bitcoin Price Drop Below $115,000? The sudden dip in Bitcoin’s value is a key event that demands attention. While specific catalysts can often be complex and multi-faceted, several factors typically contribute to such market movements. A fall below a psychological or technical support level like $115,000 can often accelerate selling pressure as automated trading systems and wary investors react. This particular Bitcoin price drop reflects a shift in immediate market sentiment, moving from optimism to caution. Understanding the immediate triggers is crucial for investors. Market analysts often point to a combination of global economic indicators, shifts in investor confidence, or even large-scale sell-offs by significant holders, often referred to as ‘whales.’ These elements collectively shape the volatile landscape of cryptocurrency trading, making rapid price changes a common, albeit often unsettling, occurrence. Exploring the Broader Market Context: Why Does Bitcoin Fluctuate? Bitcoin’s journey has always been marked by volatility. Its price action is influenced by a diverse range of internal and external factors. For instance, macroeconomic news, such as inflation reports or interest rate decisions from central banks, can have a ripple effect on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory developments around the globe also play a pivotal role; news of stricter regulations or outright bans in certain regions can significantly impact investor sentiment and trigger a Bitcoin price drop . Moreover, the crypto market is still relatively young and less liquid compared to traditional financial markets. This characteristic means that even moderately sized trades can sometimes have a disproportionate effect on price, especially during periods of low trading volume. Technical indicators, such as a breach of key support levels, can also signal further downward momentum, encouraging more sellers to enter the market. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Drop: A Guide for Investors When faced with a significant market movement like this Bitcoin price drop , investors often wonder how to proceed. It’s a natural reaction to feel concern, but panic selling is rarely the optimal strategy. Instead, adopting a measured and informed approach can help mitigate risks and potentially identify opportunities. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such market conditions: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor reliable news sources and market analysis from platforms like Bitcoin World. Understanding the news helps you make informed decisions. Reassess Your Portfolio: Take this opportunity to review your investment goals and risk tolerance. Ensure your portfolio allocation still aligns with your long-term strategy. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of attempting to ‘time the market,’ consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term volatility. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market downturns can be emotionally challenging. Base your decisions on research and your pre-defined investment plan, rather than fear or greed. Focus on Long-Term Potential: Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, recovering from numerous significant drops to reach new all-time highs. A long-term perspective can help weather short-term storms. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future Trajectory? While the immediate Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 is a significant headline, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of Bitcoin’s journey. The cryptocurrency market is dynamic, characterized by cycles of expansion and contraction. Many analysts believe that such corrections are a healthy part of a maturing market, flushing out excessive speculation and paving the way for more sustainable growth. The resilience of the Bitcoin network, its growing adoption, and its fundamental value proposition as a decentralized digital asset remain strong. While short-term fluctuations can be unsettling, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin often focuses on its scarcity, security, and potential as a hedge against traditional financial systems. Investors should therefore focus on these foundational aspects rather than getting overly fixated on daily price swings. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $115,000 is a noteworthy event in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. While it highlights the inherent risks of digital asset investing, it also underscores the importance of informed decision-making, strategic planning, and a long-term perspective. Staying educated and avoiding impulsive reactions are paramount for navigating these market shifts successfully. The crypto journey is often a rollercoaster, and understanding its dynamics is key to a smoother ride.

Although PEPE’s community strength and meme power can fuel short-term appreciation, long-term outlook is tied to speculative cycles. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention because of its fundamentals. MUTM is built around a two-way lending-and-borrowing protocol which brings DeFi utility to the table. Mutuum Finance can be bought at the cost of $0.035 in presale stage 6. The protocol has seen over $16.05 million raised in funds as well as over 16,450 holders. MUTM is ready to provide returns of up to 3,500%, an infinitely more appealing bet for investors seeking sustainable upside in 2025. PEPE Coin Meets Resistance While Mood Remains Muted PEPE is currently priced at $0.00001086, with resistance forming around $0.00001120–$0.00001140 and support around $0.00001050–$0.00001070. Volume has been good, showing interest but not strong enough to overcome resistance convincingly. Price action is generally highly co-related with meme-coin sentiment and social sentiment, which can create very steep upticks and downticks. In contrast to the unstable dynamics of PEPE, Mutuum Finance is seen by some investors as having more robust structural potential for yields in current market conditions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Soars in Presale Mutuum Finance is currently in stage six of presale at $0.035 after a 16.17% increase from the previous stage. The project is seeing enormous demand in the market with over 16,450 investors who have registered and invested over $16.05 million. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program for the security of the platform recently. The bugs have been classified on four levels with the designations critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance has strong controls of security over whatever is collateralized so that user security and protocol are never lost. Target collateral ratios, lending and deposit ceilings are upheld. Off close undercollateralized positions are enabled to make purchases of liquidated, call penalties and initiating liquidation guarantee remediation in a timely manner in assisting in achieving systemic stability. Collateral efficiency is maximized in collateralized securities, i.e., lending efficiency is maximized in Loan-to-Value (LTV) in highly collateralized financing. Reserve problems are suggested as a car for shock-absorption to abnormal market conditions, and excess reserve can be taxed on volatile assets in order to cancel out volatility. Community Growth and Rate Adjustments Mutuum Finance is looking to revolutionize the DeFi model that is prevalent in the future. For this, the project is promoting early adoption by a $100,000 giveaway contest in which 10 users will be rewarded with a $10,000 MUTM bonus. Mutuum Finance is at floating rate of interest based on liquidity. Borrowing cheap when the system is highly liquid allows more usage. Borrowing expensive when the system is illiquid allows repayment of the loan and fresh deposits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum as Pepe Coin (PEPE) struggles with resistance. While PEPE is $0.00001086 and based on hype driven by memes, MUTM delivers actual DeFi utility with its twin lending protocol. Already raised at $16.05 M with 16,410+ holders, the project stands at $0.035 in Stage 6 and moving towards $0.04 in Stage 7. Backed by a $50K CertiK bug bounty, $100K community giveaway, and robust risk controls, analysts estimate 3,500% upside as a reasonable long-term projection. Buy your MUTM tokens today at Stage 6 before prices go up.

This sudden downturn caught many traders off guard, highlighting the inherent volatility of digital asset markets. Over the past 24 hours, the total liquidated value soared to an astonishing $390 million, leaving a significant impact on trading positions across major exchanges. What exactly does this mean for traders and the broader market? What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? For those new to futures trading, understanding crypto futures liquidation is crucial. Essentially, it happens when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This occurs because the trader no longer has sufficient margin to cover potential losses. When market prices move sharply against a trader’s position, their margin balance can fall below the maintenance margin level. To prevent further losses and maintain market stability, the exchange automatically liquidates the position. Imagine you are trading with borrowed funds, also known as leverage. While leverage can amplify profits, it also significantly magnifies potential losses. If the market shifts unfavorably, even slightly, your initial capital (margin) might not be enough to sustain the position. Leverage Amplifies Risk: Using leverage means you’re trading with more capital than you actually own, increasing both potential gains and losses. Margin Call Precursor: Before liquidation, traders might face a margin call, requesting additional funds. Failure to meet this often leads to forced closure. Market Volatility is Key: The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies means prices can swing dramatically in short periods, making futures positions particularly susceptible to liquidation. Why Did Such a Massive Liquidation Event Occur? The recent $183 million crypto futures liquidation didn’t happen in a vacuum. Such large-scale events are typically triggered by a confluence of factors, often beginning with a significant price movement in a major cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or Ethereum. A sudden dip or surge can cascade through the market, especially when many traders hold highly leveraged positions in the same direction. Several elements contribute to these sudden market shifts and subsequent liquidations. Understanding these can provide valuable insights into market dynamics and help traders prepare for future volatility. Sudden Price Swings: A rapid, unexpected price drop or pump can quickly erode a trader’s margin, especially for highly leveraged positions. Over-Leveraged Positions: Many traders might have been overly optimistic or aggressive with their leverage, making their positions fragile and vulnerable to even small price movements. Market Sentiment Shift: Negative news, regulatory concerns, or broader economic trends can quickly shift market sentiment, leading to widespread selling pressure and price depreciation. Stop-Loss Hunting: Sometimes, large market players might strategically push prices to trigger stop-loss orders and liquidations, creating further downward (or upward) momentum. How Can Traders Navigate the Risks of Crypto Futures Liquidation? While the recent crypto futures liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of market risks, traders can adopt several strategies to protect themselves. Prudent risk management is not just a recommendation; it is an absolute necessity in futures trading. Protecting your capital should always be your top priority. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these turbulent waters: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage. Start with lower leverage ratios until you gain sufficient experience and confidence in your trading strategy. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves beyond a predetermined threshold. This limits potential losses and prevents catastrophic outcomes. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one trade or one asset. Diversification across different assets and strategies can help spread risk and reduce exposure. Monitor Market News: Stay informed about global economic news, regulatory updates, and cryptocurrency-specific developments that could impact prices. Knowledge is power in volatile markets. Understand Margin Requirements: Always be aware of your initial and maintenance margin requirements. Keep sufficient funds in your account to avoid margin calls and potential liquidation. Practice Emotional Discipline: Avoid impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Stick to your trading plan and pre-defined risk parameters, even when the market is chaotic. The recent $183 million crypto futures liquidation underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While futures trading offers exciting opportunities for profit, it comes with significant risks, particularly due to leverage and market volatility. By understanding the mechanics of liquidation and implementing robust risk management strategies, traders can better navigate these turbulent waters. Stay informed, trade responsibly, and prioritize the preservation of your capital to ensure long-term success in the crypto space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin balance has fallen below the required maintenance level, typically due to adverse price movements against their trade. 2. Why did $183 million worth of futures get liquidated recently? This massive liquidation was likely triggered by significant and rapid price movements in major cryptocurrencies, combined with a high number of traders holding overly leveraged positions that could not withstand the sudden market shift. 3. How can I avoid liquidation in futures trading? To avoid liquidation, traders should use lower leverage, always set stop-loss orders, maintain sufficient margin, diversify their portfolio, and stay informed about market news to make prudent trading decisions. 4. Is crypto futures trading too risky? Crypto futures trading is inherently risky due to market volatility and the use of leverage. However, with proper risk management, education, and emotional discipline, traders can mitigate some of these risks. 5. What role does leverage play in liquidation? Leverage significantly amplifies both potential profits and losses. While it allows traders to control larger positions with less capital, it also makes positions more susceptible to liquidation if market prices move unfavorably, as the margin required to maintain the position becomes insufficient more quickly.

CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index has officially soared to 70. This significant milestone signals a potential shift in market dynamics, where alternative cryptocurrencies are starting to outshine Bitcoin. For many investors, this could unlock a wave of new opportunities and reshape portfolios. What Does an Altcoin Season Index of 70 Truly Indicate? When the Altcoin Season Index reaches 70, it’s a clear indicator that the market is experiencing a notable trend. The index specifically measures whether 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization—excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens—have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score closer to 100 strongly suggests an Altcoin Season is in full swing, while a score closer to 0 points to a ‘Bitcoin Season’. This metric is crucial because it helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and capital flow within the crypto ecosystem. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally often sets the stage for altcoins to catch up and even surpass Bitcoin’s gains, as investors seek higher returns in riskier, yet potentially more rewarding, assets. Therefore, a score of 70 is a strong signal for altcoin enthusiasts. Why Do We Witness an Altcoin Season in the Crypto Market? Several factors typically contribute to the emergence of an Altcoin Season . Often, Bitcoin’s price appreciation acts as a catalyst, bringing new capital into the broader crypto market. Once Bitcoin consolidates or experiences a slight pullback, this fresh capital, alongside profits from Bitcoin, tends to flow into altcoins, seeking the next big opportunity. Consider these key drivers: Bitcoin Dominance Shift: As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap share of the total crypto market) decreases, altcoins often gain ground. Investors rotate capital from Bitcoin into other promising digital assets. Increased Risk Appetite: A general bullish sentiment in the market encourages investors to take on more risk in pursuit of higher returns, moving beyond established giants. Technological Innovations: New projects with groundbreaking technology, strong use cases, or significant partnerships can attract substantial investment, driving their prices upwards. Narrative-Driven Cycles: Specific sectors like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or gaming tokens can experience concentrated rallies, pulling the entire altcoin market upwards based on current trends. Understanding these dynamics is vital for making informed decisions during such an exciting period, as they shed light on the underlying market psychology and capital movement that fuel an Altcoin Season . How Can Investors Navigate This Exciting Altcoin Season? With the Altcoin Season in motion, how can investors best position themselves? While the potential for significant gains is alluring, it’s equally important to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy. This period demands both careful research and robust risk management to capitalize on opportunities while minimizing exposure to volatility. Here are some actionable insights: Conduct Thorough Research: Do not blindly follow hype. Understand the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Look for real-world utility and a clear roadmap. Diversify Your Portfolio: Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket, spread your investments across several promising altcoins in different sectors to mitigate risk. Implement Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders to limit potential downsides and take profits strategically when your targets are met. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves quickly. Keep up with news, developments, and sentiment shifts to adapt your strategy as needed. Join reputable communities for insights. These steps can help mitigate risks while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by a vibrant Altcoin Season , ensuring a more sustainable investment journey. What Are the Potential Rewards and Challenges of an Altcoin Season? The allure of an Altcoin Season lies in its potential for substantial returns. Many altcoins, especially those with smaller market capitalizations, can experience exponential growth in a short period. This can lead to significant portfolio appreciation for early or well-timed investors who identify promising projects before they become mainstream. However, alongside these rewards come inherent challenges that investors must acknowledge: High Volatility: Altcoins are notoriously volatile. Prices can swing dramatically in either direction, leading to rapid gains or equally rapid losses. This requires a strong stomach and clear strategy. Increased Risk of Scams: Bull markets often attract bad actors. Be wary of ‘pump and dump’ schemes, rug pulls, and fraudulent projects that prey on investor excitement. Always verify legitimacy. Information Overload: The sheer volume of new projects and daily news can be overwhelming, making it difficult to discern legitimate opportunities from noise and FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt). Therefore, a balanced perspective, combining optimism with a healthy dose of skepticism, is crucial for long-term success during an Altcoin Season . The current surge in the CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index to 70 is undeniably exciting for the crypto community. It signals a period where altcoins are demonstrating robust performance against Bitcoin, opening doors to diverse investment opportunities. While the potential for impressive gains is evident, smart investing remains paramount. Remember to prioritize research, diversify wisely, and manage risks effectively to navigate this thrilling market phase successfully. This could be a pivotal moment for your crypto journey! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Altcoin Season Q1: What exactly defines an Altcoin Season? A1: An Altcoin Season is generally defined when 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period, as measured by CoinMarketCap’s index. A high index score, like 70, indicates this trend is strongly in play. Q2: How long does an Altcoin Season typically last? A2: The duration of an Altcoin Season can vary significantly. Some can last for a few weeks, while others might extend for several months, depending on overall market sentiment, Bitcoin’s performance, and macro-economic factors. There’s no fixed timeline, so staying informed is key. Q3: Should I sell all my Bitcoin during an Altcoin Season? A3: It is generally not advisable to sell all your Bitcoin. Bitcoin often acts as a store of value and can provide stability. Many investors rebalance their portfolios, allocating a portion of their Bitcoin holdings to promising altcoins, rather than completely divesting from Bitcoin. Q4: What types of altcoins tend to perform well during an Altcoin Season? A4: Performance varies, but often altcoins with strong fundamentals, innovative technology, growing ecosystems (e.g., DeFi, AI, gaming), and active development teams tend to do well. Smaller cap altcoins can offer higher percentage gains but also carry higher risks. Q5: Is an Altcoin Season guaranteed to make me rich? A5: No, an Altcoin Season does not guarantee riches. While it presents significant opportunities for profit, it also comes with high volatility and risks. Success depends on individual investment choices, market timing, and diligent research. Always invest responsibly and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

In just one hour, over $300 million in futures positions were wiped out across major exchanges. This followed a larger $500 million liquidation within a 24-hour period. This sudden market shake-up has left many wondering about its immediate implications and what it means for the future of crypto trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? When we talk about crypto futures liquidation , we are referring to the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange. This happens automatically when a trader’s margin balance falls below a specific maintenance level. Exchanges do this to prevent further losses for the trader and to maintain market stability. It is essentially a safety mechanism. If the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged position, the exchange steps in to close it. This prevents the trader from owing more than their initial margin, but it also means their entire position is lost. Why Did This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Occur? Such a significant crypto futures liquidation event is almost always a direct result of extreme market volatility. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid price swings, and when these movements are sudden and sharp, they can catch many traders off guard. Several factors often contribute: Unexpected Price Movements: A sudden pump or dump in price can quickly erode a leveraged position’s margin. High Leverage: Many traders use high leverage to amplify potential gains. However, this also magnifies losses, making positions more susceptible to liquidation with even small price changes. Market Sentiment Shifts: A rapid change in overall market sentiment, perhaps due to a major news event or macro-economic data, can trigger widespread selling or buying pressure. These elements combined can create a cascading effect, where initial liquidations lead to further price movements, triggering even more liquidations. How Can Traders Protect Themselves from Crypto Futures Liquidation? While the allure of high returns through futures trading is strong, the risks, especially concerning crypto futures liquidation , are equally significant. Here are some actionable insights for traders to consider: Manage Your Leverage: Use lower leverage ratios. While high leverage can increase profits, it dramatically increases the risk of liquidation. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders. These automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain unfavorable level, limiting your potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your capital into a single highly leveraged position. Diversification can help mitigate risk. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news, technical analysis, and sentiment. Understanding potential catalysts for price swings is crucial. Start Small and Learn: If new to futures trading, begin with small amounts and gradually increase as you gain experience and understanding. What Does This Event Signal for the Crypto Market? This massive crypto futures liquidation serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks present in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. It highlights that even experienced traders can be caught off guard by sudden market movements. Such events often lead to a period of increased caution among traders, potentially contributing to more stable, albeit perhaps less exciting, price action in the short term. For long-term investors, it underscores the importance of a well-researched, risk-managed approach. The recent significant crypto futures liquidation event, wiping out hundreds of millions in mere hours, is a stark reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. While it signals the inherent risks of leveraged trading, it also offers invaluable lessons on risk management and the importance of a disciplined trading strategy. Staying informed and practicing caution are paramount in this fast-paced environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary cause of a crypto futures liquidation? A: The primary cause is typically high market volatility combined with high leverage, leading a trader’s margin to fall below the required maintenance level. Q2: Can I avoid crypto futures liquidation entirely? A: While you cannot avoid market volatility, you can significantly reduce the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, and managing your risk effectively. Q3: Does a liquidation event affect the spot market? A: Yes, large liquidation events in the futures market can often spill over into the spot market, leading to increased selling pressure and price drops as traders adjust their positions. Q4: Is futures trading suitable for beginners? A: Due to its complexity and high risk, futures trading, especially with leverage, is generally not recommended for beginners. It requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and risk management. If you found this article insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

One such significant event that often captures the attention of investors and traders alike is token unlocks . This week, from September 22nd to 28th, several major projects are scheduled to release substantial amounts of their previously locked tokens, potentially ushering in notable market shifts. Understanding these upcoming token unlocks is crucial for navigating the market wisely. What Are This Week’s Major Token Unlocks? According to data compiled by Tokenomist, the crypto community is bracing for a series of significant token unlocks . These events involve the release of tokens that were previously restricted, often held by early investors, team members, or advisors, and are now becoming available for trading. This increase in circulating supply can, in turn, influence market dynamics. Here’s a quick look at the key releases: Sept. 22: MBG – 15.84 million tokens ($17.9 million), representing 13.6% of circulating supply, unlock at 12:00 p.m. UTC. Sept. 24: NIL – 65.12 million tokens ($21.46 million), a significant 33.37% of circulating supply, unlock at 1:00 p.m. UTC. Sept. 25: VENOM – 59.26 million tokens ($8.4 million), 2.28% of circulating supply, unlock at 8:00 a.m. UTC. Sept. 25: PARTI – A staggering 180 million tokens ($32.41 million), making up 78.44% of circulating supply, unlock at 10:00 a.m. UTC. This particular token unlock is drawing considerable attention due to its sheer volume relative to the current supply. Sept. 25: ALT – 240 million tokens ($8.01 million), 5.67% of circulating supply, unlock at 10:00 a.m. UTC. Sept. 26: SAHARA – 130 million tokens ($11.26 million), 6.08% of circulating supply, unlock at 12:00 p.m. UTC. How Do Token Unlocks Impact the Market? The release of a large number of tokens into the market can have several implications. Primarily, it increases the total circulating supply of a cryptocurrency. This increased supply, assuming constant demand, often leads to selling pressure as early investors or team members might decide to take profits. Consequently, this can result in price volatility or even a downward trend for the token’s value. However, the actual impact varies greatly depending on several factors. Key Considerations for Token Unlocks: Percentage of Circulating Supply: Unlocks that represent a large percentage of the current circulating supply, like PARTI’s 78.44%, tend to have a more pronounced effect. Market Sentiment: A bullish market might absorb unlocks more easily, while a bearish sentiment could amplify selling pressure. Project Fundamentals: Strong projects with active development and clear roadmaps might weather token unlocks better than those with weaker fundamentals. Investor Intent: The likelihood of tokens being sold depends on the original investors’ strategies and the project’s long-term prospects. Navigating the Waves: What Should Investors Do During Token Unlocks? For those invested in or considering these tokens, staying informed is paramount. While token unlocks can introduce short-term volatility, they also present potential opportunities for strategic entry or exit points. It’s essential to conduct thorough research beyond just the unlock schedule. Actionable Insights: Monitor Volume: Pay close attention to trading volume around the unlock dates. A significant spike in volume, especially coupled with price depreciation, could signal heavy selling. Analyze Project Health: Look into the project’s recent developments, partnerships, and community engagement. A healthy project might recover quickly. Consider Staking/Yield Opportunities: Some projects offer staking or yield farming, which can absorb some of the unlocked supply, reducing immediate selling pressure. Risk Management: Always employ robust risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders, especially when dealing with assets facing significant unlocks. This week’s lineup of significant token unlocks , particularly the substantial PARTI release, underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market. While these events can introduce volatility, they are a fundamental part of a token’s lifecycle. By understanding the mechanics and potential impacts of these unlocks, investors can make more informed decisions and navigate the market with greater confidence. Stay vigilant, do your homework, and prepare for the shifts these unlocks might bring. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are token unlocks in cryptocurrency? Token unlocks refer to the scheduled release of previously restricted cryptocurrency tokens into the circulating supply. These tokens are often held by early investors, team members, or advisors under a vesting schedule. 2. Why do token unlocks happen? They are part of a project’s tokenomics, designed to distribute tokens over time, often to incentivize long-term holding, prevent early dumping by insiders, and align interests with the project’s success. 3. What is the typical impact of a token unlock on price? Often, a large token unlock can lead to increased selling pressure as more tokens become available, potentially causing short-term price volatility or a decrease. However, the actual impact depends on market sentiment, the percentage of tokens unlocked, and the project’s fundamentals. 4. Which token unlock is most significant this week? The PARTI token unlock on September 25th is particularly significant, releasing 180 million tokens, which constitutes 78.44% of its current circulating supply, potentially leading to substantial market movement for PARTI. 5. How can investors prepare for upcoming token unlocks? Investors should research the specific project’s fundamentals, monitor the unlock percentage relative to circulating supply, watch trading volume, and apply sound risk management strategies. 6. Do all token unlocks lead to price drops? Not necessarily. While common, strong market demand, positive project news, or effective strategies by token holders can mitigate negative price impacts. Sometimes, unlocks are already priced in by the market. Did you find this analysis of token unlocks helpful?

This stability in lending rates offers a fascinating lens through which to view the global economic landscape, especially for those tracking the dynamic cryptocurrency space. What’s the Latest on China Interest Rates? The People’s Bank of China confirmed it is holding its Loan Prime Rate (LPR) steady. This rate acts as the country’s de facto benchmark lending rate, influencing everything from mortgages to business loans across the nation. The one-year LPR remains at 3%. The five-year LPR, which is crucial for mortgage pricing, stays at 3.5%. This decision means that borrowing costs in China are not changing for now. It signals a cautious approach from the PBoC, prioritizing stability in a period of ongoing economic adjustments. Why Are China Interest Rates Holding Firm? Many analysts had anticipated this decision, given China’s current economic priorities. The central bank is navigating a complex environment, balancing growth targets with efforts to manage debt and stabilize key sectors, particularly the property market. By keeping China interest rates unchanged, the PBoC aims to: Support Economic Stability: Avoid adding new uncertainties to an economy that is still recovering and recalibrating. Manage Inflation Expectations: Prevent potential inflationary pressures or deflationary spirals that could arise from sudden rate changes. Provide Policy Flexibility: Preserve room for future policy adjustments should economic conditions shift significantly. This approach suggests a desire for controlled and sustainable growth rather than aggressive stimulus measures that might introduce new risks. How Do Stable China Interest Rates Impact Global Markets? China’s economy is a significant player on the global stage, and its financial policies inevitably ripple outwards. When China interest rates remain stable, it sends a clear message to international investors and other central banks. A steady rate environment in China can contribute to: Predictability: Global markets often appreciate predictability, which can reduce volatility in currency markets and commodity prices. Investor Confidence: For those investing in Chinese assets, stable rates suggest a more predictable economic outlook, potentially encouraging foreign direct investment. Influence on Other Economies: As a major trading partner, China’s economic health and policy decisions have an indirect impact on global demand and supply chains. However, some might argue that a lack of further easing could limit the upside potential for global growth if China’s domestic demand remains subdued. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Investors? While the PBoC’s decision on China interest rates does not directly affect cryptocurrency markets, there are indirect implications worth considering. Global financial stability, or the lack thereof, often influences investor sentiment towards riskier assets like digital currencies. Here are some points for crypto investors to ponder: Risk Appetite: A stable Chinese economy might reduce overall global market volatility, potentially leading to a more measured approach to risk assets. Broader Economic Health: China’s economic trajectory affects global demand, which can indirectly influence the liquidity and capital flows within the broader financial ecosystem that includes crypto. Comparison to Western Policies: As Western central banks continue to grapple with inflation and potential rate hikes, China’s steady stance offers a contrasting policy narrative that could be relevant for diversified portfolios. It is always wise for crypto investors to monitor macroeconomic signals, as they often provide context for market movements, even if the connection isn’t always immediate or direct. The People’s Bank of China’s decision to hold its benchmark interest rates steady is a clear signal of its commitment to economic stability and a measured approach to monetary policy. This move, while seemingly domestic, carries crucial implications for global financial markets and offers a stable backdrop that cryptocurrency investors should observe. As the world continues to navigate complex economic currents, China’s steady hand on its interest rates will undoubtedly remain a key factor in the global financial narrative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) in China? The LPR is China’s market-based reference rate for new bank loans and outstanding floating-rate loans. It is published monthly by the PBoC and serves as the benchmark for lending across the country. Why did the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) keep rates steady? The PBoC likely maintained stable China interest rates to support overall economic stability, manage inflation, and preserve policy flexibility amid ongoing domestic and global economic uncertainties. How do China’s interest rates affect global trade? Stable China interest rates can lead to a more predictable economic environment in China, which can positively impact global trade by providing stability for exporters and importers dealing with Chinese businesses. Will stable China interest rates impact the property market? By keeping the five-year LPR steady, which influences mortgage rates, the PBoC aims to provide stability to the property market without either stimulating excessive borrowing or causing further distress. What should cryptocurrency investors watch for next? Cryptocurrency investors should continue to monitor global macroeconomic indicators, including inflation data, central bank policies from major economies, and geopolitical developments, as these factors can influence overall market sentiment and risk appetite.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. On the streets of Bolivia, an advertisement for a bright green BYD Dolphin Mini is plastered across a billboard. The irony is hard to miss: a Chinese electric vehicle, the symbol of Beijing’s export strength in the world's emerging markets, is moving off lots in a BRICS country, but it is paid for in USDT – which is backed by the very treasuries China is dumping. China has spent years pushing de-dollarization in Latin America , framing it as South–South solidarity and economic independence from Washington. Bolivia now settles about 10% of its trade in yuan , Brazil has renewed a RMB 190 billion ($26 billion) swap line , and Argentina taps renminbi liquidity to avoid default . Yet the reality is different for retail consumers. China still wins on exports, but loses influence over the unit of account. This creates a strange situation where Chinese goods fuel dollar (USDT) demand rather than RMB demand. For merchants, dealers, and consumers in inflation-strapped or capital-controlled economies, USDT offers stability, speed, and liquidity that the yuan still cannot match. After all, the yuan, like many of the world's currencies, isn't designed to be used offshore . It's antithetical to the People's Bank of China's monetary policy. China’s exports dominate Latin American markets, soy, lithium, buses, and EVs, but as the advertisement shows, it fuels demand for USDT, not RMB. Despite the talk of de-dollarization, Tether’s crypto-dollar is conquering emerging markets, while Beijing’s central bank digital currency pilots remain confined at home. Stablecoins deliver what CBDCs and yuan swap lines cannot: speed, liquidity, and global trust. The longer this persists, the harder it will be for China to match trade power with monetary influence. De-dollarization in Latin America is happening, but not in the way Beijing intended. Instead of RMB zones of settlement, the region is seeing the rise of crypto-dollar rails: a grassroots re-dollarization that entrenches the greenback’s dominance under a new digital form. It's tough to shake the dollar as the world's reserve currency. For all the talk of CBDCs or BRICS currency, the projects have failed to launch: trade on the ground still runs through USDT, the digital dollar that dominates emerging markets. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin is trading above $114.5K. The price of BTC is relatively flat, with a slight downward trend. on the day. Key drivers include renewed interest from institutional investors, rate cut expectations in the U.S., and general macro sentiment toward risk assets. Slight resistance around the ~$115,000‑$117,000 level appears to be holding, according to the CoinDesk Market Insights bot. ETH: ETH is trading at $4400. Like BTC, ETH is also slightly soft in intraday trading. Some of the pressure comes from weak momentum and trying to reclaim and hold previous highs. ETF inflow ended the week in the green with $556M. Gold: Gold continues to trade near record highs, driven by weakening of the U.S. dollar, expectations for Fed rate cuts, high central bank demand, and inflation concerns. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 1.28%, after China held its loan prime rates steady and investors tracked Wall Street’s gains.

In a post, BALE stated , “What I am hearing is crazy. The XRP integration is going to be generational wealth explosion. Lock in.” His words highlight an optimistic outlook on the asset’s role in shaping financial opportunities, with an emphasis on its possible transformative impact. The phrase “lock in” underlines his conviction that participants in the digital asset space should pay attention to what he perceives as an imminent shift. What I am hearing is crazy. The XRP integration is going to be generational wealth explosion. Lock in — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 20, 2025 Community Reactions to the Claim The post drew immediate attention from other members of the crypto community, many of whom shared their views in the comment section. LifeOfFinance echoed BALE’s sentiment, writing, “Absolutely agree! XRP will become the rails the new financial system will run on.” This statement points toward the widely held belief among some investors that XRP has the potential to serve as a core infrastructure layer in future financial systems. The emphasis on it becoming “the rails” reflects the idea that XRP could underpin the transfer of value across institutions and borders. Not all responses, however, aligned with BALE’s optimism. GMan007 expressed skepticism, replying , “Unfortunately, I’ve been hearing that for years.” Similarly, Brian Gibbins questioned the reliability of such forecasts. Contrasting Views on XRP’s Prospects The differing reactions highlight the divide within the XRP community . BALE and those who support his statement argue that XRP’s integration into financial systems has the potential to generate substantial long-term returns. This perspective is rooted in the belief that XRP’s efficiency and scalability position it well for adoption in international payment systems and other financial infrastructures. However, the skepticism expressed by GMan007 and Brian Gibbins demonstrates hesitation to approve such forecasts without concrete evidence or specific timelines.

52078438,https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-news-ada-at-crossroads-next-few-weeks-are-crucial/,1758506400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52078438.jpeg,"Cardano News: ADA at Crossroads, Next Few Weeks Are Crucial",https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/cardano-news-ada-at-crossroads-next-few-weeks-are-crucial/,"Cardano is in a very critical stage, with the price action attracting the attention of analysts who observe similarities with previous bull cycles. ADA indicated the start of a much bigger rally after three months of consistent action in an ascending parallel channel. The question posed by the traders is whether it is the initial period of a long bull run or a temporary boom. Meanwhile, Cardano whales are mostly paying attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which analysts estimate is likely to bring up 18,000% ROI over the next 12 months . As ADA is about to take its next big leap, a lot of investors are also moving to new tokens where explosive growth opportunities are in play on top of early-entry benefits. ADA Mirrors Historical Patterns Cryptocurrency analyst Ali recently published data comparing the current price setup of Cardano to the most recent significant cycle, and this might indicate that history is repeating. According to the analysis, ADA is consolidating in a manner likened to a calm buildup before a parabolic surge. The previous instance of such a structure resulted in one of the best rallies of Cardano, and traders are now hoping that it will repeat itself. At present, ADA is trading around $0.86, which is 3.3% lower on the day, yet remains very solid within its developed parallel range. This range has been a stable one, starting in mid-2025, and has become an essential technical base. More so, the trend is up even though the recent decline was a pullback, and technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI) are in the neutral zone, which means that there is still potential for another positive leg. Technical Levels to Watch In addition, comparison of the weekly charts shows the possible trend followed by ADA. During its final cycle, Cardano shifted sideways before it exploded and finally caught the attention of the broader market. The same trend is currently developing, and assuming it continues, analysts believe that ADA would shoot up decisively above $1.30 in the near future. ADA is still oscillating on the daily chart between support and resistance lines of the channel. To the bullish traders, a breakout above $1 would be the best affirmation that momentum is turning in favor of another rally. On the negative side, it is important to have support of $0.80 to sustain the bullish case. A dip below this level may welcome selling pressure and nullify the cycle-repetition theory. A New Breakout Altcoin Enters the Conversation Even as ADA advances through this critical juncture, there are other opportunities that big players are not overlooking, other than Cardano. MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being discussed as one of the most hyped pre-sales in the crypto-sphere, and analysts predict the company will yield an ROI of 18,000% within a year . The initial rounds are already sold out in record time, and it can be seen that the demand is very high, while the supply is very low, which frequently leads to an exponential increase. The combination of community-oriented growth and strategic growth is the key feature of MAGACOIN FINANCE. These milestones build a stronger ecosystem, which forms the groundwork to be adopted over the long term and, at the same time, rewards first movers. To Cardano whales who have been used to high-risk and high-reward plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a new chance to get ahead of large-scale exchange listings, a step where huge price surges are frequently seen. Meanwhile, the project is compared to the dawn of meme giants such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, but with the added benefit of having the ability to be audited and grow in utility. Investors are not looking at this as a speculation but as the proper timing to join an ongoing movement that would alter the performance of altcoins during the next cycle. Cardano’s Role in the Market On top of the short-term price action, Cardano has been enhancing itself as one of the most influential blockchain ecosystems. Its scalability, security, and academic research have made it stand out among most of the other altcoins. The model of development of ADA may contribute to maintaining its value as the industry advances to more about real-life utility. Nevertheless, traders are aware that the price tends to be behind fundamentals. Market cycles are likely to determine when even strong projects find a penetration of attention from investors. This is the reason why the present structure of ADA is also closely followed by many. Should it then escalate into a parabolic run, history tells us that sentiment and liquidity will help in compounding gains at a faster rate. Conclusion Cardano is at a crossroads. Having the present structure similar to the past periods before breakouts, analysts assume that the upcoming weeks would be a defining moment on whether ADA would take off a blistering breakout or pause on the resistance. The near-term narrative will be determined by critical levels of $0.80 to the downside and $1.00 to the upside. Meanwhile, big players are placing hedges by seeking new prospects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , with predictions of 18,000% rates of returns catching their eye. Such a two-way process demonstrates the development of the crypto market: the old players, such as Cardano, are still vital, but new tokens are getting more attention due to whales seeking to gain excessive profits. Until then, ADA traders are holding thumbs, although they are fully aware that they only have a small window to confirm. The next few weeks can determine whether Cardano solidifies its position in the coming bull run or whether emerging rivals such as MAGACOIN FINANCE take over.

At BlackRock, PGIM, and Morgan Stanley, bond managers are still buying mid-curve Treasuries even as the Federal Reserve’s plan gets harder to read. They’re betting on the same trade that worked all year—sticking to bonds maturing in about five years. These are the bonds giving solid returns while being less sensitive to sudden shifts in interest rates. The Fed’s first rate cut in nine months came on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell said it was “a risk management cut,” adding that more changes would depend on what happens in upcoming meetings. This message caused yields to go up across the board and killed hopes for a faster pace of cuts. Some traders who were hoping for a bigger move started closing positions. But many others stayed right where they were. The ones in the middle of the curve didn’t move at all. BlackRock and PGIM target the belly for carry and cushion BlackRock’s deputy chief investment officer for global fixed income, Russell Brownback, said the focus is still on the five-year part of the curve. “The belly is the sweet spot,” he said. It’s been one of the best performers this year. A Bloomberg index tracking 5- to 7-year Treasuries shows a return of 7%, better than the broader bond market’s 5.4% gain. Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income, explained why. These mid-curve Treasuries pay enough interest to make money even when using borrowed funds. That’s called positive carry. And as the bonds get closer to maturity, their value goes up. “Positive carry and roll: it’s the bond investor’s dream,” he said. The Fed’s decision came as signs of economic weakness kept building. Job growth slowed down in recent months, and companies are still reacting to President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war. At the same time, his tariff increases risk pushing prices even higher. Inflation is already stuck above the Fed’s 2% target. That’s why Powell said future decisions would be made “meeting by meeting.” Nothing is guaranteed anymore, and everyone knows it. Mid-curve bonds hold ground while short bets unwind Christian Hoffmann, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, said the market doesn’t know how to read the Fed anymore. “It’s increasingly difficult to draw a straight line from the evolution of the data to the Fed’s reaction,” he said . He expects lower rates long term, but he’s also prepared for more confusion in the near term. The Fed’s own projections show possible quarter-point cuts over the next two meetings. But after that, only tiny changes are expected in 2026 and 2027. Traders in the futures market are betting on more. The disconnect is already affecting trades. At Natixis, the strategy team shut down their long two-year Treasuries position right after Powell’s press conference. Andrew Szczurowski, who runs the $12 billion Eaton Vance Strategic Income Fund at Morgan Stanley, thinks the market is closer to reality than the Fed’s guesses. His fund returned 9.5% this year, beating 98% of peers. He believes the Fed will try to protect jobs by keeping rates low. That would help Treasuries rise further. “You missed some of the rally, but there’s still upside,” he told his clients. “It’s a bond picker’s market.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A substantial ETH deposit to Binance , valued at approximately $72.8 million, has caught the attention of analysts and investors alike. This massive transfer, linked to Trend Research, a subsidiary of the prominent LD Capital, immediately sparked discussions about its potential impact on Ethereum’s price and the broader crypto market. What Exactly Happened with the ETH Deposit to Binance? Just moments ago, on-chain analyst ai_9684xtpa reported a notable transaction. An address, widely believed to belong to Trend Research, executed a strategic move. This entity withdrew a substantial 16,800 ETH from AAVE, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. Following this withdrawal, the entire amount was swiftly transferred and deposited to Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The total value of this ETH deposit to Binance stands at an impressive $72.88 million. Such large-scale deposits to exchanges are often seen as a critical indicator by market observers. They typically precede selling activity, suggesting that the holder might be preparing to offload their assets onto the open market. This makes the recent ETH deposit to Binance a particularly important event for anyone tracking Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Why Does This Specific ETH Deposit Matter to the Market? When a significant amount of a cryptocurrency like Ethereum moves to an exchange, it creates a supply increase on that platform. If the intent behind such a move is indeed to sell, this added supply could exert downward pressure on the asset’s price. Investors and traders closely monitor these on-chain metrics for insights into the intentions of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Potential Selling Pressure: A large ETH deposit to Binance suggests an increased likelihood of a sell-off, which could impact ETH’s price. Market Sentiment: Such moves can influence investor sentiment, potentially leading to increased caution or even panic selling among smaller holders. Liquidity Impact: While Binance has immense liquidity, a deposit of this magnitude can still be significant, especially if executed rapidly. Who Are Trend Research and LD Capital? Understanding the entities behind this transaction adds crucial context. Trend Research is identified as a subsidiary of LD Capital, a well-known investment firm in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. LD Capital has a history of investing in various projects and protocols, often playing a role in market dynamics through their strategic holdings and movements. Their involvement suggests a sophisticated and calculated decision. This isn’t a random individual making a small transfer; it’s an institutional-level player making a substantial ETH deposit to Binance . This elevates the importance of the event, as such entities typically have a significant impact on market trends. What Are the Immediate Market Implications and What Should You Watch For? The immediate implication of this ETH deposit to Binance is heightened market vigilance. Traders are now keenly watching Ethereum’s price action for any signs of increased selling volume or price depreciation. While a deposit doesn’t guarantee a sale, it significantly raises the probability. Key aspects to monitor: ETH Price Movement: Observe if ETH experiences increased volatility or a downward trend in the coming hours or days. Binance Order Books: Look for large sell orders on Binance that could correspond to this deposit. Further On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on other large transfers or withdrawals that could either confirm or contradict the selling narrative. For investors, this serves as a reminder to stay informed about on-chain analytics. These tools provide transparency into market activities that can directly influence asset prices. Understanding these signals can help in making more informed trading and investment decisions. Conclusion: A Critical Signal for Ethereum’s Short-Term Future The ETH deposit to Binance by Trend Research represents a critical piece of on-chain data that demands attention. With $72.8 million in Ethereum now sitting on an exchange, the crypto community is on high alert for potential selling pressure. While the exact intentions remain to be seen, the market is undoubtedly bracing for possible volatility. Staying informed about such large-scale movements is essential for navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an ETH deposit to Binance typically mean? An ETH deposit to Binance, especially a large one, is commonly interpreted as a precursor to selling. Holders often move their assets to exchanges when they intend to convert them into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies, suggesting an increase in potential supply on the market. Q2: Who is Trend Research and LD Capital? Trend Research is a subsidiary of LD Capital, a prominent investment firm active in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. They are known for their strategic investments and market participation, making their movements significant indicators for market analysts. Q3: How might this $72.8M ETH deposit affect Ethereum’s price? A deposit of this magnitude could potentially increase selling pressure on Ethereum. If Trend Research decides to sell a significant portion of this ETH, it could lead to a temporary price dip due to increased supply on the exchange. However, the exact impact depends on market demand and the timing of any potential sales. Q4: Where can I track similar on-chain movements? You can track similar on-chain movements using various analytics platforms and tools that monitor blockchain transactions. On-chain analysts like ai_9684xtpa often share these insights on social media platforms or specialized crypto news sites. Q5: Is an ETH deposit to Binance always followed by selling? While an ETH deposit to Binance often precedes selling, it’s not a guaranteed outcome. Sometimes, large holders move assets to exchanges for other reasons, such as providing liquidity for derivatives trading, staking, or even consolidating funds. However, the default interpretation for such a large amount is usually preparation for selling. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Its integration onto Upbit, a true powerhouse in the Asian crypto market, brings several immediate and tangible benefits for traders: Increased Accessibility: Millions of new users, particularly within the vibrant South Korean market, will now gain direct and easy access to trade SUN. This significantly broadens the potential investor base. Enhanced Liquidity: Listings on major exchanges like Upbit invariably lead to deeper liquidity pools.

For existing SUN holders, this listing can potentially translate into increased trading volume and more efficient price discovery.

In a dramatic turn of events, a massive crypto futures liquidation worth an astounding $103 million unfolded across major exchanges in just one hour. This sudden market shock left many traders reeling and highlighted the significant risks involved in leveraged trading. Over the past 24 hours, the total liquidations surged to an astonishing $614 million, painting a clear picture of intense market pressure and rapid price swings. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? For those new to the derivatives market, understanding crypto futures liquidation is crucial. Essentially, it occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because the trader no longer has sufficient margin to cover potential losses. When the market moves against a highly leveraged position, and the margin falls below the required maintenance level, the exchange automatically liquidates the position to prevent further losses for the trader and the platform. It is a protective measure, albeit a painful one for the individual trader. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses in futures trading. Insufficient margin in a leveraged position triggers automatic closure. This mechanism is designed to prevent negative balances for both traders and exchanges. The Shocking Scale: $103 Million in Crypto Futures Liquidation The recent event, seeing $103 million in crypto futures liquidation in a mere 60 minutes, serves as a powerful example of how quickly market dynamics can shift. This single hour accounted for a significant portion of the total $614 million liquidated over 24 hours. Such rapid and large-scale liquidations are often triggered by sharp, unexpected price movements, leading to a cascade effect. As some positions are liquidated, it can add selling pressure, further driving prices down (or up, in the case of short liquidations), and triggering more liquidations. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘long/short squeeze’. The impact of such an event includes: Increased market volatility and price instability. Significant financial losses for individual traders who face forced closures. A test of market resilience and overall liquidity across exchanges. How Can Traders Mitigate Crypto Futures Liquidation Risks? Navigating the volatile world of crypto futures requires a robust risk management strategy to avoid becoming another statistic in a crypto futures liquidation event. While no strategy can guarantee complete protection, several practices can significantly reduce your exposure: Understand Leverage: Use leverage judiciously. Higher leverage means a higher risk of liquidation. Many experienced traders advise starting with lower leverage or even avoiding it entirely until fully comfortable with market mechanics. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These are vital tools that automatically close your position if the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting potential losses before a full liquidation occurs. Monitor Margin Levels: Always keep an eye on your margin health. Adding more collateral (margin) to your position can prevent liquidation if the market moves unfavorably. Diversify Your Portfolio: While futures trading is inherently risky, having a diversified portfolio beyond highly leveraged positions can provide a buffer against sudden market shocks. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors that can influence cryptocurrency prices. The recent $103 million crypto futures liquidation is a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. While the allure of amplified gains through futures trading is strong, the potential for rapid and substantial losses is equally significant. By understanding the mechanisms behind liquidations, practicing diligent risk management, and never trading more than you can afford to lose, traders can navigate these treacherous waters with greater confidence and potentially avoid the painful experience of forced closure. The market will always present opportunities, but prudence and preparation are your best allies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation is the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, preventing further losses. 2. What causes large-scale crypto futures liquidation events? These events are typically triggered by sharp, sudden price movements in the market, often exacerbated by high leverage and leading to a cascade effect where one liquidation triggers others. 3. How can I avoid liquidation in crypto futures trading? To minimize the risk of liquidation, use lower leverage, set stop-loss orders, actively monitor your margin levels, and consider adding more collateral if your position is under pressure. 4. Are crypto futures inherently risky? Yes, crypto futures trading is inherently risky due to the use of leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies further increases this risk. 5. What does a “liquidation cascade” mean? A liquidation cascade occurs when a large number of leveraged positions are liquidated in quick succession due to a significant price swing. This selling pressure can further drive the price in the adverse direction, triggering even more liquidations. Did this article help you understand the dynamics of crypto futures liquidation ?

If you’ve been following the digital asset space, you might have noticed some significant turbulence, especially for those holding ‘long’ positions. This sudden downturn saw Ethereum (ETH) leading the charge, impacting countless traders and highlighting the inherent volatility of perpetual futures markets. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Before diving into the specifics of this recent event, let’s quickly clarify what crypto liquidations actually mean. In the world of perpetual futures trading, liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange. This happens because their margin — the collateral they put up — falls below a certain level, usually due to adverse price movements against their bet. For instance, if you bet a crypto asset’s price would go up (a ‘long’ position) but it drops significantly, your position could be liquidated to prevent further losses. These forced closures are designed to protect both the exchange and other traders. However, they can also trigger a cascading effect, where one liquidation leads to another, exacerbating market downturns. The scale of liquidations often serves as a barometer for market sentiment and volatility, providing crucial insights into trader confidence. The Shocking Breakdown: ETH, BTC, and DOGE Take a Hit The recent wave of crypto liquidations was particularly brutal, totaling an astounding $277 million across the market. What made this event stand out was the overwhelming skew towards long positions, meaning traders betting on price increases were caught off guard. Let’s look at the numbers: Ethereum (ETH): The digital asset leading the charge in this downturn, ETH saw a massive $180 million in liquidations. A staggering 97.19% of these were long positions, indicating a strong bearish sentiment or unexpected price drop. Bitcoin (BTC): Not far behind, Bitcoin experienced $69.29 million in liquidations. Similar to ETH, the vast majority — 95.97% — were long positions, showcasing widespread pressure on bullish bets. Dogecoin (DOGE): The popular meme coin also felt the squeeze, with $28 million in liquidations. Long positions accounted for 96.67% of these, underscoring the broad market impact on those expecting an uptrend. These figures paint a clear picture: the market took an unexpected turn downwards, catching many optimistic traders off guard and resulting in substantial losses. Why Were Long Positions So Heavily Impacted by Crypto Liquidations? The overwhelming dominance of long liquidations in this $277 million event suggests a few key factors at play. Firstly, it points to a sudden and significant downward price movement across major cryptocurrencies. Traders who had leveraged positions anticipating a rise in prices found their collateral insufficient as prices plummeted, triggering automated liquidations. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as unexpected negative news, a broader market correction, or even large institutional sell-offs. Secondly, it highlights the inherent risks of leveraged trading. While leverage can amplify gains, it equally amplifies losses, making traders highly susceptible to rapid market shifts. The rapid succession of these forced closures can also create a ‘liquidation cascade,’ where each liquidation adds selling pressure, further driving down prices and triggering even more liquidations. This phenomenon can turn a moderate market dip into a sharper, more painful correction for those with leveraged long positions. The recent $277 million in crypto liquidations , heavily led by Ethereum, serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, especially in perpetual futures trading. The significant skew towards long positions underscores the risks associated with leveraged bets and the speed at which market sentiment can shift. While such events can be painful for individual traders, they are also a part of the market’s natural cycle, often flushing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable growth. For both seasoned investors and newcomers, understanding the mechanics of liquidations and managing risk effectively is paramount. The crypto market offers incredible opportunities, but it also demands respect for its unpredictable movements. Always conduct thorough research and consider the potential for rapid price swings. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Liquidations Q1: What is a crypto liquidation? A: A crypto liquidation occurs when an exchange forcibly closes a trader’s leveraged position because their collateral (margin) is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses due to adverse price movements. Q2: Why were long positions primarily affected in this event? A: Long positions are affected when the price of an asset drops significantly. Traders betting on price increases (longs) using leverage face liquidation when prices fall sharply, as their collateral can no longer support the position. Q3: What assets were most impacted by these liquidations? A: Ethereum (ETH) led the liquidations with $180 million, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) at $69.29 million, and Dogecoin (DOGE) with $28 million, all heavily skewed towards long positions. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from crypto liquidations? A: Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, avoiding over-exposure to a single asset, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts to withstand market volatility. Q5: Do crypto liquidations impact the overall market? A: Yes, large-scale crypto liquidations can increase selling pressure, leading to further price drops and heightened market volatility. They can also indicate a shift in market sentiment or a broader market correction. Did this article shed light on the recent market dynamics?

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news of a significant ETH whale deposit . An anonymous address recently moved a staggering 16,800 ETH, valued at approximately $72.88 million, to the Binance exchange. This massive transfer, reported by The Data Nerd, has immediately captured the attention of investors and analysts, sparking widespread speculation about its potential impact on the Ethereum market. Unpacking This Anonymous ETH Whale Deposit to Binance Roughly 45 minutes ago, an unknown whale address, identified as 0x900, completed a substantial transaction. This address transferred 16,800 Ethereum tokens, worth an estimated $72.88 million at the time, directly to Binance. Such large movements are rare and often signal significant shifts in market sentiment or strategy. What makes this particular ETH whale deposit even more intriguing is the reported financial context. According to analysis, if these assets were to be sold immediately, the whale could face an estimated loss of $1.46 million. This suggests a complex decision-making process behind the transfer, rather than a simple profit-taking move. The immediate question on everyone’s mind is: what prompted this move? Is it a prelude to selling, or is there a deeper, more strategic intention at play? Why Do ETH Whale Deposits Matter for the Market? Whales, in crypto terms, are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their actions can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. When a whale moves a large sum of assets, especially to an exchange, it often triggers a ripple effect. Supply and Demand: A large deposit to an exchange increases the potential selling supply, which can put downward pressure on prices if a sell-off occurs. Market Sentiment: Such moves can impact investor confidence, leading to either fear (if selling is anticipated) or optimism (if it’s a strategic repositioning). Liquidity: Exchange deposits increase liquidity for the asset, making it easier for large trades to be executed. Understanding the motivations behind an ETH whale deposit is crucial for predicting short-term market movements. What Are the Potential Outcomes of This ETH Whale Deposit? There are several scenarios that could unfold following this significant transfer to Binance. Each carries different implications for Ethereum’s price and the broader crypto market. Potential Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern is that the whale intends to sell their ETH. Given the reported $1.46 million estimated loss if sold at current prices, this might seem counterintuitive. However, whales sometimes sell to: Cut further losses in anticipation of a deeper market downturn. Rebalance their portfolio into other assets. Cover operational costs or liquidity needs. Strategic Repositioning: Alternatively, the ETH whale deposit might not be for selling at all. The funds could be moved to Binance for: Staking: To participate in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism, although direct exchange staking might not be the most capital-efficient route for such a large holder. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): To deploy assets into various DeFi protocols available on the exchange or through linked services. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large transactions are sometimes arranged off-exchange to minimize market impact, but moving to an exchange can be a precursor to such a deal if the buyer is also on the platform. The market will closely watch for any subsequent movements from this address to gain clarity. Navigating Market Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors For everyday investors, a major ETH whale deposit can feel unsettling. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Monitor on-chain data and reliable crypto news sources for updates on this specific whale’s activity. Avoid Panic Selling: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on a single large transaction. Look at the broader market trends and fundamental analysis of Ethereum. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance. Large whale moves are a reminder of crypto market volatility. Long-Term Perspective: For those with a long-term view on Ethereum, short-term whale activity might present buying opportunities if prices dip temporarily. This recent ETH whale deposit to Binance highlights the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the anonymous whale’s intentions remain unclear, such large movements serve as crucial indicators for market watchers. Whether it signals impending selling pressure or a strategic repositioning, investors should remain vigilant and base their decisions on comprehensive research rather than speculation. The crypto world continues to evolve, with every major transaction adding another layer to its fascinating narrative. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an ETH whale deposit? An ETH whale deposit refers to a large amount of Ethereum (ETH) being transferred by a major holder (a ‘whale’) to a cryptocurrency exchange. These transactions are significant because they can influence market liquidity and price action due to their sheer size. Q2: How much ETH was deposited to Binance in this incident? An anonymous whale address deposited 16,800 ETH, valued at approximately $72.88 million at the time of the transfer, to the Binance exchange. Q3: What does it mean if a whale deposits ETH to an exchange? Depositing ETH to an exchange typically means the whale intends to sell, trade, or use the funds within the exchange’s ecosystem (e.g., for staking, participating in DeFi, or OTC deals). It increases the potential supply available for trading on the platform. Q4: Could this ETH whale deposit lead to a price drop for Ethereum? It could. If the whale decides to sell all or a significant portion of their deposited ETH, it could create selling pressure and potentially lead to a short-term price dip for Ethereum. However, other factors also influence market prices, and the whale might have other intentions. Q5: How can I track whale movements? You can track whale movements using on-chain analytics platforms like The Data Nerd, Whale Alert, or Etherscan. These tools provide transparency into large transactions on the blockchain, helping investors understand potential market shifts.

A prominent market analyst suggests we might be entering its final stages, urging investors to adopt a more cautious stance. This shift in sentiment is a crucial signal for anyone navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Is the BTC Bull Run Really Fading? According to Rachel Lucas, a respected BTC market analyst, the bullish enthusiasm that characterized the beginning of the year is now subsiding. Her insights, as reported by The Block, indicate a noticeable shift in investor behavior. While the market hasn’t seen a dramatic crash, the once-unbridled optimism is giving way to a more measured approach. Lucas points out that short-term investors, in particular, appear increasingly anxious. This doesn’t necessarily mean a mass exodus, but rather a re-evaluation of risk and potential gains. It’s a natural evolution in any market cycle, where initial euphoria eventually matures into careful consideration. Understanding Investor Sentiment: Anxious Optimism in the BTC Bull Run Interestingly, Lucas concludes that the current sentiment isn’t outright fear. Instead, she describes it as ‘anxious optimism.’ This nuanced perspective is vital for understanding the market’s current state. The absence of a large-scale sell-off, despite rising caution, highlights this unique balance. What does anxious optimism look like in practice? Reduced Aggressive Buying: New capital inflows might slow down, as investors wait for clearer signals. Increased Profit-Taking: Traders may be more inclined to secure gains at minor price peaks. Heightened Volatility: Short-term price swings can become more pronounced as participants react to news and minor shifts. Holding, Not Chasing: Many long-term holders might retain their positions but refrain from adding significantly to them. This phase demands a thoughtful strategy, moving beyond the ‘buy everything’ mentality of earlier bull market stages. Navigating the Current BTC Bull Run Landscape with Caution For investors, understanding this cautious shift is paramount. It’s not about panicking, but about adapting. The challenges of a maturing market include increased scrutiny, potential for consolidation, and the need for more sophisticated risk management. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Is your portfolio still aligned with your comfort level for potential drawdowns? Consider Diversification: Spreading investments across different assets can mitigate risk if one sector experiences a downturn. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market indicators, macroeconomic trends, and expert analyses. Secure Profits Strategically: Taking some profits off the table can help protect your capital and provide dry powder for future opportunities. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Resist the urge to chase pumps, especially if the market is showing signs of caution. Adopting a disciplined approach can help protect your investments during this transitional period. What Comes After the BTC Bull Run Peak? If the current BTC bull run is indeed nearing its peak, what might follow? Historically, bull markets are often followed by periods of consolidation, healthy corrections, or even sideways trading. These phases are natural and can offer new entry points for long-term investors. It is important to differentiate between a market correction and a full-blown bear market. A correction typically involves a 10-20% drop, while a bear market signifies a more prolonged and significant decline. Patience becomes a virtue during these times, allowing the market to find its new equilibrium. Institutional adoption and broader regulatory clarity could also play a significant role in shaping the next phase of Bitcoin’s journey. In conclusion, while the euphoric highs of the early BTC bull run may be behind us, the market is not necessarily heading for a cliff. Analyst Rachel Lucas’s assessment of ‘anxious optimism’ paints a picture of a maturing market that demands a more strategic, cautious, and informed approach from investors. By understanding these dynamics and implementing prudent strategies, you can navigate the evolving cryptocurrency landscape with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘BTC bull run nearing its end’ truly mean? A1: It suggests that the period of rapid, sustained price increases for Bitcoin is slowing down. It doesn’t necessarily mean a crash, but rather a shift to more cautious trading, potential consolidation, or even minor corrections. Q2: Who is Rachel Lucas, and why is her analysis important? A2: Rachel Lucas is a BTC market analyst whose insights are reported by The Block. Her analysis is important because it offers a professional perspective on market sentiment, helping investors understand current trends and potential shifts. Q3: What is ‘anxious optimism’ in the context of the crypto market? A3: Anxious optimism describes a state where investors are cautious and perhaps nervous about the market’s future, but they are not in a state of panic or outright fear. They are still optimistic about long-term potential but are wary of short-term risks. Q4: Should I sell all my Bitcoin if the bull run is ending? A4: Not necessarily. The decision to buy or sell depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. An ending bull run often signals a need for caution and strategic re-evaluation, not necessarily an immediate sell-off. Q5: How can I prepare my portfolio for a potential market shift? A5: Consider re-evaluating your risk exposure, diversifying your investments, taking strategic profits, staying informed about market trends, and avoiding impulsive decisions based on fear or greed.

While Bitcoin remains the dominant store of value, Ethereum’s ETF flows and whale accumulation patterns are giving analysts reason to predict further upside. Alongside this, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a breakout altcoin being mentioned in the same conversations as ETH and SOL. Ethereum Sees Significant ETF Flows Recent inflow data shows that while some reports referenced Ethereum ETF inflows outpacing Bitcoin by $652 million, the verified numbers tell a more balanced story. On August 27, ETH ETFs brought in $307 million compared to Bitcoin’s $81 million, a lead of about $226 million in favor of Ethereum. By September 12, the picture flipped, with Bitcoin ETFs adding $642 million versus Ethereum’s $405 million. This back-and-forth illustrates the growing tug of war between BTC and ETH for institutional dominance. Ethereum is currently trading near $4,480 , far above the outdated ranges that once placed it in the $2,000s. The market has established support in the $4,400–$4,500 zone , with resistance forming around $4,600–$4,800 . Technical indicators continue to show strength, especially as institutional investors use regulated ETFs to gain exposure. Combined with Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling adoption, growing DeFi activity, and broader smart contract utility, the foundation for continued growth is strong. Rising Altcoin Opportunity Beyond ETH itself, investors are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-potential altcoin that complements Ethereum’s growth story. Built on a Hashex-audited smart contract and capped at a fixed 170 billion supply , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a scarcity-driven project with strong community momentum. Wallet activity and repeat investment patterns indicate rising trust among early adopters. For investors looking to balance exposure, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents an altcoin that can capture the same kind of early-stage breakout potential ETH once did. With its transparent structure, strong community, and scarcity model, it is being positioned as a strategic companion to Layer-1 giants like Ethereum and Solana. ETF Buzz and Market Sentiment ETF inflows remain one of the biggest catalysts in crypto. While Bitcoin often leads in raw capital allocation, Ethereum’s ability to attract outsized inflows on key days shows there is institutional appetite for diversification beyond BTC. Analysts believe this ETF-driven access will provide long-term liquidity, stability, and renewed investor confidence. In this environment, Ethereum’s $7K forecast continues to hold weight, supported not just by speculation but by tangible capital movement. Conclusion Ethereum has proven resilient, with ETF inflows that sometimes outpace Bitcoin’s and a strong foundation of Layer-2 adoption, whale accumulation, and smart contract demand. Analysts remain bullish on the $7,000 ETH target , particularly if institutional flows continue to expand. Alongside Ethereum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling altcoin for diversification, offering scarcity, audited security, and community-driven momentum.With its unique ecosystem, and strong community adoption, it is being positioned as an early-stage opportunity for investors who want exposure beyond the Layer-1 giants. Together, Ethereum’s institutional surge and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s scarcity-driven growth are shaping the narrative for 2025.

This massive acquisition of 10,000 Ethereum (ETH), valued at an impressive $43.65 million, signals robust confidence in the asset’s future. Such substantial movements by large investors, often dubbed ‘whales,’ frequently capture the market’s attention, hinting at potential shifts or confirmations of prevailing trends. What’s Driving This Massive ETH Whale Purchase? According to reports from AmberCN, this recent ETH whale purchase involved the transfer of $43.65 million in USDC to Wintermute, a prominent crypto market maker, followed by the withdrawal of 10,000 ETH. This isn’t an isolated incident for this particular address; just two days prior, the same anonymous investor accumulated an even larger sum of 16,569 ETH, totaling $74.29 million. This pattern of accumulation suggests a deliberate strategy. It could indicate a long-term conviction in Ethereum’s ecosystem, anticipating future price appreciation. Furthermore, such consistent buying by a single large entity often points towards institutional interest or a high-net-worth individual with a sophisticated investment thesis. Why Do Large ETH Whale Purchases Captivate the Market? When an anonymous entity makes a significant ETH whale purchase , it sends ripples across the market. These large-scale transactions are often interpreted as strong signals of confidence, particularly when they involve a major asset like Ethereum. Whales, by virtue of their capital, have the potential to influence market dynamics and sentiment. Here’s why these purchases matter: Increased Scarcity: Each large purchase removes ETH from the active circulating supply, potentially contributing to increased scarcity. Market Sentiment: Whale activity can act as a barometer for market sentiment, often signaling a bullish outlook to other investors. Price Impact: Sustained buying pressure from whales can contribute to upward price movements, especially if followed by other investors. Understanding the Anatomy of an Anonymous ETH Whale In the crypto lexicon, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their transactions, like this recent ETH whale purchase , are large enough to potentially move markets. The anonymity often associated with these addresses stems from the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. While the identity of this specific whale remains unknown, the consistent accumulation points to a strategic player. Institutions often utilize various methods to execute large orders without causing immediate market disruption, and working with market makers like Wintermute is a common practice for such large-volume trades. This allows them to acquire significant positions efficiently and discreetly. Decoding the Future: What This ETH Whale Purchase Suggests for Ethereum This substantial ETH whale purchase underscores a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a myriad of decentralized applications (dApps). The ongoing upgrades, particularly the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent updates), aim to enhance its scalability, security, and sustainability. Such large investments suggest that sophisticated players are betting on Ethereum’s continued dominance and evolution. They likely see the fundamental strengths of the network, its vibrant developer community, and its potential for widespread adoption as key drivers for future growth. The confidence shown by this whale could encourage other institutional and retail investors to consider or expand their ETH holdings. Navigating the Waves: Investor Insights from a Major ETH Whale Purchase While a significant ETH whale purchase can be exciting, it’s crucial for individual investors to approach such news with a balanced perspective. Whale movements offer insights into market sentiment but should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. It is essential to conduct your own thorough research and understand the risks involved in cryptocurrency investments. Consider Ethereum’s fundamentals, its technological roadmap, and broader market conditions. Diversifying your portfolio and investing only what you can afford to lose are foundational principles. Observing whale activity can be informative, but relying solely on it can lead to impulsive decisions. Focus on a long-term strategy rather than short-term reactions to large transactions. The recent astonishing ETH whale purchase of 10,000 ETH for $43.7 million highlights continued strong interest and conviction in Ethereum’s future. This significant move, following an earlier substantial acquisition by the same anonymous address, suggests a strategic accumulation by a major player. While the identity of this whale remains private, their actions send a clear signal of confidence in Ethereum’s enduring value and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy. For investors, it serves as a reminder of the market’s dynamic nature and the importance of independent research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ETH whale purchase? An ETH whale purchase refers to a very large acquisition of Ethereum (ETH) by a single individual or institution, often involving millions of dollars worth of the cryptocurrency. These transactions are significant enough to potentially influence market sentiment or price. Why are large crypto purchases often made anonymously? While blockchain transactions are public, the identities behind the wallet addresses are typically pseudonymous. Large investors, whether individuals or institutions, often prefer anonymity to avoid public scrutiny, prevent front-running, or maintain strategic discretion regarding their investment positions. How do whale purchases affect the cryptocurrency market? Whale purchases can affect the market in several ways. They can signal strong confidence in an asset, potentially inspiring other investors to buy. Large buying pressure can also reduce the circulating supply, which, if sustained, can contribute to price appreciation. Conversely, large sell-offs by whales can trigger price declines. Should I invest based solely on whale activity? No, it is generally not advisable to base investment decisions solely on whale activity. While whale movements can offer insights, they are just one data point. Individual investors should always conduct their own research, understand market fundamentals, assess risks, and align investments with their personal financial goals. What is Wintermute?

DXY vs BTC Last week, the Federal Reserve (Fed) delivered its first interest rate rate cut since December, while signaling more easing in the coming months. Yet, despite this dovish move, the dollar index (DXY), which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, finished the week with a dragonfly doji on the weekly chart – a classic bullish reversal signal suggesting a USD rally ahead. The dragonfly doji gets its name from its distinctive “T” shape, which resembles the delicate wings of a dragonfly or the blade of a bamboo-copter toy. This pattern forms when the open, high, and close prices are nearly identical, accompanied by a long lower shadow that reflects a sharp price decline quickly reversed by buying pressure. The DXY initially fell on the news of the Fed rate cut, briefly dipping below the July low of 96.37, only to bounce back and end the week largely unchanged at 97.65, supported by resilience in U.S. Treasury yields. The appearance of the dragonfly doji after a notable downtrend and at critical support, as in DXY's case, suggests an impending bullish shift in the market trend. Traditionally, dollar strength corresponds with weakness in dollar-denominated and broader risk assets, setting an interesting stage for the week ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) mirrored this theme in the week ended Sept. 21, forming an indecisive Doji candle at the critical resistance marked by the trendline from 2017 and 2021 bull market peaks. Given that this Doji appeared at such a significant long-term trendline, it leans more bearish, signaling hesitation among bulls to lead the price action and renewed selling pressure from the key hurdle. On the daily chart, BTC are teasing a move below the Ichimoku cloud, with the trendline drawn from Sept. 1 lows breached, implying potential downside risk. The first line of support is seen at $114,473, the 50-day simple moving average, followed by Sept. 1 lows near $107,300. The past week's high of $118,000 needs to be overcome to weaken the bearish case. Ether range breakdown Ether (ETH) faces its own technical dilemma; it hovers below the lower end of the contracting triangle pattern on the daily chart, suggesting renewed seller dominance and potential for deeper losses. The breakdown has put focus on the Aug. 20 low of $4,062 followed by the psychological support of $4,000. The 24-hour high of $4,458 is the level to beat for the bulls. XRP's MACD flips bearish Meanwhile, XRP presents a frustrating picture for bulls. Despite the recent debut of an XRP ETF in the U.S. on Thursday, the MACD indicator has crossed bearish on the weekly chart, indicating a renewed downside bias. Price indicates that XRP is slipping back to the upper boundary of a descending triangle on the daily chart. Although a tentative breakout occurred last week, it failed to ignite a sustained rally, leaving traders cautious. Focus on the Fed speak and PCE This week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and nine other officials are scheduled to speak, with markets likely to closely watch the same for cues on the interest rate trajectory. While the Fed cut rates last week, signalling more easing ahead, Powell threw cold water over optimism by stressing a data-dependent stance. President Donald Trump appointee Stephen Miran will also speak of his independence as a policymaker, having dissented in favor of an outsized 50 basis point rate cut last week. On Friday, the U.S. core PCE index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, is scheduled to be released. According to Amberdata, the data is expected to show that inflation rose 2.7% year-on-year, with core jumping 2.9% in August, marking a slight uptick from the previous month.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Dollar index|XRP|ETH|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-22 04:04:37

News Background • First U.S.-listed XRP ETF launched September 21, generating $37.7 million in day-one volume — the largest ETF debut of 2025. • Federal Reserve policy easing remains in focus, with markets pricing near-certain September rate cuts that typically support digital assets. • Analysts warn of structural consolidation despite ETF momentum, with resistance persisting near $3.00.

The Ronin Network, a prominent EVM-based blockchain, has announced a significant financial maneuver: a Ronin RON buyback totaling $4.6 million. This strategic decision by the Ronin Foundation is poised to make waves, demonstrating a clear commitment to its native token and the broader ecosystem it supports. What Exactly is the Ronin RON Buyback Plan? The core of this initiative involves the Ronin Foundation converting its entire holdings of Ethereum (ETH) and USD Coin (USDC) into RON tokens. This substantial exchange, valued at $4.6 million, is not a one-time event but will unfold over a month-long period, commencing on September 29th. It’s a calculated move designed to reinforce the network’s foundation. A token buyback is a common practice in traditional markets and is gaining traction in the crypto space. Essentially, the issuer repurchases its own tokens from the open market. For Ronin, this means the Foundation is actively reducing the circulating supply of RON by acquiring tokens with other assets it holds. Why is a RON Buyback So Significant for the Ecosystem? A well-executed Ronin RON buyback carries several profound implications for the network and its community. It’s more than just a transaction; it’s a statement of confidence and a mechanism for value creation. Boosting Token Value: By reducing the number of RON tokens in circulation, the buyback can create scarcity, which often leads to increased demand and potential price appreciation. It’s a direct investment in the token’s long-term health. Enhancing Investor Confidence: When the Ronin Foundation actively invests in its own token, it signals strong belief in the project’s future. This can attract new investors and reassure existing holders of the network’s stability and growth potential. Improving Liquidity: A buyback can help stabilize market prices and improve liquidity for RON, making it easier for users to trade the token without significant price slippage. Ronin is the backbone for popular play-to-earn games like Axie Infinity. Therefore, any move that strengthens RON ultimately benefits the entire gaming ecosystem built upon it, from developers to players. Ronin’s Strategic Vision: Beyond the RON Buyback This Ronin RON buyback isn’t an isolated event; it aligns perfectly with Ronin’s broader strategic vision for the play-to-earn space. As an EVM-based blockchain specifically optimized for gaming, Ronin aims to provide a seamless and scalable experience for millions of players. The Foundation’s commitment goes beyond financial maneuvers. They are continuously working on: Infrastructure Development: Enhancing the blockchain’s performance and security to support a growing number of games and users. Community Engagement: Fostering a vibrant and active community of players, developers, and token holders. Ecosystem Expansion: Attracting new game studios and projects to build on the Ronin network, diversifying its offerings. The buyback acts as a powerful catalyst, providing a stable economic environment for these developments to flourish. Potential Impact and Market Reaction to the Ronin RON Buyback Market reactions to a significant event like the Ronin RON buyback can be multifaceted. Typically, such announcements are met with optimism, as they suggest proactive management and a bullish outlook from the project’s core team. Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring the execution of the buyback and its subsequent effects on RON’s price and trading volume. While the immediate impact can be positive, the long-term success hinges on Ronin’s continued innovation and the overall health of the crypto market. This initiative could: Attract New Capital: Increased confidence may draw in fresh investments from institutional and retail players. Strengthen Partnerships: A robust token economy makes Ronin a more attractive partner for game developers and other blockchain projects. It’s an important step in Ronin’s journey to solidify its position as a leading blockchain for gaming. The Ronin RON buyback of $4.6 million represents a pivotal and strategic move by the Ronin Foundation. It underscores their unwavering dedication to strengthening the RON token and, by extension, the entire play-to-earn ecosystem. By converting valuable assets into their native token, Ronin is not just making a financial play; they are investing in the future, fostering confidence, and laying a stronger foundation for the next generation of blockchain gaming. This initiative sets the stage for continued growth and innovation within the vibrant Ronin network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the RON Buyback What is Ronin (RON)? Ronin (RON) is an EVM-based blockchain specifically designed for play-to-earn games, most notably powering the popular Axie Infinity ecosystem. It serves as the infrastructure for digital asset transactions and game mechanics within its network. What is a token buyback in cryptocurrency? A token buyback is when a project or foundation repurchases its own native cryptocurrency tokens from the open market. This action typically aims to reduce the circulating supply, increase scarcity, and potentially boost the token’s value and investor confidence. Why is the Ronin Foundation conducting this RON buyback? The Ronin Foundation is conducting the $4.6 million RON buyback to demonstrate confidence in its native token, strengthen its value, and enhance the overall health and stability of the Ronin ecosystem. It’s a strategic investment in the future of the network. When will the Ronin RON buyback take place? The Ronin Foundation will commence swapping its ETH and USDC holdings for RON over a one-month period, starting on September 29th. What impact might the RON buyback have on RON’s price? While market conditions are always a factor, a buyback typically has a positive impact on a token’s price by reducing its circulating supply, which can lead to increased demand and price appreciation. It also signals strong conviction from the project team. Who benefits from this Ronin RON buyback? Token holders, the Ronin ecosystem, and potentially new investors benefit from the buyback. It aims to increase RON’s value, improve liquidity, and strengthen confidence in the network’s long-term viability, which supports all participants. Did you find this article insightful?

His new educational venture, Giggle Academy , recently made headlines by raising a staggering $1 million in donations within just 12 hours. What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that a significant 90% of these funds arrived in the form of memecoins, signaling a fascinating shift in philanthropic giving within the crypto space. What is Giggle Academy and Its Vision for Education? Giggle Academy is an ambitious educational project spearheaded by CZ, aiming to provide accessible learning opportunities. Launched with a clear mission, it seeks to empower individuals through knowledge, leveraging the decentralized spirit of the crypto community. CZ’s involvement brings a wealth of experience from the blockchain industry, lending credibility and a strategic vision to this innovative initiative. This project isn’t just about traditional education; it’s about building a future-proof learning platform. The rapid influx of donations underscores the community’s belief in its potential. The Astonishing Memecoin Phenomenon: 90% of Giggle Academy Donations Imagine raising a million dollars in less than half a day, with the vast majority coming from digital assets often seen as speculative or even whimsical. This is precisely what Giggle Academy achieved. The equivalent of $1 million flowed into the project’s coffers, with an impressive 90% consisting of various memecoins. This statistic is not merely a number; it reflects a growing trend where memecoin communities, known for their strong engagement and collective action, are directing their resources towards meaningful causes. It highlights a unique form of digital philanthropy. Why Memecoins? A New Era of Community-Driven Giving for Giggle Academy? The dominance of memecoins in Giggle Academy ‘s fundraising efforts raises an intriguing question: why these particular digital assets? Memecoin communities are often characterized by: Strong Collective Identity: Holders often share a common goal and sense of camaraderie. Viral Potential: Memecoins thrive on social media and community engagement, making fundraising efforts highly visible. Accessibility: Often low-priced, allowing many individuals to contribute, fostering broad participation rather than reliance on a few large donors. This shows a shift where digital communities can quickly mobilize significant capital for projects they believe in. Funding Future Growth: How Will Giggle Academy Utilize the Capital? CZ has been transparent about how the newly acquired funds will be used. The $1 million raised will primarily serve two critical purposes for Giggle Academy : Incentivizing Donors: This could involve recognition, exclusive access, or other benefits to encourage continued community support. Accelerating Service Growth: The capital will fuel development, expand offerings, and reach a wider audience. Crucially, CZ emphasized that these donations will NOT be used for employee salaries. He personally committed to covering salaries and server costs, demonstrating a deep personal investment in the project’s success and ensuring that donor funds directly impact the academy’s expansion. No Giggle Academy Token? Understanding the Strategic Choice In an ecosystem often driven by token launches, Giggle Academy stands out by explicitly stating it has no plans to issue its own token. This decision is significant: It avoids potential speculation and focus on financial gains, keeping the project’s core mission purely educational. It simplifies the operational structure, removing the complexities associated with tokenomics and regulatory compliance. It reinforces the idea that the project is a public good, sustained by donations and CZ’s personal commitment rather than a profit-driven model. This approach could foster greater trust and focus on long-term educational impact. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Philanthropy for Giggle Academy While the success of Giggle Academy ‘s fundraising is inspiring, crypto philanthropy comes with its own set of challenges and opportunities. The volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies, especially memecoins, means the fiat value of donations can fluctuate. However, the benefits are compelling: Global Reach: Donations can come from anywhere in the world, instantly. Transparency: Blockchain transactions offer a high degree of transparency regarding fund movements. Efficiency: Reduced intermediary fees compared to traditional fundraising. The model adopted by Giggle Academy could set a precedent for future non-profit initiatives looking to harness the power of decentralized finance and community spirit. Giggle Academy ‘s rapid fundraising success, predominantly through memecoin donations, marks a pivotal moment in both crypto philanthropy and online education. With CZ’s personal backing and a clear strategy for fund utilization, the project is poised for significant growth, demonstrating how community enthusiasm and innovative funding models can converge to create impactful educational opportunities. It’s a compelling story of how the digital world can contribute to real-world change. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Giggle Academy?

The warning comes as trade negotiations with Washington have stalled, leaving the future of Seoul’s economic prospects uncertain. The United States is pressuring South Korea to provide $350 billion in cash, an approach President Lee Jae-Myung compared to a neighbor demanding money at the door. Speaking to Reuters, Lee said the deal reflects President Donald Trump’s hardline style on tariffs. The verbal agreement, reached in July, would see Washington lower tariffs on South Korean exports in exchange for the massive investment. However, Lee warned that the U.S.’s insistence on cash transfers could destabilize Seoul’s economy. However, Lee cautioned that South Korea’s financial system would face serious instability if the dollars were provided without a swap-line agreement. He said that without safety measures, the country could again face conditions similar to the 1997 financial crisis, when it was forced to seek a massive bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Lee emphasised that the country won’t accept conditions that would surrender decisions on investments wholly to the U.S. He added that there should be guarantees of commercial practicability for the projects and safeguards to prevent South Korean companies from being exposed to unnecessary financial risk. Seoul pushes back in talks Talks with Washington have lingered for weeks since the two countries have different stands . Whereas the U.S. wants upfront commitments, Seoul seeks flexibility to control the flow of capital out of the country. Officials say such a dollar swap would help cushion the impact on the won, Korea’s currency, and keep its markets from destabilizing. South Korea also highlights that it does not have the same financial reserves as Japan, which struck a similar agreement with the U.S. in July. Unlike Tokyo, Seoul has no permanent swap line with Washington, and its foreign exchange reserves are smaller. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick argued that Seoul must take the deal or face tariffs, effectively repeating President Donald Trump’s longstanding line on trade talks. However, South Korean officials have said that the proposals so far offer no guarantee of a return on investment in the projects. Lee’s policy team has floated putting in “safeguards” to ensure only “commercially feasible projects will be funded.” However, Washington is said to have pushed back on these efforts and insisted that Trump should still have control over where the financing is sent. Tensions spill beyond trade The trade concerns are playing out amid other tensions in the broader U.S.–South Korea relationship. Earlier this month, one at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia detained over 300 South Korean workers. The reports of the workers in restraints set off fury in Seoul, where many cautioned that it would discourage future Korean investments in the United States. Lee, however, attempted to soften the fallout. He said he did not think the raid was deliberate, and praised Trump for later offering clemency to the workers. Nonetheless, he acknowledged that the incident had rattled public opinion back home. South Korea also faces mounting security challenges due to deepening military cooperation between China, Russia, and North Korea, which Lee described as a dangerous escalation. He warned that South Korea now stands at the sharp edge of a new geopolitical contest between authoritarian and democratic powers. Lee is expected to travel to New York next week for the United Nations General Assembly, at which he will be the first South Korean president to preside over a meeting of the UN Security Council. Trade, however, is not explicitly on his schedule during the visit. Pressure at home to end the standoff continues building, however. Businesses in South Korea worry about a double punch of tariffs and unclear investment rules. Financial analysts have said that even the appearance of uncertainty could hurt the won and drive out capital.

In a significant development that has captured the attention of the crypto community, OKX, a leading global crypto exchange, has officially announced the listing of ASTER perpetual futures against USDT. This highly anticipated addition is set to go live at 5:00 a.m. UTC on September 22, marking a pivotal moment for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and explore advanced derivatives instruments. This comprehensive guide will delve into what this listing means for you, the potential it unlocks, and how to responsibly navigate this thrilling new market. What Exactly are ASTER Perpetual Futures? Before diving into the trading specifics, it is essential to understand the components of this new offering. ASTER (ASTR) is the native token of the Astar Network, a multichain smart contract platform. Astar supports various blockchains like Polkadot and Ethereum, focusing on enabling dApps with both EVM and WebAssembly compatibility. Its core mission is to be a leading hub for Web3 innovation, and its ecosystem is growing rapidly, making its native token a subject of increasing interest among developers and investors alike. Now, what about perpetual futures ? These are powerful derivatives that stand apart from traditional futures contracts. Unlike those with a fixed expiry date, perpetual futures do not expire. This unique characteristic allows traders to hold positions indefinitely, provided they maintain sufficient margin. Essentially, they enable speculation on an asset’s future price movement without the need to own the underlying asset directly. The listing of ASTER perpetual futures provides a new, flexible avenue for traders to gain exposure to ASTR’s price action, offering both versatility and leverage in their trading strategies. Unlocking Potential: The Benefits of Trading ASTER Perpetual Futures on OKX The introduction of ASTER perpetual futures on OKX presents several compelling advantages for astute traders. This new listing is expected to significantly enhance liquidity for ASTER, potentially attracting a broader range of market participants from around the globe. Increased liquidity generally translates to tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery, which ultimately benefits all traders involved in the market. Moreover, perpetual futures contracts are renowned for allowing significant leverage. This means traders can control a much larger position with a relatively small amount of initial capital, thereby amplifying potential profits. However, it is absolutely crucial to remember that leverage also magnifies potential losses with equal force. Beyond speculation, these contracts can be strategically used for hedging existing spot positions in ASTER, helping to mitigate risk during periods of high market volatility. Traders also gain the flexibility to take both long and short positions, enabling them to potentially profit from both upward and downward price movements of ASTER. Navigating the Market: Understanding Risks in ASTER Perpetual Futures Trading While the opportunities presented by ASTER perpetual futures are substantial, it is equally important to acknowledge and thoroughly understand the inherent risks involved. The high leverage available, while appealing for profit amplification, can unfortunately lead to rapid and substantial losses if the market moves unfavorably against your position. Therefore, implementing robust risk management strategies is not just recommended; it is an absolute necessity for sustainable trading. Volatility within the cryptocurrency market is another critical factor to consider. ASTER, much like many other altcoins, can experience significant and sudden price swings. Traders must be adequately prepared for these fluctuations and, critically, avoid overleveraging their positions. OKX provides various sophisticated tools, such as stop-loss orders and clear margin requirements, designed to help users manage these risks effectively. Always conduct thorough research, understand the Astar Network, and carefully consider your personal risk tolerance before engaging in derivatives trading. Responsible trading practices are the cornerstone of a sustainable and potentially profitable experience with ASTER perpetual futures . Ready to Trade? Getting Started with ASTER Perpetual Futures on OKX Are you eager to begin trading ASTER perpetual futures ? The process on OKX is designed to be straightforward for all registered users. First and foremost, ensure your OKX account is fully verified and adequately funded with USDT, as the contract is denominated in ASTER/USDT. Once prepared, simply navigate to the futures trading section on the OKX platform and efficiently search for the ASTER/USDT perpetual futures pair. Upon selecting the pair, you will be able to choose your desired leverage, meticulously set your entry and exit points, and crucially, apply essential risk management orders such as stop-loss and take-profit. It is always a wise approach to start with a smaller position. This allows you to familiarize yourself with the unique market dynamics before committing larger capital. OKX also offers comprehensive educational resources to help new users understand the intricacies of futures trading, empowering them to make informed and confident decisions. The highly anticipated listing of ASTER perpetual futures on OKX on September 22nd undeniably opens up exciting new avenues for cryptocurrency traders. This significant development offers enhanced liquidity, compelling leverage opportunities, and flexible trading strategies for Astar Network’s native token. While the potential for significant gains is certainly present, it is paramount to approach these sophisticated instruments with a clear and thorough understanding of the associated risks. Implementing sound risk management practices will be key to long-term success. By diligently leveraging OKX’s robust platform and extensive educational resources, traders can confidently explore the dynamic world of ASTER perpetual futures and potentially capitalize on Astar’s continued growth and innovation.

The price is now showing bearish signs and might decline further below the $2.880 zone. XRP price is moving lower below the $3.00 support zone. The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.980 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it dips below $2.880. XRP Price Dips Below Support XRP price failed to extend gains above $3.20 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price dipped below the $3.050 and $3.020 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below $3.00. A low was formed near the $2.880 support, and the price is now consolidating losses well below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.880 low. The price is now trading below $3.00 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.980 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. If the bulls protect the $2.880 support, the price could attempt another increase. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.950 level. The first major resistance is near the $3.00 level and the trend line. A clear move above the $3.00 resistance might send the price toward the $3.080 resistance or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3.138 swing high to the $2.880 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.120 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.150. More Downside? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.880 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.740. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone, below which the price could gain bearish momentum. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.880 and $2.80.

The news made a bigger splash than most expected, pushing DOGE back onto analysts’ watchlists as one of the top altcoins to buy. But DOGE isn’t the only one catching eyes—others are buzzing, too. Analysts are flagging up-and-coming projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , hunting for tokens they believe could surge alongside institutional interest and new liquidity. Volume isn’t the whole story, but ETF buzz has a way of swinging sentiment—and this week, DOGE and MAGACOIN FINANCE are right in the spotlight, trading hands like hot tickets. What the Numbers Tell Us $54 million on an ETF’s first day is a number that grabs attention. An ETF pulling in $54 million on day one is hard to ignore—it’s the kind of figure that makes traders sit up and glance at the screen twice. It shows there was more than curiosity—actual trades were happening, with people putting real money into DOGE instead of just watching from the sidelines. By contrast, most crypto ETFs start with much smaller volumes, and only a rare few break into the double-digit millions on their first day. Analysts say this launch could give a boost to other DOGE-linked investment products. If the inflows keep coming, DOGE could see tighter spreads, deeper order books, and smoother fills. Why Analysts Are Putting DOGE Back on Their Watchlists The volatility of DOGE has always been present yet ETF developments during recent times have modified specific aspects of its market behavior. The current market analysis indicates DOGE stands at a lower value than its peers among altcoins that receive institutional investment. The increased exposure from an ETF launch tends to draw new investment capital which makes existing investors maintain their positions and new market participants join at better entry points. Market momentum plays a significant role in this situation. The launch of an ETF for altcoins tends to create market interest that spreads across the entire sector. The crypto market sentiment affects DOGE more strongly than it does smaller and newer cryptocurrencies. The large supply of DOGE, combined with its liquid market, enables fast detection of changes in investor behavior. A Word of Caution & Where DOGE Could Move Next Even though the debut was strong, DOGE still faces resistance levels. Analysts warn that strong volume is helpful, but breaking through key price levels (e.g., $0.30-$0.35, depending on the region) will require sustained interest. Weakness in ETF flows, macroeconomic headwinds, or regulatory surprises could limit upside. Still, many believe that DOGE has momentum enough to make a run if conditions stay favourable. One scenario being discussed: DOGE holding steady, growing ETF volume week over week, and published inflows supporting upward movement. In that scenario, gains toward the next psychological resistance become more plausible. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Alternative Altcoin Exposure While DOGE is capitalizing on the ETF trend, some analysts exploring alternative trades are paying attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE. It may not yet be in the spotlight like DOGE, it is steadily gaining recognition among altcoins that offer potential beyond the more obvious choices. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s attractiveness stems from its early-stage positioning. If the market is leaning towards assets that blend visibility with robust metrics, this token is emerging as a contender. For investors seeking exposure to both established altcoins and potential outperformers in rising markets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being mentioned alongside DOGE by several analysts. How to Think of DOGE in Your Portfolio Now With DOGE’s ETF launch showing strong performance, some investors are contemplating incremental allocations. While it may not be wise to wager everything on DOGE, integrating it into a diversified altcoin basket could be a sensible approach. Consider combining DOGE (for its visibility and liquidity) with other assets (such as ETH, SOL, or newer coins) that bring varied risk/reward profiles. Additionally, keeping an eye on recent volume trends, ETF applications, and regulatory developments will be essential. If PETS turns bullish for altcoin ETFs more broadly, DOGE could find itself re-ranked among the leading altcoins once more. Conclusion: Strong Signal, Not Guarantee DOGE’s ETF launch with $54 million in volume is a strong indicator that institutional interest in altcoins is expanding. Analysts who are adding DOGE back to their watchlists suggest they believe this could spur greater interest and price movement. That being said, volatility remains part of the equation. DOGE faces resistance ahead, and markets can change rapidly. For investors, pairing DOGE with newer names like MAGACOIN FINANCE may provide both visibility and the potential for significant upside.You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

According to the update, the ETF made its debut this week, marking a milestone for the asset’s path toward broader recognition within traditional finance. Early inflows into the product were described as modest, but analysts cited by Uphold suggested that institutional demand could gather strength as the fourth quarter unfolds. The listing of an XRP-focused ETF in the United States is widely viewed as a significant development in establishing more mainstream investment channels for the asset. Here’s your #XRP Report for the week: XRP ETF Launch Steals the Spotlight The first-ever U.S. spot XRP ETF ($XRPR) officially launched this week, marking a major milestone for mainstream adoption. Early flows are modest, but analysts say institutional demand could… pic.twitter.com/869DnUo5Tg — Uphold (@UpholdInc) September 20, 2025 Developments on the XRP Ledger The report also noted growth within the XRP Ledger’s ecosystem. Uphold pointed to upcoming plans for a tokenized money market fund, which will expand the range of real-world financial products integrated into the ledger. Analysts referenced by the exchange said such initiatives add credibility to XRP’s utility beyond its established use as a payments-focused digital asset. By connecting tokenization with regulated financial products, the ledger’s ecosystem is steadily diversifying and reinforcing its role in real-world finance. Technical Analysis and Market Conditions On the technical side, Uphold’s weekly report provided updates on key support and resistance levels. The exchange highlighted resistance between $3.12 and $3.30, while identifying strong support near $2.95. At the time of the update, XRP was trading at $3.01 within a weekly range of $2.95 to $3.12. Technical observers cited in the report indicated that a decisive break above $3.12 could allow XRP to push toward $3.30 and beyond. Longer-term projections suggested the possibility of a move toward $6 if institutional flows continue to accelerate following the ETF launch. At the same time, Uphold acknowledged that consolidation remains possible in the short term as the market absorbs recent developments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Sentiment and Broader Implications The exchange summarized current sentiment as optimistic, noting that both the ETF debut and the introduction of new tokenized financial products provide tailwinds for XRP’s outlook. Market watchers emphasized that maintaining the $2.95 support is key to sustaining momentum, with a loss of that level potentially leading to a retest of $2.88. The report concluded with a central question for traders and investors: whether XRP will break through the $3.12 resistance and sustain upward momentum, or whether the market is set for another period of consolidation. By drawing attention to institutional investment products and real-world financial integrations, Uphold’s report underscored the dual focus on XRP’s market positioning and the continued expansion of its underlying ledger technology. The exchange’s update reflected both the technical dynamics shaping short-term trading and the broader structural changes supporting long-term adoption.

The wild rides in 2021 is one many analysts still point to as a reference for meme coin speculative potentials. But in recent years, both DOGE and SHIB are growing uneasy. Their price trajectory is stalled and not as attractive as wished. In their place, Layer Brett ($LBRETT) at a presale of $0.0058 is emerging as the top meme coin to buy with over $3.9 million sold already. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba inu (SHIB) hold strong communities, Layer Brett’s Ethereum Layer 2 technology and viral momentum are stealing the spotlight, promising explosive returns that could outpace the established meme giants. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Veteran Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, continues to thrive on its global brand and endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. Trading at around $0.26 with a $40 billion market cap, DOGE benefits from its use in tipping and microtransactions, bolstered by recent ETF speculation. Recent data shows steady retail accumulation, which reflects its enduring appeal. Analysts also predict DOGE could reach $0.50-$1 by 2026, a 3-5x gain, if institutional inflows materialize. However, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) massive supply and reliance on hype limit its explosive potential, leaving bulls nervous as newer tokens promise higher multiples in this cycle. Shiba Inu: Building Beyond the Meme Shiba Inu (SHIB) has evolved from a meme token to a robust ecosystem with Shibarium. Its Layer 2 network supports DeFi, NFTs, and metaverse projects. With around a $7 billion market cap, SHIB’s growth is driven by token burns and adoption. Increasing Shibarium transactions reveal widespread utility. Forecasts suggest SHIB hitting $0.00005-$0.0001 by 2026, a 3-5x upside. Despite its progress, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) trillion-token supply caps rapid gains, fueling anxiety among bulls as analysts pivot to fresher, high-beta opportunities. Layer Brett: The 100x Meme Coin Disruptor Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is shaking up the meme coin space, priced at $0.0058 in presale and hailed as the top meme coin to buy. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2, it offers fast transactions, low fees, and staking rewards, blending viral meme appeal with scalable tech for NFTs and community governance. Analysts project Layer Brett to ride to $0.50-$0.60 by late 2025, a 100x leap from its presale price, driven by exchange listings and meme coin mania. In investment terms, a $1,000 investment could buy $86,207 at $0.50, dwarfing DOGE and SHIB returns. Layer Brett’s low market cap and viral energy make it the only 100x play left this cycle. Why Bulls Are Shifting Focus Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) anchored by loyal communities and growing utilities offer 2/3x gains but their large market caps limit moonshot potential. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) ETF hopes and Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Shibarium growth face risks like regulatory delays or market corrections. On the other hand, Layer Brett’s 100x forecast is fueled by its presale entry and core tech utility. Trends show investors diversifying into Layer Brett are seeking to capture its explosive upside while hedging with established meme coins. Conclusion Dogecoin and Shiba Inu bulls are nervous as their 3-5x upside pales against Layer Brett’s 100x potential. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) fast rising $0.0058 presale and Layer 2 foundation offer a rare shot at transformative wealth. While DOGE and SHIB hold their ground, Layer Brett could redefine the meme coin landscape in 2025. Don’t miss Layer Brett’s presale—stake now for the meme coin edge.

Today, the spotlight is firmly on Asia FX , which finds itself in a state of muted anticipation, largely influenced by the looming decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the steady hand of China’s central bank. For crypto investors, these traditional market movements are not just distant echoes; they are vital indicators that shape risk appetite, capital flows, and ultimately, the broader investment landscape. Why is Asia FX Currently Muted? Asian currencies have recently experienced a period of subdued activity, characterized by minimal fluctuations and a cautious sentiment among traders. This ‘muted’ state is not a sign of inactivity but rather a reflection of the market’s collective pause, as participants await clearer signals from major global economic players. Several factors contribute to this cautious stance: Uncertainty Around U.S. Monetary Policy: The primary driver of this muted behavior is the ongoing speculation surrounding the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate decisions. Any hint of a rate hike or cut can significantly impact the U.S. Dollar, which in turn influences the value of Asian currencies. Economic Data Watch: Traders are closely monitoring key economic indicators from both the U.S. and Asia, including inflation figures, employment reports, and manufacturing data. Strong or weak data can shift expectations for central bank actions. Global Geopolitical Tensions: Lingering geopolitical uncertainties can also lead to risk aversion, prompting investors to hold safer assets and reducing speculative activity in foreign exchange markets. Commodity Price Volatility: Many Asian economies are heavily reliant on commodity imports or exports. Fluctuations in oil, gas, or industrial metal prices can directly affect their trade balances and currency valuations. This period of calm can be deceptive. Beneath the surface, pressures are building, and a definitive move by the Fed or a shift in China’s policy could trigger significant movements across the region’s currency markets . Understanding the Critical Fed Rate Path The U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy is arguably the single most influential factor for global currency markets . Its decisions have far-reaching implications, dictating the cost of borrowing, influencing inflation, and shaping investment flows worldwide. The current focus is on the ‘Fed rate path’ – the projected trajectory of interest rate changes over the coming months and years. When the Fed raises interest rates, it generally makes the U.S. Dollar more attractive to investors seeking higher returns, leading to capital outflows from emerging markets and putting downward pressure on Asian currencies. Conversely, rate cuts can weaken the Dollar and provide a boost to other currencies. Here’s what’s driving the Fed’s considerations: Inflation Targeting: The Fed’s primary goal is to maintain price stability, typically aiming for 2% inflation. Recent inflation data, whether persistent or easing, heavily sways their decisions. Employment Mandate: Alongside inflation, the Fed also considers maximum sustainable employment. A robust job market might give them more leeway to keep rates higher, while signs of weakness could prompt a more dovish stance. Economic Growth Outlook: The overall health and growth trajectory of the U.S. economy play a crucial role. A strong economy can absorb higher rates, whereas a slowdown might necessitate monetary easing. The market’s anticipation of the Fed’s next move creates a waiting game, causing the muted trading environment in Asia FX . Investors are dissecting every statement from Fed officials, every economic report, to gain an edge in predicting the future of U.S. monetary policy. How Do China Lending Rates Stabilize the Region? While the U.S. Federal Reserve commands global attention, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) plays an equally vital, albeit more regionally focused, role in financial stability, particularly through its management of China lending rates . Recently, China opted to keep its benchmark lending rates, the Loan Prime Rates (LPRs), steady. This decision, while seemingly uneventful, carries significant weight for China’s domestic economy and, by extension, for the broader Asian financial landscape. The LPRs, which are market-based reference rates set by a panel of banks, guide the pricing of new loans. The PBOC’s decision to maintain these rates reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to support economic recovery with concerns about financial stability and inflation. Here’s why this matters: Domestic Economic Support: Steady rates can provide predictability for businesses and consumers, encouraging investment and spending without fueling excessive debt or speculative bubbles. Property Market Stability: The property sector in China has faced challenges. Keeping lending rates stable avoids adding further pressure to developers and homebuyers, aiding in gradual stabilization. Currency Stability: A stable domestic interest rate environment can contribute to the stability of the Chinese Yuan, which is a significant anchor for other Asian currencies. Volatility in the Yuan can have ripple effects across the region. Counterbalancing External Pressures: By maintaining a steady course, China’s central bank provides a degree of certainty amidst the global uncertainty stemming from the Fed’s actions, offering a potential stabilizing force for regional economies. This strategic steadiness from China’s central bank acts as a counterbalance to the volatility often introduced by the highly anticipated Fed rate path, contributing to the overall stability of currency markets in Asia. The Interplay of Global Monetary Policy and Local Economies The decisions made by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the People’s Bank of China are not isolated events; they are integral components of global monetary policy that reverberate across continents. The interconnectedness of today’s financial system means that a rate hike in Washington or a steady lending rate in Beijing has direct and indirect consequences for economies from Tokyo to Mumbai. Consider the following chain of effects: Central Bank Action Direct Impact Impact on Asia FX & Local Economies U.S. Fed Rate Hike Strengthens USD, increases U.S. bond yields Capital outflow from Asia, weaker Asian currencies, higher borrowing costs for dollar-denominated debt, potential inflation pressure from imports. U.S. Fed Rate Cut Weakens USD, lowers U.S. bond yields Capital inflow to Asia, stronger Asian currencies, lower borrowing costs, potential for increased investment and growth. PBOC Steady LPR Maintains stable domestic credit conditions in China Provides predictability for trade partners, supports regional supply chains, reduces currency volatility for currencies tied to the Yuan, fosters investment stability. PBOC LPR Cut Eases domestic credit, stimulates China’s economy Boosts demand for regional exports to China, potential for stronger regional economic growth, but could also signal deeper domestic issues. This complex interplay requires central banks in Asia to carefully calibrate their own monetary policies, often walking a tightrope between supporting domestic growth and managing external pressures. The goal is to maintain a competitive edge for their exports, control inflation, and prevent disruptive capital flows. What’s Next for Currency Markets in Asia? Given the current landscape, what can we expect for currency markets in Asia? The future remains largely contingent on how the Fed rate path evolves and how China continues to manage its domestic economy and China lending rates . Here are some actionable insights and potential scenarios: Continued Volatility: Until the Fed’s stance becomes unequivocally clear, expect periods of heightened volatility interspersed with phases of muted trading. Investors should prepare for swift reactions to U.S. economic data releases and FOMC statements. Divergent Policy Paths: Asian central banks may increasingly diverge from the Fed’s path, with some potentially cutting rates to stimulate growth (if inflation allows) while others remain cautious. This divergence will create both opportunities and risks for currency traders. China’s Influence: China’s economic performance and policy choices will continue to be a significant determinant. A robust recovery could bolster regional currencies, while any significant slowdown could exert downward pressure. Risk Management is Key: For investors, especially those in the crypto space who are sensitive to broader market sentiment, monitoring these traditional financial market dynamics is crucial. Diversification and careful risk management strategies will be essential. Focus on Fundamentals: While macro trends dominate, the fundamental economic health of individual Asian nations – their trade balances, current account surpluses, and fiscal policies – will ultimately determine the long-term strength of their currencies. The immediate outlook for Asia FX suggests a period of strategic patience, where market participants will closely scrutinize every piece of economic data and every central bank utterance. The ability to interpret these signals accurately will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead. Compelling Summary: Navigating Asia’s Financial Crossroads The current muted state of Asia FX is a testament to the powerful influence of global monetary policy , particularly the highly anticipated Fed rate path and the steadfast decisions regarding China lending rates . As central banks worldwide grapple with inflation, growth, and stability, Asian currency markets find themselves at a critical juncture. While uncertainty looms, China’s commitment to steady rates offers a crucial anchor, preventing wider instability. For investors, understanding these interconnected forces is not just academic; it is essential for making informed decisions across all asset classes, including the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. The coming months will undoubtedly test the resilience of Asian economies and the agility of their financial policies, shaping the future of regional and global finance.

Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets spent the weekend hovering around $4.1 trillion with no major movements amongst the high-cap assets. Monday morning trading in Asia has turned red again, with over $75 billion exiting the space over the past few hours. Bitcoin has fallen back to $114,300, its lowest level for ten days after failing to break resistance at $118,000 late last week. If current levels cannot hold, a dip back to $110,000 is looking likely. Ethereum has also weakened, losing 4% in a fall below $4,300 for the first time in a fortnight. The altcoins were also a sea of red with heavier losses for Dogecoin and Hyperliquid after Arthur Hayes sold his stash.

The midnight rout carved through support levels and established fresh resistance zones, leaving DOGE consolidating around $0.25 as traders monitor for recovery or continuation lower. News Background • DOGE fell 7% over the 24-hour period ending September 22 at 02:00, retreating from $0.27 to $0.25. • Midnight trading saw a collapse from $0.26 to $0.25 on record 2.15 billion volume, dwarfing the 24-hour average of 344.8 million. • Analysts flagged a “1-2 pattern” formation that has historically preceded DOGE breakouts above $0.28–$0.30. Price Action Summary • DOGE’s range spanned $0.02 (≈8%) between a $0.27 high and $0.25 low. • Resistance solidified near $0.27 following repeated rejections. • Institutional support emerged around $0.25, with recovery attempts keeping DOGE anchored above this level. • In the final hour (01:14–02:13), DOGE bounced within a narrow $0.25–$0.25 channel, showing accumulation patterns with spikes at 01:25 and 02:03. Technical Analysis • Record 2.15B tokens traded during the midnight dump confirms heavy institutional activity. • Support confirmed at $0.25; failure here risks extending decline toward $0.23. • Key resistance sits at $0.27, with next upside tests at $0.28–$0.30 should buying resume. • Volume spikes during recovery attempts highlight potential bottoming interest. • Pattern recognition: technicians identify a recurring “1-2 setup” consistent with prior rally structures. What Traders Are Watching • Whether $0.25 can hold as durable support after record liquidation flows. • Institutional positioning around the $0.28–$0.30 resistance band if recovery gains traction. • Follow-through volumes in upcoming sessions to confirm whether accumulation or further distribution dominates. • Broader sentiment impact from ETF delays and ongoing regulatory uncertainty.",Markets|AI Market Insights|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-22 05:14:42

His remarks came after he shared an X post stating that it is time to say goodbye to the legacy economy and start embracing the Internet economy. Srinivasan also shared a chart highlighting the widening growth gap between the Magnificent Seven , a group of major tech firms whose stock gains far outpaced the strong performance of the S&P 500 over the past decade, especially in 2023 and 2024, and the rest of the S&P 500, which has shown little change since 2005. The S&P 500 is a major stock market index that tracks the 500 largest companies listed on U.S. exchanges by market value. Source: Balaji’s X post Srinivasan highlights a shift from traditional economies to the internet sector Srinivasan pointed out the 2008 financial crisis , stating that all transactions and communications have begun taking place online since its occurrence. However, according to him, this is only the beginning of this journey. Based on his argument, the next phase will involve developing economies focusing on the internet, communities, cities, and even governments, concluding that the world is now concentrating on the Internet-First. Meanwhile, the Magnificent Seven- Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia, and Tesla, continue to dominate as the leading tech giants driving this transformation. Commenting on Srinivasan’s remarks, analysts noted that the former Coinbase executive helped popularize the idea of Network States. From his perspective, these online communities could eventually evolve to rival or replace traditional nation-states. According to him, such entities will depend on internet-based money, like cryptocurrencies, to function effectively, a transformation he likens to the Industrial Revolution, when society moved from farming to manufacturing. Despite the promising developments surrounding this significant milestone, analysts have revealed obstacles hindering this success. According to their analysis, the financial system that is currently operating and government agencies usually take their time to adopt new technologies, slowing down innovation. Considering the benefits of the internet sector in the economy, U.S. regulators and lawmakers have joined forces to support and encourage the research, development, and use of AI and blockchain technology to update the current financial system. This has sparked hope for more innovation in the economy. US regulators provide a solution for every product in the country’s market In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) released a joint statement signalling a shift towards 24/7 capital markets. This change aims to connect the traditional financial system with the crypto sector, which carries out daily operations. According to the regulators, a trading environment that is available 24/7 for various types of assets is essential to establish on-chain finance. They also pointed out that it is important to set up clear regulations for event contracts and perpetual futures, which enable investors to speculate on the future of an asset’s price without an expiration date. However, the two agencies highlighted that by extending trading hours, U.S. markets can better relate to the reality that the global economy operates around the clock. They further explained that some types of assets may adopt this change more perfectly than others; hence, there will be one solution for every product. Apart from this, the U.S. government has collaborated with oracle providers Pyth Network and Chainlink to share economic data on the blockchain to improve clarity and accountability regarding budgeting for the public.

At the same time, bitcoin has also retreated but in a more modest manner, which has increased its dominance over the market. Cryptocurrency Market Overview. Source: QuantifyCrypto The chart above demonstrates a very clear picture of the current sentiment among the altcoins. The largest of the bunch has set the trend with a 4% drop that has taken it to a weekly low of under $4,300. ETH was rejected on a couple of occasions at $4,700 in September, and its inability to resume its bull run has caused a substantial retracement. XRP lost the crucial $3 support during the weekend, and its situation has only worsened since then. Despite numerous big price predictions for a surge to its all-time high of $3.65, the asset is down by 4% as well and sits beneath $2.9 as of press time. Even more painful declines come from the likes of ADA, LINK, DOGE, HYPE, and CRO. HYPE has dumped by 8% to under $50 as Arthur Hayes disposed of his holdings, while CRO has plunged by 9% after reports about a data breach against the exchange behind it. Although there are exceptions like IP, which are well in the green, they are very few, and most other mid- and lower-cap alts are down by substantial percentages. The total crypto market cap has lost another $60 billion in a day and is down to $4.060 trillion on CG. In contrast, BTC’s dominance has risen to well over 56% as bitcoin’s price has dropped by a more modest 1%. Data from CoinGlass shows that the overall value of wrecked positions has skyrocketed to more than $630 million daily, and nearly 220,000 traders have been liquidated. ETH is the leader, with over $184 million out of the entire amount. Liquidation Heat Map.

With the purchase, Metaplanet has achieved BTC Yield of 395.1% YTD 2025, Gerovich added. Aggressive BTC Accumulation Meets Metaplanet’s Goals Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy is both aggressive and transparent. As of mid-April 2025, the corporate holder’s total Bitcoin holdings were only 4,525 BTC, entering the world’s top ten public Bitcoin-holding companies. It initially announced to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, which Metaplanet already reached on June 16 . Further, the Tokyo firm said it would acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026, but later updated its treasury strategy. Often referred as the ‘Asian Strategy,’ Metaplanet launched its sweeping “555 Million Plan,” aiming to raise $5.4 billion to buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 .

The largest crypto is trading at $114,503 at press time. The dip aligns with technical resistance, whale activity, and regulatory developments.

52085157,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83997,1758520672,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Presidential Pardon Scam: New Questions Surround Matt Argall and Who is Valerie Haney?,https://timestabloid.com/presidential-pardon-scam-new-questions-surround-matt-argall/,"When Bloomberg reported in August 2025 that businessman Matt Argall attempted to engineer a $30 million presidential pardon deal connected to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Roger Ver, the story exposed a remarkable blend of hubris and desperation. The pardon never reached Donald Trump’s desk, but the failed scheme is now prompting a far deeper line of inquiry: who, exactly, helped Argall maneuver through Washington’s political landscape, and to what extent were they complicit? Federal investigators, according to sources familiar with the matter, are no longer focusing solely on Argall’s own activities. Instead, they are mapping the ecosystem around him—friends, associates, and companions who may have provided credibility, introductions, or logistical support in the capital. For a man long associated with failed ventures, unpaid debts, and grandiose claims, Argall’s ability to embed himself in high-level discussions raises as many questions as the pardon scheme itself. The Haney Connection Valerie Haney, Matt Argall (Source: Haney/TikTok, December 24, 2024) Central to this broader probe is Valerie Haney, Argall’s longtime girlfriend and frequent companion at political and business gatherings. Haney’s background is in Hollywood, where she once worked as the personal assistant to actress Leah Remini. It was during that time that she crossed paths with Argall, a connection that soon drew her into his ventures. Leah Remini, Valerie Haney (Source: Haney/Instagram, June 29, 2024) Multiple sources confirm Haney’s presence at meetings in Washington as early as 2022, including sessions where Argall and crypto entrepreneur Brock Pierce met with representatives of Roger Ver. Her presence is not, at this stage, proof of active involvement. But investigators are keenly aware of how proximity can translate into influence, and whether Haney’s repeated appearance at high-level meetings may have helped Argall project a veneer of legitimacy he otherwise lacked. The question is not whether she brokered deals, but whether her participation—intended or not—enabled Argall to open doors he could not have opened alone. The Pardon-for-Sale Scheme The mechanics of the scheme, as first detailed by Bloomberg, centered on Argall’s attempt to profit from Ver’s legal and regulatory troubles. Ver, once hailed as “Bitcoin Jesus,” was facing mounting legal pressures abroad. Argall, leveraging his connection to Brock Pierce, dangled the prospect of presidential clemency—a commodity worth millions if delivered. What remains murky is how far this offer progressed, who in Washington took it seriously, and whether others in Argall’s circle stood to benefit financially. Investigators are particularly interested in who was present at the meetings and whether their participation suggested awareness, endorsement, or financial expectation. Haney’s confirmation as being in the room has sharpened that line of inquiry. Expanding the Probe At present, federal authorities have declined to publicly define the scope of the investigation. But interviews with individuals close to the matter suggest a widening lens. Argall is unlikely to have acted entirely alone. For years, he has cultivated an entourage of aides, acquaintances, and hangers-on. Now, each of those associations is being scrutinized for signs of enabling behavior—whether deliberate or inadvertent. One investigator summarized the issue bluntly: “It’s not just about what Argall was promising. It’s about who else showed up, who else went along with it, and who else thought they might cash in.” That framing highlights the challenge investigators face. Untangling Argall’s web means distinguishing between those who were duped by proximity and those who actively aided his efforts. The former suggests gullibility; the latter, potential complicity. A Broader Warning The unraveling of Argall’s pardon gambit is more than a personal downfall. It is a case study in how Washington’s ecosystem of access, image, and personal relationships can be exploited by opportunists. Argall’s credibility was not built on achievement, but on appearances—on the ability to surround himself with figures, companions, and settings that suggested influence. For Valerie Haney, the unanswered question is whether her role was incidental or integral. Her proximity to Argall during crucial discussions means she is now part of the story, whether she intended to be or not. The broader warning is clear: scandals in Washington rarely involve a single rogue actor. They almost always reveal a constellation of associates, enablers, and beneficiaries. As the probe into Argall widens, it is becoming less about one man’s failed scheme and more about the network that allowed him to move freely through the corridors of power.

There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2550 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh upward move if it stays above the $0.2450 zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Again Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after there was a close below $0.2720, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE declined below the $0.2620 and $0.2550 support levels. The price even traded below $0.250. A low was formed at $0.2451 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2887 swing high to the $0.2451 low. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.2550 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.250 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is a recovery wave, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2520 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2550 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.2720 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.2887 swing high to the $0.2451 low. A close above the $0.2720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.280 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.2880 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.30. Another Drop In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2550 level, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2450 level. The next major support is near the $0.2320 level. The main support sits at $0.2250. If there is a downside break below the $0.2250 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.2120 level or even $0.2050 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency, which is the second-largest digital asset by market cap, is expected to rally again, since it only barely surpassed its previous all-time high by atone $100. For bullish analysts, the target for the cycle still remains that the Ethereum price will cross the $5,000 mark, but will not stop until it crosses above $6,000. Ethereum Price Remains On The Side Of The Bulls The recent drawdown, while having beaten the Ethereum price by around 10% since then, has not turned the price action bearish. If anything, crypto analyst HAMED_AZ believes that it is a healthy correction that is helping the altcoin to get ready for the next bullish phase. One thing that stands out is that the drawdown has led to a corrective phase instead of a freefall. This suggests that the pullback is healthy for the digital asset and is rather bullish, especially as the Ethereum price has continued to maintain an important support zone above $4,100. With the current corrective phase, the crypto analyst explains that the Ethereum price is now forming a bullish flag pattern. A bullish flag pattern is a continuation pattern that is notoriously known to form after a fast price increase, followed by a brief correction. The last part of the bullish flag pattern is the breakout, and doing so with volume puts the digital asset at a unique advantage to continue its uptrend . Support Zone Needs To Hold With the bullish flag pattern that formed on the chart, the only major thing that could derail the Ethereum price is if its support fails. Right now, that support remains firm at $4,100 and continues to hold. HAMED explains that as long as the Ethereum price continues to hold this support, then the price action is still very much bullish . A breakout from the bullish flag pattern would lead to an impulse wave, and this impulse wave could lead to new all-time highs. An around 50% rally is expected to result from this impulse wave, putting the Ethereum price as high as $6,500 before it is over. “Keep a close eye on the flag breakout and watch for bullish momentum to resume once the consolidation completes,” the analyst stated. In the event of a break below the support level, though, the Ethereum price could be in trouble. The next major support would reside at the $4,000 psychological level, where the bulls would mount their defense.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-22 06:00:33

In his tweet, BarriC highlighted XRP’s performance during the 2017–2018 period, when the digital asset rose from $0.006 to over $3. He noted that current market conditions appear to be tracking a similar pattern to that earlier phase, which led to XRP’s historic rise . $XRP went from $0.006 to $3 + in 2017-2018 Right now, the market is following a similar path to 2017-2018 If #XRP replicates what it did back then We could see $XRP go from $3 to $300 end of 2025 into 2026 — BarriC (@B_arri_C) September 19, 2025 Projection of Future Value BarriC stated that if XRP replicates the growth it experienced in 2017–2018, the token could move from $3 to $300 by the end of 2025 and into 2026. For $300, XRP would need to rise by 9,900%. The projection is based on an assumption that XRP’s price structure could unfold in a manner consistent with its previous major bull run. Differing Opinions from Market Observers The post also attracted comments from other users who shared differing views. One user, Bud, dismissed the prediction, stating , “No. XRP will continue to devalue. We saw the peak and if you didn’t cash your bag by now, you better get on it.” His comment reflected a belief that XRP had already reached its highest value and was unlikely to repeat the growth suggested by BarriC. Another user, Old Man Rawshak, argued that the circumstances today differ from those of 2017–2018. He wrote, “Back then it wasn’t as big of a threat as it is Now! So Market Manipulation/Supression is trying to keep it from taking off!” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Further Context of the Projection BarriC’s outlook draws on the historical performance of XRP , which remains one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. While the scenario he outlined is highly optimistic, it reflects a viewpoint within the community that XRP could achieve exponential growth if conditions align similarly to past cycles. At the same time, the differing reactions to the tweet show the uncertainty surrounding XRP’s future price trajectory , with some participants emphasizing optimism based on past cycles, and others caution against expecting similar outcomes under today’s market conditions.

Advanced AI models like ChatGPT highlight the potential for triple-digit growth across these assets, with XRP price prediction fueled by ETF momentum. Cardano’s (ADA) blockchain upgrades also points to sustained stability. Layer Brett ($LBRETT) presale at $0.0058 promises explosive returns. While XRP and ADA offer steady gains, Layer Brett stands out with core layer 2 technology and rising adoption. Analysts forecast up to 1000x gains, making it the high-octane pick for 2025’s bull run. XRP Price Prediction: ETF Hype Drives Growth Ripple’s XRP is riding a wave of optimism, trading near $2.99 with a $178 billion market cap. Currently bolstered by the REX-Osprey Spot XRP ETF, data shows whale accumulation of over 340 million XRP and 3.66 billion tokens traded in popular exchanges like Binance. The XRP price prediction from AI models like ChatGPT hint at $5-$10 by 2026, a 100-200% gain, driven by pending SEC decisions on 15 ETF filings due in October. XRP’s role in cross-border payments and partnerships with over 300 financial institutions globally make it a reliable bet for triple-digit growth. However, its large market cap tempers the pace compared to smaller, high-beta tokens. Cardano: Steady Growth Through Innovation Cardano’s (ADA) research-driven blockchain continues to shine. Expectations of Chang hard fork, a new technology, will further consolidate smart contracts and governance. ADA’s ecosystem supports DeFi and real-world use cases like supply chain tracking. This has translated to massive adoption. Current data show rising staking and wallet growth, reflecting community trust. ChatGPT and analysts predict ADA to reach $2-$4 by 2026, driven by adoption in emerging markets. Cardano’s (ADA) methodical approach ensures stability, but its growth, while triple-digit, lacks the rapid multiples of speculative meme coins, prompting investors to diversify. Layer Brett: The 1000x Meme Coin Breakout Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is the wildcard, priced at $0.0058 in presale and crowned the top meme coin to buy. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2, it offers fast transactions, low fees, and huge staking rewards as high as 660%. Compellingly, Layer Brett fusion of viral meme appeal and extensive ecosystem make it a top investors’ favorite. Data reveals whale buys and presale sellouts, signaling breakout potential. ChatGPT’s analysis aligns with analysts projecting $LBRETT hitting $5-$6 by late 2026, a 1000x surge. A $1,000 investment today could potentially worth $861,570 at $5, which makes Layer Brett the top crypto for explosive triple-digit growth. Its viral momentum and low market cap position it to outshine XRP and Cardano (ADA). Comparing Triple-Digit Potential Crypto rewards swift action. XRP’s ETF approvals and Cardano’s upgrades face risks like regulatory delays or market dips. The XRP price prediction offers significant gains, anchored by ETF-driven institutional demand. Cardano’s (ADA) upside stems from technical upgrades and adoption. But Layer Brett’s possible rise to $0.50 offers a triple digit potential that many investors crave. Layer Brett’s presale is a time-sensitive window. Its current $0.0058 entry and enormous staking rewards echo early meme coin successes. Conclusion The XRP price prediction signals a possible 100% growth and Cardano 200%, but Layer Brett’s ($LBRETT) 1000x potential is more attractive. With XRP and ADA building steadily, Layer Brett’s $0.0058 presale offers a rare shot at transformative wealth in 2025. Don’t miss Layer Brett’s presale—stake now for the meme coin edge.

Claims are growing faster than expected, and insurers are losing billions of yuan annually. The issue is that EV adoption in the country has outpaced insurers’ antiquated tools to price risk. As a result, one of the world’s most advanced EV markets has become a battleground for insurers. China has the world’s largest number of EVs on the road. More than 20 million new energy vehicles (NEVs), including pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids, are registered nationwide. And sales continue to soar, with EVs now outselling gasoline cars in several cities. Yet behind the surge, insurance statistics paint a chilling reality. Owners of electric vehicles, many younger than motorists who pilot traditional internal combustion, are roughly twice as likely to file claims on their policies. Their vehicles are also much pricier to repair. Batteries account for roughly a third of a car’s value and are most at risk. These units are mounted under the floor and can more easily be damaged by speed bumps or road detritus. And new ones aren’t cheap; sometimes, replacing one is more than it would cost to repair the entire rest of the car combined. Specialized components like sensors and chips have become more expensive and difficult to find. And often repairs can only be made by authorized service centers, many at Tesla-certified body shops, where costs are all too expensive. In China, insurers lost 5.7 billion yuan ($802 million) on underwriting EV policies in 2024 alone, according to the China Association of Actuaries. Total premium income was almost 141 billion yuan, but claims and repair costs outweighed profits. Qin Lu, the chief executive officer of Greater China at Aon Plc, said insurers could not fully distinguish between car brands, models, and loss patterns, adding that the sector remained challenging. He predicted it could take about three more years before businesses could break even. Regulators attempt fixes as losses pile up The mounting losses have drawn the attention of regulators. In January 2025, China issued its first insurance guide for EVs and plug-in hybrids. The goal is to create uniform coverage, lower repair costs, and pressure carmakers to work with insurers. Automakers are packing their vehicles with copious amounts of data about battery health, driving patterns, and vehicle usage. However, insurers have had little access to it, complicating their ability to build accurate risk models. The new rules promote the sharing of data across industries to allow insurers to price policies more equitably. The government also initiated an online service called “Easy to Insure,” which matches up EV owners with insurance coverage. The platform has helped cover over 500,000 vehicles with policies with a combined value of nearly 495 billion yuan. And while it wouldn’t guarantee the lowest premiums, it would guarantee that you can’t be denied basic coverage. At the same time, law enforcement officials are pressuring car manufacturers and their parts suppliers to lower prices for replacement parts. A more transparent repair and supply chain should drive down costs, even if progress has been achingly slow. Automakers enter a market too big to ignore EV insurance isn’t profitable yet, but it’s seen as the industry’s future. Analysts expect premiums in this industry to hit 500 billion yuan by 2030, more than a third of China’s auto insurance market. The three biggest insurers, Ping An, PICC, and China Pacific Insurance, have more than 65% of the sector’s market share. Smaller companies have difficulty keeping pace and may lack scale or good data to manage risks effectively. Ping An said its EV business became profitable in 2024, powered by new tools that identify ride-hailing drivers and analyze the economics of a repair. Other insurers are also playing with usage-based pricing, under which policies would be based on real-time driving data. The likes of BYD, Tesla, and newcomers like Xiaomi are all establishing their own insurance arms amid a growing bet that vertically integrating in the business could provide them an edge.

According to recent market monitoring, BTC has notably dipped below the significant $114,000 mark. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $113,976.55 on the Binance USDT market, reflecting a moment of heightened scrutiny for digital asset holders. This recent drop signals a crucial period for the world’s leading cryptocurrency, prompting questions about market stability and future trajectories. Many are now observing closely to understand the underlying factors contributing to this sudden shift. What Triggered This Urgent Bitcoin Price Fall? When a significant Bitcoin price fall occurs, it rarely happens without a confluence of factors. Several elements might be at play, influencing investor sentiment and market dynamics. One primary driver could be widespread profit-taking, where large holders decide to sell off portions of their assets after a period of gains, creating downward pressure. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation fears or changes in interest rates, often push investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Technical Breakdown: From a technical analysis perspective, BTC might have broken key support levels, triggering automated sell orders and exacerbating the decline. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions or new announcements regarding cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can also introduce volatility and contribute to a Bitcoin price fall . Understanding these potential catalysts is essential for comprehending the current market behavior and anticipating future movements. The Immediate Impact of BTC’s Price Drop An abrupt Bitcoin price fall below a significant threshold like $114,000 inevitably sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. For individual investors, this can lead to varying emotional and financial responses. Those holding BTC might experience paper losses, while potential buyers could see this as an opportunity to enter the market at a lower price point. Moreover, the performance of Bitcoin often influences altcoins, with many typically following BTC’s trend. Therefore, a dip in Bitcoin’s value frequently translates to broader market corrections. The immediate impact also includes: Increased Volatility: Price swings become more pronounced, making short-term trading riskier. Shift in Market Sentiment: A general sense of caution or even fear can spread, impacting decision-making. Liquidation Events: Traders using leverage might face liquidation if their positions fall below margin requirements. Observing these immediate reactions helps in gauging the market’s resilience and potential recovery paths. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Do Amidst a Bitcoin Price Fall? During periods of a significant Bitcoin price fall , maintaining a clear strategy is paramount. Panic selling often leads to regret, while informed decisions can help protect or even grow your portfolio. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any decisions, thoroughly research the market conditions and potential future outlooks. Do not rely solely on headlines. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy can mitigate risk during volatile periods. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: A market dip is an excellent time to assess your risk tolerance and ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your long-term financial goals. Focus on Long-Term Holdings (HODL): For those with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value, a temporary Bitcoin price fall might be seen as a mere blip on the radar, making HODLing a viable strategy. Remember, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Educating yourself and making calculated moves are crucial during these times. The recent Bitcoin price fall below $114,000 serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While such dips can be unsettling, they are also an integral part of its evolution. Whether driven by profit-taking, macroeconomic shifts, or technical factors, understanding these movements is key to navigating the digital asset landscape. Ultimately, the resilience of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market will be tested, but its history suggests a capacity for recovery. Investors are encouraged to stay informed, adopt prudent strategies, and view market fluctuations with a balanced perspective. The journey of cryptocurrency continues, full of both challenges and opportunities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Is a Bitcoin price fall common? A1: Yes, price volatility, including significant drops, is a common characteristic of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its history. Q2: What does “trading at $113,976.55 on the Binance USDT market” mean? A2: This indicates the current price of Bitcoin (BTC) against Tether (USDT), a stablecoin, on the Binance exchange. USDT is pegged to the US dollar, so this effectively means BTC is trading for approximately $113,976.55 US dollars. Q3: Should I sell my Bitcoin when its price falls? A3: This depends entirely on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment strategy. Many long-term investors choose to “HODL” (hold on for dear life) during dips, while others might sell to cut losses or reallocate funds. It’s crucial to do your own research (DYOR) before making any investment decisions. Q4: How can I stay updated on Bitcoin’s price movements? A4: You can monitor Bitcoin’s price through various cryptocurrency exchanges, financial news websites, and dedicated market tracking platforms. Setting up price alerts can also be helpful. Q5: Does a Bitcoin price fall affect other cryptocurrencies? A5: Often, yes. Bitcoin’s performance typically influences the broader altcoin market. A significant Bitcoin price fall can lead to corrections in other cryptocurrencies as well, though the degree of impact can vary. Was this insight into the recent Bitcoin price fall helpful?

This year, the spotlight is on LayerBrett (LBRETT) , a trending new coin, to repeat the exact same feat. If you missed out on Dogecoin and Pepe coin’s boom, you don’t want to miss out on LayerBrett’s. Experts back LayerBrett for 100x returns Remember the meme coin craze back in 2021 and 2023? LayerBrett is igniting that feeling amongst investors again. That’s because it is a new generation meme project that is destined to succeed where others have failed. Instead of relying on hype, LayerBrett brings real utility to the meme world. It debuts as an Ethereum layer 2 solution, offering faster and cheaper transactions than even Ethereum could offer. This tangible utility makes LayerBrett immune to FUD cycles and price instability that plague most meme tokens. This puts a feather in its cap, and has got loads of crypto veterans keeping an eye on it. That’s why the coin has quickly risen up the ranks, and is starting to dominate conversations in online crypto circles. Throw in its mouthwatering staking rewards plus $1 million giveaway , and it’s easy to see why LayerBrett is a trending crypto token at the moment. The coin’s social media presence is growing every day and the FOMO is starting to kick in. That’s why experts back it for 100x returns before 2025 runs to an end. Dogecoin ETF to turbocharge LayerBrett’s price The evolution of Dogecoin from joke to serious investment asset is nothing short of astonishing. And now, Dogecoin is taking a step further to become a treasury asset for corporations and nation bodies. The launch of REX-Osprey’s Dogecoin ETF attests to that. This new fund gives traditional investors access to Dogecoin without directly holding the token. It gives Dogecoin a kind of legitimacy that top cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum enjoy. And what’s more, it is going to unleash a flow of fresh funds into meme coins. It won’t be long before institutional investors fall upon LayerBrett, given that it is one of the top trending meme coins at the moment. When institutional funds start rushing into LayerBrett, one can only imagine how high it’s going to soar. Buying the coin at its current price of $0.0058, would look like the best investment decision of a lifetime. Investment potential: Can Pepe Coin compete with LayerBrett? Given that Pepe coin is the bigger, much more popular meme coin, it’s safe to say that the average investor would gravitate towards it. But the smart investor knows which coin is more lucrative–LayerBrett. This is because, unlike PEPE, LayerBrett is still fresh and has loads of room to grow. The coin is just rising up and is yet to saturate the market. If PEPE, without real utility, can rally by as much as 100x in 2024, LayerBrett can do much more. That is why it is one of the hottest prospects on the market today. Don’t miss the LayerBrett train Pepe coin and Dogecoin are big crypto projects whose best days are behind them. LayerBrett, on the other hand, is just starting its journey to the top. The good news is that it is still in presale, available for just $0.0058 per token. Join the train, and you may rake in profits of over 100x before everyone else knows about it. Layer Brett is in presale now, but it’s moving fast. Get in early, stake while rewards are high, and don’t miss your shot at the next 100x crypto!

Its Quantity Will Keep Decreasing: Price Increases With Network Growth,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-cannot-be-mined-its-quantity-will-keep-decreasing-price-increases-with-network-growth/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE recently highlighted the unique supply model of XRP and its potential impact on future valuation. In a statement, he wrote : “…the XRP token cannot be mined and its quantity will constantly decrease, and everything that exists in a limited amount and is actively used is becoming more expensive, therefore, with the growth of the network, the XRP PRICE WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.” His comment draws attention to the fixed supply of XRP, the absence of mining, and the token’s deflationary design as central elements of its long-term economic structure. “…the XRP token cannot be mined and its quantity will constantly decrease, and everything that exists in a limited amount and is actively used is becoming more expensive, therefore, with the growth of the network, the XRP PRICE WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY.” … https://t.co/UYwgPMXAI9 pic.twitter.com/UXj084BH1F — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) September 20, 2025 A fixed supply and deflationary mechanism XRP differs from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin because all its supply was created at launch, with no additional units to be generated through mining. The XRP Ledger processes transactions using a consensus protocol, and with each transaction, a small amount of XRP is permanently removed from circulation as a transaction fee. Over time, this mechanism ensures that the overall quantity of XRP in existence decreases gradually. SMQKE underscores this point by linking the diminishing supply to a classic economic principle: when something exists in limited amounts and continues to be used actively, it tends to appreciate. The link between network growth and value The researcher’s statement ties the supply model directly to potential price outcomes. He argues that as adoption of the XRP Ledger grows , the combination of fixed supply and fee-based reduction in quantity will strengthen the case for higher valuations. The claim rests on the assumption that increasing use of XRP for settlement, payments, or liquidity provisioning will drive sustained demand. In his words, the result of this dynamic is that “with the growth of the network, the XRP price will increase significantly.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Considerations surrounding the argument While the argument presented is straightforward, it is worth noting that market prices are not only determined by supply mechanics. Factors such as regulatory clarity, institutional participation , liquidity conditions, and broader market sentiment also shape price outcomes. Nonetheless, the structural elements highlighted by SMQKE remain significant. While the absence of mining eliminates the environmental costs seen in proof-of-work systems, the predictable and gradually declining supply of XRP creates a transparent framework for assessing scarcity over time. SMQKE’s remarks focus on the fundamentals of XRP’s economic design. By indicating the non-minable nature of the asset and its decreasing supply through transaction fees, he frames a case for why the token could see higher valuations as usage of the network expands. His statement reflects a view that the supply mechanics of XRP should not be overlooked in considerations of its long-term price trajectory.

This impressive surge has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts globally, highlighting a potentially new phase for the leading digital asset. According to recent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $113,007.99 on the Binance USDT market, showcasing robust momentum. What’s Driving This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Rally? Several key factors appear to be fueling this latest ascent in the Bitcoin price . Institutional adoption continues to grow, with more traditional financial entities integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios and services. This increased institutional interest provides significant liquidity and validates Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate asset. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation concerns, often lead investors to seek alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, frequently dubbed ‘digital gold,’ benefits from this sentiment, as it offers a decentralized hedge against traditional currency devaluation. The limited supply of Bitcoin, especially following halving events, also creates scarcity, which inherently supports its value as demand increases. These combined forces are strongly influencing the current Bitcoin price trajectory. Navigating the Market: Understanding Bitcoin Price Volatility While the current rally is exciting, understanding the inherent volatility of the Bitcoin price remains crucial. Cryptocurrency markets are known for their rapid fluctuations, and Bitcoin is no exception. Investors must approach these movements with a clear strategy and a good grasp of market dynamics. To navigate this landscape effectively: Stay Informed: Regularly follow market news and expert analysis. Understand Technical Indicators: Learn how to interpret charts and patterns that can signal potential shifts in the Bitcoin price . Practice Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. These practices help in making informed decisions and managing potential risks in a dynamic market environment. Expert Perspectives: What Lies Ahead for the Bitcoin Price? As the Bitcoin price reaches new heights, analysts are offering varied outlooks on its future. Many experts remain bullish, citing strong fundamentals and growing mainstream acceptance. They predict continued upward movement, potentially targeting new all-time highs in the coming months. However, some caution against excessive euphoria, pointing to potential resistance levels and the possibility of market corrections. Key levels to watch include immediate support around the $110,000 mark and potential resistance as it approaches previous highs. The market’s reaction to global economic news and regulatory developments will also play a significant role in shaping the future Bitcoin price . It is essential for investors to consider both optimistic and conservative scenarios when planning their strategies. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto Investor For those looking to participate in the crypto market, especially with the Bitcoin price showing such strength, a thoughtful approach is paramount. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can mitigate risks. While Bitcoin is a leader, other cryptocurrencies also offer unique opportunities. Furthermore, consider your investment horizon. Long-term holders often benefit from riding out short-term volatility, while short-term traders need to be highly responsive to market changes. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting a financial advisor before making significant investment decisions. Staying patient and disciplined are key virtues in this fast-paced sector. The recent surge of the Bitcoin price above $113,000 is a compelling development that underscores the asset’s resilience and growing importance in the global financial landscape. While the journey of cryptocurrency is often marked by volatility, this latest rally offers a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s potential. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed and adopting a strategic approach will be crucial for navigating its exciting future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does the rise above $113,000 mean for Bitcoin? This surge signifies strong market confidence and potentially marks a new phase of growth for Bitcoin. It reflects increased demand, possibly driven by institutional adoption and its role as a hedge against inflation. 2. Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? The decision to invest depends on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. While the current momentum is positive, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. It is always recommended to conduct thorough research and consider dollar-cost averaging. 3. What factors could influence the Bitcoin price in the near future? Key factors include global economic trends, regulatory changes, institutional investment flows, technological advancements within the crypto space, and overall market sentiment. 4. How can I stay updated on Bitcoin price movements? You can monitor reputable cryptocurrency news outlets, use real-time market data platforms like Binance USDT, and follow analyses from financial experts and blockchain researchers. 5. What is ‘digital gold’ in relation to Bitcoin? ‘Digital gold’ refers to Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, similar to traditional gold. Its limited supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive asset for investors looking to protect wealth, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or inflation.

With current community-driven mobile mining model and ongoing mainnet migration, there are hopes of a rebound that could be above $0.40. Amid a potential PI resurgence, investors are also eyeing Layer Brett ($LBRETT), a presale meme coin at $0.0058 for its projected 100x returns. While PI Network’s grassroots momentum builds, Layer Brett’s Ethereum Layer 2 technology and fast rising adoption could outshine PI’s recovery in 2025. Pi Network Price Prediction: A Community-Driven Revival PI Network has captivated millions with its smartphone-based mining, making crypto accessible without energy-intensive hardware. As a result, (PI),has built a massive following through its unique approach to mining via smartphones. The network is preparing for its mainnet launch, which could drive adoption and increase PI’s value. Trading around $0.35 in pre-mainnet estimates, the Pi Network price prediction hinges on its mainnet migration and KYC advancements, which is expected to streamline user verification for broader exchange listings. Data shows growing wallet activity, with over 13 million users engaged, signaling strong community support. Analysts now forecast PI to climb above $0.40 by mid-2026. If mainnet rollout succeeds and listings expand, PI could rise as high as $0.50-$1.00, driven by adoption in everyday transactions. However, delays in migration or regulatory hurdles could temper gains, making PI a steady but not explosive bet compared to high-beta alternatives. Layer Brett: The Meme Coin Powerhouse Layer Brett ($LBRETT) is stealing the spotlight as the top crypto to buy, priced at $0.0058 in presale. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2 infrastructure, it offers fast transactions, low fees, and staking rewards, blending meme coin virality with scalable tech for NFTs and community governance. Unlike many others, Layer Brett’s technical foundation supports scalable applications, from NFTs to community projects, giving it staying power Onchain metrics show whale accumulation and presale sellouts, reflecting breakout potential. Analysts project Layer Brett to surge to $0.50-$0.60 by early 2026, which is a 100x leap. Layer Brett low entry, enormous staking rewards (over 660%) and viral momentum invariably make it a top meme coin to buy for investors seeking life-changing gains. Pi Network vs. Layer Brett: Recovery vs. Rocket The Pi Network price prediction offers a modest growth amid a robust mobile-first ecosystem and KYC-driven adoption. Its community of millions provides a solid base, but its pre-mainnet status limits immediate upside. Layer Brett, however, is the high-reward plan. Its 100x potential stems from a low presale price, staking yields, and meme-driven hype. Trends show crypto whales diversifying into $LBRETT, balancing community growth with speculative upside. Pi Network’s strength lies in accessibility, but Layer Brett’s tech and viral appeal could capture the market’s speculative fervor, especially as listings approach. Conclusion Pi Network price prediction signals a rebound above $0.40, with mainnet migration and KYC paving the way for triple-digit growth. Yet, Layer Brett’s ($LBRETT) 100x potential makes it the top meme coin to buy, its $0.0058 presale offering a shot at transformative wealth. As PI builds steadily, Layer Brett could redefine portfolios with its Layer 2 edge and viral energy. Don’t miss the presale for 2025’s biggest win. Don’t miss Layer Brett’s presale—stake now for the meme coin edge.

BTC was affected after a dip to $114,000, but smaller altcoins suffered mass liquidations. Crypto liquidations accelerated in the past day, starting with a late Sunday dip for BTC to the $114,000 range. Total liquidations reached $441.78M for the past day, the highest level since August 29. ETH and altcoins led liquidations over the weekend and in the new week. | Source: CoinGlass . The weekend liquidations spilled over into the new week, at one point reaching $1B in total liquidations within an hour. The return of active trading in the new week did not reverse the weekend trend, but deepened the slide for most assets. Liquidations usually affect blue-chip tokens and larger projects, where traders are strategically positioned on the derivative markets. This time around, the liquidation event affected a larger selection of tokens, liquidating $109.7M in smaller assets. Other assets that showed strength in the past weeks and built up long liquidity have also faced notable liquidations. Those include the recently expanding ASTER , as well as WLFI, PUMP, and others. Even BNB saw a limited amount of long liquidations, after climbing to a peak above $1,077. Liquidations ended the altcoin season The past week saw a series of altcoin and token rallies, extending the altcoin season period. However, historically altcoin seasons are short, often lasting around two weeks. After the most recent price slide, the altcoin season index slid from its peak of 100 points achieved just days ago, and turned back to 67 points. The altcoin season index dipped from a peak of 100 points to 67 points, ending the official altcoin season. | Source: Altcoin Season Index . The altcoin season rally continued for around a month, though peak index values lasted only a few days. During that period, well-established coins reached new valuation levels, while smaller assets went through short-lived pumps. The current level of the index suggests altcoin season is over for now, though it is not fully BTC season. BTC dominance recovered to 56.2%, while ETH dominance slid to 12.8%. Since 2024, altcoins had three periods of heated expansion, with the latest weeks becoming the longest hot altcoin season. ETH leads liquidations for the past day ETH liquidations continued in the new week, as the token lost its previous tiers of stability. ETH dipped to $4,139.61, wiping out up to $465M for the day. Long liquidations continued on Monday, at one point erasing over $1B for all assets, as BTC dipped under $113,000. Smaller altcoins extended their liquidations to over $263M, shaking out other optimistic traders. The recent event showed the crypto market was still capable of a liquidation cascade, and the initial wipeout was not complete. The market reversal may come as soon as all liquidatable positions are closed or cleared. Previous liquidity accumulation for ETH suggested a possible dip to the $3,900 level in the case of a liquidation cascade. ETH open interest reverted to $27B, down from its recent level of around $30B. ETH is seen as one of the indicators for an altcoin market. Currently, DeFi is not as threatened by liquidations, as most loans remain conservative, and significant liquidation levels start under $1,700. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The bearish performance comes amid a pullback from the broader crypto market, with BTC and Ether also recording huge losses. XRP dips below $2.80 as market reverses recent gains XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, lost more than 6% of its value over the last 24 hours. The broader crypto market experienced a flash dump earlier today, with over $1 billion in long positions liquidated from the market. The flash dump saw XRP temporarily drop to the $2.699 region, but it has now slightly recovered and is trading above $2.82 per coin. The bearish performance also overshadowed XRPR’s strong debut. XRPR is the first US-listed XRP ETF. This figure made XRPR the largest ETF debut of 2025, surpassing the Solana ETF launched by Rex-Osprey. The ETF went live on Friday, recording $37.7 million in opening-day volume. However, institutional profit-taking overwhelmed the bullish catalyst, with XRP losing roughly 8% of its value over the last 48 hours. The primary focus in the market this week remains the possibility of the Federal Reserve easing its policies. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, and nine other FOMC members are set to speak over the next few days, with traders focusing on hints of possible rate cuts before the end of the year. XRP has failed to build on the momentum it gathered in July. The coin has lost momentum in recent weeks and could experience further resistance around the $3.0 mark. XRP eyes $3.0 despite bearish price action The XRP/USD 4-hour chart has turned bearish after the cryptocurrency lost over 8% of its value over the last 48 hours. The bearish performance could result in further selling pressure, with BTC and ETH also recording huge losses. The momentum indicators have switched bearish, with the MACD lines switching into the negative territory over the weekend. The RSI of 38 also shows that XRP is heading into the oversold region if the bearish trend continues. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.82 per coin. If the bearish trend continues, XRP could retest the $2.70 resistance level in the near term. An extended bearish run would see the coin drop below $2.60 for the first time since July. On the flip side, today’s market flush could provide the liquidity to push prices higher. If that happens, XRP could rally towards the first major resistance and TLQ level at $3.02. An extended bullish run would allow Ripple’s native coin could hit the $3.2 region over the next few hours or days.

However, new projects are also taking center stage, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) being of particular interest in 2025. Holding steady at $0.035 presale, MUTM is building a two-way lending-and-borrowing protocol for long-term adoption on decentralized finance. With ADA offering the stability of a proven network and MUTM offering early-stage growth potential, both are gaining traction as investors position themselves for the next bull run. Cardano Navigates Resistance as Fundamentals Continue to Come Under Question Cardano (ADA) trades around $0.92 levels, having recently probed resistance around the levels of $1.00 with firm support around the levels of $0.80-$0.85. Its advancement in the development roadmap, including scaling and smart contract improvements, continues to attract the interest of those investors who like projects with solid technical progress. Nevertheless, ADA’s price momentum now seems less exhilarating, as much of its past projected gains now seem already priced in. Compared to ADA’s set size, Mutuum Finance, is perceived by investors to have higher potential upside within this cycle. Mutuum Finance Growth in Presale Mutuum Finance has had a record-breaking presale run with over 16,470 investors buying coins to raise a total of over $16.15 million raised to date. Tokens can be bought at $0.035 per MUTM in Phase 6. The presale is tiered, which means that early adopters enjoy lower prices. Mutuum Finance’s goal is to push the boundaries of the current DeFi market. The project has an early adopter token giveaway offering $100,000 MUTM where 10 users will be awarded $10,000 MUTM. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to lend, exchange and settle trades in USD-denominated value of assets and token value of assets like ETH, MATIC and AVAX. Fallback oracle modes, composite data feeds and decentralized exchange time-weighted averages are utilized as a safeguard against mistakes. Multi-layered format supply data price can be as accurate as needed even in hard-hitting market conditions. Creating a Trustworthy and Secure Ecosystem Other than appearing ecosystem formation, Mutuum Finance will issue a USD stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins that depegged during times of economic downturn, Mutuum’s stablecoin issued will be termed non-algorithmic and overcollateralized and thus can keep its peg during times of financial stress. The model takes advantage of the idle collateral reserve stability to be long-term stable with a value preservation promise. This ensures the stablecoin to be a safe depository, and a safe store of value. This also positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most forward-looking DeFi projects in the market today. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction as one of the best cryptos to invest in currently, offering early-stage value for investors while Cardano (ADA) remains an established network. Presale Stage 6 tokens are valued at $0.035, with over $16.15M invested and 16,470+ investors on board, showing very high demand. ADA is valued at around $0.92, with a boost from upgrades and ecosystem growth, but its short-term potential seems muted. On the other hand, MUTM combines a twin lending protocol, overcollateralized USD stablecoin, and $100K token giveaway that makes it a top 2025 pick with 50x ROI projections for the early movers. Buy and HODL your MUTM tokens during Phase 6 before the next price spike.

52087954,585975,1758526228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52087954.jpeg,"Bitcoin Set For ‘Massive Political News’ Tuesday, Says Dennis Porter",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-massive-political-news-tuesday-porter/,"Dennis Porter, CEO and co-founder of Satoshi Action Fund, spent much of Sunday, September 21, stoking anticipation for what he called a watershed moment for Bitcoin policy in the United States, promising “MASSIVE POLITICAL NEWS COMING FOR BITCOIN TUESDAY THAT WILL RESHAPE THE TRAJECTORY OF BITCOIN POLITICS. THIS WILL BE A DEFINING MOMENT.” In a late-US-hours video posted to X, Porter told followers that the announcement, to be unveiled during a coordinated X Space “with one of the largest shows in the space,” is intended to “potentially reorder the political conversation for Bitcoin across the country.” What To Expect From The Bitcoin News On Tuesday? Porter framed the reveal as part of a broader effort to move US policy onto “a better pathway” and away from what he described as a “dangerous pathway,” adding that the initiative is designed to build durable momentum for federal-level legislation. “If you really want to see something like a strategic Bitcoin reserve (SBR) bill get passed at the federal level, if you want to see Bitcoin rights get passed at the federal level, then you’re going to want to pay attention to what’s happening on Tuesday,” Porter said. He stressed expectations should be political rather than market-moving in the short term: “This is not going to be some country buying 10 million Bitcoin.” Porter positioned Tuesday’s reveal as a foundational step toward converting executive-branch direction into statute. “If you live by executive order, you’ll die by executive order,” he said, arguing that any US SBR must ultimately be codified by Congress to survive future administrations. The comments arrive in a year when state-level experiments—and federal debate—over public-sector BTC holdings have accelerated. In May, New Hampshire became the first US state to enact a SBR law, authorizing the treasurer to allocate up to a fixed share of certain public funds into Bitcoin under specified conditions. The Granite State was followed by Arizona and Texas . Many other states have introduced bills or are considering legislation for SBRs. Some bills have passed out of committee; others have failed to advance or were vetoed. For example, proposals in Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Florida have been brought forward; however, they have not succeeded into law. Satoshi Action Fund, the advocacy group Porter leads, was a primary architect of this state-by-state strategy. Its public materials and social-media profiles claim involvement in “9 bills in 8 different states,” alongside grassroots campaigns aimed at mobilizing constituents behind pro-BTC policy. Porter reiterated that record on Sunday while thanking “over 2,500” supporters and the lawmakers who “put their careers on the line” to advance the cause. IN LESS THAN 48 HOURS BITCOIN POLITICS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME — WHAT TO EXPECT. pic.twitter.com/h71TdBtGPl — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) September 22, 2025 While Porter did not preview the specific contours of Tuesday’s announcement, his remarks outlined two immediate objectives: entrenching “Bitcoin rights” at both state and federal levels, and advancing a statutory framework for a US SBR. He suggested Satoshi Action has been working “quietly” on multiple “stealth projects” to “reshape the conversation and make sure that we generate more political momentum for Bitcoin,” signaling that further disclosures will follow the initial reveal. For now, the only clear facts are those Porter put on the record: the announcement will be political in nature; it will aim to “set the foundation” for a federal strategic-reserve bill and for nationwide “Bitcoin rights”; and it will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 23, during a high-profile X Space. Everything else—what the initiative specifically entails, who is backing it, and how quickly it could translate into draft legislation—will be answered when the details are made public. As Porter put it, “This is going to be a very big piece in making sure that we get to that final place with a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill.” At press time, BTC traded at $114,264.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Dennis Porter,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-22 07:30:28

The stock now holds a 2% weight in the benchmark, putting it just behind Toyota and Sony. The surge is being driven by billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, who’s been pouring billions into artificial intelligence, and it’s forcing even some of the firm’s harshest skeptics to get off the sidelines. According to Bloomberg, fund managers tracking Japan’s equity market are being dragged into SoftBank whether they like it or not. Anyone trying to beat the index is now holding this stock or underperforming. “A lot of institutional investors are now agonizing over how to deal with SoftBank,” said Yoshiki Nagata, chief investment officer at enTorch Capital Partners. “If you don’t own this particular stock, all the effort to pick other good investments goes to waste.” Traders chase SoftBank after adding $110 billion in value The numbers are loud. SoftBank has added 15.9 trillion yen — about $110 billion — to the Topix’s total value since March. That alone made up almost 10% of the index’s total market cap growth. None of the other big names came close. The second and third biggest contributors, Advantest and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, didn’t even make up half of that combined. Nagata said that some investors now face structural pressure to buy more shares just to keep up with benchmark-linked portfolios. “When a share with a big weight like SoftBank keeps rising, it is hard to close your underweight position,” he said. “This is a structural problem with benchmark-linked investment. We could see a self-feeding loop of additional buying inviting more buying.” The company’s connection to OpenAI is also dragging in more interest. Hiroaki Tomori, executive fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management, said people should be paying attention to how much OpenAI is spending and what that means for firms tied to it. “OpenAI’s growth is staggering, the use of AI is becoming ubiquitous,” Hiroaki said. “We should see a sign of confidence behind the big orders OpenAI is making.” That momentum is lifting stocks like Broadcom and Oracle in the U.S., and now it’s spilling into Japan through SoftBank’s exposure. High volatility adds risk but doesn’t stop inflows Despite the rally, this stock isn’t for the faint of heart. SoftBank moves more than any of Japan’s 100 largest firms, with a beta of 1.515, meaning it swings about 1.5 times harder than the overall market. It tends to outperform during bull runs but takes heavier hits when markets fall. Right now, the shares are trading at a 20% discount to net asset value, which is the tightest margin in years. That’s led to some speculation that the rally could pause if Son’s bets start to miss. But the spending is only getting bigger. He’s already locked in a $30 billion commitment to the Stargate AI initiative with OpenAI , and recently surprised markets with a $2 billion position in Intel. Analyst Daisaku Masuno at Nomura Securities doesn’t see the current rally slowing. He said improvements in the Vision Fund’s investments and new momentum in SoftBank’s AI chip plans are cutting down risks. Daisaku has already raised his price target on the stock twice in under a month and now thinks the discount to NAV could go to zero.

Key Takeaways: OKX built a Hyperliquid-style DEX but delayed its launch due to regulatory concerns. Star Xu cited the CFTC’s 2023 crackdown on Deridex and others as a major reason for holding back. As onchain perpetuals gain momentum, shifting US regulations may reshape the space. In a post on X over the weekend , Xu revealed that OKX’s Web3 division had been quietly testing a perpetuals-focused DEX since 2023. “OKX Web3 has been testing a similar product since 2023, but we chose not to launch mainnet due to regulatory concerns,” Xu wrote. OKX Cites CFTC’s Deridex Crackdown as Reason for Delaying DEX Launch Xu cited the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s 2023 enforcement action against Deridex as a key reason for the holdback. The CFTC had charged Deridex with illegally offering digital asset derivatives and failing to register as a swap execution facility or a futures commission merchant. The crackdown extended to two other protocols, Opyn and ZeroEx, for offering leveraged crypto transactions to retail users without proper registration. “While we celebrate the growth of onchain perps, we should not forget the CFTC enforcement against Deridex in 2023,” Xu added. “Regulatory enforcement has fundamentally shifted — hopefully the industry can soon gain much-needed clarity.” Hyperliquid proved that massive success in onchain perps can be achieved with very few employees. Now, more competitors like $Aster are stepping into the space. OKX Web3 has been testing a similar product since 2023, but we chose not to launch mainnet due to regulatory concerns.… — Star (@star_okx) September 21, 2025 Xu’s comments come amid a surge in activity in the decentralized perpetuals space. Hyperliquid, which launched in 2024, has quickly become one of DeFi’s top platforms, recording $319 billion in trading volume in July alone. Meanwhile, ASTER, launched as Aster Chain and backed by CZ-linked YZi Labs, has seen more than $22 billion in volume over the past 30 days, per DefiLlama. While OKX chose to hold back its own DEX launch, changing regulatory dynamics in the US could shift the landscape. CFTC Adds Crypto Leaders to Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee The CFTC recently expanded its Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee to include crypto industry leaders. Among the latest appointees to DAMS are Katherine Minarik of Uniswap Labs, Avery Ching of Aptos Labs, James J. Hill of BNY, and Ben Sherwin of Chainlink Labs, key figures in blockchain infrastructure, legal policy, and institutional crypto strategy. JPMorgan’s Scott Lucas has been named co-chair of the subcommittee, joining Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul. They replace Caroline Butler in the role. DAMS was established to guide the CFTC on developments in blockchain, tokenization, and decentralized finance. Meanwhile, a newly revised draft of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025 outlines a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets in the US , aiming to reduce conflict between the SEC and CFTC. The bill proposes a Joint Advisory Committee on Digital Assets, with both agencies required to publicly respond to its findings, a move intended to boost transparency and coordination. A public roundtable on the topic is scheduled for September 29. The draft includes explicit protections for DeFi developers, validators, wallet builders, and infrastructure contributors, so long as the underlying protocol is not centrally controlled.

DeFi Development, a Nasdaq-listed entity known for its strategic acquisition of Solana (SOL), has just announced groundbreaking plans. The company intends to launch a dedicated SOL reserve company in South Korea, marking a pivotal moment for digital asset management in the region. What’s Driving This Strategic Move for a SOL Reserve Company? DeFi Development’s decision to establish a corporate presence in South Korea is a clear signal of its long-term vision for Solana. As a publicly traded company, its actions often reflect a calculated strategy to enhance its balance sheet and secure its position in the digital asset landscape. By holding SOL in its treasury through a dedicated entity, DeFi Development aims to achieve several objectives. Treasury Diversification: Adding a significant SOL holding can diversify corporate assets. Strategic Exposure: Gaining direct exposure to the growth potential of the Solana ecosystem. Regional Influence: Establishing a strong foothold in a key Asian market. This initiative isn’t a solo venture. DeFi Development plans to partner with Fragmetric, a prominent SOL-based liquid restaking protocol. This collaboration suggests a sophisticated approach to asset management, potentially leveraging Fragmetric’s expertise to optimize the yield and utility of the held SOL. The partnership is expected to facilitate the acquisition of an existing publicly listed South Korean firm, which will then house the SOL reserve company operations. How Will the SOL Reserve Company Operate in South Korea? While the specific operational details are still under wraps, the core strategy involves acquiring a publicly listed South Korean company. This approach offers several advantages, including an established legal framework, local market access, and potentially a quicker path to operational readiness compared to building from scratch. The acquired firm will serve as the legal and operational base for the SOL reserve company , managing the treasury’s SOL holdings. The involvement of Fragmetric, a liquid restaking protocol, is particularly interesting. Liquid restaking allows users to maintain liquidity while participating in staking rewards. For a corporate entity holding substantial SOL, this could mean maximizing returns on their assets while retaining flexibility. This innovative approach highlights a sophisticated understanding of the DeFi landscape and a commitment to leveraging advanced protocols for treasury management. Currently, the exact timeline and the name of the target South Korean firm have not been disclosed. However, the announcement itself has generated considerable buzz, indicating the market’s anticipation for further details on this significant development. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for the SOL Reserve Company? The establishment of a SOL reserve company in South Korea presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges. Understanding these aspects is crucial for stakeholders. Potential Benefits: Increased Institutional Adoption: A Nasdaq-listed company establishing such a venture can pave the way for more traditional firms to explore crypto treasuries. Market Stability: Large, strategic holdings can contribute to the stability of the SOL ecosystem. Regional Economic Growth: The presence of a major crypto firm can attract talent and investment to South Korea’s digital economy. Enhanced Trust: Operating within a regulated framework through a publicly listed entity can build greater trust among investors. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: South Korea has a evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, and navigating this will be key. Market Volatility: While SOL has shown significant growth, all cryptocurrencies are subject to price fluctuations. Operational Complexities: Managing large digital asset treasuries requires robust security and compliance protocols. Why is South Korea a Key Market for a SOL Reserve Company? South Korea stands out as a strategic choice for DeFi Development’s expansion. The nation boasts a highly tech-savvy population with a strong interest in digital assets. It has a robust financial infrastructure and a growing ecosystem of blockchain innovation. Moreover, the South Korean government has been actively working towards developing clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, which can provide a more predictable environment for corporate ventures. By positioning a SOL reserve company in this dynamic market, DeFi Development aims to tap into a significant user base and potentially influence broader institutional adoption of Solana in Asia. This move could also foster stronger ties between the global DeFi sector and the vibrant South Korean tech scene. In conclusion, DeFi Development’s plan to launch a SOL reserve company in South Korea is a monumental step for institutional crypto adoption. By strategically partnering with Fragmetric and acquiring a local firm, they are setting a precedent for how major corporations can integrate digital assets into their core financial strategies. This development not only highlights the growing maturity of the Solana ecosystem but also underscores South Korea’s pivotal role in the future of global finance. As more details emerge, the industry will be watching closely to see the full impact of this ambitious venture. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main purpose of DeFi Development launching a SOL reserve company? The primary purpose is to strategically hold Solana (SOL) in its corporate treasury, diversify assets, gain exposure to the SOL ecosystem’s growth, and establish a strong presence in the South Korean market for digital asset management. 2. Who is Fragmetric, and what is its role in this plan? Fragmetric is a SOL-based liquid restaking protocol. It will partner with DeFi Development to facilitate the acquisition of a publicly listed South Korean firm, likely contributing expertise in optimizing the yield and utility of the held SOL through innovative restaking strategies. 3. Why did DeFi Development choose South Korea for this initiative? South Korea was chosen due to its tech-savvy population, strong interest in digital assets, robust financial infrastructure, and the government’s efforts to develop clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, offering a strategic environment for growth. 4. What are the potential benefits of this SOL reserve company for the broader crypto market? This initiative could significantly boost institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, contribute to the stability of the SOL ecosystem through large holdings, stimulate regional economic growth, and enhance trust in digital assets by operating within a regulated corporate structure. 5. When will more specific details about the South Korean firm and operational plans be released? Specific details, including the name of the target South Korean firm and the exact timeline for operational plans, have not yet been disclosed.

However, the company has denied the accusation and says it filed the breach with regulators and contained the issue within hours. According to the report , the data breach in question likely occurred in early 2023 and was orchestrated by members of Scattered Spider, a cybercriminal group known for targeting corporations with social engineering tactics. A complex phishing attack Investigators say the hackers gained access to internal Crypto.com systems by impersonating IT staff and tricking employees into handing over credentials. Once inside, they reportedly accessed sensitive user information. The attackers, including then-teenager Noah Urban, allegedly used stolen personal data, some of it obtained via a compromised UPS system, to support their phishing operation. Bloomberg’s investigation links the incident to a bigger spree in which Scattered Spider infiltrated over 200 companies across different sectors using similar tactics. In Crypto.com’s case, the breach reportedly affected a limited set of users, though the exact scope remains unclear due to the platform’s initially silent handling of the matter. Critics have argued that Crypto.com’s failure to publicly disclose the breach in a timely and transparent manner may have put affected users at further risk. Blockchain sleuth ZachXBT accused the exchange of deliberately covering up the incident and claimed it wasn’t the first time the platform had been linked to undisclosed security lapses. See below. ZachXBT @zachxbt · Follow Replying to @cryptocom Bad news: Your team covered up a breach that impacted the personal information of your users 4:06 PM · Sep 21, 2025 1.6K Reply Copy link Read 118 replies Some industry observers also questioned whether the exchange had adequately notified impacted users, noting that such incidents could expose them to phishing, identity theft, or follow-up attacks. Crypto.com downplays allegations In response, Crypto.com has strongly pushed back against the cover-up claims. A company spokesperson told crypto media that the firm had filed a “Notice of Data Security incident” with the U.S. Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) and also submitted reports to the relevant regulators. Crypto.com has stressed that the incident was quickly identified and contained within a few hours. “The incident included exposure of limited PII data affecting a very small number of individuals,” the spokesperson said, while claiming that no customer funds were accessed or placed at risk. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has also spoken up regarding Bloomberg’s claims and described the report as based on “uninformed sources.” “I want to directly and clearly address some misinformation spreading from uninformed sources….any suggestion that we did not report or disclose a security incident is completely unfounded,” Marszalek wrote on X. Centralised exchanges under fire Just as the dust was beginning to settle around past exchange breaches, the Bloomberg revelations have stirred fresh doubts about how secure user data really is on centralized platforms. Coinbase, a major name in the crypto exchange market, found itself at the center of a major data leak that compromised the personal information of over 69,000 users. Unlike Crypto.com, the Coinbase breach was directly the result of insider misconduct at TaskUs, a third-party customer support vendor it had employed. According to court filings, a TaskUs employee named Ashita Mishra and her accomplices stole user records over several months and sold them to hackers who later used the data for impersonation scams. No funds were lost, but Coinbase came under a lot of heat for failing to promptly report the incident to its customers, leaving many exposed to phishing attempts and identity theft risks. The fallout forced Coinbase to sever ties with TaskUs, overhaul its support operations, and spend as much as $400 million on remediation efforts.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s value has decreased $1025.8 after achieving a new ATH of $1079.07 in the past 24 hours. If traders continue booking profits, the BNB price might see a further dip, and the next target could be above $990. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,654.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $1025.8, as bears target $990. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 4.87 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $1000 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,654.04 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. Heading into September, BNB is trading at approximately $854.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-22 07:48:37

If you are currently involved in NEIROETH/USDT perpetual futures, this news demands your immediate attention. Understanding the details and preparing your strategy is crucial for navigating this change effectively. What Does This Binance NEIROETH Delisting Mean for Your Trades? Binance has officially declared its decision to delist the NEIROETH/USDT perpetual futures contract. This critical event is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. UTC on September 26. For those holding positions, understanding the implications is crucial. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract in the crypto world that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiry date. They are popular for their leverage opportunities, but also carry significant risks. The impending delisting means that this specific contract will no longer be available for trading on Binance’s platform. Traders must prepare for the cessation of trading for this particular contract. It is not just about closing positions; it is about understanding the broader market reaction and managing your portfolio effectively. Why Do Exchanges Initiate a Delisting? Exchanges like Binance often delist contracts or tokens for various reasons. These can include low liquidity, which means not enough buyers and sellers are actively trading the asset, making price discovery difficult and increasing volatility. Regulatory concerns can also play a role, as can a project’s overall activity and community engagement. Sometimes, a project might simply fail to meet the exchange’s listing standards over time. A delisting can significantly impact traders. It often leads to increased selling pressure as users rush to close their positions before the deadline. This can result in sharp price movements, potentially causing losses for those who are unprepared. Navigating the Aftermath: Your Action Plan for the Binance NEIROETH Delisting Effective risk management becomes paramount during such periods. Do not wait until the last minute to act. Proactive measures can mitigate potential losses and ensure a smoother transition. Here are some actionable insights: Close Positions: Ensure all open NEIROETH/USDT perpetual futures positions are closed before the delisting time. Binance will automatically settle any remaining positions at that exact moment. Withdraw Assets: If you hold NEIROETH tokens, consider withdrawing them to a personal wallet or another exchange that supports the asset. This proactive step helps you maintain control over your funds. Monitor Announcements: Always stay updated with official Binance announcements. They often provide detailed instructions and timelines for such events. Beyond NEIROETH: Lessons for Futures Traders The Binance NEIROETH delisting serves as a potent reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. Projects and contracts can come and go, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance and adaptability. Diversifying your portfolio across various assets and trading strategies can help mitigate the impact of such individual delistings. Relying too heavily on one contract or asset can expose you to undue risk. Regularly checking news from reputable sources and official exchange announcements is essential. Informed decisions are always the best decisions in the fast-paced crypto world. The upcoming Binance NEIROETH delisting is a significant event for affected traders. By understanding the reasons behind such actions and taking timely, decisive steps, you can navigate this change effectively. Always prioritize risk management and stay informed to protect your investments in the volatile crypto landscape.

52088796,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=825089,1758527723,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52088796.jpeg,Binance Coin’s Epic 10% Rally: Which Best Altcoins Will Explode Next?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-buy-bnb-nears-1100-weekend-rally/,"Over the weekend, Binance Coin ($BNB) surged by more than 10%, rallying up to $1,087 before leveling off slightly below that mark. While other cryptocurrencies remained largely flat, $BNB remains in a ‘price discovery’ phase, and it could reach new highs soon with strong-enough momentum. While history suggests another potential rebound, the market’s upside momentum is spilling over into altcoins. This season, the best altcoins , such as Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , and Binance coin ($BNB), are quickly gaining traction. BNB On-Chain Signals Turn Bullish — Is This the Spark for the Best Altcoins? $BNB has already dipped slightly from its ATH and could correct toward the 20-period exponential moving average (EMA) near $1,012, or the 50-period EMA around $974, which was a historical support line in previous bull runs. On-chain data from Gael Gallot indicates a healthy consolidation above the $970 support level , characterized by rising trading volume and a bullish long-short ratio of 17.71 in derivatives markets (which is a bullish observation). This means that, even if $BNB’s price dips below $970, it could rebound and possibly hit $1,200 by year end. $BNB has been steadily rallying since the beginning of-September, forming an ascending triangle after clearing the $1,050 resistance. This consolidation suggests bullish momentum, with a potential breakout if the price holds above the trendline. Moreover, $BNB’s NUPL currently stands at 0.44 , its highest level by far, suggesting that holders are sitting on moderate unrealized gains, consistent with both optimism and anxiety. A look at Binance’s $BNB-$USDT perpetual market reveals that longs are outpacing shorts by 1.91 to 1 , with mildly negative funding, pointing to a bullish sentiment. However, there may be slight pressure for longs (due to funding rate). If momentum holds, BNB could reach its cup-and-handle breakout target near $1,250, and climb towards the 2.618 Fibonacci extension ($1,565), echoing its parabolic run in 2020–2021 . Additionally, BNB’s bullish momentum could act as a catalyst for the wider crypto market, paving the way for the best altcoins to explode next. 1. Best Wallet Token Is Redefining Safe Crypto Storage — and Investors Are Cashing In On track to capture 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet market by 2026, Best Wallet offers multi-wallet functionality, supporting Ethereum, Bitcoin, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, and Base, with over 50 blockchains still to come, including Ton. Upcoming features include market intel analytics for more informed decision making, in-app staking, a crypto-fiat card, news feed, and MEV protection. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the backbone of the Best wallet ecosystem, offering several high-utility benefits, including reduced transaction fees, governance rights, early access to the best crypto presales , higher staking yields, and exclusive iGaming bonuses. With Fireblocks MPC-CMP security and an in-app presale model that eliminates mirror-site risks, $BEST offers the best of both worlds: functional utility and risk mitigation. The $BEST wallet token has already raised $16M in presale and is continuing to attract strong traction (a whale bought $70K 20 days ago ). The token is currently trading at $0.025675, and if our $BEST price predictions play out , the token could reach $0.05106175 by 2026 and $0.07 by 2030. This could turn your $100 investment to roughly $199 (99% increase), and $272 (173% increase) respectively. Additionally, you can stake your $BEST tokens for an 83% APY, amounting to roughly $183 in a year’s time, without factoring in token price changes. $BEST positions itself as a serious contender for beginner and advanced traders looking for safe crypto storage, modern trading tools, and access to the best and newest crypto presales in the sector. Join the $BEST presale today before the next price jump tomorrow. 2. PEPENODE: The Community-Driven Coin Poised for Explosive Growth Rewriting the meme coin playbook, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is the first virtual mine-to-earn project, merging sustainable tokenomics, innovative DeFi mechanics, and gamified mining into a single dynamic ecosystem. Instead of simply buying and holding $PEPENODE, you can build out virtual server rooms, deploy and optimize mining nodes, and compete for rewards based on strategy and activity. Besides, Pepenode’s unique approach eliminates the need for costly hardware, offering a scalable and gamified environment that grows in line with community participation. Additionally, holders can enjoy staking yields available during presale (970% APY), flexible node ownership, and rewards for top performance in trending meme coins . With $1.3M already raised in the presale, the cost of 1 $PEPENODE today is $0.0010702 per token. Adding to the momentum, the recent whale buy of $94.1k has further boosted confidence in the project. According to our analysts’ $PEPENODE price prediction , the token could climb to $0.0031 by the end of 2025, which would value a $200 investment today at about $579 (+190% APY) from price appreciation alone. By 2026, if the price reaches $0.0077, your $200 could grow to over $1,438. And by 2030, at a potential $0.0095 price, you’d be looking at a whopping $1,775. However, the real accelerator is staking. With a dynamic staking APY of 970%, that same $200 could compound into roughly $2,140 by year-end, even before factoring in token price gains. With explosive growth potential and yield-generating mechanics, $PEPENODE is shaping up to be the next crypto to explode in the altcoin market. Pepenode transforms passive holding into an interactive and yield-driven experience, making it one of the top utility-packed meme coins to watch in 2025. Join the $PEPENODE presale today before the next price jump in two days. 3. $BNB: The Powerhouse Fueling Binance’s Ecosystem Growth Binance Coin ($BNB) is a multi-utility powerhouse across both centralized and decentralized layers, giving traders fee advantages and deep integration across the Binance and BNB Chain ecosystems. You can enjoy up to 25% discounts on Spot & Margin trading fees (and up to 10% on Futures) if you pay fees using $BNB, an essential edge for maximizing returns in fast-paced markets. You can also use $BNB to pay gas fees on the BNB Chain and enjoy fast, low-cost smart contracts execution, swaps, and DeFi operations. Additionally, the token gives access to exclusive launch events such as Launchpool, Megadrop, and HODLer airdrops, letting traders get in early on new tokens. $BNB is flexing hard this week, trading at $1,025 after a 10% pump in the last 7 days. With a market cap north of $142B and a hefty 24h volume of $4.35B, Binance coin’s liquidity game stays strong. The token has also surpassed $1.9T in cumulative DEX volume on the Binance Smart Chain. $BNB’s 139.18M circulating supply reflects no sneaky emissions to dilute the holders’ bags. While FDV tracks closely to its market cap at $142B, the steady volume-to-market cap ratio of 2.74% indicates traders’ continued interest to keep this coin in play. So, Binance coin is holding its ground as a top-five giant, continuing to prove that it still has plenty of firepower for the next leg up. Buy your $BNB on Binance and other top exchanges (like MEXC ), while $BEST and $PEPENODE can be purchased from their official website. This is not financial advice.

Recently, the crypto community was abuzz with speculation, but leading exchange Bybit has decisively stepped forward to address and quash widespread Bybit hacking rumors . This prompt and clear communication is crucial for maintaining trust and stability in the volatile digital asset space, reassuring users about the safety of their investments. Addressing the Bybit Hacking Rumors Head-On Bybit, a prominent global cryptocurrency exchange, recently took to its official X account to strongly deny any claims of a security breach. The exchange’s statement was unequivocal: all user assets remain secure, and its robust trading systems and operational infrastructure are functioning completely normally. This direct approach helps to dispel fear and uncertainty that often accompany unverified reports. When such rumors surface, they can trigger panic selling and significant market volatility. Bybit’s swift response demonstrates its commitment to transparency and protecting its user base from the adverse effects of misinformation. Users can continue to trade and manage their portfolios with confidence, knowing their funds are safeguarded. Bybit’s Unwavering Commitment to Security The core of Bybit’s reassurance lies in its advanced security protocols. The exchange highlighted that it has established an industry-leading security framework, designed to protect community assets against a myriad of potential threats. This comprehensive framework includes: Multi-layered Defenses: Implementing various security measures at different levels to prevent unauthorized access. Advanced Encryption: Ensuring all sensitive data and communications are protected with robust encryption standards. Continuous Monitoring: Proactively watching for suspicious activities and potential vulnerabilities around the clock. These elements work in tandem to ensure the integrity of its platform. Furthermore, Bybit reiterated its full commitment to safeguarding its users’ investments. This isn’t just a statement; it’s a fundamental promise that underpins their operations. The exchange actively encourages its users to rely solely on verified official channels for any updates or critical information, especially when it pertains to sensitive topics like security or potential breaches. This emphasis on official communication is vital in preventing the spread of false Bybit hacking rumors . The Origin of the Bybit Hacking Rumors The recent wave of speculation regarding a Bybit hack appears to have originated from posts on Xiaohongshu, a popular Chinese social media platform. These unsubstantiated claims suggested that the exchange had suffered a significant security breach, reportedly losing Ethereum (ETH) worth an astonishing $1.5 billion. Such figures, if true, would represent one of the largest crypto hacks in history, making Bybit’s swift denial even more critical. It is important for the crypto community to understand that social media, while a powerful tool for communication, can also be a breeding ground for unverified information. Users should always exercise caution and cross-reference any alarming claims with official statements from the affected entities. The rapid spread of these particular Bybit hacking rumors serves as a stark reminder of this necessity. Navigating Crypto Information: Why Official Sources Matter In the dynamic and often speculative cryptocurrency market, discerning reliable information from baseless rumors is paramount. The incident involving the Bybit hacking rumors underscores the critical importance of seeking information exclusively from official and verified channels. Platforms like X, official blogs, and dedicated support pages of exchanges are designed to provide accurate and timely updates directly to users. Relying on unofficial sources, especially those on less moderated social media platforms, can lead to panic, poor investment decisions, and even exposure to phishing scams. Bybit’s advice to stick to verified channels is not just about their platform, but a best practice for all crypto participants. Being vigilant and informed is your best defense against misinformation. In conclusion, Bybit has unequivocally addressed and dismissed the recent Bybit hacking rumors , affirming the security of all user assets and the normal functioning of its systems. The exchange’s robust security framework and commitment to user protection remain steadfast. This incident highlights the ongoing challenge of misinformation in the crypto space and reinforces the critical need for users to consult only official sources for reliable information. Staying informed directly from the source is the strongest shield against panic and false narratives. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What were the recent Bybit hacking rumors about?

The rally took shares to 83,400 won, close to about $60, and boosted the KOSPI benchmark by 0.8%. Local reports also indicate that Samsung’s 12-layer HBM3E product recently passed Nvidia’s qualification tests, though the company has not yet issued an official statement. Passing the tests means its chips can be deployed in the AI accelerators that train models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, allowing the firm to compete with SK Hynix’s premier offerings. Goldman Sachs sees Samsung’s clearance as a positive development Shares of Samsung are up about 20% this month, supported by bets that demand for AI will tighten supplies of commodity memory chips , an area where the tech conglomerate continues to lead. Foreign investors have also snapped up more than $2 billion of the company’s stock in September alone. Adding to the momentum, speculation is growing that the company has finally cleared Nvidia’s qualification tests. Talk of Samsung’s qualifying has been around for months, but investors are only paying closer attention now, nearly 19 months since development started and after a series of delays. Citigroup analyst Peter Lee now expects an official announcement by late September or early October. However, Samsung may ship only a small number of units to Nvidia this year, seeing as competitors SK Hynix and Micron have already filled most of the demand. Even so, the move is seen as a major step for the company, which has been under pressure over delays that cast doubt on its technical edge. Goldman Sachs analysts noted that even with investor expectations tempered by delays, Nvidia’s nod would still represent an encouraging development for the company. Giuni Lee, an analyst at the bank, stated that if the deal is confirmed, “it would be a clear indication that the company is able to meet the highest standard in the HBM industry.” He added that the development might raise the chances that Nvidia will approve Samsung’s HBM4 chips. Nvidia recently revealed its planned investment in Intel Samsung has been providing HBM3E chips to AMD and Broadcom, though it only recently secured Nvidia’s approval. SK Hynix, its key rival, was the first in the industry to mass-produce HBM3E chips last year, with Micron Technology Inc. following suit. While the approval brings Samsung closer to SK Hynix and Micron, SK Hynix has already announced the completion of its HBM4 development, news that sent its stock to all-time highs, leaving Micron and Samsung still working to complete their own versions. Nevertheless, Samsung has shown progress outside its core memory business. Its $16.5 billion agreement with Tesla in July revived confidence in its foundry arm, which was previously viewed as a fading part of the business. Meanwhile, Nvidia recently disclosed a $5 billion funding commitment to Intel and a plan to collaborate on next-generation chips for PCs and servers. Analysts suggest this supports the Trump administration’s campaign to restore Intel’s competitiveness. According to reports, Nvidia is set to acquire Intel’s common stock at $23.28 per share. The deal would give the semiconductor company over 4% of Intel. Jensen Huang commented on the deal, “This historic collaboration tightly integrates Nvidia’s AI and accelerated computing technology with Intel’s CPUs and vast x86 ecosystem, merging two world-class platforms into one.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|AMD|Broadcom|Intel|Micron|Nvidia|Samsung|SK Hynix,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-22 08:00:14

XRP Explosion Ahead? In a September 21 video address, he framed the move as a classic continuation sequence following a run at all-time highs and a corrective “falling wedge” that has now been retraced. “I think something like this is what you’re going to see once again… this actually could take you to that $19.27 mark,” he said, adding that his “price prediction remains the same.” The crux of the thesis is historical rhyme and pattern logic. “Just like 2017, we ran into an all-time high… and essentially, we are pulling back in and around it,” the analyst said, describing the pullback as a falling wedge—a structure he classifies as continuation when it appears in an uptrend. “The falling wedge has been completed. You have run or retraced the entire wedge… Since we engulfed that and made a target, we have now been pulling back once more, again, in the form of a falling wedge.” In his view, this sets up an “engulfment of the entire pullback… and then leads to continuation.” Related Reading: Next XRP ‘Monster Leg’ Will Start No Earlier Than 2026: Analyst He also points to a potential cup-and-handle spanning the current cycle, cautioning that its measured-move objective would sit “significantly higher than $19.27,” but that his public focus is the nearer six-month path. “It’s a reliable pattern. It’s really a story of trend continuation,” he said, emphasizing that when assets “break into new all-time highs, typically they continue and will actually reach that target.” The timeline he outlines runs roughly through late March 2026. The $19.27 waypoint is not new for ALLINCRYPTO. He has repeatedly telegraphed that objective across social channels in recent weeks, tying it to a multi-leg advance after consolidation at prior highs. “XRP’s chart [is] setting up for a next leg, which, over time, may be set to reach a price target of $19.27,” he wrote in one post amplifying the thesis to his followers. In earlier messaging, he framed the scenario as “price discovery” into the $19s if resistance continues to resolve. 🚨 📈 A look at $XRP‘s recent movements and where we could expect to see the token going, closer towards our long-term price target of $19.20 pic.twitter.com/wEEM4CFPLs — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) September 21, 2025 At publication time on September 22, XRP trades near $2.80, implying that the analyst’s six-month objective would require on the order of a 6–7x advance from the current spot. The pair’s short-term context remains choppy after a multi-week range at the round-number handle. Related Reading: Pundit Predicts XRP Price Crash Below $3, Here’s Why Pattern mechanics are central to the call. In classical terms, a falling-wedge retrace that completes to its origin and then resolves upward often precedes trend continuation, while a cup-and-handle breakout seeks to clear prior highs on expanding participation. The analyst’s near-dated map therefore hinges on two confirmations: maintaining the recent uptrend structure after the wedge retrace and securing a decisive breakout “once again” through resistance to re-enter price discovery. “We have spoken about how potentially this could be a major cup and handle,” he said. “We haven’t given you the price prediction on the back end of that… [but] I actually think that XRP… stands a pretty good chance of getting to the original price prediction that we gave of $19.27.” Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",XRP News|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRP Price Analysis|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-09-22 08:00:44

Data shows that 135.54 million XRP worth $397.03 million was moved from an unknown wallet to another, followed by a transfer of 141.81 million XRP valued at $415.62 million, also between unidentified addresses, according to on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Whale Alert on September 22. The large-scale movements come at a time when XRP is facing renewed selling pressure in line with the broader cryptocurrency market. At press time, the token was trading at $2.82, down 6.27% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, XRP has dropped 7.23%, while its market cap slipped to $168.3 billion after shedding $11.2 billion in a single day. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, XRP is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $3 but above the longer-term 200-day SMA of $2.56, reflecting mixed momentum with short-term weakness against a relatively stronger long-term trend. The 14-day RSI stands at 49.61, a neutral zone indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This setup suggests consolidation, with potential support around $2.56 and resistance near $3. The whale transactions point to heightened activity among large holders, often a precursor to major market shifts. Historically, transfers of this magnitude have coincided with either accumulation phases or preparations for large-scale sell-offs. XRP’s key support to watch Meanwhile, cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez highlighted key XRP price levels to watch. In an X post on September 17, he projected that XRP could find support at $2.78, a level that has previously served as a strong demand zone. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Should sellers maintain control, testing $2.78 remains a possibility, and a rebound from this level could spark renewed buying pressure and push XRP back toward $3, while a breakdown below would likely confirm further downside risk. Notably, XRP’s selling pressure persists despite some bullish developments, such as the launch of the first exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) in the United States through the REX-Osprey XRPR ETF. Despite its impressive debut , the fund has so far failed to spark meaningful upward price momentum.

According to a tweet from crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull, XRP recorded $112 million in trading volume on Upbit and $77 million on Binance within just 12 hours. The data was presented in a heatmap, which highlighted significant capital rotation into XRP across multiple exchanges. At the time of the update, XRP was priced at $2.97, maintaining a market capitalization of $178 billion. With a futures trading volume of $3.69 billion and spot volume of $755 million in the last 24 hours, the figures indicate heightened participation in XRP markets. The chart also showed additional contributions from Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, Crypto.com, and Kraken, though Upbit and Binance remained the most dominant.

This heatmap screams rotation. Pay attention to $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/fzvSkEemQT — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) September 21, 2025 Community Reaction The tweet drew responses from other users who also noted the momentum in XRP markets. Primal Eth commented that the asset was showing “huge action” and suggested that a significant move could soon follow. X Finance Bull responded by affirming this view, stating that the current rotation in trading volume was “screaming next leg up.” This sentiment reflected a shared anticipation that XRP’s recent strength could be the beginning of a broader price movement. Another user, XRPLGOD, added that the surge in liquidity across Asian markets was “no coincidence.” They further emphasized that when XRP gains attention, it tends not to lose momentum quickly. According to them, the current trading pattern appears to be “the start of something much bigger.” Such comments highlighted the optimism within sections of the community that see the rising exchange activity as a precursor to further price appreciation. Analysis of Market Dynamics The data revealed in the heatmap showed a strong concentration of volume in Asian exchanges, particularly Upbit , which alone accounted for more than $112 million. This dominance suggests that market demand in Asia is playing a critical role in XRP’s present trading behavior. Binance followed closely, reinforcing the significance of global liquidity hubs in shaping near-term price dynamics. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The distribution of trading activity also suggested a shift in how liquidity is rotating among exchanges. While traditional U.S. platforms such as Coinbase showed $30.77 million in 12-hour volume, the figures from Upbit and Binance were considerably higher. This supports the observation that much of the current momentum is being driven by Asian markets, which appear to be absorbing a significant share of activity. As XRP continues to hold its position above $2.97 with a market cap of $178 billion, the rising liquidity points toward a strengthening position in the broader digital asset market. The commentary from X Finance Bull and other users reflects a belief that the ongoing rotation could lead to the next major upward phase for the asset. While short-term fluctuations remain possible, the sustained growth in trading activity across major exchanges, particularly in Asia , has positioned XRP as one of the most closely watched assets in the current cycle.

52089588,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=825106,1758529117,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52089588.jpeg,AxCNH and KRW1 Stablecoins Launch in Asia as $BEST Token Soars Past $16M on Presale,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/china-launches-first-stablecoin-adoption-spikes-best-wallet-gains/,"The AxCNH, a Chinese Yuan-pegged stablecoin issued by AnchorX, was officially launched on September 17, 2025 in Hong Kong. BDACS also launched KRW1, a South Korean Won-pegged stablecoin, the following day. Why do these moves matter? Because the crypto race is heating up. While America’s new federal stablecoin framework ( the GENIUS Act in 2025 ) sets strict issuance and transparency rules, countries like Hong Kong and South Korea are also accelerating regulatory frameworks to oversee stablecoin activity. Retail users also stand to gain. Putting fiat on-chain enables near-instantaneous 24/7 cross-border settlement and brings smart contracts into the mix. This not only reduces correspondent-bank friction, but allows for programmable FX flows (like atomic swaps and other DeFi uses). And with stablecoins redefining how money moves, lightweight crypto apps like Best Wallet provide an accessible gateway to onboard more people into the crypto world. Powering the Best Wallet ecosystem, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has already secured over $16M in its presale as a statement to this market shift. Currently in phase 2 of its roadmap, this crypto project bridges the gap between crypto and CeFi with effortless onramping, multi-chain support, low-cost swaps, and more features like derivatives trading and a debit card in the pipeline. Stablecoin Market Heats Up: What AxCNH and KRW1 Mean for Global Crypto Growth Unlike traditional financial systems, the blockchain never sleeps. With no business hours or potential correspondent delays to tie it down, both individuals and businesses trading on-chain benefit from a reliable, around-the-clock solution. This also makes currency faster and more easily accessible, even for cross-border payments or transfers, giving people real reasons to use blockchain over legacy systems. More importantly, being fiat-backed and overcollateralized, these stablecoins align with global regulatory expectations, raising institutions and retail users’ trust and confidence to embrace crypto. Unlike traditional financial systems, stablecoins also rely on oracle networks like Chainlink, which enable real-time, tamper-resistant data and automated, trustless smart contracts for lending and DeFi trading. For newcomers still uncertain about entering the crypto landscape, stablecoins offer a familiar entry point, as they resemble fiat currencies and create a safe environment for traders to operate without concerns about volatility. With that base, it becomes easier to explore other digital assets and DeFi applications. This is where Best Wallet and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) also come in as beginner-friendly crypto tools with building momentum behind them. Best Wallet Makes Crypto Easy While Its Native $BEST Token Raises $16M+ in Presale Best Wallet is one of the leading hot wallets built to outperform legacy wallets like MetaMask. It provides traders with a streamlined multi-chain hub that directly supports top networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BSC, and Base (with 60+ more chains coming in the near future). Some of the other perks of Best wallet include: Non-custodial key management backed by Multi-Party Computation . You don’t have to worry about protecting your secret key, since it’s virtually unbreakable. Effortless cross-chain moves, available in one dashboard – think Ethereum staking through Lido and Rocket Pool integrations or low-cost cross-swaps across dozens of DEXes. A built-in filter to hide suspicious tokens, which adds an extra security layer when exploring decentralized projects. Besides, the app’s WalletConnect compatibility allows you to connect to other external crypto platforms like derivatives exchanges and other dApps. With this, you can leverage more advanced strategies and enable seamless yield farming across more ecosystems. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the backbone of this ecosystem, engineered to reward loyal and early adopters. By holding $BEST, you can benefit from reduced in-app transaction fees, early access to vetted new presales, and higher staking rewards in the app’s upcoming staking aggregator. Best Wallet’s upcoming tokens feature is particularly attractive to degens hunting for new meme coin presales and other early-stage opportunities. With all projects vetted and smart contract audits available, it’s easier than ever to find trusted projects and avoid honeypots or other scams. $BEST also integrates trading incentives with governance, creating upside beyond speculation. By giving holders a direct role and voting rights on the app’s future direction, $BEST ensures its base stays loyal and active as the project’s roadmap progresses. With rapid presale traction and ambitions to capture 40% wallet market share by 2026, $BEST offers plenty of room for growth. Its fundraiser is still ongoing as the dev team is working behind the scenes to introduce more advanced features (like NFT support, a crypto debit card, and a staking aggregator coming in phase 3). The $BEST token has already raised over $16M and continues to gain traction. The ICO has even attracted several whale buys of $70.2K , $50.9K , and $49.5K , further boosting confidence in the token. $BEST is now trading at $0.025675, which means a $500 entry today might be worth around $685 by the end of 2025 if our expert $BEST token price prediction holds. Zooming out, the potential upside looks even better under bullish conditions. By 2026, $BEST could hit $0.0510, pushing your $500 stack to about $995 (a 2x move), and $0.07 by 2030, growing your investment to ~$1,360 (7x higher). On top of this, $BEST offers dynamic staking rewards (currently at roughly 83% APY). If the reward rate stays high in the upcoming months, you could be racking up around $915 on your $500 investment, without factoring in token price moves. With momentum building, the next price increase drops in under 12 hours. Visit the $BEST token presale to get ahead of the curve. This is not financial advice.

Binance Launches New Spot Trading Pairs and Trading Bot Services on September 23 According to the statement, IMX/USDC, NMR/TRY and TWT/USDC trading pairs will be available on Binance Spot as of 11:00 AM on September 23. Additionally, Trading Bot services will also be activated for these trading pairs on the same date and time. Users will be able to execute automated trading strategies on IMX/USDC, NMR/TRY, and TWT/USDC via Spot Algo Orders. Binance emphasized that this step will increase trading efficiency, particularly for retail and professional investors. The statement also emphasized that the Turkish Lira (TRY) is a fiat currency and does not represent any digital asset. This allows Binance to expand its trading options in Turkish Lira and facilitate access for local investors. Meanwhile, Binance users will be able to take advantage of discounted taker fees on existing and new USDC spot and margin trading pairs. This campaign will continue indefinitely and provide users with a cost advantage. This move by Binance is part of its strategy to both increase global trading diversity and offer special opportunities to regional investors. Analysts predict that TRY trading pairs, in particular, could boost trading volume in the Turkish market. *This is not investment advice.

Market data shows strong accumulation with $66M outflows and 76% of traders holding long. RSI at 54 and rising EMAs leave room for upside if resistance levels break cleanly. Key Levels to Watch XRP is trading around $2.8, holding just above the 50 EMA on the 3-day chart. The moving average is projected to meet the price at $2.77, making it the next level to watch. Analyst EGRAG CRYPTO said , “If we break through this target, we could see further downside, which isn’t what we want to hear.” Notably, the $2.77 support is short-term, while $2.65 remains the most critical area for the broader trend. This level has been a pivot in past cycles. A hold above $2.65 keeps the higher timeframe outlook intact. If it fails, further supports are seen at $2.50, $2.37–$2.41, and $1.85 at the 200 EMA. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X Throw Back Phase Confirmed EGRAG also noted that XRP has completed a 5-wave downside move, with the asset reaching $2.82. He described this as the “Throw Back Process,” confirming a projection they made earlier. The move followed rejection at $3.13, which has acted as a strong resistance point. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO/X Support remains at $2.82, with a possible retest of $2.65 if selling pressure continues. On the upside, a recovery above $2.94, where the 21 EMA and 33 SMA converge, would be the first step toward stabilization. If achieved, XRP could then test $3.13 and $3.40. Signs of Accumulation Analyst Erica Hazel pointed to buying activity, stating, “76% of traders are long (Binance L/S ratio 3.34),” with more than $66 million in outflows over the past two days. She suggested that larger players may be positioning for higher prices. Hazel added that XRP recently broke out of a descending trendline in place since mid-July. The retest of $2.95 held, confirming it as support. As long as the asset holds above $2.95 and $2.85, the bullish setup remains valid. XRP faces resistance at $2.96 and $3.13. A move above these levels could open the way to $3.31. The next major test sits at $3.64, which Hazel said, $XRP is grinding higher after retesting $2.95 support. • 76% of traders are long (Binance L/S ratio 3.34) • $66M+ outflows in 48h = clear accumulation • RSI neutral at 54, EMA still holding Next key test: $3.64 resistance. Break it, and bulls take full control. #XRP #Ripple pic.twitter.com/4GBY5wfuaV — Erica Hazel (@Erica__Hazel) September 22, 2025 Situated at 54, this value of RSI suggests a neutral reading and allows space for further movement. The 50-day EMA, however, still ascends after putting in a crossing, providing support for the medium-term trend. Although volatility remains, analysts agree that all-time highs above $2.65 are a prerequisite for maintaining the general bullish outlook.

For those keenly observing the interplay between traditional finance and the nascent cryptocurrency space, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. A stronger Franc, for instance, can influence capital flows and even impact the perceived stability of fiat-backed stablecoins. UBS, a financial giant, has dramatically cut its EUR/CHF targets, signaling a significant recalibration of expectations for one of the world’s most watched currency pairs. This move highlights how traditional patterns are being challenged, forcing investors and traders to rethink their strategies. Why is the Swiss Franc Defying Expectations? The Swiss Franc has long been celebrated as a quintessential safe-haven currency, a reliable refuge during times of global economic uncertainty. Its strength is typically tied to Switzerland’s robust economy, political neutrality, and a strong current account surplus. However, its recent performance has gone beyond traditional safe-haven flows, exhibiting an unprecedented resilience that has caught many analysts off guard. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon: Aggressive Monetary Policy: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been proactive in its fight against inflation, implementing interest rate hikes that have made the Franc more attractive to yield-seeking investors. This hawkish stance contrasts with some other central banks, providing a relative advantage. Persistent Inflationary Pressures: While inflation in Switzerland might be lower than in some other major economies, the SNB’s commitment to price stability reinforces confidence in the Franc’s purchasing power. Global Economic Uncertainty: Geopolitical tensions, energy crises, and lingering supply chain issues continue to fuel demand for perceived safe assets, and the Franc fits this bill perfectly. However, its current strength suggests more than just a flight to safety; it indicates a fundamental re-evaluation of its value. Reduced SNB Intervention: Historically, the SNB has intervened to prevent excessive Franc appreciation. Recent periods have seen less direct intervention, allowing market forces to push the currency higher. This confluence of factors has created a unique environment where the Franc’s strength is not just a temporary reaction but potentially a sustained trend, challenging long-held assumptions about its equilibrium. The Dramatic Shift in EUR/CHF Targets: What Does it Mean? The EUR/CHF currency pair represents the exchange rate between the Euro and the Swiss Franc. A lower EUR/CHF value means it takes fewer Euros to buy one Swiss Franc, indicating a stronger Franc. UBS’s decision to slash its targets for this pair is a powerful statement about the Franc’s enduring strength and the Euro’s relative weakness. Previously, many analysts expected the EUR/CHF to stabilize or even recover, but UBS’s revised outlook suggests a more prolonged period of Franc dominance. This target cut signifies several key implications: Confirmation of Franc’s Strength: It validates the market’s current assessment that the Swiss Franc is fundamentally strong and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Euro’s Headwinds: It underscores the challenges facing the Eurozone, including persistent inflation, slower economic growth, and the European Central Bank’s (ECB) potentially less aggressive monetary tightening compared to the SNB. Impact on Trade: A stronger Franc makes Swiss exports more expensive and imports cheaper, affecting Switzerland’s trade balance. Conversely, it makes Eurozone goods cheaper for Swiss consumers but Eurozone exports to Switzerland less competitive. Investor Sentiment: Such a significant revision from a major bank can influence broader market sentiment, potentially encouraging other institutions to follow suit and adjust their own forecasts. The move by UBS is not just an adjustment of numbers; it reflects a fundamental shift in the underlying economic and monetary dynamics impacting these two crucial European currencies. Unpacking the UBS Forecast : A Deeper Dive into Analyst Perspectives The latest UBS forecast represents a significant recalibration of expectations for the EUR/CHF pair. While specific figures can vary, the essence of their revised outlook points towards a lower equilibrium for the pair than previously anticipated. This isn’t merely a tactical adjustment; it’s a strategic reassessment based on evolving macroeconomic realities. UBS’s rationale often includes: Divergent Monetary Policies: The SNB’s commitment to combating inflation through rate hikes, often ahead of the ECB, creates a yield differential favoring the Franc. Inflationary Differentials: While both regions face inflation, the relative success of the SNB in managing it, or at least its perceived commitment, boosts the Franc’s appeal. Economic Resilience: Switzerland’s economy has shown remarkable resilience despite global headwinds, supporting its currency. Geopolitical Risk Premium: The Franc continues to benefit from its safe-haven status, with global uncertainties acting as a constant tailwind. To illustrate the magnitude of these adjustments, consider a hypothetical comparison of UBS’s old versus new targets: Time Horizon Previous EUR/CHF Target (e.g., Q3 2023) New EUR/CHF Target (e.g., Q3 2023) Change 3 Months 0.9900 0.9650 -2.52% 6 Months 0.9850 0.9500 -3.55% 12 Months 0.9800 0.9400 -4.08% (Note: These figures are illustrative and reflect the general direction of a target cut.) This table highlights a consistent downward revision across various timeframes, indicating a fundamental belief in the Franc’s sustained strength. Such a definitive stance from a leading financial institution can have a cascading effect, influencing other market participants and potentially accelerating the trend. Navigating Volatile Currency Markets : Challenges and Opportunities The current environment, characterized by a surging Swiss Franc and shifting central bank policies, presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities across global currency markets . For businesses, investors, and even everyday consumers, understanding these dynamics is paramount. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Unpredictable shifts in currency values make it harder for businesses to plan and budget, especially those engaged in international trade. Hedging Costs: Companies with exposure to the Franc might face higher costs to hedge against currency fluctuations, impacting profit margins. Investment Risk: Investors holding Euro-denominated assets or those exposed to Eurozone economies face currency depreciation risk if the EUR/CHF continues to fall. Economic Competitiveness: For Eurozone exporters, a weaker Euro against the Franc can make their goods cheaper in Switzerland but overall competitiveness can be affected by other factors. For Swiss exporters, a strong Franc makes their products more expensive internationally. Opportunities: Purchasing Power: For Swiss consumers and businesses, a stronger Franc means imported goods and services from the Eurozone become cheaper. Investment in Franc-denominated Assets: Investors seeking safe havens or capital appreciation might find Swiss bonds or other Franc-denominated assets more attractive. Arbitrage and Speculation: Experienced traders can leverage the volatility and divergent central bank policies for potential profit through strategic forex trading. Diversification: A strong Franc offers an opportunity for portfolio diversification, especially for those seeking to reduce exposure to other major currencies facing headwinds. These market conditions demand a proactive approach, with continuous monitoring of economic indicators, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments. Actionable Insights for Forex Trading Amidst Franc’s Strength For those involved in forex trading , the strengthening Swiss Franc and UBS’s revised targets offer critical insights and potential strategies. Navigating this environment requires a blend of fundamental and technical analysis, coupled with robust risk management. Key Considerations for Traders: Follow Central Bank Signals: Pay close attention to communications from the SNB and the ECB. The SNB’s continued hawkish stance or any signs of intervention will be crucial. Similarly, any unexpected shifts from the ECB could impact the EUR’s trajectory. Monitor Economic Data: Keep an eye on inflation figures, GDP growth, and employment data from both Switzerland and the Eurozone. Strong Swiss data reinforces Franc strength, while weak Eurozone data exacerbates Euro weakness. Technical Analysis: Use technical indicators to identify potential support and resistance levels for the EUR/CHF pair. A strong downtrend suggests further downside, but watch for signs of oversold conditions or potential reversals. Risk Management is Paramount: Given the volatility, always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Avoid over-leveraging, especially when market sentiment is strong in one direction. Consider Carry Trades (with caution): While the SNB has raised rates, the interest rate differential might still be favorable for holding Francs against lower-yielding currencies. However, carry trades come with inherent risks if the exchange rate moves unfavorably. Diversify Exposure: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. If you’re trading the EUR/CHF, consider balancing your portfolio with other currency pairs or asset classes to mitigate risk. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Assess whether your trading strategy aligns with the perceived long-term strength of the Franc or if you’re looking for short-term tactical plays on volatility. UBS’s forecast suggests a longer-term trend. Understanding the interplay of these factors will enable traders to make more informed decisions in a market that continues to defy conventional wisdom. A Resilient Franc in an Unpredictable World The decision by UBS to cut its EUR/CHF targets is a powerful indicator of the Swiss Franc’s remarkable and perhaps unprecedented strength. This move underscores a significant shift in global currency markets , where traditional patterns are being challenged by aggressive monetary policies, persistent inflation, and geopolitical uncertainties. The implications for the EUR/CHF pair are profound, signaling a sustained period of Franc dominance. For investors and those engaged in forex trading , the UBS forecast serves as a critical guide, emphasizing the need for adaptable strategies, robust risk management, and a keen eye on evolving macroeconomic landscapes. As the world navigates an era of economic unpredictability, the Swiss Franc stands out as a beacon of resilience, forcing a re-evaluation of established norms and offering both challenges and opportunities for the astute market participant.

This week, we’re diving deep into five crucial factors that could significantly influence where Bitcoin heads next. Cointelegraph’s latest analysis highlights these vital points, offering a roadmap for traders and enthusiasts alike. Let’s explore what truly matters for Bitcoin in the coming days, helping you stay ahead of the curve. What’s Stirring the Bitcoin Market: Price Retests and Record Liquidations? One of the most immediate and impactful concerns for the Bitcoin market is the potential retest of a critical support level. Analysts are closely watching the $112,000 mark with bated breath. A successful hold above this level could signal underlying resilience and a potential rebound, offering a glimmer of hope for bullish sentiment. Conversely, a decisive break below this support might open doors for further downside, potentially triggering a cascade of selling pressure. This makes the $112,000 threshold a significant psychological and technical battleground for traders. Moreover, the past 24 hours have seen a staggering $1.7 billion in liquidations across the crypto derivatives market, marking the largest single-day total this year. This massive event isn’t just a number; it represents a significant unwinding of leveraged positions, often triggered by rapid price movements. Such large-scale liquidations typically suggest heightened volatility and can dramatically impact short-term price action, creating both risks and opportunities for savvy investors in the Bitcoin market . Key Support Level: The $112,000 mark is crucial for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Unprecedented Liquidations: A $1.7 billion event signals extreme market turbulence and the deleveraging of speculative positions. How Will Macroeconomic Indicators Shape the Bitcoin Market This Week? Beyond the immediate charts, the broader economic landscape plays a pivotal role in shaping the Bitcoin market . Traders are keenly observing macroeconomic indicators, particularly those emanating from the United States. The possibility of additional U.S. interest rate cuts is a major talking point. Historically, lower interest rates tend to make riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive as traditional fixed-income investments yield less. This could encourage a shift of capital towards digital assets. Furthermore, the upcoming release of Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data is highly anticipated. The PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, and its results will be a critical input for future monetary policy decisions. If inflation cools more than expected, it could reinforce expectations for rate cuts, potentially boosting the Bitcoin market . Conversely, higher-than-expected inflation might lead to a more hawkish stance from the Fed, creating headwinds for risk assets. Interest Rate Speculation: Potential U.S. rate cuts could provide a tailwind for Bitcoin. PCE Data Impact: This key inflation metric will heavily influence the Federal Reserve’s stance and, by extension, market sentiment. Understanding these macro shifts is essential because they often dictate the flow of institutional capital and overall investor confidence in the digital asset space, making them vital considerations for anyone invested in Bitcoin. Are There Policy Surprises or MVRV Warnings for the Bitcoin Market? The regulatory environment can also be a game-changer for the Bitcoin market . Any major news related to U.S. policy regarding cryptocurrencies could introduce significant shifts. Positive regulatory clarity, for instance, could pave the way for broader institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance, fueling a bullish narrative. Conversely, restrictive measures or new taxes might introduce uncertainty and deter investment, causing temporary setbacks. Additionally, technical indicators like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio are providing intriguing signals. The MVRV ratio compares Bitcoin’s market capitalization to its realized capitalization (the sum of all coins valued at the price they last moved). Current signals from MVRV are suggesting a possible bull market peak. This doesn’t necessarily mean an immediate crash, but it could imply that the market is entering a period of consolidation, or perhaps even a correction, as profit-taking increases. Monitoring this indicator can offer valuable insights into potential long-term trends within the Bitcoin market . U.S. Policy Watch: Keep an eye on legislative or regulatory announcements that could reshape the crypto landscape. MVRV Indicator: Signals from this on-chain metric might point towards a potential bull market peak, suggesting caution. These diverse factors, from regulatory whispers to sophisticated on-chain analytics, paint a complex but fascinating picture of Bitcoin’s current trajectory, demanding attention from every serious participant. Navigating the Dynamic Bitcoin Market: Your Week Ahead As we navigate this dynamic week, the Bitcoin market remains a focal point for investors worldwide. From critical support levels and record liquidations indicating immediate volatility, to the looming influence of macroeconomic data and potential shifts in regulatory policy, multiple powerful forces are at play. Staying informed about these five key factors will be crucial for making well-timed decisions and protecting your portfolio. Remember, the crypto space is known for its rapid changes and high stakes, so vigilance and a clear understanding of these drivers are your best allies. Keep an eye on the charts, listen closely to the economic signals, and prepare for whatever the unpredictable Bitcoin journey brings next! Your proactive approach to understanding these market drivers can make all the difference. Frequently Asked Questions About the Bitcoin Market Q1: Why is the $112,000 level important for Bitcoin this week? A1: The $112,000 level is a critical support point. If Bitcoin can hold above it, it could signal strength and potential for recovery. A break below this level, however, might indicate further downward pressure. Q2: What do the recent $1.7 billion liquidations mean for the Bitcoin market? A2: These liquidations represent a massive unwinding of leveraged trading positions. It signifies high volatility and often precedes significant price movements as speculative bets are closed out, impacting short-term price action. Q3: How do U.S. interest rate cuts affect the Bitcoin market? A3: Generally, lower U.S. interest rates make traditional investments less attractive, encouraging investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like Bitcoin. This can lead to increased capital flow into the crypto market. Q4: What is the MVRV indicator, and what is it signaling for Bitcoin? A4: The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) indicator compares Bitcoin’s market cap to its realized cap. It’s currently signaling a possible bull market peak, suggesting that the market might be due for a period of consolidation or correction. Q5: Why is U.S. policy significant for the Bitcoin market? A5: U.S. policy can profoundly impact the Bitcoin market by providing regulatory clarity, which could foster institutional adoption, or by introducing restrictive measures that create uncertainty and deter investment. Any major policy news is closely watched. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin market helpful?

Despite market cycles and growing competition, CoinW has remained committed to its long-term mission of “Here For Crypto,” continuously advancing its product ecosystem around spot trading.

WConnect: Bridging Across Web3 Ecosystems Beyond product upgrades, CoinW leverages its flagship initiative, WConnect , to foster collaboration across Web3 ecosystems. Since its launch, WConnect has evolved from a community-focused AMA series into a cross-ecosystem platform integrating content education, project incubation, and trading incentives. Initially, WConnect engaged the community through AMAs, exploring opportunities for user participation and spotlighting trending projects. It then partnered with Sui Network to launch “WConnect｜Sui Season”, establishing the cross-ecosystem collaboration model that combined technical sharing, trading activities, and project incubation, effectively validating its ecosystem value.

Recently, WConnect teamed up with Mantle Network for “ WConnect｜Mantle Season “, focusing on on-chain finance, DeFi, and RWA opportunities. Through AMAs, onchain tasks, and trading & staking rewards, it has created organic interactions between users, developers, and projects, significantly boosting ecosystem engagement. Through continuous innovation, WConnect has grown from a single event initiative into a central hub connecting projects, users, and trading activities, becoming a key driver of CoinW’s spot trading ecosystem. Marching Into a New Era of Spot Trading with CoinW Looking ahead, CoinW will continue strengthening its spot trading ecosystem, focusing on liquidity, matching efficiency, and user experience. Clear fees and smooth trading paths reduce friction, making trading easier and more efficient. The Mainstream Crypto Trading will keep improving order book depth and risk management.

WConnect continues to drive ecosystem synergy. Live sessions, guided tasks, and trading incentives connect projects, communities, and trading. Together, the Mainstream Crypto Trading, GemW On-chain Trading, and WConnect form a complementary three-pillar spot trading ecosystem, balancing stability, innovation, and engagement.

The global crypto market capitalization declined by 3.77% the past 24 hours to $3.89 trillion. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid’s HYPE led the downside with an over 10% slide on its daily price chart. HYPE’s downside intensified after a massive sell from BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes. Lookochain data shows the billionaire offloaded 96,628 HYPE tokens over the weekend, worth approximately $5.1 million. The transaction saw Hayes pocketing approximately $823,000 in returns. Lookonchain @lookonchain · Follow Arthur Hayes( @CryptoHayes ) just sold all 96,628 $HYPE ($5.1M) he bought a month ago, making ~$823K(+19.2%).During his speech at the WebX Summit on Aug 25, he predicted a 126x upside for $HYPE , but is now out with less than a 20% gain. hypurrscan.io/address/0xc322… 7:31 PM · Sep 21, 2025 164 Reply Copy link Read 59 replies The substantial dump sparked speculations, especially as it comes after Hayes forecasted a 126x surge for HYPE . Is the digital token eventually losing steam after gaining more than 1,400% in the past year? Arthue Hayes’ research firm and family office, Maelstrom, highlights the reason behind the exit. Why Hayes dumped HYPE Hayes jokingly revealed that he reduced his holdings to pay the deposit for the new Ferrari. Later, Maelstrom’s research clarified the reasons behind his decision. The analysis highlights looming token unlocks that could mean prolonged selling pressure for Hyperliquid’s native token. The project will start vesting a staggering 237.8 million tokens for over two years, from November 29. That represents roughly $11.9 billion (at current market prices) worth of supply flooding the market, with around $500 million unlocked every month. Starting November 29, 237.8M HYPE will begin vesting linearly over 24 months. At $50 per token, that’s $11.9B in team unlocks, nearly $500M notional hitting the market every month. Indeed, token unlocks aren’t uncommon in the crypto space. These events impact market sentiments and price stability as they are fundamental in managing the distribution and circulation of a token’s supply. However, Hyperliquid’s unlocks raised eyebrows as it will likely fail to absorb looming bearish pressure with its buybacks. Maelstrom trusts the buyback program can only handle 17% of the surging supply, leaving over $400M of possible sell pressure that traders have to digest. The analysis added that digital asset treasuries (DATs) cannot offset Hyperliquid’s unlock-fueled sell-off. While Sonnet has raised over $800 million ($305M in cash and $583M in HYPE coins), it might not be enough to keep prices afloat. Even Sonnet + the other smaller HYPE DATs all combine, are just a drop in the bucket compared against impending HYPE unlocks. HYPE price outlook The native token exhibited a bearish outlook. It trades at $48.79 after a swift slide on its daily price chart. Chart by Coinamrketcap HYPE’s trading volume has increased by 135% in the last 24 hours. That signals robust user activity, possibly from participants exiting positions to avoid further losses. Broad market declines, with liquidations topping $1.5B , contribute to HYPE’s downward stance.

Cardano (ADA) continues to be in the spotlight with its steady network upgrades, and Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to have pull with its massive community and cultural relevance. Yet the real hype is for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a brand new DeFi token in presale for just $0.035. Loaded with its dual lending-and-borrowing protocol for utility, Mutuum Finance could potentially yield the most returns in the market, say analysts, making it one to watch closely. Cardano: Tracking Key Levels Below $1 Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.93 with resistance at $1.00 and support at $0.80-$0.85. ADA’s ecosystem development, specifically its advancement of scalability and smart contract capacity, still makes it a player in the conversation for under $1 projects to move higher. ADA has seen steady appreciation, but its upside might be less than some newer protocols. By comparison, Mutuum Finance may have greater return potential in an upside market environment. Dogecoin Struggles with Resistance as Momentum Wavers Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.2641, cooling down from recent highs and encountering resistance in the $0.28–$0.30 region. Although community support remains active, its price action is increasingly dependent on social sentiment and speculation rather than fundamental news. Support levels appear to be holding between the $0.22–$0.25 region, with any breakdown poised to test lower regions of interest. Compared to DOGE’s current trajectory, investors see newer DeFi-based Mutuum Finance as having more upside for greater percentage gains in the next cycle. Mutuum Finance Presale Impresses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading in its sixth presale round where it is breaking records as investors join in. The project has already crossed 16,470 investors and has broken the $16.15 million capital threshold. The trend will only continue to build. Record-breaking milestones like these are a reassuring sign of increasing confidence of the investors with the platform approaching launch time. Investors buying today could gain gigantic returns in the long term as the ecosystem keeps expanding. The project is appealing to investors because it has a dual lending mechanism, future prospects, open-source and audited codebase, and transparent tokenomics. Mutuum Finance is anticipating long-term growth in the DeFi market. The project is compensating early users by hosting a $100,000 giveaway campaign, and 10 users of the platform will receive $10,000 MUTM each. The project stands to be one of the best ETH-based DeFi projects to watch with Ethereum (ETH) prices over $4,600 now. Building a Secure Platform Mutuum Finance has taken a step further to provide security in its platform and collaborated with CertiK to introduce an official bug bounty program with an minimum assured reward pool of $50,000. The reward is of four severity levels i.e. critical, major, minor and low in such a way that each type of vulnerability could be disclosed and removed. By opening its site to third-party auditing by researchers and developers, Mutuum is also welcoming its newest security technology, an additional security and assurance for its investor community. Mutuum Loan to Value and liquidation ratios that vary with the volatility of the underlying collateral are the primary source of stability. Multipliers of reserves from a 10% safer to up to 35% of risk assets are the secondary source of stability. The system is so perfectly balanced in terms of access and safety and further market participation is possible and systemic risk is contained. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the strongest sub-$1 cryptocurrency to watch, outgrowing ADA and DOGE in growth potential. Presale tokens for Stage 6 are just $0.035, with the price set to move higher in Stage 7, providing early buyers with the possibility of asymmetric returns. 16,470+ investors are already backing the project, and it has a raised amount of $16.15M, reflecting strong market confidence.

XRP 1-day market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The token trades at $2.81, marking its sharpest single-day drop since July and reinforcing the fragility of altcoin momentum in a market dominated once again by Bitcoin . The decline followed the euphoric launch of the REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR), which had attracted a record $37.7 million in first-day volume only days earlier. While the debut was hailed as a milestone for regulated XRP exposure, it also created the conditions for a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” dynamic. Traders who had positioned heavily ahead of the launch used the liquidity window to lock in gains, amplifying the pullback as leveraged long positions were unwound. More than $1.7 billion in crypto derivatives were liquidated across the market, with nearly 90% of those positions coming from the long side. XRP trading analysis On-chain activity pointed to renewed whale involvement. Data showed transfers worth more than $800 million in XRP executed in recent sessions, moving between anonymous wallets at a time when liquidity was already thinning. Whether these flows represent accumulation or distribution remains unclear, but the immediate impact has been to rattle sentiment, particularly as XRP failed to defend the key $3.00 threshold. Technically, XRP price has struggled to sustain breakouts above $3, with repeated rejections turning that level into firm resistance. The slide below short-term moving averages coincided with a weakening MACD histogram and an RSI retreating from bullish territory. With $2.80 now emerging as the immediate support zone, traders warn that a decisive break lower could expose the token to further declines toward $2.60. The pullback has also been magnified by broader market weakness. Bitcoin dropped 2.54% in the past 24 hours to $112,745, underperforming the crypto market’s overall decline of 3.72%. Ethereum retreated alongside, reinforcing the view that XRP’s drop is not isolated but part of a wider correction tied to profit-taking and shifting macro expectations. Despite the setback, XRP’s ETF debut remains a significant marker for institutional adoption. The question is whether that long-term narrative will outweigh the short-term volatility triggered by traders unwinding positions. With Bitcoin dominance climbing back to 57.73%, capital is rotating away from riskier altcoins, and XRP will need to hold the $2.80 floor to avoid deeper losses.

If so, you’ve likely noticed a significant surge in interest and investment. Last week, digital asset funds experienced an astounding net inflow of $1.9 billion. This substantial capital injection signals a robust and growing appetite among investors for cryptocurrencies. What Are Digital Asset Funds, and Why Do They Matter? Before we dive deeper, let’s quickly clarify what we mean by digital asset funds . These are investment vehicles that allow individuals and institutions to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly buying and holding the underlying assets themselves. Think of them as professionally managed portfolios that invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. Their importance cannot be overstated. Inflows into these funds are a crucial indicator of institutional and broader investor sentiment. When these funds see significant capital, it often reflects increasing confidence in the long-term viability and growth potential of the crypto space. The Week’s Stunning Inflow: A Closer Look at Digital Asset Funds The recent figures, announced by CoinShares, paint a very clear picture: investors are pouring money into digital assets. The $1.9 billion net inflow wasn’t just a minor bump; it was a powerful statement. This surge brings the year-to-date total to an impressive $40.4 billion, underscoring a sustained trend of adoption. Let’s break down where this capital went: Bitcoin (BTC) : The king of crypto continued to reign supreme, attracting $977 million in inflows. This demonstrates enduring belief in Bitcoin as a store of value and a leading digital asset. Ethereum (ETH) : Not far behind, Ethereum-related products saw a significant $772 million inflow. This highlights strong interest in the network’s ecosystem and its potential for innovation. Solana (SOL) : The high-performance blockchain attracted $127.3 million, indicating growing enthusiasm for alternative layer-1 solutions. XRP : Despite regulatory uncertainties, XRP still drew a notable $69.4 million, showing continued investor support for the token. What Sparked This Surge in Digital Asset Funds? CoinShares provided a key insight into the timing of this accelerated capital influx. The majority of the inflows occurred late in the week, coinciding with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision regarding interest rates. When the Fed cuts or signals a cut in interest rates, it typically makes traditional investments like bonds less attractive. This often encourages investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including equities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. The prospect of lower borrowing costs can also stimulate economic activity, which in turn can boost investor confidence in growth assets like digital currencies. This macroeconomic shift clearly played a pivotal role in the recent performance of digital asset funds . Broader Market Implications: What Does This Mean for Investors? These substantial inflows into digital asset funds carry several implications for the broader market and individual investors: Institutional Validation : The consistent flow of institutional capital into these funds suggests growing mainstream acceptance and validation of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. Market Stability : Increased institutional participation can potentially lead to greater market stability and reduced volatility over the long term, as larger players tend to have longer investment horizons. Diversification Opportunities : For traditional investors, digital asset funds offer a convenient way to diversify portfolios beyond traditional stocks and bonds, potentially enhancing returns. Evolving Landscape : The demand for various altcoins like Solana and XRP indicates a broadening interest beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, pointing to a more mature and diverse digital asset ecosystem. However, it’s crucial to remember that while inflows are positive, the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various influences, including regulatory changes and technological developments. Looking Ahead: The Future of Digital Asset Funds The trend of increasing inflows into digital asset funds seems poised to continue, especially as the global economic landscape evolves and more traditional financial institutions embrace digital assets. As more sophisticated investment products emerge, and regulatory clarity improves, we can expect even greater participation from both retail and institutional investors. This ongoing institutional interest could further cement cryptocurrencies as a permanent fixture in global financial markets, driving innovation and potentially unlocking new opportunities for wealth creation. Staying informed about these trends is key for anyone looking to navigate the exciting world of digital finance. In conclusion, the $1.9 billion net inflow into digital asset funds last week is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of surging investor confidence and the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance. This momentum, fueled by both asset-specific demand and broader macroeconomic factors, highlights a promising future for the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are digital asset funds? Digital asset funds are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum without directly owning the assets. They are managed by professionals and typically invest in a basket of digital currencies or specific crypto-related products. Q2: Why is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision relevant to digital asset funds? When the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates, it generally makes traditional, lower-risk investments less attractive. This can prompt investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, leading to increased inflows into digital asset funds. Q3: Which digital assets saw the most significant inflows last week? Bitcoin-related products attracted the largest share with $977 million, followed closely by Ethereum-related products with $772 million. Solana and XRP also saw substantial inflows. Q4: Do these inflows indicate that cryptocurrency investments are now risk-free? No, significant inflows into digital asset funds indicate growing investor confidence and institutional adoption, but they do not eliminate the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. The market can still be volatile and is subject to various external factors. Q5: How can I invest in digital asset funds? Investment in digital asset funds is typically done through traditional brokerage platforms that offer access to these specialized funds or through dedicated crypto investment platforms. It’s advisable to consult with a financial advisor to understand if such investments align with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

What started as a period of cautious optimism quickly turned into a wave of panic selling, leaving bulls struggling to regain control. The sharp correction has pushed the market into a new, uncertain phase where confidence is being tested, and short-term volatility is dominating sentiment. Related Reading: Coinbase Reserves Hit $112B: Highest Level Since 2021 Market Peak Top analyst Maartunn highlighted one of the key drivers behind the downturn: an overleveraged derivatives market. In the last 24 hours alone, the crypto market witnessed $597 million in BTC and ETH long liquidations, marking one of the heaviest waves of forced selling in recent months. This liquidation wipeout serves as a harsh reminder to tradersof the risks of excessive leverage in a market that can turn abruptly. The selloff also underscores the fragile balance between bullish enthusiasm and macroeconomic uncertainty. With central banks recalibrating policy and liquidity conditions tightening, crypto faces a complex environment. As prices test lower support levels, the coming days will reveal whether this correction is a temporary shakeout or the beginning of a deeper phase of market revaluation. Liquidations Trigger Speculation on Crypto’s Next Phase According to Maartunn, the past 24 hours delivered one of the harshest blows to overleveraged traders this year. Data shows that $189 million in Bitcoin longs were liquidated, alongside an even larger $408 million in Ethereum longs, bringing the total wiped out positions close to $600 million. This wave of liquidations happened within hours, highlighting just how fragile sentiment can be when leverage builds up across major assets. The sudden sell-off sent shockwaves through the market, forcing bulls to retreat as Bitcoin slipped under the $115K level and Ethereum dropped below $4,500. Traders who had built aggressive long positions in anticipation of continued upside quickly found themselves on the losing side, as cascading liquidations amplified the decline. Such events are not uncommon in crypto, but the size and speed of this move have left investors reassessing the short-term landscape. Now, speculation is heating up about what comes next. Some analysts argue this was nothing more than a leverage reset, a necessary purge to clear excessive speculation and allow the market to build a healthier foundation for the next leg upward. Others are less optimistic, viewing the event as a potential trigger for a corrective stage, where broader selling pressure could drag prices lower before any recovery. What’s clear is that the market has entered a new phase of uncertainty. Investors are watching closely for whether fresh demand steps in to stabilize prices, or if further selling pressure forces a deeper pullback. Until clarity emerges, volatility is likely to dominate.

The chart highlights the rejection near the $4 trillion mark, a key psychological resistance level that has repeatedly capped upward moves in recent weeks. Despite this setback, the market remains well above its medium-term supports, suggesting the broader uptrend is still intact. Looking at the moving averages, the 50-day SMA (~$3.87T) is being tested, and a decisive close below could open the door to further downside toward the 100-day SMA (~$3.68T). However, as long as the market holds above this zone, the bullish structure remains valid. The 200-day SMA (~$3.31T) continues to provide a strong foundation for the longer-term trend, showing that the bull market context remains strong.

Conversely, a deeper breakdown below $3.7T may shift momentum, signaling a potential corrective phase in the short term.

Staying informed about platform updates is absolutely vital for every trader. Recently, a significant announcement from one of the leading crypto exchanges has caught the attention of the market: a major OKX delisting event. This move is set to impact several perpetual futures trading pairs, prompting users to take immediate action. What Does This OKX Delisting Entail? Crypto exchange OKX has officially announced its decision to delist seven USDT-margined perpetual futures trading pairs. This change is scheduled to take effect at 8:00 a.m. UTC on September 26 . For traders, this means these specific pairs will no longer be available for futures trading on the platform after the stated time. The affected perpetual futures pairs include: MAJOR ARC SWARM GRIFFAIN GODS ORBS VINE This OKX delisting directly affects anyone holding open positions or strategies involving these particular assets. It underscores the dynamic nature of crypto trading and the need for traders to remain vigilant about exchange announcements. Why Do Crypto Exchanges Perform Delistings? You might be wondering why an exchange like OKX would choose to delist trading pairs. Such decisions are not made lightly and usually stem from a combination of strategic and operational factors. Exchanges regularly review their offerings to ensure a healthy and efficient trading environment. Common reasons for a delisting include: Low Liquidity: Pairs with insufficient trading volume can lead to poor price discovery and difficulty in executing large orders without significant slippage. Project Viability: If a project behind a token shows signs of inactivity, security concerns, or failure to meet development milestones, an exchange might remove it to protect its users. Regulatory Changes: Evolving regulatory landscapes can sometimes necessitate the removal of certain assets or trading products to maintain compliance. Performance Issues: Technical problems, network instability, or smart contract vulnerabilities can also trigger a delisting. The OKX delisting in this instance likely reflects an assessment of these factors, aiming to optimize the platform’s overall perpetual futures market. Impact on Traders: What Actions Should You Take? For traders with open positions in any of the seven affected perpetual futures pairs, immediate action is crucial. Failing to address these positions before the deadline could result in forced liquidation or unfavorable outcomes. It is vital to understand the implications of this OKX delisting on your portfolio. Here are some actionable insights: Close Positions: If you have any open long or short positions in MAJOR, ARC, SWARM, GRIFFAIN, GODS, ORBS, or VINE perpetual futures, you should close them before September 26, 8:00 a.m. UTC. Withdraw Funds: While the delisting specifically targets futures pairs, it is always wise to review your overall holdings and ensure you understand the status of the underlying assets. Review Trading Strategies: If your strategies relied on these pairs, it is time to adjust them and explore alternative trading opportunities available on OKX. Being proactive is the best defense against unexpected market changes. This event serves as a strong reminder for traders to regularly monitor their portfolios and stay updated on exchange announcements. Navigating Future Changes in the Crypto Landscape The cryptocurrency market is known for its rapid evolution. While an OKX delisting might seem like a challenge, it also presents an opportunity for traders to refine their strategies and adapt to a more streamlined market. Staying informed is your most powerful tool in this environment. To successfully navigate these changes: Subscribe to Exchange Announcements: Ensure you receive notifications from OKX and other platforms you use. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on a few assets or pairs can increase risk. Continuous Learning: Understand market dynamics, regulatory shifts, and project developments. This proactive approach helps mitigate risks and positions you to capitalize on new opportunities that emerge in the ever-changing crypto space. The recent OKX delisting of seven perpetual futures pairs, including MAJOR, is a significant development for traders. It highlights the importance of staying informed and agile in the cryptocurrency market.

52092258,https://cryptonews.com/?p=426541,1758533798,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52092258.jpeg,South Africa’s Sygnia Warns Investors Against Going All-In on Bitcoin ETF,https://cryptonews.com/news/south-africas-sygnia-warns-investors-against-going-all-in-on-bitcoin-etf/,"South African asset manager Sygnia Ltd. is urging caution after its newly launched Bitcoin ETF attracted a surge of interest from local investors. Key Takeaways: Sygnia advises investors to limit crypto exposure to no more than 5% of their portfolio. The firm’s CEO warns that Bitcoin’s volatility poses a serious risk, especially in emerging markets like South Africa. Despite strong inflows, Sygnia actively contacts clients to discourage full portfolio switches into its Bitcoin ETF. The company, which introduced the Sygnia Life Bitcoin Plus fund in June, says it actively discourages clients from shifting all their assets into the high-risk crypto product. “We actually intervene with a view of stopping the investor from doing something silly by switching,” said Magda Wierzycka, CEO of Sygnia, during an interview with Bloomberg TV . Sygnia CEO Recommends Capping Crypto Exposure at 5% of Portfolio Wierzycka emphasized that cryptocurrencies should only make up a small portion of a broader investment strategy, recommending no more than 5% of discretionary or annuity assets be allocated to crypto funds. The Sygnia Bitcoin Plus fund uses the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF as its benchmark. While Bitcoin has soared 82% in the past 12 months, it remains volatile, dropping 2.3% to $112,735.12 at mid-morning in Johannesburg on Monday. Although its historical volatility has eased from over 200% a decade ago to around 40%, the risk remains substantial, especially in an emerging market like South Africa. Wierzycka noted that the extreme volatility could wipe out life savings in a country where per capita GDP is just $15,990, far below developed economies. “The underlying asset is highly volatile,” she warned. “You need to be very sure about the messaging around it and you need to be sure that you don’t make promises that you can’t meet.” While previously skeptical of Bitcoin, Wierzycka now sees the asset as a legitimate long-term play rather than just a speculative bet. Sygnia has plans to launch additional crypto ETFs on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, pending regulatory approval. A prior attempt was blocked by authorities. The Cape Town-based firm manages around 350 billion rand ($20 billion) in assets. Its Bitcoin Plus fund has seen “very, very significant” inflows, according to Wierzycka, though exact figures were not disclosed. She confirmed that the firm calls investors who appear to be switching large sums into the crypto fund to caution them personally. Bitcoin ETFs Hold Over 1.47M BTC Bitcoin exchange-traded products now hold over 1.47 million BTC , representing around 7% of the total supply, with U.S.-based ETFs dominating the landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT leads with 746,810 BTC, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at nearly 199,500 BTC, according to data from HODL15Capital. AUGUST Global Bitcoin ETF update pic.twitter.com/6VkRsTmOU2 — HODL15Capital (@HODL15Capital) September 2, 2025 However, momentum appears to be cooling. In August, Bitcoin ETPs saw $301 million in outflows, while Ethereum funds attracted $3.95 billion. Whale activity mirrors this shift, with several large holders rotating hundreds of millions from BTC into ETH ahead of key ETF developments and the historically weak September trading month. As reported, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently reviewing 92 crypto ETF applications , according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. A detailed spreadsheet published on August 28 shows most of these filings, especially those linked to Solana, XRP, and Litecoin, are facing final decisions by October. The wave of new applications reflects growing interest in altcoin-focused ETFs and could spark fresh capital inflows into the crypto market.

Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, Binance’s co-founder, warned of selling pressure on the new token. Binance’s Giggle Academy started receiving donations from the team of a new meme token, Giggle Fund (GIGGLE). The ticker was created unofficially, and was aimed as a charity tool for Binance’s educational platform. The new token was created hours after Giggle Academy opened its donation feature. Binance’s co-founder Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao noted the project immediately received up to $1M in donations, though up to 90% of those donations came from the fees generated by the GIGGLE meme token. Crazy that @GiggleAcademy received more than $1m donations in the first 12 hours of the feature being online. Way beyond my expectations. Lots of good people out there. Lots of good crypto people. 🙏 90% of the donations so far came from a meme coin. I still don’t get how a $5m… https://t.co/U8vBt3pT1X pic.twitter.com/FIsuGT4Q7R — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) September 22, 2025 Giggle Academy has set up its donation page to receive only BNB, USDC, and USDT, and has warned it will not issue an official token. However, Zhao admitted meme tokens did have utility, as the project would provide operating costs for the Giggle Academy platform. Zhao also did not explicitly mention the GIGGLE ticker, though the asset benefitted from the connection to Binance’s educational platform. GIGGLE rallies to $26M market cap The GIGGLE token upgraded the model of using memes for fundraising. Previously, some charity tokens were launched with the understanding that they would be sold for profit, as Cryptopolitan reported . Instead of relying on direct donations, GIGGLE levies a relatively high trading tax, which goes toward charity. All token trades incur a relatively high 5% fee, which built up $900K in donations within hours. GIGGLE retained its levels at around $0.23, though selling happened during the initial pump. As a result, GIGGLE has not faced significant selling pressure, and has retained a market cap above $26.1M. Soon after the mention by Zhao, the unofficial token expanded from an initial market cap of $5M. GIGGLE tokens rallied to a market cap above $26.1M, producing over $900M in fees within hours to be donated to Binance’s Giggle Academy. | Source: DexScreener . GIGGLE still saw some profit-taking, though at a relatively small scale compared to other charities that ended in a rug pull. The top whale realized $227.7K. Previously, tokens used for charity on either Ethereum or BNB Chain had different fates. Vitalik Buterin has been known to sell the tokens on the open market and donate the proceeds. Zhao has burned some of the tokens sent to his wallet for exposure. GIGGLE remains a third-party meme The GIGGLE ticker has not received direct endorsement or any plans of inclusion into Binance’s curated token ecosystem. For now, the project is a third-party meme, with potential related risks. The token does not show significant clustering or sniping of the supply, though some whales were quick to trade GIGGLE on PancakeSwap for short-term profits. The asset has just 3,821 holders. The Giggle Fund team seems to be engaged with the project, aiming to continue its activity and fund educational content. The fund also launched its own tracker , registering a total of $2.42M donated to Giggle Academy. The Giggle Academy address holds all reported funds, including an additional long list of small-scale meme transfers for exposure, which are not key to the fundraising efforts.

52092503,586083,1758534073,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52092503.jpeg,Ethereum Price Prediction for September Comes In as Pepenode Looks Like the Next 1000x Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-prediction-traders-watch-pepenode-as-next-1000x-crypto/,"The most recent Ethereum price predictions hint at a rich end of the month for Ethereum with a potential October bull ready to attack. This optimistic outlook comes as Ethereum just recorded the lowest 7-day average of the year at 0.93 as $ETH has been on a downward spiral since the 19th. Cryptoquant believes that there’s a simple explanation for the discrepancy: the current bearish consensus is likely to attract long investors. An extreme bear market always creates investment opportunities, especially in the institutional sphere, giving off a powerful buy signal. Before that happens, though, we may see an even more abrupt correction if $ETH fails to consolidate above $4,000. Either way, Pepenode ($PEPENODE) stands to gain massively in the coming months, as investors already see it as the next 1000x crypto currently in the presale oven. Will Ethereum Recover in October? It’s very likely that Ethereum will begin to recover as October sets in as the next FOMC meeting draws close. The last meeting took place on September 16-17, which saw Bitcoin add almost $3K to its price, stopping just shy of $118K. Then came the 19th and the entire market entered a brutal correction phase with red across the board. $SOL, $ADA, $DOGE, $XRP, and $ETH are the biggest losers in the top 10, which brings us to the main point of this article: it’s not Ethereum, it’s the market. The bearish wave is a symptom of stronger shorts, as investors capitalize on the recent pump following September’s FOMC meeting. We expect the market to change direction in October, especially since FedWatch puts the odds of another tax rate cut at almost 92%. More importantly, the Federal Reserve declared that, aside from September’s cut of 25 basis points, we should expect two more reductions in 2025 and another in 2026. Simply put, this means that the next bull phase, expected near mid-October, will likely push Bitcoin to a new ATH, which means $ETH could also see a breakout above $5,000. Analyst Lark Davis is smashingly optimistic, reminding us that Ethereum’s charts look ‘eerily similar to September 2020’, when the market embarked on a ‘multi-month bull run’. This means that $ETH’s recent contraction is temporary, and we may see a rally in early October, so long as the coin holds above $4K. If not, we could see a crash to $3.5K, which would push the bull pump to late October. Pepenode’s $1.3M presale stands to gain either way, as it’s already on the road to becoming the next big hit of 2025. How Pepenode Brings Coin Mining Into the Presale Sphere Pepenode ($PEPENODE) addresses the main problem associated with modern presales: the lack of incentives for early participation. You can draw in investors with a meaty staking reward, rich post-launch promises, and a fat ROI if the token goes ballistic. But that’s not enough. You need a system to keep investors engaged beyond the simple buy-and-forget tactic, which is how most presales operate, and Pepenode has the solution: active mining gameplay. Pepenode allows you to buy your own mining nodes, upgrade them, and create your personal virtual mining facility, which allows you to mine tokens. The leaderboard keeps track of the top miners and rewards them with higher staking rewards and bonuses based on their progress. Post-launch, you’ll also receive rewards in actual meme coins like $DOGE, $PEPE, and $FARTCOIN. Pepenode allows you to learn and practice your coin mining without dealing with expensive rigs, spicy electricity bills, and melted GPUs. Professional crypto miners are also expensive and often difficult to set up, making them unfit for casual miners. With Pepenode, you can experience coin mining with the help of a personalized setup, which you can upgrade at your own pace. Our price prediction for $PEPENODE is $0.0023 by the end of the year and $0.0244 by 2030. Based on the token’s current presale price of $0.0010702, we’re looking at a 5-year ROI of 2,179%. If the token sees mainstream adoption, it could climb even higher. And let’s not forget about the staking APY, currently at 969%, further incentivizing early participation. You can read about how to buy $PEPENODE right here and visit the presale page to grab your tokens today. This isn’t financial advice. Do your own research (DYOR) and manage risks wisely before investing.

The move has boosted the company’s total holdings to 25,555 BTC, which were accumulated for about $2.71 billion at an average cost of $106,065 per BTC, according to CEO Simon Gerovich. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Hoard Expands Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation strategy has delivered a whopping 395.1% year-to-date BTC yield in 2025. With this purchase, the Tokyo-listed firm now ranks as the fifth-largest public corporate BTC holder, overtaking Bullish and trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Marathon Digital, XXI, and Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, according to the data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries. Metaplanet has intensified its Bitcoin acquisition strategy after boosting its year-end target from 10,000 to 30,000 BTC. To support this goal, the company raised $837 million via international share offerings, of which the bulk of the funds were allocated for purchases scheduled in September and October. Building on this momentum, the firm disclosed plans to generate $1.4 billion through the issuance of 385 million new shares, earmarked entirely for additional BTC acquisitions. Last week, the company also announced the launch of Metaplanet Income Corp., a Miami-based US subsidiary with an initial capital of $15 million. The subsidiary is designed to focus on Bitcoin income generation and derivatives trading, thereby creating a clear separation from Metaplanet’s core BTC holdings. Leadership responsibilities will be shared between CEO Gerovich, Dylan LeClair, and Darren Winia. According to the firm, this organizational structure will allow revenue-generating activities to operate efficiently while having minimal impact on consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31. Weathering Bitcoin Turbulence The latest announcement comes as Bitcoin rattled markets heading into the final week of September and retreated to $112,000. The sharp pullback triggered more than $1 billion in liquidations of crypto long positions, as it marked the largest single liquidation event of 2025 to date. Meanwhile, Metaplanet’s stock fell 3.12% to $3.98 during Monday’s session in Japan, according to the Yahoo Finance data. The stock showed significant intraday volatility. Despite this, it remains up almost 70% year-to-date.

52092524,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=207568,1758534310,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/52092524.jpeg,Massive 250 Million USDC Minted: Unpacking Its Crucial Market Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/massive-250-million-usdc-minted/,"BitcoinWorld Massive 250 Million USDC Minted: Unpacking Its Crucial Market Impact The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with significant movements, and a recent report by Whale Alert has certainly caught the attention of many. A staggering 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury has been observed, signaling a potentially crucial shift in market dynamics. This substantial creation of a leading stablecoin often precedes notable market activity, making it a point of interest for traders and investors alike. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Signify? When such a large amount of USDC minted is reported, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying reasons and potential consequences. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. Its primary purpose is to provide stability in the volatile crypto market, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized applications. The minting process means new USDC tokens have been created and added to circulation. This typically happens for several key reasons: Increased Demand: More users or institutions want to hold USDC, often for trading, lending, or simply as a safe haven during market volatility. Exchange Deposits: Large sums of USDC might be minted to facilitate deposits onto cryptocurrency exchanges, preparing for significant trading activity. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Institutional investors often use stablecoins for large, private transactions that bypass public order books. DeFi Protocol Liquidity: Funds could be earmarked to provide liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, fueling lending, borrowing, or yield farming. Therefore, a significant amount of USDC minted can be an indicator of growing institutional interest or an anticipation of increased market movement. Understanding the Role of Stablecoins Like USDC Stablecoins are a cornerstone of the modern crypto economy. They offer a stable value proposition in a market known for its dramatic price swings. For instance, when Bitcoin or Ethereum experience high volatility, traders often convert their assets into stablecoins like USDC to protect their capital without fully exiting the crypto ecosystem. This allows them to re-enter the market when conditions are more favorable. Moreover, USDC is widely used across various blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, among others. This interoperability enhances its utility and broadens its reach, making it a preferred choice for many participants in the decentralized space. The continuous growth in the supply of USDC minted reflects its expanding adoption and integral role. Potential Market Implications of Fresh USDC Minted A substantial influx of USDC minted into the market can have several implications. While it doesn’t directly cause price changes for other cryptocurrencies, it can signal future activity. For example: Buying Pressure: If the newly minted USDC is intended for exchange deposits, it might indicate an upcoming wave of buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies, as users convert their stablecoins into volatile assets. Liquidity Boost: More USDC in circulation means greater liquidity across various platforms, making it easier for large trades to execute without significant price impact. Market Sentiment: A continuous increase in stablecoin supply can sometimes be interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting that investors are preparing to deploy capital into the market. It is important to remember that minting is just one piece of the puzzle. How this newly created USDC is ultimately utilized will determine its true impact on the broader crypto landscape. Observers often track these minting events closely, looking for patterns that might foreshadow significant market trends. What Should Investors Consider After a Large USDC Minted Event? For investors, understanding these large stablecoin movements is crucial for informed decision-making. While a 250 million USDC minted event doesn’t guarantee a specific market outcome, it does provide valuable data points. It encourages deeper analysis into market sentiment, liquidity pools, and potential institutional activity. Always consider the broader context: What is the current market sentiment (bullish or bearish)? Are there any major economic announcements or regulatory changes expected? How has the total supply of USDC changed over time? By staying informed and analyzing these signals, market participants can better position themselves for upcoming movements. The transparency provided by services like Whale Alert is invaluable for this purpose. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Stablecoin Flows The recent report of 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury is a significant event that highlights the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the critical role stablecoins play in facilitating liquidity and acting as a barometer for potential market shifts. While the immediate impact may not be evident, such large minting events often precede periods of heightened trading activity or institutional maneuvers. Staying attuned to these movements provides valuable insights into the pulse of the digital asset world, helping us understand where capital might be flowing next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when USDC is “minted”? A1: When USDC is “minted,” it means new USD Coin tokens have been created and added to the total supply in circulation. This process is typically backed by an equivalent amount of US dollars or highly liquid assets held in reserve, ensuring its 1:1 peg to the dollar. Q2: Why would 250 million USDC minted be considered a significant event? A2: Minting such a large amount of USDC, like 250 million, is significant because it suggests substantial demand for stablecoins. This demand often comes from institutions or large traders preparing to make significant moves in the crypto market, such as buying other cryptocurrencies, providing liquidity to DeFi protocols, or settling large OTC transactions. Q3: Does a large USDC minted event automatically mean crypto prices will go up? A3: Not necessarily. While a large amount of USDC minted can indicate an intention to buy other cryptocurrencies, which could lead to upward price pressure, it’s not a direct cause-and-effect. The USDC could also be used for lending, liquidity provision, or other purposes that don’t immediately impact volatile asset prices. It’s a signal to watch, not a guarantee. Q4: Who is Whale Alert, and why are their reports important? A4: Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions on various blockchains. Their reports are important because they provide transparency into significant capital movements, often involving large investors or institutions (known as “whales”), which can offer insights into potential market trends and sentiment. Q5: What are the primary uses of USDC in the crypto ecosystem? A5: USDC is primarily used for providing stability in a volatile market, facilitating fast and low-cost international transfers, acting as collateral for loans in DeFi, enabling seamless trading between different cryptocurrencies on exchanges, and as a store of value within the crypto space. Q6: How can I track large stablecoin movements like USDC minted ? A6: You can track large stablecoin movements by following blockchain analytics services like Whale Alert, checking on-chain data explorers for specific stablecoin contracts, or utilizing cryptocurrency news platforms that report on such significant transactions.

Their wild volatility can lead to massive profits, but only for those who know where to look. If you’re considering diving into meme coins, here are four that have the potential to turn your $800 investment into $10,000 before Shiba Inu (SHIB) makes its next big run. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The underdog with big potential Little Pepe is still in its early stages, but it’s showing strong promise. At just $0.0022 in its 13th presale stage, this coin is set to rise slightly in the next phase, to $0.0023. That might not sound like much, but the demand behind Little Pepe tells a different story. With over 15.7 billion tokens sold and a total of $25.5 million raised across its presale stages, it’s clear that investors are paying attention. What’s truly exciting is its growing community—over 41,000 holders and 29,700 active Telegram members. Additionally, the $777,000 giveaway has over 360,000 entries, generating buzz around the token. And with a 95% Certik audit score and a listing on CoinMarketCap, Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a project that’s building serious credibility. As its presale continues to gain traction, Little Pepe might just be the hidden gem you’ve been looking for. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s leading meme coin, poised for a breakout Bonk has firmly positioned itself as the top meme coin within the Solana ecosystem. Currently priced at $0.0000247, Bonk has seen a 146% increase in value over the past month. What makes Bonk especially attractive is its upcoming plan to burn 1 trillion tokens once the holder count hits 1 million. This planned burn is designed to create scarcity, potentially driving up the token’s value. Additionally, the possibility of a 2x Leveraged ETF has investors excited. If the ETF is approved, it could bring institutional support and massive liquidity to Bonk. With nearly a million holders and significant developments on the horizon, Bonk is one to watch as it prepares for its next major move. Dogecoin (DOGE): The meme coin with serious backing Dogecoin is the meme coin that started it all, and it’s still making waves today. Thanks to Elon Musk’s continued support, Dogecoin is seeing more real-world use cases than ever before. It’s now being used for tipping on X (formerly Twitter) and accepted for purchases at Musk’s various ventures, like The Boring Company and his merch store. This is breaking down the barriers that once confined Dogecoin to the “meme” category. Additionally, Dogecoin is benefiting from infrastructure upgrades. DOGE nodes are now operational through Starlink and SpaceX satellites, enhancing their network speed and reliability. Furthermore, the launch of the Rex-Osprey DOGE ETF is expected to attract institutional investors, which could drive Dogecoin toward new all-time highs. Analysts are keeping their eyes on the $1 mark, and with everything happening in the background, Dogecoin could be on the verge of something big. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN): A serious player, despite its name Fartcoin might have a silly name, but it’s making a serious impact in the crypto world. After being listed on Coinbase in June, Fartcoin saw a 12% surge in price and an impressive $400 million in trading volume. Currently sitting at $0.8815, it’s gained strong momentum in 2025, and there’s more to come. The Fartcoin team has big plans, including the launch of FartDAO in late 2025, which will give the community more control. They’re also planning to dive into NFTs in 2026, expanding their ecosystem. With a market cap of $881 million and strong buying pressure, analysts believe Fartcoin could see a 15x return. Final thoughts Keep an eye on Little Pepe, Bonk, Dogecoin, and Fartcoin to turn $800 into $10,000. Meme currencies are hazardous, but they have strong communities, real-world uses, and interesting future plans. These could lead to huge rewards if you invest in meme coins.

In 2025, however, the script is being rewritten as new projects are emerging with novel solutions to real-world problems. Among them, Remittix (RTX) is being compared to Ripple for its payments innovation and rapidly growing community. As interest quickly catches up with crypto markets, RTX is now strategically positioned as a strong contender in the race to be the next big utility-based altcoin. XRP Market Performance XRP has remained a strong influence in the overall crypto market. The current selling price is $2.97, a marginal drop of 0.17%. Its market capitalization of $177.98 billion holds its firm position among leading digital assets, and a trading volume of $3.37 billion showing that investor interest remains. These figures obviously point to Ripple’s lasting importance, yet also to cautious sentiment towards legacy cryptocurrencies. In the face of competition from upstart projects and an evolving market narrative, XRP has the challenge of extending its momentum in 2025. Remittix Gains Recognition While Ripple is cementing its position in cross-border payments, Remittix is offering its own vision of faster, cheaper transactions. Currently priced at $0.1130 per token , RTX has already raised more than $26.3 million in its presale, selling more than 66.8 million tokens. The project recently achieved a milestone in announcing its first centralized exchange (CEX) listing on BitMart, with confirmation of a second listing on LBank after the $22 million raised. The listings will provide greater liquidity and open doors to participation globally. Verified by CertiK and Wallet Testing Adding to its credibility, the Remittix team has been completely verified by CertiK, the leading blockchain security firm. Even more impressively, RTX is ranked #1 on CertiK for pre-launch tokens, reasserting investor faith in its tech and openness. Wallet beta testing is also ongoing, with members of the community able to try out its real-world usage before full launch. All of this action demonstrates that RTX is more than just another presale — it’s an active DeFi project with concrete utility. Why Remittix Is Being Compared to Ripple Comparisons between Remittix and Ripple are far from coincidental. Both projects are tackling the problems of cross-border payments, but Remittix is leveraging modern frameworks to deliver faster, more affordable solutions. Some highlights include: Low gas fees facilitating transactions worldwide Crypto-to-fiat payments in 30+ nations Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term value Referral program with 15% rewards in USDT $250,000 giveaway driving community growth While Ripple continues to take over world finance, Remittix is demonstrating that new entrants can bring innovation, speed, and scalability to the industry. With a strong presale push, confirmed CEX listings, and the seal of approval from CertiK, RTX is positioning itself as one of the best crypto presales of 2025. For investors searching for the next big altcoin with real-world adoption, Remittix may be just the project to watch.

The metal, now trading at $3,721, advanced about an hour after bitcoin (BTC), seen by some proponents as a digital form of sound money, posted a 24-hour drop of 3% that cut its price to $112,000 and its year-to-date gain to 17%. The timing suggests the possibility that profits from bitcoin liquidations rotated into gold. The two assets rarely move in tandem, though there are occasional periods when both rise or fall simultaneously, often with a short lag. This time, the divergence is stronger. Gold is not the only metal attracting flows. Silver gained 1.5% on Monday to approach $44, its third-highest level since 1975, and is now up more than 50% year to date. Notably, since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 bps on Sept. 17, both gold and the S&P 500 are up about 1%. At the same time, U.S. treasury yields have risen, with the U.S. 10-year at 4.125% (up 2.5%) and the U.S. 30-year at 4.7% (up 2%). The dollar strengthened, with the DXY index adding 1% to 97.5.

The following contracts will be removed: MAJORUSDT ARCUSDT SWARMSUSDT GRIFFAINUSDT GODSUSDT ORBSUSDT VINEUSDT On the specified date, all transactions of these contracts will be stopped, users' open orders will be canceled, and accounts will be closed at the arithmetic average price of the last hour.

However, it warned that market volatility may increase prior to the trade closing. OKX stated that during the closure of contracts, asset transfers in the accounts of users with positions over $10,000 will be restricted for 30 minutes, after which transactions will return to normal.

This significant development opens up fresh avenues for market participants looking to diversify their trading strategies and engage with new assets. What Exactly Are 0G Perpetual Futures, and Why Are They Important? Perpetual futures contracts are a popular derivative product in the crypto space. Unlike traditional futures, they do not have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely. They closely track the underlying asset’s price, in this case, 0G, through a funding rate mechanism. While 0G is a relatively new or emerging asset, its listing on a major platform like Binance signifies growing interest and potential. The availability of 0G perpetual futures means traders can speculate on its future price movements without owning the actual asset. Key benefits of engaging with perpetual futures include: Leverage: Amplify potential gains with a smaller initial capital, though this also increases risk. 24/7 Trading: Access markets anytime, aligning perfectly with the global and continuous nature of cryptocurrency. Hedging Opportunities: Potentially offset risks in spot market holdings by taking opposing positions in the futures market. No Expiry: Hold positions as long as desired, subject to funding rates and margin requirements. When Can You Start Trading These Exciting 0G Perpetual Futures? Mark your calendars! Binance has confirmed the listing of both 0G/USDT and 0G/USDC perpetual futures . The official launch is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. UTC on September 22 . This precise timing allows traders globally to prepare their strategies and be ready from day one. The inclusion of both USDT and USDC pairs offers flexibility, catering to different stablecoin preferences within the trading community. This dual listing underscores Binance’s commitment to providing diverse trading options and enhanced liquidity for its users. To participate, ensure your Binance account is verified and funded. Navigate to the futures section on the Binance platform at the specified time to access the new 0G perpetual futures pairs. Navigating the Potential and Pitfalls of 0G Perpetual Futures The introduction of 0G perpetual futures on Binance could significantly boost the liquidity and exposure of the 0G asset. This often leads to increased market activity and price discovery, creating dynamic trading environments for those seeking new opportunities. However, it is crucial for traders to approach futures trading with caution. While leverage can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses, potentially leading to rapid liquidation of positions. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, especially newer assets like 0G, adds another layer of risk. Consider these actionable insights for managing risk: Risk Management: Always utilize stop-loss orders to limit potential losses and protect your capital. Start Small: Begin with smaller position sizes to understand market dynamics and the asset’s behavior before committing larger funds. Educate Yourself: Thoroughly understand funding rates, margin requirements, and the various liquidation risks associated with perpetual futures. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and developments surrounding 0G and the broader crypto market to make informed trading decisions. The listing of 0G perpetual futures on Binance is undoubtedly a significant event for the cryptocurrency trading landscape. It represents new opportunities for seasoned traders and an exciting entry point for those looking to explore advanced trading instruments. As always, informed decision-making and robust risk management are paramount to navigating these thrilling markets successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What are 0G perpetual futures? 0G perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the price of the 0G cryptocurrency without an expiry date. They track the 0G spot price through a funding rate mechanism. 2. When will 0G perpetual futures be listed on Binance? Binance will list 0G/USDT and 0G/USDC perpetual futures at 10:00 a.m. UTC on September 22. 3. What are the risks associated with trading 0G perpetual futures?

52093286,https://invezz.com/?p=2892024,1758534928,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"BTC to go 70% drawdown next bear market, but this altcoin reflects 700% upward trajectory only",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/22/btc-to-go-70-drawdown-next-bear-market-but-this-altcoin-reflects-700-upward-trajectory-only/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has long been recognized as the anchor of the digital asset market, but history paints a clear picture of its cyclical volatility. Every cycle, Bitcoin (BTC) has faced drawdowns of around 70%, wiping out short-term gains for traders who entered near the highs. While BTC remains unmatched for stability and dominance, growth-focused investors are questioning whether it is the best place to allocate capital in 2025. The new conversations on crypto charts and in trading groups are increasingly centered on where the next parabolic returns will come from. The consensus is that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , an emerging DeFi platform still in its presale, represents the most compelling growth story, reflecting a projected 700% upward trajectory from presale to listing. Bitcoin (BTC) faces cyclical risks while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) locks momentum Looking at crypto prices today, Bitcoin (BTC) appears strong, but long-term observers know that the asset has always moved in cycles. From 2013 to 2015, BTC fell by over 80% after its peak. From 2017 to 2019, the drawdown was close to 70%. Even after the highs of 2021, BTC again experienced a similar collapse. Analysts working on crypto predictions widely accept that such corrections are an unavoidable part of Bitcoin (BTC)’s design, making it less appealing for those seeking continuous growth rather than cyclical entry points. This is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale at a price of $0.035, the project has already raised over $16.1 million with 45% of the allocation sold to more than 16,500 holders. The presale structure ensures that every new phase comes with a price increase, and Phase 7 is set to lift the entry point by 15%, creating immediate urgency for investors who want to secure lower valuations before the token begins public trading. The contrast is clear: Bitcoin (BTC)’s history shows repeating drawdowns, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineered with upward-only mechanics during its presale, reflecting compounding gains for those who enter before expected listings on top exchanges. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set for a 700% upward trajectory Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just about presale momentum—it is about sustainable growth drivers built into its ecosystem. When the token lists, the beta version of the platform will go live, giving early users the ability to immediately test lending pools, borrowing features, and staking mechanisms. This instant proof of utility is rare among new projects and ensures adoption begins from day one. One of the most powerful elements is the stablecoin model. Every time users borrow against their collateral, new stablecoins will be minted, and every time loans are repaid or liquidations occur, those stablecoins will be burned. This mint-and-burn cycle naturally creates continuous borrowing activity while maintaining system safety through overcollateralization. The result is sustained demand that strengthens the protocol over time. Revenue streams add another layer of long-term growth. Borrowers pay interest based on utilization, and liquidation incentives ensure that undercollateralized positions are resolved efficiently. A portion of these revenues, known as the reserve factor, will be captured into the protocol’s treasury. These mechanisms create predictable cash flows that directly tie into demand for MUTM, as treasury growth supports buybacks and incentives for stakers. Layer-2 cost optimization Layer-2 integration further enhances competitiveness. By operating on Layer-2 infrastructure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers cheaper fees and faster transaction times compared to legacy DeFi protocols still operating on expensive Layer-1 systems. This efficiency attracts users who demand lower costs, giving MUTM a natural adoption advantage in the battle for DeFi market share. The broader growth strategy includes expected listings on leading global exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, Kraken, and MEXC. These listings will provide global liquidity and visibility, exposing MUTM to millions of potential new investors who will not have access to today’s low presale prices. For traders seeking exponential returns, this transition from presale to major listings is exactly where the 700% projection is anchored. The story becomes clear when you compare the paths. Bitcoin (BTC) is still a secure hold, but every cycle it has to deal with a 70% drop. At this point, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is only moving up. This is because of the presale-to-listing mechanisms, the platform beta launch, the stablecoin innovation, and the exposure to exchanges, all of which are working together to build momentum. Investors who buy MUTM at $0.035 during Phase 6 are getting into a growth engine that is ready for long-term use and big price increases. The next negative market will remind traders of the cyclical hazards of Bitcoin (BTC), but those who are interested in the next wave of DeFi adoption are joining forces with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM is an unusual cryptocurrency that may expand quickly without being affected by the historical cycles that continue to affect BTC’s performance. This is because its structure and fundamentals have a 700% trajectory built into them.

According to Lookonchain’s on-chain data, Hayes made an estimated $823,000 in profit from the sale of 96,628 HYPE tokens, which i s 19 .2 % ab ove his initial investment. According to Hayes, the sale was partially made to pay for a deposit on a Ferrari Testarossa. Since Hayes advocated for HYPE’s long-term potential at the August WebX Asia conference, his sudden exit has sparked controversy. There, he argued that the adoption of stablecoins and the growth in decentralized exchange revenue from Hyperliquid could drive the token to all-time high valuations. Need to pay my deposit on the new Rari 849 Testarossa https://t.co/PX7Hx0FuK9 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) September 21, 2025 Token unlocks raise market concerns The sale comes after growing controversy over Hyperliquid’s tokenomics . According to Maelstrom’s research, which Hayes cited , 237.8 million HYPE tokens will vest progressively over a 24-month period. This means that almost $500 million worth of supply enters the market each month. According to the analysis, buybacks at their current level can only cover 17% of the new supply, which could result in a monthly overhang of $410 million. Despite its substantial year-to-date gains, market observers warn that such pressure could have a significant impact on HYPE’s performance. “With the crown comes the Sword of Damocles: HYPE is about to face its first true test.” ~ Arthur Hayes Since its late November launch at $6.51, HYPE has already risen by 660% to pass $49. However, it remains uncertain whether Hyperliquid’s growing exchange revenues will be enough to cover the likely outpouring of tokens because of unlock-related risks. His departure has sparked speculation that Hayes may be redistributing into other assets. ASTER, a recently launched token, was recommended by some analysts as a possible investment for their money. Yoshitaka, a cryptocurrency analyst, noted that Hayes’s sudden change in direction raises eyebrows among investors since it is out of character with his previous strong support for HYPE. This won’t be the first time Hayes has sold sizable holdings while publicly retaining a bullish outlook, as Cryptopolitan reported . Despite predicting a “monster altseason,” he reportedly sold off more than $13 million worth of assets earlier this year, including ETH, ENA, and PEPE. Price reaction and technical outlook After Hayes’ sale, HYPE underperformed overall market movements, dropping 8.3% in 24 hours. As of this writing, the token is currently trading at $49.9. According to Finora AI Global, the immediate demand level is $52.346. Further lower declines can be seen if the price falls below $52.054 or $50.558. If the token remains near its current support, there is still a possibility for interim gains towards $54.482. A stronger reversal would be confirmed only when the price rises above $59.928 with stable trading volume. Hype / USDT perpetual contract. Source:X Data from DeFiLlama shows that Hyperliquid’s trading volume has grown dramatically, rising from $560 million in early August to an unprecedented peak of $3.4 billion. Hayes maintains his general optimism for cryptocurrency outside of HYPE. He has reaffirmed his goal of $250,000 in Bitcoin by the end of 2025. Last week, he also argued that after the U.S. Treasury meets its $850 billion General Account target, cryptocurrency markets will return to being “up only.” However, it’s unclear if Hayes will return to HYPE.

Reports point to rapid user growth and features that set XYZverse apart from rivals. Predictions focus on key metrics and community buzz, hinting that a major change could be coming this cycle. The reasons behind these bold forecasts invite a closer look. Avalanche: The Fast, Green Chain Racing Ahead in the Crypto Sprint Avalanche, or AVAX, is a fresh Layer-1 network built for speed and care for the planet. It moves value at up to 4,500 transactions per second and settles each deal in under two seconds. Fees stay tiny, so small payments make sense. The magic comes from three linked roads, called X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain, that split work and avoid jams. A special mix of voting rules, drawn from both old and new block ideas, keeps the system safe. Users can even launch their own mini-chains, called Subnets, with only a few clicks. AVAX powers it all, paying for fees, rewards, and custom tokens. Right now, the market is hunting for chains that mix low cost with high speed, and Avalanche fits that wish list. While older leaders like Ethereum face crowded lanes and high tolls, AVAX offers a smoother ride. Its Subnet idea also draws game studios and finance apps that want their own space without starting from zero. If the next cycle favors real use rather than hype, a token that fuels fast, green, and flexible rails could shine. For many watchers, that makes AVAX an appealing pick at current prices. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development.

Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.0055, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.0056. With an anticipated listing price of $0.10, the token is set to launch on leading CEXs and DEXs. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run.

52093045,https://timestabloid.com/?p=83949,1758535214,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"MUTM Could Be the Best Crypto to Invest in Before BTC Hits $150K, Here’s Why Analysts Agree",https://timestabloid.com/mutm-could-be-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-before-btc-hits-150k/,"Analysts across the industry are projecting that Bitcoin (BTC) will move toward $150,000 in the coming market cycle. Historically, when Bitcoin (BTC)’s value surges, investors not only gain exposure to BTC itself but also look for high-growth projects that can outperform. This trend often leads to capital flowing into altcoins that are still early in their journey. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining attention as a DeFi project designed with real utility and infrastructure that could stand out as Bitcoin (BTC) climbs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not positioning itself as just another token tied to speculation. Instead, it is building a foundation of decentralized finance tools: a stablecoin designed to hold $1 in value, lending and borrowing mechanisms backed by collateral, and an oracle-driven system for accurate price discovery and risk management. These are the kinds of systems that investors and users turn to when markets heat up and volatility rises. Stablecoin Utility During BTC Rallies One of the most attractive aspects of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be its stablecoin design. The token is created only when users borrow against assets like ETH or BTC and is removed from circulation when loans are repaid or liquidated. This approach means people do not have to sell their Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum to access liquidity—they will be able to borrow against them while keeping their exposure intact. During a BTC rally toward $150,000, this will become especially valuable because users often want to maintain their position while still unlocking funds to use in other investments or real-world expenses. The stability mechanism goes further. Interest rates on borrowing this stablecoin will not be left to chance or speculative markets but will be adjusted through governance to help keep the peg close to $1. If the stablecoin trades higher than $1, the rate can be lowered; if it dips below, the rate can rise. Combined with arbitrage opportunities and automatic liquidations on under-collateralized loans, the system is designed to stay balanced even in periods of market turbulence. To make this work, reliable pricing data is essential. Mutuum will rely on established oracle feeds such as Chainlink to bring verified asset prices into its system. Oracles serve as the lifeline for liquidations and borrowing, especially when BTC swings sharply. The roadmap also accounts for fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and decentralized exchange data as backup references. This layered design helps ensure that liquidations and valuations happen fairly and on time, a safeguard that gives lenders and borrowers confidence. Presale Momentum and Early Entry Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its presale, which places it in a unique position compared to Bitcoin (BTC)’s maturity. Phase 6 is live at $0.035, with 45% of the tokens in this round already sold, more than $16.10 million raised, and over 16,500 holders onboard. The next phase will lift the price to $0.040, a 15% increase, which creates urgency for those watching from the sidelines. Investors who enter during this phase lock in a lower entry point before the next price step, while the presale continues to attract attention as a rare early-stage opportunity. Staking and Long-Term Value Creation Beyond borrowing and lending, Mutuum is introducing a staking mechanism through mtTokens. When users deposit assets into liquidity pools, they will receive mtTokens representing their share. These mtTokens can then be staked in designated smart contracts to earn MUTM rewards. On top of this, the platform plans to use its revenue for open-market buybacks of MUTM tokens, which are then distributed to stakers. This creates a system of compounding rewards that Bitcoin (BTC) does not provide, giving long-term holders of MUTM a way to steadily grow their position. Mutuum’s roadmap further highlights how early this project still is. Phase 1, which included the presale launch, initial marketing campaigns, a CertiK audit, and tracking platform listings, has been largely executed. Phase 2 will involve building core smart contracts, the front-end app, and back-end infrastructure, alongside code reviews and analytics development. Phase 3 focuses on finalizing the system with testnet demos, additional audits, security checks, and exchange listing preparations. Phase 4 will deliver the live platform, exchange listings for MUTM, activation of claims, regional compliance, and multi-chain expansion. Compared to Bitcoin (BTC)’s long-established role, Mutuum is only just beginning, which is where growth opportunities often lie. Why Analysts See MUTM as a Strategic Play The reason analysts are aligning with MUTM at this stage is simple: Bitcoin (BTC)’s rally toward $150,000 will dominate headlines, but the largest profits often come from projects that build critical infrastructure around it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines a decentralized stablecoin, lending and borrowing features, oracle-driven precision, staking rewards, and a clearly defined roadmap. With its presale still active at just $0.035, investors have a chance to enter at an early level before Bitcoin (BTC) reaches its next milestone. Riding BTC’s growth is a proven path, but pairing it with a project like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers the chance to capture multiples in the same cycle.

Such a prospect has generated heightened interest, as it touches on one of the most debated areas in the future of cross-border settlements. Bale (@AltcoinBale), a well-known crypto figure on X, posted that his sources informed him Ripple is close to reaching an agreement with SWIFT. He called the situation “BREAKING” and urged followers to take notice. While the claim remains unconfirmed, its meaning is clear. If true, Ripple’s technology could play a role in modernizing SWIFT’s international payments framework. For XRP, the native digital asset tied to Ripple’s operations, integration into a global standard for banking transactions would mark a turning point in real-world adoption . BREAKING My sources are telling me RIPPLE is close to an agreement with SWIFT for cross border settlements. Lock the fuck in right now. — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 20, 2025 Why It Would Benefit XRP XRP has long been positioned as a faster, cheaper, and more scalable alternative to legacy systems used to move money across borders. Traditional SWIFT processes rely heavily on correspondent banks, manual reconciliation, and settlement times that can stretch to several days. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously called SWIFT’s system outdated , and the costs associated with those delays often fall on businesses and individuals trying to move money globally. By contrast, XRP transactions settle in seconds, with much lower fees, and function on a decentralized ledger without reliance on intermediaries. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If SWIFT were to adopt Ripple’s technology and integrate XRP, the partnership could help transition the network from its decades-old infrastructure into a new phase of efficiency. For SWIFT, the benefit would be the ability to maintain its central role in the global financial system while addressing long-standing criticisms of slow speed and high cost. For XRP, it would provide unprecedented validation as a digital asset capable of scaling to meet the demands of global finance. Will XRP Replace SWIFT? Supporters of XRP have always argued that integration with SWIFT or a total overhaul would represent the kind of adoption long-awaited by the digital asset community. While some questioned Bale’s claims, many approved of this potential development. These reports are currently unconfirmed. XRP has sufficient liquidity, offering fast and cheap transactions, which could bring the global cross-border payments system into a new age. However, at press time, there is no indication that both parties are collaborating.

For instance, BTC is now testing the all-important 50% Fibonacci retracement level drawn from the low of its September rally. This level also coincides with the 100 EMA, which has historically served as an effective support for Bitcoin. Together, these confluences suggest that Bitcoin is simply taking a much-needed breather before potentially resuming its long-term bull run. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts $BTC $350K Price as Bitcoin Hyper Isn’t too Far from $20M in Presale September 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Robert Kiyosaki, author of ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ made another astounding crypto prediction – Bitcoin to reach $350,000 in the future . The Bitcoin Therapist (an X analyst) also made the same prediction, claiming that gold is ~10x Bitcoin’s value. With price appreciation to take $BTC at 30% of gold value, it would hit ~$350K per coin . Many commenters are calling this estimate conservative, even. Just by looking at Bitcoin’s entire lifespan and its parabolic climb to a $124K ATH, $350K doesn’t seem like fiction anymore. Backed by significant institutional appeal through $BTC treasuries ( 3.74M total $BTC holdings ), BIitcoin’s journey above $150K seems like a near certainty in the minds of many. We also believe the king crypto is destined for greatness. But sadly, it’s far from a best fit for current DeFi demands. No dApps, no smart contracts, almost zero programmability. That’s where today’s crypto presale, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes into play. It plans to add all of the above and increase $BTC’s transaction speed to hundreds sand thousands of transactions per second. Take a look at what Bitcoin Hyper is planning to do in its $17.5M-strong presale. Ethereum Holds Strong Against Bearish Pressure While Bitcoin Hyper Bridges the DeFi Gap Between BTC & ETH September 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Ethereum has been trading near the $4.5K resistance this weekend, with 24 hour volume still +150% up today . While the dip to $4.2K might show a short-term bearish reversal, this might just be a case of ongoing volatility. In fact, according to recent Glassnode figures, investors have been moving $ETH off exchanges in record numbers since late August. This signals optimism and growing investor accumulation as holders are moving their bags off CEXes for long-term holding. This shift comes at a time when Vitalik Buterin highlights Ethereum’s role as a low-risk DeFi powerhouse . With DeFi protocols becoming the backbone of Ethereum’s economy, investor interest in blockchain tech is more evident than ever. Another DeFi-focused project, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is also making waves with a daring mission: roll out Ethereum and Solana-style smart contracts through a Bitcoin Layer-2. This project is set to power scalable DeFi protocols and keep Bitcoin’s secure settlement, delivering the best of both Bitcoin and top alt chains. Learn about Hyper’s potential with this $HYPER price prediction.

Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto.

XRP Price Fluctuates as It May Aim for a $5 Breakthrough Soon: PEPENODE as Next Crypto to Explode in the Aftermath September 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC $XRP whales have moved over $800M in a few hours , hinting at upcoming price swings. But the token’s recent breakthrough of $3 shows potential for more upside, perhaps aiming for $5. While $XRP is currently $2.81 , with a 100% increase in trading volume in the last day and a sharp drop in the last day. Are the bears currently winning? That might look like it but long-term, we believe $XRP remains bullish. Ali Martinez did say that the next price to watch is $2.78 , which was a strong demand zone previously. If $XRP hits that level, it could respark another rally above $3. With Ripple behind it, this prediction has a lot of weight, and altcoins like PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) are bound to benefit from $XRP’s future rally. This has happened time and time again – blue-chip cryptos pumping hard and pulling low-cap coins after them. As for $PEPENODE, it delivers a virtual mining minigame with gamification features that’s as interactive as it is rewarding. The staking APY is over 960% now, for instance. Check out how to buy PEPENODE, one of 2025’s top presales. Analyst Predicts 730% Dogecoin Surge. This New Doge Token Could Be the Next Crypto to Explode September 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Ever wondered ‘Can Dogecoin reach $1?’ A crypto analyst made a bullish prediction: Dogecoin is headed for a massive 730% rally, and could potentially hit a new ATH near $2.28. According to Javon Marks, a crypto trader and analyst with over 57K followers on X, Dogecoin follows a cyclical growth pattern. Based on $DOGE’s price history so far, the token is looking at a 8.3x run at a minimum, though the most bullish prediction sees Dogecoin going 20x to $5.3+ . While this sounds nice, other traders are skeptical. Such a 730% surge isn’t impossible in crypto, but this would put $DOGE’s market cap in the 300B+ range. Still, building momentum around Dogecoin could likely trickle into lower cap coins with better upside potential, like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a good contender for the next crypto to explode in the dog token niche. This degen-coded dog token plans a listing on Uniswap, with a market cap target in the low $15M range. Check $MAXI’s $2.4M+ strong presale here.

GAIB, a visionary crypto AI startup, has announced a significant $30 million partnership with Siam.AI, a prominent AI data center operator based in Thailand. This strategic alliance is poised to revolutionize AI infrastructure development through an innovative approach: GPU tokenization . This groundbreaking initiative is not merely about expanding data centers; it aims to democratize access to powerful computing resources by converting them into digital, tradable assets on the decentralized market. What Exactly is GPU Tokenization and Why Does it Matter? At its core, GPU tokenization involves transforming physical Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) – the powerhouse components essential for intensive AI computations – into digital tokens on a blockchain. Imagine owning a verifiable, digital piece of a supercomputer, accessible to a broader range of investors. This method allows GAIB to raise capital in the decentralized market by offering investors fractional ownership or access rights to these high-demand GPUs. Democratizing Access: It opens up investment opportunities for a wider range of participants, moving beyond traditional institutional investors. Enhanced Liquidity: Tokenized assets can be traded more easily and quickly on decentralized exchanges, increasing market efficiency. Transparent Funding: Blockchain technology provides an immutable and transparent record of all transactions, fostering greater trust and accountability. Scalable Infrastructure: The funds raised through this tokenization directly support the expansion of critical AI computing power, addressing a vital industry need.

52096398,586362,1758541275,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52096398.jpeg,Die Bären sind los? Warum Bitcoin und Co. jetzt abstürzen,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-kurs-absturz-ethereum-abwarts-liquidation/,"Der Kryptomarkt hat einen heftigen Rückschlag erlebt und Milliardenverluste verzeichnet. Über 407.000 Händler mussten ihre Positionen aufgeben, weil die Kurse schnell fielen. Besonders Ethereum und kleinere Coins wie Dogecoin und Solana waren betroffen. Plötzlich rauschten die Kurse nach unten: Innerhalb von nur einem Tag verloren viele Kryptowährungen deutlich an Wert. Für mehr als 400.000 Trader bedeutete das massive Verluste. Auch wenn Bitcoin nur leicht nachgab, traf es vor allem Ethereum und die kleineren Coins hart. Experten sehen in der Unsicherheit der Weltwirtschaft einen wichtigen Auslöser. Ein Tag voller Verluste An nur einem Tag gingen über 1,5 Milliarden Dollar verloren. Der Grund: Viele Händler hatten auf steigende Kurse gesetzt, doch die Kurse entwickelten sich genau in die andere Richtung. Weil sie dabei Kredite nutzten, also mit sogenanntem Hebel handelten, wurden ihre Positionen zwangsweise geschlossen. Liquidation Alert In the past 24 hours: ✦ 406,205 traders were liquidated ✦ Total liquidations reached $1.69 billion ✦ Largest single liquidation: $12.74M #OKX – BTC-USDT-SWAP. Liquidation Breakdown: Longs: $1.61B Shorts: $83.48M #Crypto #Liquidations $BTC … pic.twitter.com/k4G3RWhOFE — CryptOpus (@ImCryptOpus) September 22, 2025 Das nennt man Liquidation. Wenn der Kurs zu stark fällt, reicht die Sicherheitsleistung der Trader nicht mehr aus. Dann schließt die Handelsplattform automatisch die Positionen. Das kann wie eine Lawine wirken und noch mehr Verkäufe auslösen. Ethereum rutscht stark ab Ethereum, die zweitgrößte Kryptowährung, fiel zeitweise um 9% auf 4.075 Dollar. Allein hier wurden fast eine halbe Milliarde Dollar an Long-Positionen beendet. Am Ende lag der Tagesverlust noch immer bei rund 6%. Eigentlich hatte ETH in den letzten Woche deutlich Stärke gezeigt. Bitcoin hielt sich etwas besser, rutschte aber auch um fast 3% nach unten und fiel auf knapp 112.000 Dollar. Nach einem kurzen Rückgang konnte sich Bitcoin etwas stabilisieren, doch die allgemeine Unsicherheit bleibt. Kleinere Coins verlieren noch mehr Besonders deutlich waren die Verluste bei den kleineren Kryptowährungen. Dogecoin stürzte um mehr als 10% ab und war damit der größte Verlierer. Auch Solana , Cardano, BNB und Tron verloren kräftig, alle mindestens 5% innerhalb von 24 Stunden. Gerade für Kleinanleger, die oft in solche Coins investieren, war das ein schwerer Schlag. Viele hatten auf schnelle Gewinne gehofft, doch die starke Verkaufswelle drehte den Markt ins Negative. Was Liquidationen verraten Liquidationen zeigen nicht nur Verluste, sie geben auch Hinweise auf die Stimmung im Markt. Wenn viele Long-Positionen aufgelöst werden, bedeutet das oft, dass die Hoffnung auf steigende Kurse zu groß war. Manchmal ist genau dann ein Tiefpunkt erreicht. In the last 24 hours: 107,066 traders liquidated Total liquidations: $400.95M Biggest single order: $7.83M on BitMEX (XBTZ25)The markets aren’t playing around. #WiseCrypto #Liquidations #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/LYN4qlHgJL — Wise Crypto (@WiseCrypto_) August 19, 2025 Andersherum können Liquidationen von Short-Positionen, also Wetten auf fallende Kurse, eine Erholung andeuten. Profis schauen deshalb genau auf diese Daten, weil sie dabei helfen, den nächsten Trend frühzeitig zu erkennen. Unsicherheit durch die Weltwirtschaft Die Verluste haben auch mit den weltweiten Finanzmärkten zu tun. Zwar hat die US-Notenbank die Zinsen zuletzt gesenkt, doch die allgemeine Lage bleibt angespannt. Investoren warten gespannt auf neue Wirtschaftsdaten wie die Arbeitslosenzahlen und die Rede des Fed-Chefs. Der Marktstratege Nassar Achkar sagt, dass Bitcoin in dieser unsicheren Zeit wohl stärker bleibt als andere Coins. Ethereum und kleinere Projekte könnten dagegen weniger Chancen haben, schnell wieder nach oben zu kommen. Wie es weitergehen könnte Die kommenden Tage sind entscheidend. Sollte die US-Notenbank eine eher lockere Haltung zeigen, könnte das die Stimmung verbessern. Dann hätten vor allem die Altcoins eine Chance auf eine kleine Erholung. Hier gehts zu einem Artikel über den Binance Coin (BNB) und warum er gerade so performt. Doch bleibt die Lage angespannt, drohen weitere Rückschläge. Für Anleger heißt das: Vorsicht ist wichtig, und wer investiert, sollte genau hinschauen, wo mögliche Risiken lauern. Ohne Risiko investieren geht nicht, das ist klar. Aber durch gründliche Rechereche können Investoren doch zumindest Risiken minimieren. Ein Projekt, was derzeit immer mehr an Fahrt gewinnt ist Bitcoin Hyper. Bitcoin Hyper: Bitcoin endlich schnell und smart Bitcoin Hyper bringt frischen Wind in die Krypto-Welt: ein Layer-2, das Bitcoins Sicherheit mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana kombiniert. Das bedeutet blitzschnelle Transaktionen, extrem niedrige Gebühren und echte Smart-Contract-Power – direkt auf Bitcoin.

Growing interest suggests it may soon attract more users than Avalanche has so far. Unique features and steady momentum are fueling this rise. What’s driving experts to favor XYZverse right now, and what sets it apart from its rival? The answer may surprise many. Avalanche: The Fast, Green Chain Racing Ahead in the Crypto Sprint Avalanche, or AVAX, is a fresh Layer-1 network built for speed and care for the planet. It moves value at up to 4,500 transactions per second and settles each deal in under two seconds. Fees stay tiny, so small payments make sense. The magic comes from three linked roads, called X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain, that split work and avoid jams. A special mix of voting rules, drawn from both old and new block ideas, keeps the system safe. Users can even launch their own mini-chains, called Subnets, with only a few clicks. AVAX powers it all, paying for fees, rewards, and custom tokens. Right now, the market is hunting for chains that mix low cost with high speed, and Avalanche fits that wish list. While older leaders like Ethereum face crowded lanes and high tolls, AVAX offers a smoother ride. Its Subnet idea also draws game studios and finance apps that want their own space without starting from zero. If the next cycle favors real use rather than hype, a token that fuels fast, green, and flexible rails could shine. For many watchers, that makes AVAX an appealing pick at current prices. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.0055 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early for Maximum Gains Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Conclusion AVAX remains strong, yet bull run 2025 favors first all-sport memecoin XYZverse (XYZ), uniting sports fans and targeting PEPE-like gains through early, community-driven growth.

With Bitcoin falling to $112,000, these declines suggest that declines could deepen further in September, which has historically been known as the weakest month of the year. At this point, analysis firm Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson said that three indicators show that the cycle is exhausted and are giving bearish signals. Accordingly, the Alphractal CEO first said that the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Trend Signal is giving bearish signals. SOPR measures whether Bitcoin transactions are profitable or unprofitable on-chain. A reading above 1 indicates sellers are in profit, while a reading below 1 indicates sellers are in loss. According to the current chart, SOPR is currently trending downward, although it remains above 1. This indicates that the profitability from on-chain transactions is decreasing. “The SOPR signal is an excellent tool for detecting when profitability on the blockchain is starting to decline. Never in the history of Bitcoin have investors accumulated so late and at such high prices.” The analyst also noted that the realized price for short-term investors (STH) is at $111,400, which is close to the current market level. A drop below this level could trigger stop-loss sell orders. The analyst recently noted that despite Bitcoin's higher price than in previous cycles, its Sharpe ratio is also weaker, meaning risk-adjusted returns are lower, thus reducing profit potential. Joao Wedson stated that these three indicators signal a decline, and that the social interest will increase again not thanks to Bitcoin, but thanks to altcoins. *This is not investment advice.

They’ve just announced ambitious plans to significantly expand their BNB investment holdings, signaling a bold move in the digital asset space. This isn’t just a minor portfolio adjustment; it’s a massive capital raise designed to position the company firmly within the BNB ecosystem. What’s Behind This Massive BNB Investment Push? CEA Industry intends to secure an impressive $1.25 billion to fuel its expanded commitment to BNB. This substantial sum will be acquired through a two-pronged approach: Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE): The firm plans to raise $500 million via this method. Warrants: An additional $750 million will be secured through the issuance of warrants. This strategic financial maneuver was formally announced when CEA Industry filed a simplified S-3 securities registration form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 19. The filing clearly outlines their future direction, emphasizing a dedicated focus on generating returns specifically from BNB investment . Why is BNB Investment Captivating Institutional Players? Many might wonder why a Nasdaq-listed company would commit such a significant amount to a single cryptocurrency. BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem, offers more than just speculative value. It powers the Binance Smart Chain (now BNB Chain), facilitates trading on Binance Exchange, and offers utility across a vast decentralized application (dApp) landscape. Institutions are increasingly recognizing the potential of well-established cryptocurrencies like BNB. Its robust ecosystem, coupled with mechanisms like token burns that reduce supply over time, makes it an attractive asset for long-term growth. For CEA Industry, this expanded BNB investment could unlock new avenues for yield and portfolio diversification within the digital economy. Moreover, a public company like CEA Industry making such a definitive move lends credibility to the broader crypto market. It demonstrates a growing institutional confidence in digital assets as legitimate components of investment portfolios. Are There Risks to This Bold BNB Investment Strategy? While the potential rewards are significant, any substantial move into the cryptocurrency market comes with inherent risks. The crypto landscape is known for its volatility; prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods. Therefore, CEA Industry’s BNB investment will certainly navigate these market swings. Regulatory scrutiny is another critical factor. The U.S. SEC continues to develop its stance on digital assets, and future regulations could impact the operational environment for firms heavily invested in cryptocurrencies. CEA Industry, as a publicly traded entity, will need to carefully manage these evolving compliance requirements. Furthermore, the success of this strategy hinges on the continued growth and stability of the BNB ecosystem itself. Any challenges faced by the BNB Chain or Binance could directly affect the value of CEA Industry’s holdings. What Does This Mean for the Future of BNB Investment ? CEA Industry’s decision to pursue such a substantial BNB investment could be a bellwether for broader institutional adoption. It highlights a growing trend where traditional financial entities are seeking direct exposure to leading digital assets rather than just indirect participation. For existing BNB holders and enthusiasts, this institutional backing could be seen as a positive indicator, potentially contributing to long-term price stability and ecosystem development. The move signifies a maturation of the crypto market, where sophisticated financial instruments are being deployed for digital asset acquisition. Ultimately, this expansion by CEA Industry sets a precedent. It demonstrates that strategic, large-scale crypto investments are becoming a viable and attractive option for public companies looking to capitalize on the evolving digital financial landscape. It will be fascinating to observe how this ambitious strategy unfolds and its impact on both CEA Industry and the wider BNB ecosystem.

The post came just hours after one of the sharpest market shakeouts in weeks. I would like to see a pause in the endless rally of speculation, gold. crypto and profitless companies — Jim Cramer (@jimcramer) September 22, 2025 The crypto market was hit particularly hard. In less than 20 minutes, over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin long positions were liquidated as low-liquidity conditions during the Sunday night session triggered a sudden drop. As often happens in these time frames, thin order books amplified the sell-off, creating a washout across the digital asset space. Crypto community is confused Virtually all top-ten cryptocurrencies turned red over the past week, with the sole exception of BNB, which has continued to defy the broader pullback. XRP, Ethereum, and Bitcoin all posted multi-day lows, sparking heated debate among traders. One user responded directly to Cramer’s post, writing: “What rally in crypto are you speaking of? The crypto market has been bearish.” At the same time, gold is charting an entirely different path. The safe-haven asset surged to a new all-time high above $3,726 per ounce on Monday, underscoring its resilience amid global macro uncertainty. Cramer’s comments lumped gold into the same speculative basket as crypto, though for many investors, the divergence highlights the contrasting roles the two assets play: one as a volatile risk asset, the other as a hedge in turbulent times. The question of “profitless companies” remains ambiguous, with Cramer not naming specific stocks. However, the remark points to a familiar theme in his commentary, where unprofitable tech names often come under scrutiny when markets shift toward risk-off sentiment. Despite Cramer’s call for a pause, seasoned traders noted that crypto dips during thin weekend sessions are often bought back into the U.S. market open, a pattern that has played out repeatedly this year. It remains to be seen whether this week follows that script depends on how Bitcoin reacts to the liquidation flush and whether institutional buyers step in at lower levels.

On Monday, spot gold jumped to $3,726.19 per ounce, the highest it’s ever been, before settling at $3,723.81 as of 0950 GMT. U.S. gold futures for December didn’t lag either, climbing 1.4% to $3,758.40. The spike came ahead of a packed week where the Federal Reserve is expected to speak, and new inflation data could set the stage for more rate cuts . Traders are placing bigger bets that the Fed is now well on a dovish path, especially after it just cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Wednesday, its first cut since December. Investors are now pricing in two more cuts this year, one in October with a 93% chance, and another in December at 81%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Fed speakers and inflation data drive gold outlook The focus now turns to what Fed officials say this week. Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is scheduled to speak on Tuesday, and multiple other officials will speak too. On top of that, core PCE inflation data is dropping Friday. All of this could push the metal even higher if the numbers give the Fed more room to cut again. Giovanni Staunovo, a strategist at UBS, said, “I would expect gold to reach new record highs this week with Fed officials likely to indicate further rate cuts, but also being data dependent on the pace and magnitude of cuts.” According to Staunovo, the Fed is watching the data, but the tone is clear: they’re leaning toward easing. But it’s not just interest rates fueling this move. Staunovo also pointed out that Western investors are finally jumping into gold , especially through ETF holdings, which until now had been mostly ignored by them. “There is a shift in the factors supporting gold. So far it was central banks and Asian demand, now we are also starting to see Western investors looking to add gold, visible in gold ETF holdings, driven by expectations of falling U.S. rates,” he said . That’s a change from what’s driven the yellow metal this year. So far, it’s been up more than 40%, thanks to geopolitical tension, economic uncertainty, and massive central bank buying. But the new player, rate-cut-hungry Western investors, is what’s pushing it into fresh territory now. There’s also some technical pressure adding to the mix. Analysts say prices could keep testing resistance around $3,705, and once it clears that, it might climb into a new range, $3,719 to $3,739. Staunovo added that $3,900 by mid-2026 is a real possibility if this momentum holds. Meanwhile, the rally isn’t just in gold. Silver jumped 1.4% to $43.67, the highest since 2010. Platinum moved up 0.8% to $1,415.09, and palladium added 1.9%, landing at $1,170.63. But all eyes are still locked on the yellow metal, and every sign this week points to more room for it to run.

The overwhelming response exceeded CZ’s expectations and fundamentally changed his perception of meme coins, which he previously dismissed as lacking utility. The donations came primarily through the “Giggle” token created by Giggle Fund, which charges trading fees in BNB and automatically sends proceeds to Giggle Academy’s donation address. The mechanism generated $900,000 in fees from a token with only a $5 million market capitalization, according to CZ’s X posts . CZ clarified that Giggle Academy did not create the token and has no plans to launch its own crypto. The platform will convert all meme coin donations to major altcoins for operational use, warning donors not to complain about potential selling pressure. The funds will incentivize contributors and accelerate platform growth, while CZ personally covers employee and server costs. Crazy that @GiggleAcademy received more than $1m donations in the first 12 hours of the feature being online. Way beyond my expectations. Lots of good people out there. Lots of good crypto people. 90% of the donations so far came from a meme coin. I still don't get how a $5m… https://t.co/U8vBt3pT1X pic.twitter.com/FIsuGT4Q7R — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) September 22, 2025 When Prison Release Sparked Educational Revolution CZ’s focus on education began during his transition from leading Binance, following a four-month federal prison sentence for money laundering violations that concluded in September 2024. The former crypto executive was released two days early on Friday, September 27, because prisons don’t release inmates on weekends under the US federal code. During his final months at a Long Beach halfway house, CZ received supervised excursions and even attended movies while preparing for his post-prison ventures. He spent five months before incarceration traveling across the United States, networking with entrepreneurs, including OpenAI’s Sam Altman, to discuss potential startup plans. Giggle Academy emerged from CZ’s desire to create a “ maximum positive impact ” by utilizing his software platform expertise to reach hundreds of millions of people. The concept paper , released in February 2024, outlined plans to provide free K-12 education to underprivileged children in developing countries who lack access to traditional schooling. Source: Giggle Academy The platform targets the 781 million illiterate adults worldwide, with 75% concentrated in South Asia, West Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. CZ’s vision encompasses teaching basic reading, writing, mathematics, science, and non-traditional subjects, including finance, entrepreneurship, blockchain, and artificial intelligence, that current schools typically omit. Giggle Academy deliberately avoids controversial subjects, such as history and religion, to prevent debates on its global platform. The curriculum aims to help children secure better employment opportunities, rather than preparing them for college admission, by focusing on practical skills and job market readiness through gamified learning experiences. From Meme Skeptic to Crypto Charity Convert The donation mechanism began when X user “RUNE” asked CZ whether Giggle Academy would accept token donations, citing examples like Vitalik Buterin’s $1 billion Shiba Inu donation to COVID-19 relief in India. hey @cz_binance , would giggle accept donations from tokens? an utility of memecoins is charity example, vitalik donated hundreds of millions from shiba, or watercoin donated millions to mr beast water project what about a token that has a trading fee and donates automatically… — RUNΞ (@RuneCrypto_) September 21, 2025 CZ initially expressed skepticism about meme coin donations, stating the platform would convert them fully to major cryptocurrencies. RUNE clarified that the proposed system wouldn’t involve direct token transfers but instead would charge BNB trading fees and send the proceeds as donations. This mechanism ensures that there is no negative price impact on the meme coin while generating substantial charitable contributions through trading activity. The Giggle Fund launched shortly after this exchange, creating the automated donation system that generated over $1 million in contributions within hours. The token describes itself as a “ donation coin that directly donates to GiggleAcademy ” and maintains transparent on-chain tracking of all contributions. CZ’s newfound appreciation for meme coin utility contradicts his previous stance on speculative cryptocurrencies. The experience convinced him that meme coins can serve legitimate purposes beyond pure speculation, saying that “ this will forever change my perception of meme coins. Meme coins have utility! ”. Initially, CZ plans to sustain Giggle Academy through future alumni donations from graduates who secure better employment through the platform’s education. The model eliminates traditional revenue streams, making charitable contributions essential for scaling operations and incentivizing high-quality content creators.

On September 22, 2025, Cronos (CRO) was trading at $0.1989, marking a significant downtrend of 11.45%. This movement follows a bearish trend that has been observed recently in the asset. The cryptocurrency faced notable resistance at $0.2266, while its immediate support level was found at $0.1962. The overall market sentiment has caused CRO to face pressure, as traders continue to navigate through volatile market conditions. Cronos daily price chart: CRO selling pressure intensifies as it approaches key support On the daily chart, the price of CRO has dropped steadily from $0.2269 to its current position at $0.1989. This is a clear indication of selling pressure, with the price moving downward through multiple key levels. The price is currently sitting near the support level of $0.1962, and a break below this level could signal further downside risks for the asset. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The technical indicators on the daily chart highlight the weakening bullish momentum and a shift towards a more neutral to bearish trend. As the price struggles to hold above the $0.20 mark, the selling pressure is dominating the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is showing signs of declining, indicating that sellers are gaining control. Additionally, trading volume has steadily increased during the downtrend, confirming the bearish sentiment. Cronos 4-hour price chart: CRO bearish trend persists as it tests key support On the 4-hour chart, the price movement shows a series of lower highs and lower lows, further confirming the bearish market structure. The asset has failed to break above the key resistance level at $0.2266, which continues to cap the upside potential. With the price approaching the critical support at $0.1962, the asset needs to hold this level, as a breakdown would indicate a stronger downtrend. CRO/USDT Chart: TradingView The moving averages on the 4-hour chart are all tilted downward, indicating that short-term bearish momentum is likely to continue. With the price currently testing its support zone, a bounce could occur, but it would require significant buying volume to break the current downtrend. If the selling pressure persists, the price is likely to continue sliding lower, with a focus on support levels and testing the $0.1962 mark.

Given the ongoing bearish trend, Cronos (CRO) is likely to continue facing selling pressure in the short term. With the price approaching the critical support level of $0.1962, CRO must hold this level. A breakdown below this support could trigger further downside movement, potentially testing lower levels. If the market sentiment remains bearish, the price will likely continue to struggle near resistance at $0.2266. A strong reversal or a shift in market conditions could help CRO bounce back, but this would require a significant increase in buying volume to break the prevailing downtrend. In the immediate future, traders will focus on how CRO behaves around the $0.1962 support to gauge its potential next move. Is Cronos a good investment? Given the current bearish market trend and the persistent selling pressure on Cronos (CRO), investing in the asset carries a higher level of risk in the short term. The price is nearing a critical support level at $0.1962, and if this level fails to hold, it could result in further declines. This suggests that CRO may not be a favorable investment for those looking for short-term gains. However, for long-term investors, the potential exists if CRO shows signs of stabilization or a reversal in market sentiment. Investors will need to monitor key levels closely, particularly the $0.1962 support, as a strong rebound could signal a future opportunity. A shift in market conditions or a significant increase in buying volume could support a positive outlook for CRO, but until then, caution is advised due to the ongoing downtrend. Why Is Cronos (CRO) Down Today? Cronos (CRO) is experiencing a significant downtrend, with a 11.45% decline observed on September 22, 2025. This drop is primarily driven by ongoing selling pressure as the overall market sentiment remains bearish. The price is testing crucial support levels near $0.1962, which is contributing to the current weakness. Several factors are influencing the current downtrend. The broader cryptocurrency market has been facing volatility, leading to a general risk-off sentiment among investors. CRO’s failure to break the $0.2266 resistance level further highlights the difficulty in regaining upward momentum. The downtrend is compounded by the increasing trading volume during sell-offs, reinforcing the bearish outlook. Until a shift in market conditions occurs, CRO is likely to continue facing downward pressure. Recent news As reported by Cryptopolitan , Cronos has released its 2025–2026 roadmap, detailing plans to position itself as a key infrastructure provider for tokenized assets and AI-powered finance. Over the next 12 to 18 months, it will launch a comprehensive tokenization platform covering asset classes such as equities, real estate, commodities, funds, insurance, and forex, with features like instant settlement, yield generation, lending, and DeFi integration. To make its ecosystem AI-native, Cronos will introduce an AI Agent SDK and a Proof of Identity standard, enabling direct interaction between AI agents and onchain finance. Adoption will be driven by integration with Crypto.com ’s 150 million users and 10 million merchants. At the same time, institutional demand will be supported through CRO ETFs in the U.S. and Europe, backed by partners like 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Trump Media Technology Group. The roadmap also highlights support for CRO-based digital asset treasuries, bolstered by the recent $6.4 billion Trump Media– Crypto.com SPAC merger aimed at establishing a dedicated CRO treasury and validator. Will Cronos reach $0.5? Based on long-term forecasts, Cronos (CRO) is projected to reach $0.5 by 2026 as its ecosystem and user adoption continue to grow. Will Cronos reach $1? Projections for Cronos estimate it could reach $1 by 2028, driven by its expansion in DeFi, NFT integrations, and partnerships. Will Cronos reach $100? It is unlikely that Cronos’s price will reach $100, as this would require an extremely high market capitalization beyond the current CRO coin price prediction for the crypto sector. Does Cronos have an excellent long-term future? Cronos CRO holds promising long-term potential due to Crypto.com ’s ongoing innovations, such as DEX expansions, NFT integration, and metaverse applications, collectively enhancing CRO’s appeal and utility. These strategic initiatives, along with CRO’s liquidity and staking rewards, position it as a solid investment for those with a long-term perspective.

Recently, Nasdaq-listed Bitmine (BMNR), a company with a strong focus on Ethereum investments, made headlines with an impressive announcement. The company now boasts substantial Bitmine ETH holdings , reaching an astounding 2,416,054 ETH. This figure represents a remarkable increase of more than 250,000 ETH in just one week. Such rapid accumulation underscores Bitmine’s aggressive strategy and its deep conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value. Investors and enthusiasts are certainly taking note of this powerful expansion. Understanding Bitmine’s Impressive ETH Holdings Growth Bitmine’s latest report highlights a strategic pivot towards significant accumulation. The company’s decision to expand its Bitmine ETH holdings so rapidly is not merely a short-term play. It aligns with a much larger, ambitious vision: to secure over 5% of the total Ethereum supply in the long term. This goal, if achieved, would position Bitmine as a dominant force within the Ethereum ecosystem. It would grant them substantial influence and expose them to significant potential upside as Ethereum continues to evolve. The recent increase demonstrates tangible progress towards this audacious target, providing a clear indicator of their commitment. Significant Accumulation: Over 250,000 ETH added in a single week. Strategic Vision: Long-term goal to hold over 5% of total ETH supply. Market Impact: Potential for increased institutional confidence in Ethereum. Why Bitmine’s Strategy for Ethereum Holdings Matters The implications of Bitmine’s expanding Bitmine ETH holdings extend far beyond the company itself. For the broader crypto market, this institutional confidence can be a powerful catalyst. When a publicly traded company like Bitmine makes such a bold statement, it often encourages other traditional investors to consider similar allocations. Moreover, a significant holder like Bitmine could play a crucial role in the network’s future. Their substantial stake might influence governance decisions and contribute to the stability and security of the Ethereum blockchain. This kind of deep engagement from major entities is often seen as a sign of maturation for the cryptocurrency space. However, this strategy also comes with its own set of challenges. Market volatility remains a constant factor in cryptocurrencies. While the potential for gains is high, so too is the risk of price fluctuations affecting the value of their substantial holdings. Bitmine’s leadership will undoubtedly need to navigate these market dynamics carefully. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Bitmine and its ETH Holdings? As Bitmine continues to grow its Bitmine ETH holdings , several key areas will be worth watching. Firstly, the pace of their accumulation will indicate their confidence in Ethereum’s immediate future. Are they accelerating their purchases, or maintaining a steady rate? Secondly, their engagement with the Ethereum community and their stance on network upgrades will be vital. A company holding such a significant portion of the supply naturally becomes a stakeholder with a vested interest in the network’s success. Their actions could set precedents for how large institutional players interact with decentralized ecosystems. For investors, Bitmine’s performance could serve as a bellwether for institutional crypto adoption. Their journey will offer valuable insights into the opportunities and complexities of integrating digital assets into traditional financial frameworks. Therefore, closely monitoring their progress becomes an essential part of understanding the evolving crypto landscape. In conclusion, Bitmine’s incredible growth in its Ethereum portfolio is a compelling story of institutional conviction. Their ambitious goal to secure 5% of the total ETH supply, backed by their recent rapid accumulation, positions them as a key player in the future of decentralized finance. This development highlights the increasing mainstream acceptance and long-term potential of Ethereum as a foundational digital asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Bitmine (BMNR)?

52098003,https://invezz.com/?p=2892788,1758542111,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,NEIRO price dips 20% as Binance confirms contract delisting,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/22/neiro-price-dips-20-as-binance-confirms-contract-delisting/,"Amid broader market slumps , Binance deteriorated sentiments among the NEIRO community with plans to delist the alt’s perpetual contract later this week. In a Monday’s notice, the leading exchange confirmed it will close all NEIRO positions on September 26, 2025. Binance Futures @BinanceFutures · Follow Binance Futures will close all positions and conduct an automatic settlement on USDⓈ-M $NEIROETH perpetual contract at 🗓️Sept. 26 2025, 09:00 (UTC) The contracts will be delisted after the settlement is complete.Read more 👇 binance.com/en/support/ann… 1:06 pm · 22 Sept 2025 120 Reply Copy link Read 33 replies Users should close their open positions before this deadline to avoid automatic settlement. From 09:00 UTC on the same day, the NEIROETHUSDT perpetual contract will no longer be available on Binance Futures. Furthermore, the platform will not support new trades from $08:30 UTC on September 26. That means a narrow timeframe to adjust before Binance removes NEIRO entirely. The meme token plunged after the announcement, now down over 20% on its daily chart. NEIRO braces for heightened volatility The official announcement included multiple warnings to traders. Notably, Binance will not support liquidations using the Futures Insurance Fund 60 minutes before contract settlement. It will use Immediate or Cancel Order (IOCO) to handle any liquidation in that timeframe, with positions that fail to satisfy margin requirements processed via Auto-Deleveraging (ADL). Binance has warned users to monitor and manage their NEIRO positions as that period could witness amplified volatility and liquidity crunches. Users are strongly advised to actively monitor and manage open positions during the final hours, as this period may be subject to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity. Moreover, the exchange revealed it might adopt various protective procedures without notice. That includes adjusting funding rates, leverage, price index constituents, and margin tiers to safeguard against extreme conditions. What does it mean for the project? While delisting perpetual contracts doesn’t remove the coins from spot markets, it limits derivatives trading activity. That translates to reduced user activity, which can translate to lower liquidity. With Binance’s move, NEIRO traders who rely on perpetuals for speculation or hedging will have to find exposure on different platforms or trading pairs. The exchange didn’t clarify the reasons behind removing NEIRO’s perpetual contract. However, the move is likely to ensure market stability and manage risk. That happens whenever the contract’s trading volume plunges or volatility becomes overwhelming to handle. NEIRO exhibits massive bearishness after prolonged downsides. The meme coin has lost over 60% of its value in the past year. It has failed to rally despite broader market gains in the past months. Its sluggish price actions have forced its loyal investors to exit . NEIRO price outlook The altcoin leads the downside after losing over 20% within the past 24 hours. NEIRO trades $0.03114. Chart by CoinMarketCap The 260% uptick in daily trading volume signals intensified user activity, potentially from traders and holders exiting after Binance’s announcement. With the current broader market dip, NEIRO’s price will likely dip further before gaining ground.

Despite the pullback, people are starting to think US banks will open the floodgates to mainstream adoption soon. Alessio Quaglini, CEO of Hong Kong-based Hex Trust, says regulation is the last hurdle to full institutional participation. “Give it a few months, every single bank in the U.S. will provide custody services for Bitcoin,” Quaglini said in a recent interview. “That’s when we’ll have real adoption—when banks start offering Bitcoin deposits, trading, and structured products.” His view reflects a growing belief that once U.S. regulators finalize rules, the banking sector will follow swiftly. While banks worldwide have run pilots, few have gone live without clear U.S. approval. Quaglini calls American oversight the “global benchmark” that sets the tone for financial markets everywhere. Hex Trust Expands Institutional Footprint Founded in 2018, Hex Trust offers custody, trading, lending, and staking services to large institutions. Licensed in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, and Europe, the firm has scaled rapidly—growing from $300,000 in seed funding to more than 200 employees and over a million end-users via institutional partnerships. The company raised $6 million in Series A funding in 2021 and aims to hit $20 million in revenue by 2025, with long-term ambitions of hundreds of millions and a potential IPO. “We want to be the J.P. Morgan of Asia in crypto,” Quaglini said. He also sees stablecoins as a parallel disruptor, predicting they will replace the SWIFT network for cross-border payments. “They’re faster, cheaper, programmable money,” he added, warning that traditional remittance firms like Western Union could struggle as adoption accelerates. Hex Trust’s strategy contrasts with U.S.-listed peers such as Coinbase and Galaxy Digital. While those firms rely heavily on retail trading fees or proprietary trading income, Hex Trust focuses on institutional custody to limit exposure to volatility. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Key Levels Ahead Technically , Bitcoin has broken down from the channel, below $116,000 support and now at $112,900, close to the 200-EMA at $113,450. The decline produced long red candles like a three black crows pattern, which often means more weakness to come. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI is 26, oversold, but we need confirmation via bullish engulfing or hammer candles before calling a reversal. Immediate support is at $113,450, then $110,820 and $108,770. Resistance is at $115,000-$116,200, where a breakout could propel us to $117,900 and $119,300. #Bitcoin broke below $116K support, now testing $113K near the 200-EMA. RSI at 26 shows oversold, but no reversal yet. Key zones: $110.8K support / $116.2K resistance. pic.twitter.com/QK0cXraKWD — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) September 22, 2025 For now, aggressive traders can short below $115,000 with stops above $116,200. More cautious traders can wait for a confirmed reversal at $110,800 before getting long. Despite the near-term bearish pressure, the longer term trend of higher lows since summer is still intact, so we could see a bounce to $120,000. As Quaglini says, US regulatory clarity will be the ultimate catalyst. Once banks add Bitcoin to mainstream finance, Wall Street will enter the party and drive the next big move. For investors, the message is clear: the window to position before banks and institutions pile in is closing.

""BTCUSD fell out of the upward channel that had been in place since early September, dropped below horizontal support and fell sharply below the 50-day moving average. ""This combination of negative signals suggests a further decline is likely unless there is a fundamental change in financial market sentiment."" Derivatives Positioning By Omkar Godbole The top 20 tokens, except for BTC and HYPE, have seen double-digit declines in futures open interest as the price drops shake out overleveraged bets. Shorts seem to be stepping in via Binance-listed USDT futures, as OI has increased to 276K BTC from 270K alongside near-zero funding rates in the past couple of hours. Funding rates in TRX, ADA, LINK, TON, UNI and Binance-listed 1000SHIB futures are notably negative, indicating a bias for bearish, short positions. Funding rates for other majors, including BTC, are flat to slightly positive. BTC front-month futures on the CME still trade at a roughly $100 premium to the spot price. Traders need to watch out for a potential shift into discount for signs of strengthening of selling pressure. On Deribit, put premiums relative to calls have spiked, as the price drops bolster demand for downside protection. Sentiment in the XRP and SOL options has flipped bearish too, aligning with BTC and ETH markets. Token Talk By Oliver Knight A number of altcoins were dealt double-digit moves to the downside on Monday, with the likes of PUMP, RAY, CRV and TIA all sliding to their lowest in over a month. The sell-off was made worse by a $1.6 billion liquidation cascade, with $500 million occurring on ether (ETH) trading pairs, according to CoinGlass . Funding rates for ether flipped negative, which means short traders are paying to hold their position, demonstrating a shift in sentiment following ETH's rally from $2,400 at the start of July to $4,831 in late August. It's worth noting that crypto majors like BTC, ETH and SOL are now at respective levels of support and as sentiment has flipped bearish, a recovery could be staged to target traders being overly aggressive in short positions. The average crypto token relative strength index (RSI) is also at 28.4 out of 100 , indicating heavily oversold conditions that will likely lead to a relief rally, unless ETH and BTC break their levels of support.",Markets|Markets|Crypto Markets Today|market analysis|Derivatives|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-22 12:00:00
52097439,586165,1758542408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52097439.jpeg,Bitcoin LTH Sit On $1.18 Trillion In Unrealized Profits – What This Means For The Market,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lth-sit-1-18-trillion-in-unrealized-profits/,"The cryptocurrency market is facing a wave of selling pressure, and Bitcoin has not been spared. In the last few hours, the world’s largest digital asset slipped below the $115,000 level, signaling that bullish momentum has weakened. The break under this critical threshold reflects a broader loss of control by buyers as volatility sweeps through global markets following heightened liquidations and risk-off sentiment. Despite the setback, on-chain data reveals an important dimension of Bitcoin’s current state. Top analyst Axel Adler highlighted that Bitcoin long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on $1.18 trillion in unrealized profit. This staggering figure underscores the extent of accumulation in previous months and the resilience of long-term investors, even as short-term price action remains shaky. Historically, when LTHs hold such substantial profits, the market reaches pivotal points where profit-taking pressure competes with fresh demand. While some traders view this as a risk of increased selling, others interpret it as proof of Bitcoin’s strong fundamentals, with deep-pocketed holders continuing to maintain conviction. Long-Term Holder Profits And Market Outlook When LTHs maintain such significant paper gains, it reflects the depth of conviction among investors who acquired Bitcoin during earlier phases of the cycle. Historically, these periods of elevated unrealized profit create both opportunity and risk: on one side, they demonstrate the asset’s resilience and potential for further growth, while on the other, they heighten the risk of profit-taking that could pressure prices. According to on-chain data, LTHs are not uniformly selling into strength. Instead, many continue to hold, signaling confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. This willingness to remain invested even amid volatility provides a stabilizing foundation for the market. However, when large tranches of older coins begin to move, as seen in recent weeks, price reactions often follow swiftly, reflecting the influence of these cohorts. The recent 25-bps interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has introduced another layer of complexity. While monetary easing typically supports risk assets like Bitcoin, it also injects volatility as markets recalibrate to the new macro environment. This “new phase” could extend the cycle, but it will likely be driven by sharp swings as speculative capital tests supply levels against LTH conviction. Bitcoin Faces Pressure After Losing $115K Support Bitcoin has come under heavy pressure after failing to hold above the $115K level, as shown in the chart. The drop pushed BTC down to nearly $112K, marking one of its sharpest daily declines in recent weeks. This correction follows the recent post-Fed rally, highlighting the market’s volatility as traders reassess their positions. From a technical perspective, BTC has broken below its short-term support levels, signaling weakening bullish momentum. The daily chart shows the price dipping beneath the 50-day moving average around $114.4K, an area that had acted as support during the September rebound. If bulls fail to reclaim this level, further downside could test the $110K region, where the 100-day moving average currently lies. Resistance remains at $123K, a key level marked by the August high. A decisive move above that zone would confirm renewed bullish strength and open the door toward fresh all-time highs. Until then, the structure suggests consolidation with downside risk. Bitcoin’s pullback reflects profit-taking and pressure from recent whale and long-term holder activity. With volatility rising, the next sessions will be critical in determining whether BTC stabilizes above $110K or risks deeper retracement before attempting another breakout.

In its statement, the People’s Bank of China said it maintained the one-year LPR at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. Last Thursday, the PBOC also left its seven-day reverse repo rate unchanged, mirroring the decision to stand pat despite the Fed’s 25-basis-point cut. The central bank last lowered its key lending rates in May, cutting them by 10 basis points as part of Beijing’s push to support economic growth. China’s economy slowed in August Monday’s decision was broadly anticipated, as Chinese authorities have warned about major stimulus measures following a rebound in equities , despite data showing the economy remains under strain. According to August data, key metrics underperformed expectations. Retail sales growth cooled to 3.4%, and industrial output slowed to 5.2%, its weakest reading since last August. The country also posted a larger-than-expected decline in consumer prices, with producer prices deflated for nearly three years. Nonetheless, the country posted 4.4% export growth in August. However, it was the slowest growth rate since February, as early shipment gains tapered off and U.S. actions against transshipment dampened flows to other markets. Per Barclays economists, the overall economic momentum weakened noticeably in Q3, dragged down by a steeper real estate slump, fading fiscal stimulus, and tighter controls on industrial overcapacity. They even noted that nearly every housing indicator plummeted in August. As a result, analysts broadly expect Beijing to opt for modest monetary stimulus before year-end to help the economy meet its 5% growth goal. Hong Hao, managing partner and CIO at Lotus Asset Management, also commented, “Beijing’s focus has shifted from risk management to growth stimulation, moving from tolerating deflation to reflating the economy.” He added that China had reached a point where it needed to halt inefficient, debt-driven asset accumulation and start cutting back on unproductive investments. He also asserted that he expects more policy stimulus in the months ahead. So far, Barclays has lowered its forecast for China’s real GDP growth to 4.5% in 2025, citing a deeper-than-anticipated slowdown. The bank still expects Beijing to provide additional support, projecting that the PBOC will cut the seven-day reverse repo rate and loan prime rate by 10 basis points each in the fourth quarter, and reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points. Trump says they’ve made progress in talks with Xi on TikTok Meanwhile, the U.S. president recently announced that talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping had advanced on TikTok and that the two leaders would meet in South Korea in about six weeks to discuss trade, drug concerns, and the Ukraine conflict. Reportedly, U.S. lawmakers met Premier Li Qiang at the Great Hall of the People on Sunday, hoping the talks would serve as a first step toward improving ties between Washington and Beijing. On Saturday, the White House had said that a tentative agreement would place TikTok’s algorithm under the control of U.S. companies and seat six Americans on a seven-member board supervising its U.S. arm. Speaking to reporters, Trump also said a group of “great American patriots” was preparing to acquire TikTok. Once scheduled for a January ban, the app has been allowed to keep operating under several presidential orders while negotiations with ByteDance over its U.S. operations proceed.

The Chinese EV maker has also revealed plans to localize all European production in three years. The Chinese EV maker expanded its market share in fully electric and plug-in hybrids to over 10% in July, more than double its European average and Tesla’s 3.3%. The Chinese EV maker’s overall car market in Spain also rose from 0.3% a year ago to 1.8% in August, surpassing renowned brands such as Stellantis , Jeep, and Volvo. The Seal U has gained popularity in the country this year with its plug-in hybrid feature. BYD’s dealership network quadruples to nearly 100 in Spain Reuters cited one buyer named Javier Hernandez who went car shopping in Barcelona. Hernandez was swayed by the value offered by the Chinese EV maker and opted for the Seal U DM-I, plug-in hybrid. The model sold at around €30,000, undercutting the European models by nearly €10,000. Javier revealed in his statement that the value for money was better. BYD has gained ground in Spain due to its relatively low prices and quick delivery times. The Chinese firm’s dealership network has also grown to nearly 100 dealers from just 25 last year, mainly due to aggressive marketing and discounts, as revealed by Alberto De Aza, BYD’s country manager for Spain and Portugal. Makus Hauput, interim CEO of Volkswagen, acknowledged the competition from Chinese automakers, saying they are mounting pressure on them. Most renowned car makers in the European market, including Volkswagen and Audi, have lost dealerships over the past decade, falling from 2,164 to 1,641 in 2024. Faconauto data also revealed that Volkswagen and Audi dealership outlets declined by 40%. The Chinese EV maker’s sales in Spain rose to over 14,000 cars in July, which is over 675%, alongside SAIC-owned MG, which realized 58% upside, and Chery’s Omoda, which moved more than double the previous year. BYD to manufacture all European cars locally within three years Some analysts have noted that the Chinese EV maker’s strong presence in Spain is due to the absence of a strong national automotive champion. Felipe Munoz of JATO Dynamics highlighted the Seat model acquired by Volkswagen, losing its Spanish identity. Seat’s sales rose by 4% this year, trailing the Spanish market’s 15% growth, while its premium brand Cupra gained 17%. BYD revealed that it will manufacture all EU region vehicles locally within three years. A plant construction is ongoing in Hungary, while De Sza suggested that Spain could also be another candidate for production expansion. He cited Spain’s industrial infrastructure and relatively cheap electricity. Spain’s EV market has also seen challenges, with total sales for fully electric and plug-in hybrid models falling short at 21% against the European average of 27%. That has, however, grown from just 10 % last year. Some analysts cited insufficient charging infrastructure as the biggest challenge, with Spain hosting roughly 50,000 charging stations, just a third of the Netherlands. BYD also lags behind market giants such as Toyota , Renault, and Volkswagen in overall sales, despite the rising competition following its targeted cheaper alternatives. BYD has tapped into the limited infrastructure, focusing on hybrids and plug-in hybrids. Reuters interviewed Juan Gonzalez, a 56-year-old IT head who chose a plug-in hybrid over a fully electric vehicle with solar panels due to concerns over long-distance driving. He said that if you ran out of battery and had to tackle a mountain pass, you would be in trouble.

Behind the daily price swings, a significant share of the token is either locked in escrow, held by early insiders, or already secured in institutional cold storage. Each new wave of demand tightens the market even further, leaving far less XRP truly available than headline numbers suggest. Market analyst 24HOURSCRYPTO recently drew attention to this growing scarcity, sparking renewed debate across the crypto community without disclosing the full depth of the figures. People don’t realize how little XRP is left. Ripple escrow: 37.3B XRP (37.3%) Ripple liquid: 3.5B (3.5%) Chris Larsen: 2.3B (2.3%) Arthur Britto: 1.3B (1.3%) That’s nearly 44.4% of supply already accounted for… ..and then you have look at institutions. Purpose ETF already… pic.twitter.com/ExyK7OUEAa — 𝟸𝟺𝙷𝚁𝚂𝙲𝚁𝚈𝙿𝚃𝙾 (@24hrscrypto1) September 22, 2025 A Supply That Isn’t as Large as It Appears On-chain data shows XRP’s circulating supply is 59.77 billion tokens, yet more than 35 billion XRP remains locked in Ripple’s monthly escrow program . Those tokens are released gradually and cannot flood the market at once, which means the pool of freely tradable XRP is much smaller than many investors assume. Institutions Are Quietly Absorbing Millions Institutional interest is already removing sizable amounts of XRP from circulation . Canada’s Purpose Investments XRP ETF holds about 29.6 million XRP, while public filings show that 3iQ controls roughly 45 million XRP. These holdings are kept in long-term custodial accounts, effectively removing them from the day-to-day trading supply. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Founders’ Holdings Add to the Tightness Ripple’s founders continue to hold significant stakes. Wallets linked to co-founder Chris Larsen alone contain approximately 2.8 billion XRP, and other early insiders also hold substantial allocations. Combined with Ripple’s escrow and institutional reserves, these holdings concentrate a significant portion of the network’s total supply in a few hands. Why This Scarcity Matters As global banks, asset managers, or large custodians step in, they could lock away hundreds of millions—if not billions—of additional tokens. Each large purchase reduces the available supply of tokens in the market, increasing the impact of new demand on price. The Takeaway Drawing on 24HOURSCRYPTO’s initial observations, blockchain data, and verified fund disclosures, the evidence is clear: XRP’s headline supply overstates what is truly available. With much of the token already locked or spoken for, the next wave of institutional adoption could remove billions more XRP from open circulation almost overnight, creating a far leaner market than most traders anticipate.

While profit-taking introduced volatility, derivatives markets shifted from a risk-off stance to more balanced positioning, easing downside concerns. Perpetual futures played a central role , with open interest hitting a cycle high before moderating under policy-driven volatility. Short liquidations ahead of the FOMC announcement triggered squeezes that fueled the rally, though subsequent long liquidations highlighted the market’s sensitivity to leverage. On-chain data show that Bitcoin now trades above the cost basis of 95 percent of supply (~$115,200), restoring profitability for most holders. Sustaining this level is key to maintaining momentum; a drop below could invite renewed selling pressure and retest the $105,500–$115,200 range. The Federal Reserve’s first rate cut since 2024 highlights its delicate balancing act between softening labour markets and stubborn inflation. Chair Jerome Powell stressed that employment risks are now taking priority, even as dissent within the Fed reveals divisions over how far easing should go. With growth slowing and inflation likely settling above target, the Fed appears willing to tolerate higher prices to cushion jobs, though political pressure and volatile market reactions continue to cloud the policy outlook. These pressures are most evident in housing. New construction has dropped to multi-year lows , builder sentiment remains depressed, and price cuts are widespread as inventories swell. While mortgage rates have eased, affordability remains constrained by weak job markets and tighter liquidity, leaving residential investment a drag on growth . Taken together, the Fed’s cautious easing, the Treasury’s funding strategy, and a struggling housing market suggest that monetary relief alone may not prevent the economy from facing prolonged headwinds. The global crypto landscape is being shaped by a convergence of macroeconomic stress, sovereign digital currency initiatives, and regulatory breakthroughs that could redefine digital asset markets. In the UK, surging government borrowing and rising debt costs have heightened volatility in bonds and sterling, strengthening the case for Bitcoin as a hedge against fragile fiscal foundations.In Europe, finance ministers advanced plans for a digital Euro by agreeing on frameworks for issuance and holding limits, framing the project as both payment modernisation and a step toward financial sovereignty. Meanwhile, in the US, the SEC’s adoption of generic listing rules for spot crypto ETFs could fast-track launches in as little as 75 days, opening the door to products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Together, these shifts show how crypto is increasingly tied to fiscal pressures, central bank digital currency strategies, and regulatory reform, dynamics that will shape both growth and volatility ahead.

Replying to the exchange’s post on Saturday, ZachXBT claimed the platform had been compromised several times, but it allegedly “covered up a breach that impacted the personal information of users.” Crypto.com CEO: We did not cover up a public breach Chief executive Kris Marszalek responded to ZachXBT’s allegations on Monday, calling them “completely unfounded.” In a post on X, he wrote that the company did not fail to disclose a security breach and had filed a “Notice of Data Security incident” with regulators. I want to directly and clearly address some misinformation spreading from uninformed sources… Any suggestion that we did not report or disclose a security incident is completely unfounded – as we reported in a NMLS Notice of Data Security incident filing and in additional… — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) September 22, 2025 According to Marszalek, the 2023 incident involved a phishing campaign that targeted an employee but was contained within hours. “No customer funds were accessed or ever at risk, and impacted an extremely limited number of our users’ partial PII. Our systems are battle-tested and continuously improving – we’re proud of our security-first culture and having the most security certifications of any company in our industry,” Marszalek asserted. But after his response, ZachXBT asked the CEO to share a URL of where the incidents were publicly disclosed, much like Coinbase and Gemini did earlier this year for their breaches. “Since the Crypto.com CEO Kris blocked me, I cannot reply to his post and will just reply here…User balances, names, emails, & phone numbers leaked from other incidents is a bit more than just ‘partial PII,” the investigator replied. In July, ZachXBT accused the company of insider trading, for burning 70 billion CRO tokens in 2021, only to reissue the same amount in 2023 through a governance vote in which validators linked to the exchange controlled most of the outcome. “Remember, they printed more tokens, too, out of nowhere. All shades of red flags,” one user commented on the allegations. Crypto․com has not responded to those claims, and is still building partnerships, including an alliance with Trump Media to create a digital asset treasury for CRO. Teenage hacker behind the Crypto.com breach According to Bloomberg’s investigations, the perpetrators were part of the Scattered Spider collective , including an 18-year-old from Florida named Noah Urban. Urban admitted he took part in one of the world’s most destructive cybercrime networks, which in 2023 orchestrated an attack on MGM Resorts International that caused $100 million in damages, and another on British retailer Marks & Spencer for around $400 million. With the assistance of another hacker known only as Jack, the teenager reportedly used social engineering techniques to impersonate staff and “talked their way” into accessing a Crypto.com employee’s account, alongside United Parcel Service systems, to gather personal data. UPS later confirmed it had patched the vulnerability but declined to provide details on the matter. For Crypto․com, a company spokesperson said the episode only affected “a very small number of individuals” and no customer funds were compromised. Noah Urban was sentenced to prison Noah Urban’s path into cybercrime began at age 15 in Minecraft gaming communities, where he learned SIM-swapping techniques that required little technical expertise. According to Bloomberg, Urban had a deep voice that was unusual for his age; he used to impersonate telecommunications staff and trick employees into sharing phone numbers. “Hey, my name is Kevin, and I’m calling from the T-Mobile internal security management,” read one of the scripts the then-teenager was using for his social engineering tactics. As disclosed in the investigative piece, he earned $50 for every successful call, even racking up as high as $3,000 in a single week while his gaming friends listened to his Discord channel.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-mining-and-investment-company-bitmine-immersion-announces-ethereum-acquisition-here-are-the-details/,"Crypto mining and investment firm BitMine Immersion announced that it has significantly increased its Ethereum holdings. BitMine Immersion Increases Ethereum Holdings to 2.4 Million Tokens The company announced that it has purchased an additional 264,378 ETH, bringing its total holdings to 2,416,000 ETH. This amount corresponds to more than 2% of the total supply on the Ethereum network. This move by BitMine Immersion is interpreted as strengthening the company's long-term strategic position in the crypto market. Ethereum stands out as the second-largest blockchain network, underpinning smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Therefore, accumulating assets at this scale both increases the company's market influence and allows it to profit more from future price movements. According to figures released by the company, the total value of its cryptocurrency and cash reserves has reached $11.4 billion, making BitMine Immersion one of the institutions with the strongest crypto reserves globally. Analysts say the company's increased investment in Ethereum reflects growing interest in digital assets among institutional investors. The move is also a clear indication of confidence in Ethereum's long-term potential. BitMine Immersion is expected to further diversify its reserves and make new acquisitions in the future, based on market conditions. This development further demonstrates the growing scale of institutional crypto investments. *This is not investment advice.

Trading volume, however, is up, reaching $190.3 billion. Most major assets are in the red over the past 24 hours, with only a few exceptions among top coins. TLDR: 9 of the top 10 cryptos are in the red; BTC down 2.7% to $112,508, ETH drops 6.7% to $4,166; Fear & Greed Index at 47 shows neutral sentiment; Bitunix warns Trump’s $100K H-1B visa fee may fuel volatility across markets; US BTC spot ETFs saw $222.62M in inflows; US ETH spot ETFs gained $47.75M; China urged brokerages to pause RWA tokenization in Hong Kong amid regulatory caution; Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, nine of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap are showing 24-hour losses. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $112,508, down 2.7% in the last 24 hours, but still up 2% over the past week. Ethereum (ETH) has dropped 6.7% on the day to $4,166.40, marking one of the steeper declines in the top 10. Dogecoin (DOGE) leads the losses, falling 10.7% to $0.238, with a 7-day drop of nearly 10%. BNB (BNB) is the only coin among the top five posting green on the weekly chart, up 11.1% over the past 7 days despite a 3.9% drop in the last 24 hours. Among trending tokens, OG saw a massive drop of 26.8% to $4.31, followed by Aster , down 15.1% to $1.46. Avantis also slipped 3.6% to $2.07. Top gainers include PumpBTC , which surged 140.9% to $0.2175, followed by Merlin Chain up 46.8% to $0.373, and Mavryk Network rising 30.6% to $0.1436. Despite short-term losses across much of the market, some altcoins continue to show outsized volatility, both to the upside and downside. Meanwhile, with October just days away, analysts are debating whether Bitcoin will repeat its strong historical performance, as it has closed in the green 10 out of the past 12 Octobers, earning the nickname “Uptober.” A rally similar to 2017 or 2021 could push BTC to around $165,000 from current levels. 10 days left until we enter Uptober. Do you understand? pic.twitter.com/h4Su5W03u1 — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) September 20, 2025 Trump’s H-1B Fee Bomb Sparks Crypto Jitters Bitunix analysts say President Donald Trump’s proposed $100,000 H-1B visa fee has rattled markets, injecting fresh political risk into an already fragile macro environment. The move directly targets India’s $280 billion IT outsourcing sector, raising the prospect of trade tensions, legal battles, and rising corporate costs. “This policy is highly political and will likely spark negotiations and litigation between corporations and governments,” the analysts wrote, warning that weakened risk appetite could drive capital toward safer assets like the US dollar and Treasuries. In crypto, BTC slipped from ~$117,000 to around $114,000, with buyers reappearing near $113,000. “If $111,000 breaks, price may quickly fall toward secondary support at $108,000,” Bitunix said. Resistance remains heavy near $119,000–$120,500, where liquidity heatmaps show dense short-term seller clusters. Traders are advised to monitor US–India developments and reactions from major tech firms. Until clarity emerges, volatility could remain elevated across both traditional and digital markets. Levels & Events to Watch Next As of Monday morning, Bitcoin is trading at $112,594, down 2.6% over the past 24 hours. After failing to reclaim the $115K zone, BTC has slipped into a lower range, with buyers stepping in around $112K. The asset remains under pressure, consolidating below the $114K resistance. Traders are closely watching the $114,000–$116,000 zone. A clean break above could open the door toward $117,500, with $119,000 as the next upside level. On the downside, $111,000 is the next key support, followed by $108,000 if the level breaks with volume. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading at $4,166, down 6.6% on the day. ETH saw a sharp rejection after briefly touching the $4,500 mark over the weekend and has since pulled back toward its lower support levels. Immediate resistance sits at $4,300, followed by a stronger zone at $4,500–$4,600. If ETH fails to hold the $4,150–$4,100 range, further downside could test $3,950, with $3,800 acting as the next major support. Market participants are eyeing macro risks, including US tech-sector volatility and regulatory signals out of Asia, both of which could fuel more choppy price action this week. Meanwhile, market sentiment in crypto remains steady. The CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index is currently at 47 , slightly lower than yesterday’s 48 and down from last week’s 51, signaling a continued neutral outlook. This reading suggests that traders remain cautious, neither driven by fear nor swept up in market euphoria. With Bitcoin ranging below key resistance and macro risks still present, participants appear to be waiting on clearer direction before making decisive moves. The US Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a strong day of inflows on September 19, adding $222.62 million in net new capital. This pushes the cumulative net inflow across all funds to $57.72 billion, with total assets under management now reaching $152.31 billion, or 6.63% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. BlackRock’s IBIT led the day with a massive $246.11 million in net inflows, the only fund to post a gain. Grayscale’s GBTC saw the largest outflow, losing $23.5 million and shedding 203.74 BTC. Other funds, including FBTC, BITB, ARKB, and HODL, recorded no net flows for the day, showing a largely one-sided flow pattern. Trading volume was dominated by IBIT at $2.17 billion, followed by FBTC and GBTC. The US Ethereum spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $47.75 million on September 19, bringing the cumulative total net inflow across all ETH funds to $13.92 billion. Total assets under management now stand at $29.64 billion, or 5.51% of Ethereum’s market cap. Among the nine listed ETFs, BlackRock’s ETHA led with a significant $144.29 million in net inflows, followed by smaller outflows from other funds. Fidelity’s FETH recorded a notable outflow of $53.40 million, while Grayscale’s ETH and ETHE saw outflows of $11.30 million and $6.22 million, respectively. Meanwhile, China’s securities regulator has quietly urged domestic brokerages to halt their real-world asset (RWA) tokenization operations in Hong Kong, raising red flags over the fast-growing digital assets sector being cultivated offshore.

The corporate giant recently announced a substantial acquisition, purchasing an additional 850 BTC for an impressive $99.7 million. This latest strategic investment, initially reported by Unfolded, further solidifies MicroStrategy’s position as a leading institutional holder of MicroStrategy Bitcoin . Why is MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy So Consistent? MicroStrategy’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin is not a new phenomenon; it’s a deliberate, long-term strategy spearheaded by its executive chairman, Michael Saylor. The company views Bitcoin as a superior treasury reserve asset, offering a hedge against inflation and a store of value in an increasingly digital world. Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies, which can be devalued by inflation. Digital Gold Narrative: Many, including MicroStrategy, consider Bitcoin to be ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset with global accessibility and censorship resistance. Long-Term Vision: The company’s strategy is built on the conviction that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly over the long term, driven by increasing adoption and network effects. This approach highlights a profound belief in the future of decentralized finance and the enduring value of MicroStrategy Bitcoin as a foundational asset. What Does This MicroStrategy Bitcoin Purchase Mean for the Market? Every time MicroStrategy announces a new Bitcoin purchase, it sends ripples through the cryptocurrency market. These acquisitions often serve as a strong signal of institutional confidence, potentially influencing other corporate entities and even individual investors. The immediate impact can be observed in market sentiment. A major player like MicroStrategy buying more Bitcoin often leads to: Increased Investor Confidence: It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is a legitimate and valuable asset for large-scale investment. Positive Price Action: While not always direct, consistent buying pressure from large entities can contribute to upward price movements. Validation for Institutional Adoption: MicroStrategy’s actions set a precedent, encouraging other companies to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. However, it also brings challenges. Such large holdings can increase market sensitivity to MicroStrategy’s financial health or any shifts in its investment strategy. The continuous accumulation of MicroStrategy Bitcoin is a testament to its leadership’s conviction. How Does MicroStrategy Bitcoin Accumulation Compare? MicroStrategy stands out as the largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin. Its strategy is unique in its scale and consistency. While other companies have also invested in Bitcoin, few have done so with the same relentless focus and transparency. For example, MicroStrategy’s previous purchases have been meticulously tracked, providing a clear roadmap of its accumulation journey. This transparency allows investors to understand the scale of its commitment to MicroStrategy Bitcoin . What can retail investors learn from this? Conviction is Key: A long-term perspective and strong conviction in an asset’s fundamentals can be powerful. Strategic Allocation: Even small, consistent investments can grow significantly over time. Research and Due Diligence: Understanding why a company like MicroStrategy makes such moves can inform personal investment decisions. This strategic decision by MicroStrategy is more than just an investment; it’s a clear statement about the future role of digital assets in corporate finance. In conclusion, MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition of 850 BTC is a powerful reaffirmation of its belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value. This move not only expands its own digital treasury but also continues to influence broader market perceptions and institutional investment trends in the cryptocurrency space. The company’s unwavering commitment to its MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy remains a significant narrative in the ongoing digital asset revolution.

According to John David Lovelock, VP Analyst at Gartner, “The forecast assumes continued investment in AI infrastructure expansion, as major hyperscalers continue to increase investments in data centers with AI-optimized hardware and GPUs to scale their services.” He added that the AI investment landscape is also expanding beyond traditional U.S. tech giants, including Chinese companies and new AI cloud providers. Furthermore, venture capital investment in AI providers is providing additional tailwinds for AI spending . Looking towards 2026, overall global AI spending is forecast to top $2 trillion, led in large part by AI being integrated into products such as smartphones and PCs as well as infrastructure. Table 1: AI Spending in IT Markets, Worldwide, 2024-2026 (Millions of U.S. Dollars) Market 2024 2025 2026 AI Services 259,477 282,556 324,669 AI Application Software 83,679 172,029 269,703 AI Infrastructure Software 56,904 126,177 229,825 GenAI Models 5,719 14,200 25,766 AI-optimized Servers (GPU and Non-GPU AI Accelerators) 140,107 267,534 329,528 AI-optimized IaaS 7,447 18,325 37,507 AI Processing Semiconductors 138,813 209,192 267,934 AI PCs by ARM and x86 51,023 90,432 144,413 GenAI Smartphones 244,735 298,189 393,297 Total AI Spending 987,904 1,478,634 2,022,642 Source: Gartner (September 2025) The biggest expenses are on AI services, GPU servers, and AI smartphones According to the Gartner forecast, the biggest spending in 2025 is on AI services at $282 billion, GenAI smartphones at $298 billion and AI application software expenditure reaching $172 billion. This will increase in 2026, with spending on AI services set to reach $324 billion, GenAI smartphones to $393 billion and AI applications to $269 billion. MENA IT spending is set to reach $169 billion in 2026, fueled by data center investment . Saudi Arabia’s data center market is projected to grow from $1.33 billion in 2024 to $3.9 billion by 2030, while the U.S. data center market is currently valued at over $200 billion. In August, another Gartner IT forecast for MENA found that IT spending across the region is set to reach $169 billion in 2026 – an 8.9% increase from the current year. The biggest spending in MENA would be on data centers, forecasted to grow in MENA by 37.3% in 2026, reaching nearly $13 billion. The acceleration in data center investment comes from an increased demand for generative AI and large-scale machine learning which require vast compute power. Eyad Tachwali, Vice President, Advisory at Gartner. “The strongest demand is coming from hyperscalers, government entities, and AI-focused tech providers, rather than traditional enterprises.” Saudi Arabia AI spending to reach $1.44 billion in 2025 In light of this global and regional investment in AI, IDC research noted that Saudi Arabia’s AI spending is set to hit $1.44B in 2025 and soar to $6.4B by 2030. During the recent Money20/20 event in Saudi Arabia this month, AI took center stage, as Saudi Arabia is projected to reap nearly $135.2 billion from AI by 2030, equivalent to 12.4% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) as per PWC. Humain , a Saudi artificial intelligence company established under the Public Investment Fund to drive the Kingdom’s AI strategy, announced $23 billion investment targets for strategic industry partnerships, and $10 billion venture fund. California-based AI company Groq in February secured a $1.5 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia for expanded delivery of its chips. In December, Groq built what it said was the region’s largest AI inference cluster in the kingdom.

A notable transaction that has caught the attention of market watchers is the substantial move by Abraxas Capital. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Abraxas Capital withdrew an additional 1,060 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at approximately $120 million, from Binance within a six-hour window. This significant Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a market signal that prompts deeper analysis into its potential implications for Binance and the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does This Massive Abraxas Capital BTC Withdrawal Signify? When a large holder, often referred to as a ‘whale’ in crypto circles, makes such a considerable move, it naturally sparks curiosity and speculation. This particular Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal from one of the world’s largest exchanges could indicate several strategic possibilities. For instance, it might be a move to cold storage for enhanced security, a preparation for an over-the-counter (OTC) trade, or even a reallocation to another exchange or a different investment vehicle. Understanding these whale movements is crucial for grasping potential shifts in market sentiment and liquidity. It is important to remember that such large withdrawals do not automatically signal negative intent. Often, institutional players like Abraxas Capital engage in sophisticated portfolio management. Their actions are usually calculated, reflecting a long-term strategy rather than impulsive decisions. However, the sheer volume of this Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal means it warrants close observation. Decoding Whale Movements: Why Abraxas Capital’s Actions Are Crucial Whales, by definition, hold substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, and their transaction patterns can offer valuable insights into market trends. When a significant entity like Abraxas Capital executes a large-scale withdrawal, it can influence market psychology. Investors often look to these movements for clues about potential future price action or market sentiment. For example, a large withdrawal might be interpreted as a bullish signal if the BTC is being moved to cold storage, suggesting a long-term holding strategy. Conversely, it could be seen as a bearish sign if the funds are being prepared for sale. However, without specific context, it is challenging to draw definitive conclusions. Abraxas Capital’s strategic decisions, including this notable Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal , are often based on a complex interplay of market analysis, risk management, and investment goals. Their actions can provide a glimpse into how major players are positioning themselves in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. The Ripple Effect: How Large BTC Withdrawals Impact Exchanges and Markets A withdrawal of 1,060 BTC, while significant in dollar terms, represents a fraction of Binance’s total liquidity. Therefore, it is unlikely to cause an immediate liquidity crisis for the exchange. However, large withdrawals can have other ripple effects: Market Sentiment: Such moves can create uncertainty among smaller investors, potentially leading to increased volatility as people react to the news. Price Action: If the withdrawn BTC is eventually sold on the open market, it could exert downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Conversely, if it’s moved to cold storage, it removes supply from active circulation, which could be bullish. Exchange Perception: While Binance remains a dominant player, continuous large withdrawals could prompt questions about investor confidence, even if unfounded. The implications of an Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal extend beyond the immediate transaction, touching upon the broader market’s health and investor psychology. Navigating Crypto Waters: Actionable Insights from Major Withdrawals For the average investor, monitoring significant whale movements, such as the recent Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal , can be an informative practice. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable blockchain analytics platforms and news sources to understand large transactions. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not base investment decisions solely on whale movements. Always conduct thorough personal research. Diversify Your Portfolio: Reduce risk by spreading investments across various assets, rather than concentrating on a single cryptocurrency or strategy. Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations caused by large transactions are common. Focus on your long-term investment goals. Understanding the ‘why’ behind these moves is more important than simply reacting to the ‘what’. In conclusion, the recent Abraxas Capital BTC withdrawal from Binance serves as a potent reminder of the constant movement and strategic decision-making within the cryptocurrency market. While such events are part of the daily ebb and flow of digital assets, they offer valuable insights into the behavior of major players and the underlying dynamics of the market. Staying informed and approaching these developments with a critical, analytical mindset is key for any participant in the crypto space. These movements underscore the importance of robust security practices and the continuous evolution of investment strategies in this exciting, yet unpredictable, financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a ‘crypto whale’? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Q2: Why do large withdrawals like Abraxas Capital’s happen? Large withdrawals can occur for various reasons, including moving funds to cold storage for security, preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) trades, rebalancing portfolios, or transferring assets to another exchange or investment platform. Q3: Does this withdrawal affect Binance’s security or stability? While significant, a withdrawal of 1,060 BTC is unlikely to impact Binance’s overall security or stability. Major exchanges hold vast reserves, and such transactions are part of normal operational flow. Binance maintains robust security protocols. Q4: How should average investors react to news of a large withdrawal? Average investors should react cautiously. It’s crucial to avoid panic and conduct independent research. Use such news as an opportunity to understand market dynamics, but don’t make impulsive investment decisions based solely on a single whale movement. Q5: What is Abraxas Capital?

The caution centers on an unusual yet increasingly dangerous scam involving the sale of Telegram usernames, which is a tactic that allows malicious actors to impersonate trusted members of the SHIB community. Shiba Inu Holders Warned Against Telegram Scam Scams and hacks are not new in the Shiba Inu ecosystem , but this one is raising concern because of how easily it can compromise credibility and trick unsuspecting holders. According to Susbarium, scammers are offering significant amounts of money to Shiba Inu community members in exchange for their Telegram usernames. At first glance, this may seem harmless or even profitable. However, the true danger lies in what happens after the transaction. Once a trusted username changes hands, the buyer can impersonate the original account owner, use the reputation associated with the handle, and exploit the trust others have built with that identity. From there, these impersonators can scam others, spread misinformation, and even damage the reputation of the original owner who unknowingly handed over their credibility. The risks of this scam extend beyond simple impersonation. Fake accounts with respected usernames can easily convince community members to click on malicious links, share wallet information, or participate in fraudulent token sales. This problem is especially concerning in Shiba Inu’s active ecosystem, as Telegram is a major hub for discussions and announcements. The Susbarium warning emphasizes that selling usernames off-platform or through private deals creates a loophole for scammers. “Never sell your username through private messages or off platform deals,” Susbarium warned . Even legal sales through platforms like Fragment still raise questions of trust, since usernames play a crucial role in verifying credibility in online communities. Growing Scams Threatening The Shiba Inu Ecosystem Warnings about scams are not new to the Shiba Inu community, and multiple trusted accounts have repeatedly raised alarms about malicious actors. Earlier this year, Shibarium Trustwatch cautioned SHIB holders about fake X profiles designed to impersonate popular Shiba Inu marketing lead Lucie. More recently, Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya issued another critical alert after identifying fake Discord servers circulating in the ecosystem. These fraudulent servers, which were styled to look like legitimate SHIB or Shibarium groups, were being used to spread harmful links and carry out wallet hacks. One recent scam involved fake migration sites pushing a LEASH V2 migration through Telegram or phishing websites to trick Shiba Inu holders into approving wallet connections and transactions that drained funds. In response to this, the Shiba Inu team warned that any migration or contract change claims circulated outside official channels, such as the SHIB website or verified social profiles, should be treated as fraudulent.",Shiba Inu|Kaal Dhairya|LEASH v2 Migration|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu ecosystem|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium Trustwatch|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT|Susbarium|Telegram,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TOKEN SALE|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-22 13:30:25

Following the earlier launch of Solana-based products, leveraged and futures-focused XRP offerings entered the market and quickly generated even stronger demand. This development reflects a broader appetite for crypto-linked investment vehicles beyond the dominant Bitcoin ETF market. Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto influencer, highlighted this development by sharing a video interview featuring Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. In the video, Seyffart acknowledged the demand for these newer products, indicating that XRP’s leveraged ETF launch occurred after Solana’s and still managed to outperform in terms of initial investor activity. James Seyffart: Leveraged $XRP ETF products launched post-SOL are seeing strong demand XRP ETF even outperformed SOL ETF. But don’t expect XRP ETF to outshine Bitcoin; nothing matches BTC ETF launch hype. XRPArmy are we gonna see XRP outperf Bitcoin or not? #Crypto #ETF pic.twitter.com/xCPQWmZNEQ — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) September 21, 2025 Seyffart’s Perspective on Market Dynamics Seyffart noted that while the enthusiasm is evident, investors must recognize the difference between XRP-linked products and the massive market entry of Bitcoin ETFs. He cautioned against expecting XRP or similar digital assets to draw the same level of inflows, explaining that the Bitcoin ETF launch remains a singular event in terms of scale. He added that XRP and other non-Bitcoin crypto ETFs fall into the category of “longer tail assets,” meaning they appeal to more specific segments of the market rather than the entire investment landscape. Despite this, he stressed that there will still be meaningful demand and room for several products to succeed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Opportunity for XRP Investors Seyffart’s outlook suggests a promising trajectory for XRP in the ETF market. He noted that the success of initial leveraged and futures XRP products demonstrates a strong base of investor confidence. While he does not foresee XRP ETFs matching the scale of Bitcoin or even Ethereum, he emphasized that “there will be demand. There will be plenty.” However, the XRP army has a different opinion, as many believe XRP ETFs can outperform Bitcoin ETFs despite Bitcoin’s dominant market position. Canary Capital CEO Steve McClurg has predicted that XRP ETFs could see inflows of up to $5 billion in the first month . While Seyffart’s comments show that XRP investors could benefit from continued growth in institutional and retail adoption through diversified financial products, the community disagrees with his ETF growth projection. Market Outlook Although Seyffart does not expect every altcoin ETF to achieve significant traction, he indicated that XRP’s early performance places it among the more promising contenders. The community is anticipating the SEC’s approval of these products in October , and the months that follow will determine if Seyffart’s analysis was right or if XRP can shock the crypto market once again.

52100335,586430,1758548010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52100335.jpeg,Best Meme Coins to Buy as Dogecoin 730% Pump Might Come Soon,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-buy-as-dogecoin-pump-might-come-soon/,"One of the biggest reasons why 2025 is being looked at as one of the biggest years for crypto – not only in terms of performance so far but also for what’s coming in the months ahead – is Dogecoin’s rise. Arguably the greatest meme coin of all time, now a large-cap meme coin, Dogecoin has surged nearly 50% in just six months . This is one of the strongest signals that a full-blown altcoin rally might be on the way. Given Dogecoin’s place and importance in the crypto space, especially in the altcoin sector, it’s only natural that analysts everywhere are diving deep into its analysis, trying to guess where it could head next, and how bold a move it could churn out. Such a rally wouldn’t just suggest a great buying opportunity in Dogecoin itself, but also perfect timing to position yourself in other low-cap, high-upside meme coins. Read on as we unpack one of the latest and most talked-about Dogecoin analyses – a price prediction from a crypto analyst who believes Dogecoin could be on its way to a 730% pump – and how you can make the most of it by buying the best meme coins right now . DOGE Poised for a 730% Pump We’re talking about Javon Marks – or @JavonTM1 on X – who posts to nearly 60K followers and is an ardent crypto analyst. His recent Dogecoin analysis suggests the token is now gearing up for a third bullish cycle, as you can see in the image below. Cycle 1 was when Dogecoin first shot to fame in 2017, rising around 12,000% in three years. Then came Cycle 2 in 2021, when Dogecoin surged nearly 25,000%. Now, the trader believes a third cycle could be on its way. Since future price predictions venture into uncharted territory, the trader has used Fibonacci extensions to arrive at potential upside targets. He believes that if we see a similar jump in performance as in the past two cycles, Dogecoin could easily 20x from here and hit $5.30. That said, he also offered a more conservative target, suggesting Dogecoin should at least hit $2.28, which still represents a massive 730% gain from current price levels. With that in mind, this could potentially be one of the best times to stack your crypto portfolio with under-the-radar meme coins that could rise alongside Dogecoin. Here are our top 3 suggestions. 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Upcoming Dogecoin-Themed Meme Coin with 1000x Potential Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is an exciting new meme coin bringing the unfiltered aura of a fiery mascot the crypto world has been waiting for. To fully understand $MAXI’s potential, you’ll need to know where it comes from. Think of Maxi as Dogecoin’s distant cousin. Naturally, with Doge being the first mainstream meme coin, he dominated all family gatherings, leaving Maxi lonely, humiliated, and frustrated. That’s when Maxi Doge decided to hit the gym, chug protein shakes, and craft the perfect revenge plot to return as DOGE’s ultimate nemesis. Now, $MAXI intends to be the next 1000x crypto . How? The project has set aside a whopping 40% of its total token supply for advertising campaigns, social media marketing, and influencer partnerships. There will also be exclusive holder-only events, including weekly trading competitions with leaderboard prizes. The idea is to build a loyal community of $MAXI traders and HODLers who believe in the token’s degen spirit and absurd mission of taking down Dogecoin. While most presale projects aim for CEX and DEX listings, $MAXI plans to go a step further and secure listings on future platforms as well. This will allow high-risk, high-reward crypto traders to slam the leverage pedal and have a real shot at making life-changing gains, all thanks to $MAXI. Currently in presale, Maxi Doge has already raised over $2.41M from early investors, with each token priced at just $0.0002585. Here’s how to buy $MAXI . According to our Maxi Doge price prediction , the token could hit $0.0024 by year-end – representing a mouth-watering 820% return. Visit $MAXI’s official website to learn more about its absurd mission, roadmap, and tokenomics. 2. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) – Unique Mine-to-Earn Pepe-Themed Meme Coin PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is a unique mine-to-earn cryptocurrency project that lets you build virtual mining rigs and earn rewards in the form of free $PEPENODE (native crypto), $FARTCOIN, and $PEPE tokens. Normally, crypto mining involves expensive hardware and high electricity costs, which makes it inaccessible to the average participant. PEPENODE changes that by offering a cost-effective alternative through its gamified virtual mining rigs, complete with real-life-like dashboards featuring parameters like hashrate, energy, and rewards. Every user starts with an empty server room. From there, you buy ‘nodes,’ which are mining components powered by $PEPENODE. Each node increases your rig’s mining capacity. You can also sync different nodes to boost capacity. It’s worth noting that various permutations and combinations of nodes deliver different boost levels, giving you room to experiment, buy nodes, and optimize your setup. The best part? Nodes purchased in the early stages have higher mining capacity. This early participation incentive means you can start with a basic rig and eventually upgrade to a massive mining farm. Moreover, these nodes can also be upgraded or sold, making the ecosystem far more interactive than most presale projects. The $PEPENODE presale is just getting started but has already raised over $1.38M. Check out our guide on how to buy PEPENODE for help with the purchase. Right now, 1 $PEPENODE is available for just $0.001070. According to our PEPENODE price prediction , a $100 investment today could turn into $670 by the end of 2026. Visit $PEPENODE’s official website to learn more about its first-of-its-kind mine-to-earn system. 3. Boba Cat ($BOBA) – Philanthropy Crypto Project Advocating for Cat Shelters Worldwide Boba Cat ($BOBA) is inspired by the real-life cat of Dogecoin founder Billy Marcus. But don’t mistake $BOBA for a simple meme coin built around a pet animal; it’s actually a true philanthropist project that supports pet shelters and highlights blockchain’s role in charity. For instance, $BOBA has already donated $84K across 8 countries, supporting nearly 16 shelters. Beyond donations, the project also aims to educate non-profit organizations and agencies about cryptocurrency adoption and blockchain technology, helping to increase transparency and address operational challenges. $BOBA token holders also get the opportunity to participate in governance decisions, voting on key proposals such as partnerships or platform changes. You can even contribute directly by donating $BOBA tokens. All things considered, it’s no wonder $BOBA has seen a massive price surge. It has gained 1,332% in the last 7 days and 262% in the past 24 hours. It’s currently trading around $0.05943. Recap : With Dogecoin primed for a chonky rally in the coming weeks, the stage is set for low-cap, high-upside meme coins like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , and Boba Cat ($BOBA) to emerge as the next big breakout winners. Disclaimer: None of the above constitutes financial advice. The crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable, so kindly do your own research before investing.

Today, all eyes are on Akash Network , the innovative supercloud project, as it proposes a significant change to its tokenomics. This move aims to strengthen the value of its native token, AKT, and further solidify its position in the competitive blockchain space. The community is buzzing about a newly submitted governance proposal that could introduce a game-changing Burn Mint Equilibrium (BME) model. What is the Burn Mint Equilibrium (BME) for Akash Network? The core of this proposal revolves around a concept called Burn Mint Equilibrium, or BME. Essentially, this model is designed to create a balance in the token’s circulating supply by systematically removing a portion of tokens from existence. For Akash Network , this means burning an amount of AKT that is equivalent to the U.S. dollar value of fees paid by network users. Fee Conversion: When users pay for cloud services on the Akash Network , these fees are typically collected in various cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. AKT Equivalence: The proposal suggests converting the U.S. dollar value of these collected fees into an equivalent amount of AKT. Token Burn: This calculated amount of AKT would then be permanently removed from circulation, or ‘burned’. This mechanism creates a direct link between network utility and token supply reduction. As more users utilize the decentralized supercloud, more AKT will be burned, potentially impacting the token’s scarcity and value. Why is This Proposal Crucial for AKT Holders? For anyone holding AKT, or considering investing in the Akash Network ecosystem, this proposal carries significant weight. Token burning mechanisms are often viewed as a positive development because they can lead to increased scarcity. When supply decreases while demand remains constant or grows, the price per unit tends to increase. Here are some key benefits: Increased Scarcity: Burning tokens reduces the total circulating supply of AKT. This makes each remaining token potentially more valuable over time. Demand-Supply Dynamics: The BME model directly ties the burning of AKT to network usage. Higher adoption of the Akash Network supercloud translates into more fees, and thus more AKT burned. Long-Term Value Proposition: By creating a deflationary pressure, the proposal aims to enhance AKT’s long-term value, making it a more attractive asset for investors and long-term holders. This strategic move demonstrates a commitment from the Akash Network community to optimize its tokenomics for sustainable growth and value appreciation. How Does BME Impact the Decentralized Supercloud Mission? Beyond token value, the BME proposal aligns perfectly with the broader mission of the Akash Network . As a decentralized supercloud, Akash provides a marketplace for cloud computing resources, allowing users to deploy applications faster, more efficiently, and at a lower cost than traditional providers. The BME model reinforces this utility. Consider these impacts: Network Health: A stronger AKT token can incentivize more validators and providers to secure and contribute resources to the network, improving its overall health and resilience. Ecosystem Growth: Enhanced token value can attract more developers and projects to build on the Akash Network , fostering a vibrant and diverse ecosystem. User Incentive: While users pay fees, the potential appreciation of AKT could indirectly benefit those who hold the token, creating a circular economy within the supercloud. This proposal is not just about burning tokens; it’s about building a more robust, self-sustaining, and economically sound decentralized cloud infrastructure for the future. What Are the Next Steps for the Akash Network Community? As a governance proposal, the BME model will now undergo a period of community discussion and voting. This is a crucial phase where AKT holders and network participants can voice their opinions, debate the merits, and ultimately decide on the future direction of the project. Transparency and community engagement are hallmarks of decentralized projects like Akash Network . Challenges and Considerations: Implementation Complexity: Ensuring the burning mechanism is technically sound and transparent will be vital. Community Consensus: Achieving broad agreement within the diverse Akash Network community is key for successful adoption. The outcome of this vote will significantly shape the tokenomics and economic model of the Akash Network , influencing its trajectory in the rapidly evolving decentralized cloud landscape. The proposal to introduce a Burn Mint Equilibrium model represents a bold and strategic step for Akash Network . By directly linking network usage to token scarcity, the project aims to create a more resilient and valuable AKT token, ultimately strengthening its position as a leading decentralized supercloud provider. This move underscores the project’s commitment to innovative tokenomics and sustainable growth, promising an exciting future for both users and investors in the Akash Network ecosystem. It’s a clear signal that Akash is actively working to enhance its value proposition and maintain its competitive edge in the decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main goal of the Burn Mint Equilibrium (BME) proposal for Akash Network? The primary goal is to adjust the circulating supply of AKT tokens by burning a portion of network fees, thereby creating deflationary pressure and potentially enhancing the token’s long-term value and scarcity. 2. How will the amount of AKT to be burned be determined? The proposal suggests burning an amount of AKT equivalent to the U.S. dollar value of fees paid by users on the Akash Network for cloud services. 3. What are the potential benefits for AKT token holders? Token holders could benefit from increased scarcity of AKT, which may lead to higher demand and appreciation in value over time, especially as network usage grows. 4. How does this proposal relate to the overall mission of Akash Network? The BME model reinforces the Akash Network ‘s mission by creating a stronger, more economically robust ecosystem. A healthier token incentivizes network participants, fostering growth and stability for the decentralized supercloud. 5. What is the next step for this governance proposal? The proposal will undergo a period of community discussion and voting by AKT token holders. The community’s decision will determine if the BME model is implemented on the Akash Network .

Per questo, il mercato cripto si sta preparando a una settimana di forte volatilità — e ne ha tutte le ragioni. Oltre al discorso di Powell, una serie di dati macro USA ad alto impatto verrà diffusa nel corso della settimana. Mercoledì 23 settembre 2025 saranno pubblicati i dati sulle vendite di case. Giovedì 24 settembre 2025 toccherà invece alle vendite di abitazioni esistenti, che offriranno un’istantanea sulla solidità del mercato immobiliare americano, insieme all’ultimo report sugli ordini di beni durevoli. In passato, entrambi questi dati hanno avuto un peso rilevante nei flussi d’investimento verso gli asset digitali. Ma sarà giovedì il vero punto di svolta: la seconda stima del PIL USA del secondo trimestre rivelerà se l’economia è davvero uscita dal tunnel o se, al contrario, sta affrontando nuove pressioni da “stagflazione”. Venerdì uscirà invece l’Indice Core PCE di agosto, l’indicatore d’inflazione preferito dalla Fed. Sempre il 24 settembre sarà diffuso anche il dato preliminare dell’Indice di fiducia dei consumatori del Michigan. REMINDER: FED CHAIR POWELL WILL DELIVER A SPEECH NEXT TUESDAY.

Dopo aver mantenuto la soglia dei 4,1 trilioni di dollari per tutto il weekend, oggi gli asset digitali hanno subito un duro colpo, con oltre 75 miliardi di dollari bruciati in poche ore.

Nel 2017, Bitcoin salì rapidamente, salvo poi crollare improvvisamente e minare la fiducia, per poi volare a nuovi massimi storici nei mesi successivi. Lo stesso schema si è ripetuto nel 2021, quando i prezzi rimasero fermi intorno ai 60.000 $ prima di spiccare un nuovo balzo.

This crucial intervention comes at a pivotal moment for the South American nation, which has grappled with persistent economic volatility, high inflation, and significant debt burdens. For those tracking global finance and its ripple effects, particularly within the cryptocurrency space where such instability often drives adoption or capital flight, this development is a game-changer. It represents a potential turning point towards greater Argentina economic stability , offering a glimmer of hope for a more predictable financial future. Unpacking the Urgency: Why Argentina’s Economic Stability Matters Argentina’s economic journey has been a rollercoaster of boom and bust cycles, marked by recurring debt crises, hyperinflation, and a constant struggle to maintain a stable currency. This chronic instability has not only affected its citizens but has also sent tremors through global financial markets, impacting trade, investment, and even the broader sentiment towards emerging economies. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, Argentina has often served as a stark example of a population seeking alternatives to a depreciating fiat currency, leading to high crypto adoption rates out of necessity rather than pure speculation. The persistent challenges include: High Inflation: Consistently among the highest globally, eroding purchasing power and making long-term financial planning nearly impossible. External Debt: A heavy burden of foreign debt, often requiring renegotiation and leading to austerity measures. Currency Volatility: Frequent devaluations of the Argentine Peso, making imports expensive and fostering capital flight. Political Uncertainty: Policy shifts that often accompany changes in government, hindering consistent economic planning. The lack of Argentina economic stability has created a challenging environment for businesses and individuals alike. The US Treasury’s willingness to engage signifies an acknowledgment of the systemic importance of Argentina’s economy and the potential for its recovery to positively influence the wider region. The Breadth of US Treasury Support: What’s on the Table? The US Treasury’s commitment is not merely symbolic; it is expected to manifest in tangible financial mechanisms designed to bolster Argentina’s economy. While specific details are still emerging, the support is anticipated to encompass a range of strategic initiatives. This comprehensive approach underscores the depth of the US Treasury support and its potential to address Argentina’s multifaceted economic woes. Potential avenues of support could include: Facilitating IMF Negotiations: The US, as a key member of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), can play a pivotal role in helping Argentina secure more favorable terms or expedite disbursements from its existing IMF programs. This is crucial for managing its debt obligations. Technical Assistance: Providing expertise and guidance on economic policy, fiscal management, and structural reforms to foster sustainable growth. This often involves sharing best practices in areas like tax collection, public spending, and regulatory frameworks. Bilateral Loans or Guarantees: While less common for direct budgetary support, the US could offer credit lines or loan guarantees to help Argentina access capital markets at more favorable rates or manage short-term liquidity challenges. Promoting Private Investment: Encouraging US businesses and investors to consider opportunities in Argentina, thereby stimulating foreign direct investment which is vital for job creation and economic diversification. This multi-pronged US Treasury support aims to create a more stable macroeconomic environment, essential for attracting long-term investment and fostering sustainable growth, rather than just providing a temporary fix. Beyond Immediate Relief: The Long-Term Impact of Argentina Financial Aid While immediate financial relief is critical for Argentina to navigate its current economic headwinds, the true value of this intervention lies in its potential for long-term structural transformation. The provision of Argentina financial aid is not just about bridging funding gaps; it’s about laying the groundwork for enduring economic health. The long-term impacts could include: Aspect Potential Long-Term Impact Investor Confidence Increased foreign and domestic investment, leading to job creation and economic expansion. Fiscal Discipline Improved government budgeting and spending, reducing reliance on money printing and external debt. Monetary Stability Reduced inflation and currency volatility, restoring faith in the national currency and financial system. Trade Relations Strengthened trade ties and access to international markets, boosting exports. Social Welfare Improved public services and reduced poverty as economic conditions stabilize and grow. However, realizing these long-term benefits requires unwavering commitment from Argentina’s government to implement necessary reforms. The financial aid serves as a catalyst, but sustained progress hinges on sound policy decisions and political will. The success of this Argentina financial aid will ultimately be measured by its ability to foster self-sufficiency and resilience. Navigating the IMF Landscape: The Crucial Role for IMF Argentina Programs Argentina’s relationship with the IMF has been complex and often contentious, marked by a series of large bailout packages and stringent conditionalities. The current program, one of the largest in IMF history, is central to Argentina’s debt management strategy. The US Treasury’s involvement is particularly significant in the context of IMF Argentina programs, as the US holds substantial voting power and influence within the institution. How US support can impact IMF programs: Facilitating Review Approvals: US backing can smooth the process of IMF program reviews, which are necessary for the disbursement of tranches of funds. This can help Argentina meet its financial obligations on time. Negotiating Flexibility: The US can advocate for greater flexibility in program conditionalities, allowing Argentina more room to implement reforms tailored to its unique economic circumstances without imposing undue social costs. Building Consensus: By publicly supporting Argentina, the US can help build broader international consensus among other IMF member countries, making it easier for Argentina to gain necessary approvals and support. Enhancing Credibility: US endorsement adds a layer of credibility to Argentina’s reform efforts, signaling to the IMF and other international creditors that the country is serious about its commitments. The effectiveness of IMF Argentina programs is often tied to political will and the ability to meet agreed-upon targets. US Treasury support can provide the necessary impetus and diplomatic leverage to ensure these programs remain on track and yield positive results. A Broader Perspective: Implications for Emerging Markets Finance The US Treasury’s decision to actively support Argentina carries implications that extend far beyond its borders. This move is a significant signal for the broader landscape of emerging markets finance , potentially influencing how international financial institutions and major global powers approach economic crises in other developing nations. Key implications for emerging markets finance: Precedent Setting: This intervention could set a precedent for how major economies engage with countries facing severe economic distress, particularly in strategically important regions. It highlights a proactive approach to prevent wider contagion. Investor Sentiment: A successful stabilization of Argentina, aided by US support, could boost overall investor confidence in emerging markets. It might encourage a more nuanced view of risk, distinguishing between countries committed to reform and those that are not. Geopolitical Influence: The US’s engagement reinforces its role as a key player in global financial architecture and its commitment to stability in the Western Hemisphere. This can have geopolitical ramifications, especially in a world where other global powers are also increasing their financial influence. Reform Imperative: It underscores that while external aid is available, it often comes with an expectation of robust internal reforms. This reinforces the message that emerging markets must prioritize sound economic policies to attract and retain international support. The outcome of this engagement will be closely watched by policymakers, investors, and economists globally, shaping future approaches to emerging markets finance and crisis management. Challenges and Roadblocks Ahead Despite the positive news, the path to sustained economic recovery for Argentina is fraught with challenges. Political consensus, especially on contentious reforms, remains a significant hurdle. Past attempts at stabilization have often been undermined by shifts in political priorities or public resistance to austerity measures. Furthermore, global economic conditions, such as rising interest rates or commodity price fluctuations, can quickly derail even the best-laid plans. Key challenges include: Political Will: Sustaining commitment to difficult reforms across different political administrations. Social Impact: Managing the social consequences of austerity measures and structural adjustments. Global Headwinds: External economic shocks that could undermine domestic efforts. Inflation Control: The perennial challenge of bringing down inflation to single-digit levels. The success of the US Treasury’s support will largely depend on Argentina’s ability to navigate these complex domestic and international landscapes. Benefits of US Treasury Engagement The potential benefits of this robust US Treasury engagement are substantial. For Argentina, it offers a credible pathway out of its economic quagmire, potentially leading to lower inflation, a more stable currency, and renewed growth. For the US, it reinforces its diplomatic and economic ties in a crucial region. For the global financial system, it represents an effort to prevent further instability in a significant emerging economy, contributing to overall market confidence. Actionable Insights for the Future What should stakeholders watch for in the coming months? Policy Implementation: Monitor the concrete steps taken by Argentina’s government to implement fiscal and monetary reforms. IMF Reviews: Pay close attention to the outcomes of upcoming IMF program reviews and any new agreements. Inflation Data: Track Argentina’s monthly inflation figures as a key indicator of economic stabilization. Investment Flows: Observe foreign direct investment trends and capital market activity as signs of returning confidence. A New Horizon for Argentina? The US Treasury’s readiness to back Argentina with diverse financial options marks a pivotal moment. It signals a strong international commitment to helping the nation overcome its deep-seated economic challenges. While the road ahead will undoubtedly be demanding, this robust support offers Argentina a vital opportunity to forge a path towards lasting economic stability and prosperity. The global community, particularly those invested in emerging markets and the broader financial landscape, will be watching closely as this crucial partnership unfolds, hopeful for a successful transformation.

According to reports, Strategy has acquired 850 BTC while Metaplanet has acquired a bumper 5,419 tokens. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, purchased BTC worth $99.7 million at $117,344 per Bitcoin. This has brought its total Bitcoin holdings to 639,835 BTC, acquired for about $47.3 billion at $73,971 per Bitcoin. JUST IN: Strategy buys 850 BTC for $99.7M at $117,344 per BTC.

This has brought its total BTC holdings to 25,555 BTC, which was acquired for approximately $2.7 billion and purchased at an average price of $106,065 per BTC. Strategy slows down BTC purchase while Metaplanet adds speed The US company’s most recent Bitcoin purchase is in line with a recent trend of small purchases , showing a slowdown compared to the big purchases seen earlier this year. Strategy bought 3330 Bitcoin in September, which is a big drop from the 7,714 BTC it bought in August and a 75% drop from the 31,466 BTC it bought in July. In line with Bitcoin, Strategy’s stock has dropped about 2% in the last 30 days. Starting in 2020, the company put most of its money into Bitcoin. It used a mix of debt and stock to buy huge amounts of BTC, which turned the business intelligence software company into a Bitcoin giant. Still, the stock has gone up 2,200% since it started buying BTC. On the other hand, the Japanese company’s purchase has positioned Metaplanet’s holdings at 85.2% of its year-end 2025 target of 30,000 BTC. It is also a quarter away from its 2026 goal of 100,000 BTC. Metaplanet revealed its 555 Million Plan, which is aimed at raising $5.4 billion to buy 210,000 BTC by 2027. The firm’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, also revealed that the company has achieved a BTC Yield of 395.1% YTD 2025. However, Metaplanet’s stock plunged 1.64% on Monday in Japan, per Google Finance data. The stock has also gone down by over 28% in the past month and remains at 66.71% up year-to-date. From the influence of Strategy, several industries outside of crypto have pivoted to bet on Bitcoin in the hopes of repeating its stock price success. But in recent weeks, some of those imitators have suffered steep losses. For example, healthcare data provider Kindly MD (NAKA) has shed 87%, and health tech firm Semler Scientific (SMLR) is down nearly 8%. Bitcoin unbothered price down 3% BTC is down 2.54% today, easing from last week’s one-month high, as investors looked past the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut and await more concrete cues on the US economy. The token ended largely unchanged last week as gains over the Fed cut optimism were offset by caution over future easing. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is trading at $112,802, retreating from last week’s peak near $118,000, its strongest level since mid-August. Also, the market cap is down 2.55%. However, even after the latest pullback, Bitcoin remained up about 5% in September, which was helped by improving liquidity conditions. Bitcoin has gained over 20% so far in 2025, supported by institutional inflows and optimism around broader adoption. However, it remains well below its all-time high of over $124,000 reached earlier this year. These bearish signs have been reflected in the whole crypto market. The market is down 3% with most altcoins falling more sharply than Bitcoin, as risk appetite remained dim.

The memecoin frenzy continues to captivate investors, and amidst the buzz, a new contender often emerges, sparking fervent speculation. Today, we’re diving deep into the fascinating realm of Neiro, a relatively fresh face in the memecoin arena, to explore its potential trajectory. Our comprehensive Neiro price prediction for 2025, 2026, and even stretching to 2030 aims to unravel whether this particular NEIRO memecoin has what it takes to climb the charts and perhaps even hit the ambitious $0.005 mark. Join us as we dissect market dynamics, community influence, and technological potential to paint a clearer picture of Neiro’s future. What is NEIRO Memecoin and Why Does it Matter? Before we peer into the crystal ball for our Neiro price prediction , it’s essential to understand what Neiro is all about. At its core, Neiro is a community-driven memecoin, much like many of its predecessors that have garnered massive attention. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that often boast complex technological innovations or real-world utility from day one, memecoins primarily thrive on viral appeal, social media hype, and the strength of their community. Neiro aims to carve out its niche by fostering a vibrant and engaged community, often leveraging humor and internet culture to spread its message. Why does a NEIRO memecoin matter in the grand scheme of things? The rise of memecoins has demonstrated a significant shift in how value is perceived in the crypto space. They represent a blend of financial speculation and cultural phenomenon, often providing entry points for new investors into the cryptocurrency market. For many, investing in a memecoin like Neiro is less about its intrinsic technological value and more about participating in a collective movement, hoping to ride the wave of collective enthusiasm to substantial gains. This unique dynamic makes analyzing their future challenging yet incredibly intriguing. The Dynamics of Cryptocurrency Price Movements Understanding the broader forces that dictate cryptocurrency price fluctuations is crucial for any specific asset’s forecast. The crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, often interconnected and highly reactive. These can range from global macroeconomic trends to specific project developments and regulatory news. For memecoins, these factors are amplified, often leading to more dramatic swings. Key drivers of cryptocurrency price include: Market Sentiment: The overall mood of investors – fear, greed, or caution – significantly impacts buying and selling pressure. Positive news or widespread hype can send prices soaring, while negative sentiment can trigger sharp declines. Supply and Demand: Basic economic principles apply here. Limited supply combined with high demand drives prices up, and vice-versa. Memecoins often have vast supplies, making demand a critical factor. Technological Advancements & Utility: While less pronounced for pure memecoins, any potential future utility or integration into larger ecosystems can boost perceived value. Regulatory Landscape: Government regulations, or the lack thereof, can instill confidence or fear in investors, affecting market stability and adoption. Macroeconomic Factors: Inflation, interest rates, and global economic stability can push investors towards or away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Social Media & Community Engagement: For memecoins especially, viral trends and strong community backing on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Telegram are paramount. Understanding the Volatile Memecoin Market The memecoin market is a beast of its own, characterized by extreme volatility and rapid shifts in sentiment. Unlike established cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, memecoins often lack significant utility or a long-term roadmap. Their value is predominantly derived from community engagement, social media trends, and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) among retail investors. This makes them incredibly susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes and speculative bubbles. Navigating the memecoin market requires a different mindset. Investors often participate for high-risk, high-reward opportunities, understanding that prices can skyrocket within hours only to plummet just as quickly. The lifespan of a memecoin’s hype cycle can be unpredictable, with some fading into obscurity while others manage to sustain momentum for longer periods, sometimes by evolving to introduce new features or burning tokens to reduce supply. For Neiro, its journey within this unpredictable landscape will depend heavily on its ability to maintain community interest, innovate its appeal, and perhaps even hint at future utility beyond mere speculation. Without these elements, even the most promising memecoins can struggle to maintain their initial momentum. Neiro Price Prediction 2025: Short-Term Horizons Looking ahead to 2025, our Neiro price prediction considers both the inherent volatility of the memecoin market and the broader crypto environment. The next year could be a pivotal period for Neiro, as it seeks to establish a more permanent presence beyond initial hype. We anticipate a year marked by significant fluctuations, but also potential growth if certain conditions are met. Factors influencing Neiro’s price in 2025: Community Growth & Engagement: Sustained growth in its user base and active participation in its ecosystem will be critical. Broader Market Recovery: A bullish trend in the overall cryptocurrency price market, potentially driven by Bitcoin’s performance, would likely lift all altcoins, including Neiro. Exchange Listings: Listing on more prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs) could significantly increase liquidity and exposure. Development & Utility Hints: Even small announcements about potential future utility, partnerships, or unique features could fuel speculation. Given these factors, our conservative estimate for 2025 suggests Neiro could trade within a range. If the market experiences a strong bull run and Neiro maintains its community traction, reaching closer to the $0.0005 to $0.001 range is plausible. However, if market conditions are bearish or community interest wanes, it could struggle to maintain current levels. Forecasting Neiro’s Future: 2026 – 2030 Long-Term Outlook Extending our Neiro price prediction to 2026-2030 requires a more speculative approach, as the long-term future of any memecoin is inherently uncertain. However, by analyzing potential trends and the evolution of the crypto space, we can outline possible scenarios for this NEIRO memecoin . Neiro Price Prediction 2026 By 2026, the initial memecoin fervor might have settled, pushing projects like Neiro to demonstrate more substance. If Neiro manages to build some form of ecosystem, perhaps through NFTs, gaming, or a unique community platform, it could solidify its position. A sustained bull market would be beneficial, allowing Neiro to potentially reach new highs, possibly testing the $0.001 to $0.002 mark. However, without tangible development, it risks being overshadowed by newer, more innovative projects. Neiro Price Prediction 2027 The year 2027 could be a period of consolidation or further differentiation. Regulatory clarity in major economies might provide a more stable environment for crypto investment . For Neiro to thrive, it would need to have either developed a niche utility or maintained an exceptionally strong, loyal community. If it succeeds, a price range of $0.0008 to $0.0025 could be achievable. Failure to adapt or innovate would likely see its value decline significantly. Neiro Price Prediction 2028 As we approach 2028, the crypto market may have matured further, with institutional money playing a larger role. For a NEIRO memecoin to survive and grow, it would likely need to have transitioned from a purely speculative asset to one with some recognized value proposition, even if it’s just a highly successful decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) or a robust social platform. In an optimistic scenario, where the overall cryptocurrency price market is thriving, Neiro could aim for $0.002 to $0.0035. Neiro Price Prediction 2029 By 2029, the landscape for memecoins will likely be even more competitive. Only those with true staying power, innovative approaches, or an unshakeable community will remain relevant. If Neiro manages to continuously adapt and find new ways to engage its base or introduce surprising utility, it could potentially hold its value or even grow, possibly reaching $0.003 to $0.0045, especially if it benefits from a broader market surge. Neiro Price Prediction 2030 The ultimate goal for many investors is seeing Neiro hit $0.005. By 2030, this target would require extraordinary circumstances. It would necessitate not only a sustained bull market across the entire crypto space but also a remarkable evolution of the NEIRO memecoin itself. This could involve becoming a foundational token for a popular metaverse project, a leading social token, or achieving massive global recognition through unique viral campaigns. While ambitious, reaching $0.005 by 2030 is not impossible in the highly speculative memecoin market , but it depends on a perfect storm of positive developments and market conditions. A more realistic optimistic range could be $0.0035 to $0.005 if all goes well, with a significant risk of being much lower. Here’s a summarized outlook for Neiro: Year Potential Low (USD) Potential High (USD) Key Drivers 2025 $0.00015 $0.001 Market sentiment, community growth, minor listings 2026 $0.0003 $0.002 Ecosystem development, sustained market bull run 2027 $0.0005 $0.0025 Regulatory clarity, niche utility, community strength 2028 $0.0008 $0.0035 Market maturity, institutional interest, significant project evolution 2029 $0.001 $0.0045 Continuous adaptation, strong partnerships, global recognition 2030 $0.0015 $0.005 (Ambitious) Major utility, metaverse integration, sustained widespread adoption Is NEIRO a Viable Crypto Investment? The question of whether Neiro constitutes a viable crypto investment is complex and depends heavily on an individual’s risk tolerance and investment goals. Memecoins, by their very nature, are high-risk, high-reward assets. They offer the potential for exponential gains but also carry an equally high risk of significant losses. Benefits of Investing in NEIRO (Potential): High Growth Potential: If Neiro catches significant viral traction, early investors could see substantial returns. Community Driven: A strong, active community can provide resilience and drive hype, which is crucial for memecoins. Accessibility: Often, memecoins have very low entry prices, making them accessible to a broad range of investors. Challenges and Risks: Extreme Volatility: Prices can swing wildly, leading to rapid gains or losses. Lack of Fundamental Utility: Without a clear use case, its long-term value is purely speculative. Competition: The memecoin market is saturated with thousands of similar projects, making it hard to stand out. Rug Pulls & Scams: While not implying Neiro is one, the memecoin space is unfortunately prone to malicious projects. Whale Dominance: A few large holders can significantly influence price movements. For those considering Neiro as a crypto investment , it’s paramount to approach it with caution, only investing what you can afford to lose. It’s not a ‘set it and forget it’ asset but rather one that requires constant monitoring of market sentiment and community developments. Key Factors Influencing NEIRO’s Journey to $0.005 The path for NEIRO memecoin to potentially reach the $0.005 milestone is fraught with challenges but also opportunities. Several critical factors will determine its success: Community Strength and Virality: This is the lifeblood of any memecoin. Sustained, organic growth of its community and its ability to go viral on social media platforms will be paramount. Without continuous hype, interest will wane. Market Cycle & Overall Cryptocurrency Price: A strong bull market, particularly one driven by renewed retail interest, is essential. If Bitcoin and Ethereum lead a significant rally, it creates a favorable environment for altcoins, including memecoins, to surge. Exchange Listings & Accessibility: Securing listings on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) would dramatically increase Neiro’s visibility, liquidity, and accessibility to a broader investor base, driving demand. Innovation and Evolution: While starting as a pure memecoin, projects that endure often introduce some form of utility, unique features (like staking, NFTs, or mini-games), or a compelling narrative that keeps the community engaged beyond mere speculation. Developer Commitment & Transparency: An active and transparent development team (even if it’s just community organizers) can build trust and signal long-term viability, encouraging sustained crypto investment . Challenges and Opportunities for NEIRO Memecoin Every cryptocurrency, especially in the speculative memecoin market , faces a unique set of challenges and opportunities. For NEIRO memecoin , these are particularly pronounced: Challenges: Sustainability of Hype: Memecoins are notoriously difficult to sustain long-term interest without evolving beyond their initial viral appeal. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto market matures, regulators may impose stricter rules, potentially impacting highly speculative assets. Competition: The entry barrier for creating new memecoins is low, leading to constant competition for investor attention and liquidity. Whale Manipulation: Large holders can significantly influence price, leading to instability for smaller investors. Security Risks: Smart contract vulnerabilities or platform exploits, though less common for simple memecoins, remain a general crypto risk. Opportunities: Emergence of Niche Utility: If Neiro can organically develop a specific use case, perhaps in social finance (SocialFi) or decentralized applications (dApps), it could create enduring value. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with other projects, influencers, or brands could boost its profile and expand its reach. Technological Advancements: Leveraging new blockchain technologies or scaling solutions could enhance its appeal and functionality. Community-Led Innovation: Empowering its community to propose and implement new ideas could foster a truly decentralized and resilient ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Potential NEIRO Investors If you’re considering a crypto investment in Neiro or any other memecoin, here are some actionable insights to guide your decisions: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand the project, its community, and its market position. Start Small: Given the high risk, only invest a small portion of your portfolio that you are comfortable losing entirely. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across various assets to mitigate risk. Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep a close eye on social media trends, news, and overall cryptocurrency price movements. Memecoins are highly reactive to these. Set Clear Goals: Define your entry and exit points. Are you aiming for a quick profit or holding for potential long-term growth? Stick to your strategy. Be Aware of Scams: Always be vigilant for phishing attempts, fake websites, or promises of guaranteed returns. Consider the Long-Term Vision: While memecoins are often short-term plays, projects that show even a hint of a long-term vision or utility tend to perform better over time. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for NEIRO The journey for NEIRO memecoin to potentially hit $0.005 by 2030 is an ambitious one, reflective of the high-stakes nature of the memecoin market . Our comprehensive Neiro price prediction highlights that while the path is filled with volatility and uncertainty, the possibility exists under ideal conditions of sustained community growth, broader market bullishness, and perhaps an unexpected evolution of its utility or appeal. The inherent risks of a speculative crypto investment cannot be overstated, yet the allure of exponential gains continues to draw investors to projects like Neiro. Ultimately, Neiro’s future will be written by its community, the broader market’s temperament, and its ability to adapt in an ever-changing digital landscape. Whether it becomes a fleeting trend or a lasting player in the memecoin narrative remains to be seen, but its journey will undoubtedly be one to watch. Investors should proceed with caution, armed with thorough research and a clear understanding of the risks involved.

Double-Top Pattern Flashes Red Alert,https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-breakdown-looms-double-top-pattern-flashes-red-alert/,"TL;DR DOGE confirmed a double top at $0.27, with bearish target matching the current $0.238 price zone. Trendline retest around $0.24–$0.25 holds, keeping breakout structure intact with resistance near $0.30. MVRV ratio rising but below peaks, suggesting DOGE remains mid-cycle with a target of $1.20. Double Top Formation Raises Bearish Concerns Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.24 after dropping 11% in the past 24 hours and 10% over the week. The decline follows a pattern flagged by analyst Merlijn The Trader, who said, $DOGE IS FLASHING A TEXTBOOK DOUBLE TOP. Bearish retest locked. Target sits at $0.238. Don’t confuse noise with signal. The chart is already telling the truth. pic.twitter.com/GJ32G2kniw — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) September 21, 2025 Notably, the setup formed as DOGE failed twice to break higher, before sliding under the neckline near $0.27. A brief bounce back to that level was rejected, confirming the breakdown. Based on the measured move, the projected downside sits at $0.238, now reached by the price. Resistance remains at $0.27, while a close above $0.28 would challenge the bearish case. As long as the price stays under the neckline, the chart points to weakness. Trendline Retest Offers Counterpoint Analyst Trader Tardigrade pointed to a completed retest of a descending trendline that capped the price for months. The breakout above the line was followed by a pullback to $0.24–$0.25, where support held. Meanwhile, this level is now seen as a base. If DOGE remains above it, momentum could build toward $0.30. A move through that resistance would leave room for targets between $0.32 and $0.35, levels tested earlier in the year. Source: Trader Tardigrade/X In addition, Trader Tardigrade also shared an Ichimoku update. They noted , “No bearish Ichimoku signals; status remains bullish.” DOGE trades above both the Kumo cloud and the Kijun-sen line, with support at $0.24770 and deeper support between $0.21517 and $0.22214. All major indicators maintain an upward bias. The cloud is green, price action holds above the Kijun-sen, and the Chikou span is above the price. These keep the short-, mid-, and long-term trends aligned and heading in a bullish direction. MVRV Suggests Room for Growth On-chain data adds another angle.

This marks the first consolidation among public companies holding large bitcoin treasuries. The agreement values Semler at $90.52 per share , representing a 210% premium over its last market close. Each share of Semler will be exchanged for 21.05 shares of Strive (ASST) . Following the transaction, Semler’s executive chairman Eric Semler will join the combined company’s board. Alongside the merger, Strive disclosed the purchase of 5,816 bitcoin for $675 million , at an average price of $116,047 per BTC . When added to Semler’s holdings of about 5,000 bitcoin , the combined company will control more than 10,900 BTC . The deal follows heavy pressure on Semler’s stock price. In recent weeks, the company traded at levels below the value of its bitcoin reserves, effectively discounting its medical equipment business. This reflects a broader downturn across listed bitcoin treasury firms, many of which have seen valuations collapse after the summer’s market correction. “This merger cements Strive’s position as a top Bitcoin treasury company,” said Strive chairman and CEO Matt Cole. He added that the firm’s strategy and capital structure aim to deliver returns above bitcoin over the long term. The transaction signals the beginning of consolidation among publicly traded bitcoin treasury companies, with Strive positioning itself as a leading player in the sector.",,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-09-22 13:45:33

The initiative is meant to enable the nation to automatically share its tax reporting related to digital asset transactions with the global authority. The framework was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ). The initiative requires crypto exchanges, brokers, custodians, and wallet operators to reveal customer activity, including purchasing, selling, and transferring virtual currencies. UAE opens public consultation The framework is scheduled to roll out in 2027, and the country is expected to start sharing data with international tax authorities the following year. The CARF plan was first announced in November 2024, when the UAE revealed plans to reinforce its dedication to international tax transparency and regulatory consistency. The country’s MoF said the initiative aims to ensure that the UAE provides certainty and clarity to the digital asset industry while maintaining global tax transparency. The agency also believes the framework is designed to mitigate tax evasion, reduce money laundering risks, and strengthen the integrity of the crypto market. The MoF insists that the framework will offer greater clarity for investors and companies. It also asked the stakeholders to share their feedback on the framework’s potential impacts and areas requiring further clarification. The government agency invited all stakeholders active in the crypto asset sector to participate in a public consultation on CARF implementation in the country. The MoF opened the public consultation for eight weeks, running from September 15 to November 8. The agency said the initiative aims to develop clear and effective regulatory rules with the help of insights from experts and stakeholders, and to align with market needs. According to the report, the nation’s adoption of CARF positions it among more than 65 countries involved in the OECD framework. The UAE’s alignment with global best practices also pushed it a step closer to enhancing its standing as a financial hub and enabling greater cross-border cooperation to combat illicit conduct. The initiative also positions the UAE to follow existing regulatory parameters, including the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). The MoF argued that the country’s strategy accords with international efforts to regulate the digital asset industry and maintain consistency with the evolving global regulatory landscape. “It aligns the UAE with global tax transparency standards, boosting trust with regulators and international partners.” -Nitesh Mishra, Co-Founder and CTO at ChaiDEX. Mishra also acknowledged that the initiative brings greater legal clarity and certainty to crypto activities in the region , making the environment safer for compliant partners. He also argued that allowing public input on the framework suggests that final regulations might reflect market and investor needs. He added that it would attract institutional investors, since the rules help establish a fair, well-regulated marketplace. UAE discusses latest financial and economic developments with the IMF The MoF also engaged with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) delegation on Wednesday in Abu Dhabi, where they discussed the country’s economic projection and policy framework. The agency revealed that both parties reviewed the UAE’s macroeconomic performance, financial and banking developments, and its broader economic policies. They also discussed primary challenges and opportunities for promoting the nation’s sustainable economic growth. The lead of the MoF delegation, Younis Haji AlKhoori, said the initiative showed the depth of the UAE’s strategic partnership with the Fund. The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Finance acknowledged that the agency was keen on strengthening its cooperation, since the IMF was still a key partner in supporting the ministry’s efforts towards fiscal and economic policy. AlKhoori added that the regular consultations enable the MoF to design financial policies that keep pace with regional and global developments.

This move by PayPal’s dedicated investment arm into Stable, an innovative Layer 1 blockchain focused on stablecoins, signals a profound belief in the future of digital payments. It’s not just an investment; it’s a partnership poised to redefine how we interact with digital currencies. What Exactly is the PayPal Ventures Stable Investment? PayPal Ventures, the venture capital arm of the global payments giant PayPal, has committed an undisclosed sum to Stable. As reported by PR Newswire, this isn’t merely a financial transaction; it’s a strategic alliance. Stable is a unique Layer 1 blockchain, purpose-built with a singular focus: stablecoins. This specialization is key, aiming to provide a robust and efficient infrastructure for these less volatile digital assets. A significant outcome of this investment is the planned integration of PayPal’s own stablecoin, PYUSD. Imagine using PYUSD seamlessly for payments and various financial transactions directly on the Stable blockchain. This integration is set to dramatically enhance the utility and accessibility of PYUSD, extending its reach and potential impact across the digital economy. Why Are Stablecoins and Layer 1 Blockchains So Important Right Now? Stablecoins are a cornerstone of the modern crypto landscape. They are cryptocurrencies engineered to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar. This stability makes them incredibly attractive for everyday commerce, remittances, and hedging against the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. The PayPal Ventures Stable partnership recognizes this critical role. A Layer 1 blockchain, such as Stable, is a fundamental network that processes and finalizes its own transactions without relying on other blockchains. Think of it as the bedrock upon which other applications are built. This architectural choice typically ensures greater security, decentralization, and the potential for superior scalability. By developing a dedicated Layer 1 for stablecoins, Stable aims to overcome common blockchain challenges, offering a highly efficient and reliable platform. This powerful synergy between PayPal Ventures and Stable is set to unlock several compelling advantages: Enhanced Transaction Stability: A blockchain specifically optimized for stablecoins can deliver superior performance and unwavering reliability for digital payments. Expanded Utility for PYUSD: The direct integration means PayPal’s stablecoin gains more real-world use cases and broader acceptance, making it easier for users to transact. Potentially Lower Costs: An optimized blockchain architecture could lead to more affordable digital payments, benefiting both consumers and businesses. Faster Transaction Settlements: Streamlined processes on a purpose-built chain are designed to accelerate how quickly transactions are finalized, improving efficiency. What Benefits and Hurdles Lie Ahead for Digital Payments? This strategic investment by PayPal Ventures Stable represents far more than just financial backing; it’s a resounding vote of confidence in the evolving landscape of digital payments. It paints a picture of a future where stablecoins play an increasingly central role in our daily financial interactions, from online purchases to international money transfers. This collaboration could very well establish a new benchmark for how established financial institutions embrace and integrate cutting-edge blockchain technology. However, the path forward is not without its complexities. Regulatory frameworks for stablecoins are still under development globally, posing a significant, evolving challenge. Governments and financial bodies are actively working to create guidelines, which will impact how Stable and PYUSD operate. Moreover, the stablecoin and Layer 1 blockchain sectors are highly competitive, demanding continuous innovation and a clear demonstration of Stable’s unique value proposition to stand out. For users and developers, this development presents exciting opportunities: Access to a potentially more efficient, secure, and cost-effective payment rail. Greater integration of digital assets into mainstream financial activities, bridging traditional finance with crypto. New avenues for developers to innovate and build decentralized applications (dApps) that leverage the Stable blockchain and PYUSD, fostering a vibrant ecosystem. This collaboration truly exemplifies a growing global trend: established financial players are not just observing but actively embracing decentralized technologies. It signifies a collective movement towards a more interconnected, efficient, and accessible global financial system, with stablecoins at its very core. A Groundbreaking Step for PayPal Ventures Stable and the Digital Economy The investment from PayPal Ventures into the Stable blockchain is undeniably a groundbreaking development for the entire digital asset space. It not only injects substantial capital and credibility into Stable but also strategically positions PayPal’s PYUSD for significantly broader adoption and utility. This powerful partnership has the potential to accelerate the mainstream acceptance of stablecoins, laying a robust foundation for a more integrated and efficient digital economy. As this alliance unfolds, it will be fascinating to observe its impact on the payments landscape. This collaboration is a testament to the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology, promising a future where digital money is more accessible and functional than ever before. Keep a close watch on these developments, as they are set to redefine how we perceive and utilize digital currency in our daily lives.

This landmark event has truly opened the floodgates for other digital asset firms considering a leap onto traditional stock exchanges. But who’s next in line? According to Maja Vukinovic, the insightful CEO of FG Nexus (FGNX), a Nasdaq-listed Ethereum investment firm, the spotlight is now firmly on Paxos. She firmly believes that a Paxos Nasdaq listing is not just possible, but highly probable, marking a significant milestone for the stablecoin industry. Why is Paxos a Top Contender for a Paxos Nasdaq Listing ? Maja Vukinovic’s perspective isn’t just a hunch; it’s rooted in a deep understanding of the market and regulatory landscape. She highlights several compelling reasons why Paxos stands out among its peers. The success of Circle, the issuer of USDC, in navigating the complexities of a public offering has paved a clear path. This precedent demonstrates that stablecoin companies, despite their innovative nature, can meet the stringent requirements of a major stock exchange like Nasdaq. Paxos, as a regulated blockchain infrastructure platform, has consistently demonstrated a commitment to regulatory adherence. This commitment is paramount for any company aspiring to list on a traditional exchange. Traditional investors and regulators alike seek stability and transparency, qualities that Paxos has actively cultivated. Its proactive approach to compliance positions it as an ideal candidate to follow in Circle’s footsteps. The Regulatory Edge: Paxos’s Compliance Blueprint One of Paxos’s most significant strengths lies in its robust regulatory framework. Unlike many other crypto entities, Paxos operates under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter. This provides a strong foundation of oversight and trust, which is invaluable in the highly scrutinized financial world. This regulatory compliance is not merely a formality; it’s a strategic advantage. Vukinovic emphasized that Paxos’s dedication to meeting U.S. regulations makes it an exceptionally strong contender. This adherence ensures that the company operates within established legal boundaries, reducing potential risks and increasing its appeal to institutional investors. For a successful Paxos Nasdaq listing , demonstrating unwavering regulatory compliance is absolutely non-negotiable. NYDFS Trust Charter: A key differentiator, providing a regulated operational framework. Proactive Compliance: Paxos consistently works with regulators, building trust. Investor Confidence: Strong compliance attracts traditional investors seeking security. Powering PayPal’s PYUSD: A Testament to Trust Beyond its regulatory standing, Paxos has proven its operational capabilities through high-profile partnerships. Its role in managing PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, is a prime example of its reliability and expertise. PayPal, a global leader in online payments, would not entrust its stablecoin operations to just any firm. This partnership speaks volumes about Paxos’s infrastructure and its ability to handle large-scale financial operations securely and efficiently. The successful management of PYUSD showcases Paxos’s technical prowess and its capacity to deliver on complex projects within the mainstream financial ecosystem. This real-world application, backed by a major financial institution, adds another layer of credibility to Paxos’s profile. Such endorsements are critical when pitching for a public listing, as they demonstrate proven market integration and operational excellence. What Does a Paxos Nasdaq Listing Mean for the Crypto Market? A successful Paxos Nasdaq listing would send a powerful signal across the entire cryptocurrency industry. It would further legitimize stablecoins as a crucial component of the global financial infrastructure. Moreover, it would encourage more blockchain companies to pursue public listings, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative digital asset space. For investors, it would offer a new avenue to gain exposure to the growing stablecoin market through a regulated, publicly traded entity. This could attract a wave of institutional capital that has previously been hesitant to enter the crypto market directly. It also signifies a maturing industry, one that is increasingly ready to integrate with established financial systems while maintaining its core innovative spirit. The potential listing would also highlight the importance of compliance and regulatory clarity for long-term success in the crypto space. Companies that prioritize these aspects are more likely to thrive and gain acceptance from broader financial markets. The Future of Digital Assets on Public Exchanges The trend set by Circle and potentially followed by Paxos suggests a future where digital asset companies are increasingly part of mainstream financial markets. This integration could lead to greater transparency, enhanced investor protection, and wider adoption of blockchain technology. It’s a clear indication that the financial world is evolving, embracing the potential of decentralized finance within regulated frameworks. This ongoing evolution promises to reshape how we view and interact with money and investments. The journey of companies like Paxos towards public markets is not just about their individual growth; it’s about the broader maturation and acceptance of the entire digital asset ecosystem. It’s an exciting time for innovation, convergence, and the future of finance. The prospect of a Paxos Nasdaq listing is more than just a corporate event; it’s a testament to the evolving legitimacy and integration of stablecoins into the mainstream financial world. Maja Vukinovic’s insights from FG Nexus underscore Paxos’s strong position, driven by its unwavering commitment to compliance and its successful ventures like managing PayPal’s PYUSD. As the crypto market continues to mature, such listings will undoubtedly pave the way for a more robust, regulated, and accessible digital asset economy, benefiting both traditional and crypto investors alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin, and why is Paxos a stablecoin issuer? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. Paxos is a regulated financial institution that issues stablecoins such as Pax Dollar (USDP) and previously Binance USD (BUSD), ensuring their value is backed by reserves and audited regularly. They also manage PayPal’s PYUSD. Q2: Why is a Nasdaq listing significant for a crypto company like Paxos? A Nasdaq listing provides a crypto company with significant legitimacy, access to a broader pool of institutional and retail investors, and increased transparency through public reporting requirements. It bridges the gap between the innovative crypto space and traditional financial markets, signaling maturity and stability. Q3: How does Paxos’s compliance with U.S. regulations help its Nasdaq listing prospects? Paxos operates under a New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) trust charter, which means it adheres to strict financial regulations. This strong regulatory compliance is crucial for gaining approval from the SEC and attracting traditional investors who prioritize security, transparency, and legal adherence, making a Paxos Nasdaq listing more likely. Q4: What role does PayPal’s PYUSD play in Paxos’s appeal for a public listing? Paxos manages PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD. This partnership with a major global financial services company demonstrates Paxos’s operational reliability, technical expertise, and ability to integrate with mainstream finance. Such high-profile collaborations enhance its credibility and attractiveness to investors considering a public offering. Q5: What impact could more stablecoin companies going public have on the broader crypto market? More stablecoin companies listing on public exchanges would further legitimize the digital asset industry, attract more institutional investment, and foster greater regulatory clarity. It would signify a growing acceptance of crypto within traditional finance, potentially leading to wider adoption and a more stable, regulated market environment.

CAKE token is at the heart of the PancakeSwap ecosystem. Buy it, win it, farm it, spend it, stake it… heck, you can even vote with it!

PancakeSwap historic price sentiment PancakeSwap price history PancakeSwap’s native token, CAKE, has had an eventful price history since its inception in September 2020. CAKE launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) in September 2020, initially trading at a fraction of a cent. Over time, it experienced gradual growth. The first notable surge occurred during the first DeFi bull run in early 2021. CAKE’s price skyrocketed from less than $1 to over $20 in just a few weeks, reflecting the growing popularity of PancakeSwap and the broader DeFi market. Following this surge, CAKE went through a correction and consolidation phase, trading within the $10 to $15 range, allowing the token to stabilize. The second DeFi bull run in April and May 2021 saw CAKE’s price reaching new all-time highs. At its peak, CAKE briefly touched $44, highlighting its resilience and potential. Like many cryptocurrencies, CAKE faced increased market volatility during the mid-2021 crypto market correction, with its price fluctuating between $10 and $20. In late 2021, CAKE saw a resurgence, reaching and maintaining a price of around $20 between August and October. However, the bearish trend began in November, and throughout 2022, CAKE struggled, only having hit a peak of $12 in early January 2022. By the end of 2022, it was trading at approximately $3.2. In early 2023, there were brief price corrections, pushing CAKE to $4.68. Unfortunately, the bears returned, driving the price down to $1.3 by mid-2023. Till the year 2023 came to an end, CAKE regained bullish momentum and spiked up to $3.5 range. 2024 started with a lower break from the peak, and the price reduced to $2.41 by the end of January. At the start of February 2024, Pancakeswap started another bullish run, and it peaked at $5.15. By the end of April, CAKE had lost almost 50% of its value, and its price had decreased to the $2.5 level. In May, CAKE neared the $3 mark and jumped to 3.19 on June 5, 2024. However, the coin remained on a downslope till the end of July. CAKE traded around the $1.48 to $2.21 range in August and remained in the said range till the end of October. The token started spiking in November with a peak price of $3.17, and it jumped to $4.18 in December 2024. It ended the year 2024 with a price tag of $2.50. CAKE saw a high price of $2.84 in January 2025, but it corrected down to the $1.36 range in February. CAKE enjoyed a bullish trend along with the broader cryptocurrency market in March, April, and May and touched a high price of $2.9. A low swing towards $1.95 was also observed in June, but the trend reversed soon, and the altcoin jumped near its yearly high to $3.31 in August. In September 2025, CAKE is trading near $2.8.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|CAKE|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-22 13:58:09

In an official government release , the UAE Ministry of Finance revealed that it has signed the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the Automatic Exchange of Information under the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) , following its announcement last November of its intention to implement the framework. CARF implementation in the UAE is now scheduled to go live in 2027, with the first tax information reporting expected in 2028. Source: UAE Ministry of Finance “ The framework establishes a mechanism for the automatic exchange of tax-related information on crypto-asset activities, ensuring that the UAE provides certainty and clarity to the crypto-asset sector while upholding the principles of global tax transparency ,” the Ministry said. The move builds on the UAE’s efforts to attract crypto businesses after exempting crypto transactions from VAT in 2024 and Dubai setting regulatory guidelines for digital asset companies. The Ministry is now seeking industry feedback before implementing the rules. All participants in the crypto sector, including exchanges, custodians, traders, and advisors, are invited to join the public consultation to share their concerns about potential impacts. The consultation has already opened on September 15 and is expected to close on November 8, 2025. For Crypto Investors: What Does the UAE Crypto Tax Reporting Agreement Means The UAE will begin automatically sharing information on crypto transactions and holdings with tax authorities in other countries starting in 2028. This means that crypto will no longer be treated as an opaque asset class for offshore investors. Investors who rely on the UAE as a low-tax or no-tax hub will need to ensure they report their crypto holdings correctly in their home jurisdictions. Authorities can cross-check disclosures with the data exchanged under CARF, making tax evasion much harder. The most common tax fear: “I don’t want to be audited.” The IRS uses a scoring system to decide which returns to flag for review. Each return is processed through a model that assigns a score based on how likely it is that income is underreported or deductions don’t line up… pic.twitter.com/ugPRkuLh7a — Nick Abouzeid, EA (@nickabouzeid) September 16, 2025 UAE-based exchanges, custodians, and wallet providers will be required to collect and report customer data, similar to how banks and brokers report under FATCA/CRS. Crypto investors should expect stricter KYC and AML processes, as platforms prepare to comply with international reporting standards. Institutional investors may view this as a positive development, as it reduces reputational risk and regulatory uncertainty. However, privacy-focused investors who rely on crypto for tax avoidance or secrecy may feel uneasy as cross-border reporting reduces anonymity. There could be higher compliance costs, especially for traders using multiple wallets, custodians , or offshore entities. Non-compliant investors might face penalties, back taxes, or investigations in their home countries as the tax avoidance window closes by 2027–2028. UAE’s Local Tax Position Remains Unchanged It’s worth noting that the UAE’s signing the CARF does not mean it will start taxing crypto gains locally. What it does mean is that if you are a foreigner living in the UAE but remain tax-resident elsewhere, your home country can now receive details of your UAE crypto activity and tax you according to its laws. For UAE nationals and residents who are only tax-resident in the UAE, crypto will still be exempt from income tax, unless a new domestic law is introduced later. Currently in the UAE, there’s no personal income tax on individuals, whether from salary, business profits, or crypto gains. Similarly, the 5% VAT in the country only applies to goods and services, but not to investment gains (like profits from selling crypto). So until now, crypto trading by individuals has not been taxed in the UAE. However, a corporate tax of 9% was introduced in June 2023 , but it mainly applies to companies with profits exceeding AED 375,000. Individuals trading crypto on their own are not subject to corporate tax. Who Should Worry Most About the Crypto Tax Reporting System? The first category includes expats in the UAE who are still tax residents in their home countries. Also, investors who have been under-reporting or not reporting crypto gains back home and high-net-worth individuals who moved assets into UAE exchanges for “privacy.” This means if you’re from the US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, or India, the new CARF agreement means your home tax authority will soon have a clear view of your UAE crypto accounts. In France and Italy, governments impose taxes to the tune of almost 50% (!) of GDP. In the US, that’s barely 30%. Not a fun experience for productive individuals and companies in Europe: pic.twitter.com/nDVAvEmndc — Alf (@MacroAlf) February 17, 2025 But suppose you’re from countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Singapore, or Switzerland, or you’re a UAE national/resident who is only tied to the UAE. In that case, there’s little change since your jurisdiction doesn’t currently tax crypto gains.

According to data from CoinGlass, over $1.7 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, leaving more than 402,000 traders in the red. Related Reading: FalconX Adds To Solana Stash: $28.39M In SOL Pulled From Binance Ethereum (ETH) bore the heaviest losses, with nearly $500 million in liquidations, while Bitcoin (BTC) saw about $284 million wiped out. Altcoins such as XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Hyperliquid (HYPE) tumbled between 7–12%, erasing recent gains and signaling an abrupt end to the latest altcoins rally. The cascade began with BTC dipping below $113,000, triggering margin calls and automated sell-offs. Within just 30 minutes, liquidations had surged past $1 billion, underscoring the fragility of highly leveraged trading environments. Bitcoin Dominance Rises as Altcoins’ Value Drops The sell-off also brought a sharp reversal in market sentiment. The Altcoin Season Index, which peaked at 100 points just days ago, has now dropped to 64, suggesting traders are shifting back toward Bitcoin. BTC dominance has climbed to 57%, while ETH dominance slipped to 13%. Historically, altcoin seasons last only a few weeks before liquidity rotates back into Bitcoin. Analysts warn that the latest liquidation cascade may have ended this cycle earlier than expected. Smaller tokens, including ASTER, WLFI, and PUMP, which recently saw speculative surges, were among the hardest hit, with more than $263 million in altcoins longs liquidated. ETH's price trends lower on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview Healthy Shakeout or Bearish Warning? Despite the steep losses, many analysts argue the pullback reflects a healthy reset rather than the end of the bull cycle. Overleveraged traders were washed out, creating stronger support levels for long-term holders. Institutional demand remains intact, with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs recording steady inflows last week, suggesting that large investors continue to buy the dip. On-chain data also shows 420,000 ETH leaving exchanges, pointing toward accumulation despite short-term volatility.

Nasdaq-listed Reliance Global Group has officially joined the growing list of corporations embracing digital assets by adding Cardano’s ADA to its ADA corporate reserves . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency purchase; it signals a significant shift in how established companies view and integrate digital currencies into their treasury strategies. Why Are Companies Eyeing ADA Corporate Reserves? When a company like Reliance, listed on the prestigious Nasdaq, makes such a move, it sends a powerful message across the financial landscape. It highlights a growing confidence in cryptocurrencies, not just as speculative assets, but as legitimate components of a corporate balance sheet. This strategic decision by Reliance underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption. Cardano (ADA) stands out due to several key attributes: Its proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain offers energy efficiency. A strong focus on sustainability and peer-reviewed research. A robust development roadmap that attracts long-term investors. These characteristics make ADA an attractive option for institutional players seeking both technological innovation and potential long-term value. For corporations, holding crypto like ADA can offer portfolio diversification, a potential hedge against traditional market inflation, and a forward-thinking approach to treasury management. Reliance Global Group’s Strategic Play: Diving into ADA Reliance Global Group’s decision to specifically acquire ADA, even without disclosing the exact size of the acquisition, underscores a clear strategic intent. It suggests a belief in Cardano’s underlying technology and its future potential within the evolving digital economy. What might be driving their motivation? Innovation: Positioning the company at the forefront of emerging financial technologies. Investor Attraction: Appealing to a new generation of investors familiar with digital assets. Market Positioning: Differentiating themselves in a competitive market by embracing future trends. However, integrating digital assets into ADA corporate reserves also comes with its share of challenges. Companies must carefully navigate price volatility, the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, and the complexities of secure digital asset management. These are crucial considerations for any corporate entity exploring such moves. The Expanding Horizon of Corporate Crypto Adoption Reliance isn’t alone in this venture. We’ve seen other corporate giants like MicroStrategy and Tesla make headlines with their significant Bitcoin acquisitions. This growing trend signifies a broader institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. The increasing presence of ADA corporate reserves and other digital assets on corporate balance sheets suggests a maturation of the crypto market. It moves cryptocurrencies from being niche assets to a more mainstream financial discussion. This shift has profound implications, potentially driving further market liquidity, fostering innovation, and legitimizing the entire digital asset ecosystem in the eyes of traditional finance. What This Means for the Future of ADA and Corporate Reserves? The inclusion of ADA in Reliance’s ADA corporate reserves could significantly boost Cardano’s profile, attracting more institutional attention and potentially influencing its market valuation. It validates Cardano’s position as a serious contender in the blockchain space, capable of attracting major corporate investment. For other companies observing this trend, it might prompt them to explore similar strategies. The question is no longer “if” corporations will adopt crypto, but rather “when” and “which” digital assets they will choose. This move by Reliance could serve as a blueprint for others. Actionable Insight: Companies considering digital assets for their reserves should conduct thorough due diligence. It is essential to understand the specific regulatory frameworks, assess their risk tolerance, and establish robust security protocols before making any commitments. The landscape of ADA corporate reserves is evolving, and informed decisions are key. A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future Reliance Global Group’s entry into ADA corporate reserves marks a pivotal moment, highlighting the increasing integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance. It’s a clear signal that the future of finance is increasingly digital, and forward-thinking companies are positioning themselves accordingly. This move not only benefits Reliance but also adds another layer of credibility to the entire Cardano ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is ADA? ADA is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano blockchain platform. Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project that is fully open source. It is known for its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and scientific, research-driven approach to development. Q2: Why are companies adding cryptocurrencies like ADA to their corporate reserves? Companies are adding cryptocurrencies to their reserves for various strategic reasons, including portfolio diversification, potential hedge against inflation, exposure to a rapidly growing asset class, and demonstrating innovation to investors. It’s seen as a forward-looking treasury strategy. Q3: What are the primary risks for corporations holding crypto assets? Key risks include price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, security concerns (e.g., hacks, loss of private keys), and accounting complexities. Companies must have robust risk management frameworks in place. Q4: Will more Nasdaq-listed companies follow suit and add ADA to their reserves? While difficult to predict with certainty, Reliance Global Group’s move, combined with broader institutional interest, suggests a growing likelihood. As the crypto market matures and regulatory clarity improves, more companies may consider including ADA and other digital assets in their corporate reserves. Q5: How does this institutional adoption impact Cardano’s ecosystem? Institutional adoption, such as adding ADA to corporate reserves, can significantly boost Cardano’s credibility and market visibility. It can lead to increased liquidity, greater demand for ADA, and potentially attract further development and investment into the Cardano ecosystem, strengthening its long-term viability.

Today, the three major U.S. stock indices kicked off the trading day in the red, with the S&P 500 down 0.13%, the Nasdaq Composite dipping 0.02%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing a 0.4% decline. This immediate downturn in traditional equities naturally prompts a crucial question: what does this mean for your digital asset portfolio? Understanding the intricate dance between these seemingly separate markets is vital for informed decision-making. Understanding the US Stock Market’s Opening Dip When the US stock market begins the day with a noticeable dip, it often reflects broader investor sentiment or reactions to recent economic data. The S&P 500, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, serves as a key indicator of overall market health. Similarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the industrial-focused Dow Jones Industrial Average provide distinct insights into different sectors. A simultaneous decline across all three suggests a widespread cautious, or even bearish, outlook among investors. This initial movement can set the tone for the trading day and influence various asset classes globally. Why Does the US Stock Market Matter for Crypto? Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts initially believed digital assets would remain entirely uncorrelated with traditional markets. However, recent years have shown a growing interconnectedness. When the US stock market experiences significant shifts, particularly downturns, it can trigger a “risk-off” sentiment. This means investors tend to pull capital from riskier assets, including some cryptocurrencies, and move it into perceived safer havens. Institutional Influence: As more institutional money flows into crypto, the correlation strengthens. Major investment firms often manage portfolios that include both stocks and digital assets, leading to similar reactions across their holdings during market volatility. Macroeconomic Factors: Shared economic concerns like inflation, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical events impact both traditional stocks and the crypto market. Consequently, a negative outlook for one often spills over to the other. Investor Psychology: General market fear or optimism can be contagious, influencing decisions across different asset classes. Navigating Volatility: Your Crypto Strategy During a US Stock Market Downturn A dip in the US stock market doesn’t necessarily spell doom for your crypto portfolio, but it does call for a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Diversify Your Portfolio: While some cryptocurrencies may correlate with stocks, others might exhibit different behaviors. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risk. Focus on Long-Term Holdings: Short-term market fluctuations, whether in stocks or crypto, are common. A long-term investment horizon can help weather these temporary storms. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can reduce the impact of volatility. Research Fundamentals: Understand the underlying technology, use cases, and development teams behind your chosen cryptocurrencies. Strong fundamentals can offer resilience during broader market turbulence. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Knowledge is power in volatile markets. Future Outlook: What’s Next for the US Stock Market and Crypto? Predicting the exact future trajectory of the US stock market or the crypto market is challenging. Economic indicators like inflation rates, employment figures, and central bank policies will continue to play a significant role. For crypto, ongoing regulatory developments, technological advancements, and increasing mainstream adoption will also be key drivers. While short-term correlations might persist, many believe that cryptocurrencies, especially those with strong utility, could eventually decouple more significantly from traditional markets, offering unique investment opportunities. Investors should remain vigilant and adapt their strategies as new information emerges.

This future might be closer than you think, as Germany’s largest commercial bank, Deutsche Bank, has made a compelling forecast: Bitcoin could be recognized as a central bank reserve asset by 2030 . This isn’t just a bold prediction; it signals a potential paradigm shift in global finance, prompting serious discussion about the evolving nature of sovereign wealth and monetary policy. Deutsche Bank’s Bold Prediction: Bitcoin as a Future Reserve Asset The notion of a Bitcoin reserve asset on central bank balance sheets might seem futuristic, but a recent report from Deutsche Bank, as highlighted by Coindesk, suggests this could become a reality within the next seven years. Currently, the U.S. dollar reigns supreme, accounting for a dominant 57% of global foreign exchange reserves. However, the report points to a gradually changing landscape. For example, major economies like China have already begun to diversify, reducing their holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds by a significant $57 billion last year. This strategic move indicates a broader trend among nations to lessen reliance on a single reserve currency, seeking alternative hedges against economic and geopolitical uncertainties. Deutsche Bank’s analysis provides a credible institutional voice to the growing conversation around digital assets in traditional finance. Why Consider Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset? Diversification and Digital Gold So, what makes Bitcoin an attractive candidate for a Bitcoin reserve asset ? The report from Deutsche Bank outlines several key attributes that position Bitcoin as a complementary hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. Its value proposition is rooted in its low correlation with the U.S. dollar and other traditional assets. This characteristic is vital for diversification, offering a safeguard when conventional markets face turbulence. Consider these points: Inflation Hedge: With its capped supply, Bitcoin is often viewed as a scarce asset, akin to digital gold, which can protect purchasing power during periods of rising inflation. Geopolitical Risk Mitigation: As a decentralized asset, Bitcoin operates independently of any single government or financial institution. This makes it a potential refuge during international disputes or sanctions, offering a neutral store of value. Portfolio Diversification: Adding a low-correlation asset like Bitcoin to a reserve portfolio can reduce overall risk and potentially enhance returns, much like gold has traditionally done. While Bitcoin is unlikely to immediately replace the dollar’s status, its role as a digital alternative to gold is gaining traction among institutional thinkers. Navigating the Path to Bitcoin Reserve Asset Adoption: Challenges and Evolution The journey for Bitcoin to become a widely accepted Bitcoin reserve asset is not without its hurdles. Deutsche Bank acknowledges that its adoption will accelerate gradually, contingent on the evolution of both regulatory frameworks and the broader economic environment. This includes addressing concerns around volatility, scalability, and security, which are often cited as barriers to institutional adoption. Key considerations for central banks include: Regulatory Clarity: Clear, comprehensive regulations are essential to provide certainty and reduce risks for central banks considering Bitcoin. Market Maturity: As the cryptocurrency market matures, with increased liquidity and reduced price swings, its appeal as a stable reserve asset will grow. Technological Infrastructure: Central banks would need robust and secure infrastructure to manage and store digital assets effectively. The report emphasizes that as these factors evolve, the practicalities of integrating Bitcoin into national reserves will become more manageable, paving the way for its inclusion. What This Means for the Global Financial Landscape The potential emergence of Bitcoin as a central bank Bitcoin reserve asset has profound implications for the global financial landscape. It signifies a broader recognition of digital assets beyond speculative investments, elevating them to a strategic tool for national economic stability. This shift could accelerate the digital transformation of finance, encouraging further innovation in blockchain technology and digital currencies. For investors and the general public, this forecast suggests a growing institutional validation of Bitcoin. While retail interest often drives crypto markets, central bank involvement would represent a monumental step towards mainstream acceptance and potentially greater stability. It underscores the idea that digital assets are not merely a fleeting trend but a fundamental component of the future economy. Deutsche Bank’s projection that Bitcoin could become a central bank reserve asset by 2030 is a powerful testament to the evolving nature of global finance. It highlights a future where digital assets play a significant role in safeguarding national wealth, complementing traditional assets like gold and the U.S. dollar. While challenges remain, the institutional recognition and the ongoing search for diversification by central banks suggest that Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital currency to a global reserve asset is well underway. This transformative outlook invites us to consider a financial future unlike any we have known. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a central bank reserve asset? A1: A central bank reserve asset is a foreign asset held by a central bank to support its currency, manage exchange rates, and provide liquidity during crises. Traditionally, these include gold, foreign currencies (like the U.S. dollar), and government bonds. Q2: Why is Deutsche Bank forecasting Bitcoin as a reserve asset? A2: Deutsche Bank’s forecast is based on Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks, its low correlation with traditional assets, and the global trend towards diversification away from a sole reliance on the U.S. dollar. Q3: How would Bitcoin complement traditional reserve assets like gold? A3: Both Bitcoin and gold offer hedges against inflation and geopolitical instability due to their scarcity. Bitcoin, as a digital asset, provides advantages like ease of transfer and censorship resistance, making it a complementary digital alternative to physical gold for diversification. Q4: What are the main challenges for Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset? A4: Key challenges include the need for clearer regulatory frameworks, addressing market volatility, ensuring scalability, and developing secure technological infrastructure for central banks to manage digital assets.

Their latest report suggests that a potential Bitcoin bear market could be on the horizon. This isn’t just speculation; it’s based on a significant metric: the cost basis for Bitcoin short-term holders. If BTC continues to trade consistently below this specific price point, we might be entering a prolonged period of downward pressure, fundamentally shifting the market sentiment. Understanding the Glassnode Bitcoin Bear Market Signal Glassnode’s analysis focuses on the behavior and financial positions of short-term holders (STHs). These are typically defined as entities that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. Unlike long-term holders, STHs are often more reactive to immediate price fluctuations, making their collective sentiment a powerful indicator of market direction. The firm reported that the average cost basis for these STHs currently stands at an estimated $111,400. This figure represents the average price at which these investors acquired their Bitcoin. When the market price consistently trades below this average, it means a significant portion of recent buyers are holding their assets at an unrealized loss. This situation can create strong selling pressure as these investors may choose to exit their positions to prevent further losses, thereby exacerbating a downward trend. What is the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis, and Why Does it Matter for a Bitcoin Bear Market ? The short-term holder cost basis is more than just a number; it acts as a critical psychological and financial support level for the market. It reflects the aggregate conviction and entry points of a large group of active participants. When the price dips below this level, it signals a significant shift in market dynamics. Unrealized Losses: Trading below the STH cost basis means most recent buyers are “underwater,” facing losses. This can trigger capitulation events. Historical Precedent: Historically, sustained trading below this key metric has often preceded or coincided with broader market downturns, paving the way for a full-fledged Bitcoin bear market . Supply Dynamics: A large portion of the circulating supply held by STHs becomes vulnerable to selling, increasing the available supply on exchanges and putting downward pressure on prices. This $111,400 threshold is not just arbitrary; it’s derived from sophisticated on-chain data analysis, providing a data-driven perspective on potential market shifts. Understanding this metric allows investors to gauge the health of the market beyond simple price charts. Navigating a Potential Bitcoin Bear Market : Strategies for Investors If Glassnode’s warning proves accurate and the market transitions into a medium-to-long-term Bitcoin bear market , how should investors prepare? Proactive planning and a clear strategy are essential during challenging market conditions. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Risk Exposure: Take a fresh look at your portfolio. Assess how much of your capital is allocated to Bitcoin and other volatile assets. Adjusting your risk exposure might involve reducing positions or rebalancing. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin, a bear market can present opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices. DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. Diversify Your Portfolio: Spreading investments across different asset classes, including traditional assets or less correlated cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate overall portfolio risk during a downturn. Focus on Long-Term Vision: Bear markets are a natural part of any financial cycle. For long-term investors, they can be a test of patience. Focusing on Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and technological advancements can help maintain perspective. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring on-chain metrics, macroeconomic trends, and expert analysis from reputable sources like Glassnode to make informed decisions. Beyond the $111.4K Mark: What Else Signals a Bitcoin Bear Market ? While the $111.4K short-term holder cost basis is a significant indicator, it’s important to remember that a Bitcoin bear market is often a confluence of multiple factors. Relying on a single metric, no matter how powerful, can be misleading. A holistic view is always best. Other crucial signals to monitor include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic conditions, such as persistent inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical instability, can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Declining On-Chain Activity: A consistent drop in transaction counts, active addresses, and overall network usage can indicate reduced interest and utility, signaling a potential slowdown. Technical Breakdown: Breaching major long-term support levels on price charts, coupled with declining trading volumes and the formation of bearish chart patterns (e.g., lower highs and lower lows), are strong technical indicators. Waning Investor Sentiment: A noticeable shift from widespread euphoria and “fear of missing out” (FOMO) to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), or even capitulation, among both retail and institutional investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory pressure or unfavorable policy decisions in major economies can dampen enthusiasm and investment in the crypto space. The $111.4K level identified by Glassnode serves as a critical barometer for the current state of Bitcoin. While not a definitive guarantee, sustained trading below this price point could indeed usher in a challenging period for investors, marking a transition into a Bitcoin bear market . Staying informed, understanding on-chain metrics, and adopting a well-thought-out strategy are paramount for navigating the unpredictable waters of the crypto market.

A1: Glassnode is a leading on-chain analytics platform that provides advanced data and insights into the blockchain, helping investors understand market trends and participant behavior for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Q2: What is the short-term holder cost basis? A2: The short-term holder cost basis is the average price at which Bitcoin holders who have owned their coins for less than 155 days acquired their assets. It represents their collective breakeven point. Q3: How does trading below $111.4K signal a Bitcoin bear market? A3: When Bitcoin’s price consistently trades below the short-term holder cost basis ($111.4K), it means a large number of recent buyers are at an unrealized loss. This often leads to increased selling pressure and can trigger a broader market downturn, characteristic of a Bitcoin bear market . Q4: What should investors do if a Bitcoin bear market occurs? A4: Investors might consider re-evaluating their risk exposure, employing dollar-cost averaging strategies, diversifying their portfolios, and maintaining a long-term perspective. Staying informed through reliable sources is also crucial. Q5: Is the $111.4K level a guaranteed bear market trigger? A5: While the $111.4K level is a strong indicator based on historical data and on-chain analysis, no single metric guarantees a market outcome. It’s best viewed as a significant warning sign that should be considered alongside other macroeconomic and technical factors.

Ripple, Solana, and the emerging Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) are three projects attracting attention, but their millionaire potential differs drastically in both timeframe and probability. Ripple and Solana have proven track records and strong communities, while their market caps hinder exponential development. Currently in presale, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) comes with unrivaled upside due to its low entry fee, innovative blockchain objectives, and enormous early momentum. Let’s break down the numbers. Ripple (XRP): Established But Slower to Multiply Ripple trades around $3.10 per token, with a roughly 59.6 billion XRP circulating supply. This makes it one of the major cryptocurrencies, frequently ranking among the top 10 on CoinMarketCap for value and adoption. Investing $1,000 in XRP now would purchase you around 322 coins. XRP must increase to above $3,100 per coin to hit millionaire status. That is a stunning 1,000× increase, which might take decades at its current scale. Solana (SOL): High Growth, But Still Limited Upside Solana is priced around $247.87 with a circulating supply of about 542 million SOL. Known for its blazing-fast network, Solana has attracted DeFi builders, institutional players, and NFT activity, reinforcing its reputation as a premier Layer-1 blockchain. With $1,000 invested in Solana, you would own just over 4 SOL tokens. Each token would need to surge to $248,000 to reach millionaire status. While theoretically possible, such gains are highly improbable within a single cycle. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Millionaire Potential Little Pepe is a different story. Still in Stage 13 of its presale at $0.0022, the project has already raised over $25.6 million, selling over 15.8 billion tokens. Its entry price gives investors unparalleled leverage compared to established giants like XRP and SOL. A $1,000 investment at today’s presale price would net you around 454,545 LILPEPE tokens. For that stack to become $1,000,000, the token must reach $2.20, a far more attainable leap than the astronomical multiples required by XRP and SOL. Unlike most meme coins, little Pepe is building a Layer-2 blockchain dedicated to meme projects. It promises ultra-low fees, lightning-fast speeds, zero transaction taxes, and anti-sniper bot protections, making it the first blockchain optimized specifically for meme culture. The ecosystem also includes a Meme Launchpad, allowing new meme projects to launch directly on the Little Pepe chain. Combined with listings on two centralized exchanges and a CertiK audit, the fundamentals position $LILPEPE for rapid adoption and massive speculative demand. These incentives have ignited social media buzz, driving more investors into the presale. With every stage, the token price climbs, rewarding early buyers and building anticipation ahead of Little Pepe’s launch on centralized exchanges later this year. Comparing the Timelines to $1 Million For XRP, hitting millionaire status requires a 1,000× surge to $3,100 per token. Even with growing adoption, such growth is unlikely to happen within a decade, let alone this cycle. Solana requires an equally improbable rise to $248,000 per token. Little Pepe, however, just needs to reach $2.20 to transform $1,000 into $1,000,000. In a positive market cycle, fueled by listings, utility deployment, and meme buzz, such a rise may unfold within one to two years, making it the shortest path. Conclusion Ripple and Solana remain strong long-term plays, but their high valuations limit their explosive upside. Still in presale with a tiny market cap, Little Pepe offers a realistic shot at millionaire returns for early adopters with just a $1,000 stake. While high-risk, the low entry price, utility-driven roadmap, and massive community backing make Little Pepe stand out. For investors chasing the next millionaire-maker coin, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is the project that delivers fortunes faster than XRP or SOL.

Stable’s blockchain, built for stablecoin transactions with sub-second finality and low fees, is designed to fix the infrastructure issues that have slowed adoption, the company said. The size of the investment was not disclosed. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They play a major role in cryptocurrency markets, providing among other things a payment infrastructure, and are also used to transfer money internationally. Tether's USDT is the world's largest stablecoin, followed by Circle's (CRCL) USDC. Both companies said the move will unlock new commerce use cases, particularly in emerging markets where dollar-based payments have the biggest impact. With PYUSD now live on Stablechain, the partnership marks a step toward taking stablecoins beyond crypto-native use and into everyday payments and financial products, Stable said.

As a result, $1.7 billion in leveraged positions were wiped out, as 390,029 traders were liquidated. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), were also hammered, recording substantial drops. BTC is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $112,983 after falling to a low of $111,761. According to CoinGlass data, the flagship cryptocurrency lost $287 million during the liquidation event. Bitcoin (BTC) Will Continue To Appreciate As World Enters The Fourth Turning Market analyst Jordi Visser believes Bitcoin (BTC) will continue growing in value and adoption regardless of prevailing macroeconomic conditions as the world heads into a Fourth Turning-style reset. Speaking to Anthony Pompliano, Visser stated that people are losing faith in legacy institutions. The analyst believes this will drive capital to BTC . Visser stated, ""Bitcoin is a trustless thing. It was set up first to deal with the fact that I don't trust the banks. Well, now we're past the banks. I don't trust my employer. I don't trust the government. I don't trust the banks. I don't trust the currency. I don't trust the debt. I don't trust anything, and so, I don't see how you all of a sudden get the trust back.” “Uptober” Rally Under A Cloud Market experts are questioning whether markets will see a rally in October after prices plunged on Monday. Historically, October has been one of the most bullish months for Bitcoin , with the flagship cryptocurrency registering gains in 10 out of 12 Octobers since 2013. Bitcoin has not seen a bearish October since 2018, when it fell just under 4%. The asset’s value rose 48% in October during the 2017 bull market, and 40% in October 2021. Despite BTC’s recent struggles, some analysts are confident “Uptober” will return. Bitcoiner Kyle Chassé stated that the chances of another Federal Reserve rate cut in October are increasing. According to CME futures predictions, there is a 92% chance of a rate cut next month. Another analyst believes markets will drop lower before rebounding in October. “As I’ve been saying for a wee while, $112,500 is the number, and when we get there, we will see the usual suspects calling for rate cuts being bearish and market topping. After we get this over with, it’s on to new highs and the start of the explosive final leg that will push the market into euphoria.” However, some analysts cautioned against over-optimism. Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, stated, “We expect any BTC rallies to be relatively muted given the extremely low implied volatility and upside skews, weakening DAT inflow momentum, and presence of profit takers still looking to sell to cap upside. Longer-term investors will have to be more patient before we expect new ATHs to be reached.” Metaplanet, Strategy Add To Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet and Michael Saylor’s Strategy added to their Bitcoin holdings after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time this year. Japan-listed Metaplanet announced a fresh purchase of 5,419 BTC for $632.53 million, in a move that strengthens its Bitcoin strategy. The firm bought the tokens at an average price of $116,724 per coin. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich announced the purchase in a post on X, stating, “Metaplanet has acquired 5419 BTC for ~$632.53 million at ~$116,724 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 395.1% YTD 2025. As of 9/22/2025, we hold 25,555 acquired for ~$2.71 billion at ~$106,065 per bitcoin.” The latest purchase elevates Metaplanet among the top 5 largest corporate holders of the asset. It is also the company’s largest Bitcoin purchase to date, allowing it to achieve a BTC Yield of 395.1% YTD 2025. Metaplanet initially planned to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. However, the company has revised this figure to 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy also announced its latest Bitcoin purchase. According to the company’s announcement, it purchased 850 BTC for $99.7 million during the week ending Sunday. Strategy purchased at an average price of $117,344 per coin. The latest acquisition takes Strategy’s total holdings to 639,835 BTC , purchased for about $47.3 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a dramatic decline during the ongoing session, plunging to a low of $111,761. However, it has made a slight recovery to reclaim $112,000 and is currently trading around $112,944. BTC has struggled to regain momentum after Friday’s drop, which took the price below $116,000.

Selling pressure has intensified during the ongoing session, thanks to lingering economic uncertainty and optimism around rate cuts offset by future easing.

Ethereum saw over $500 million liquidated, while Bitcoin registered losses of $287 million.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/chinas-securities-regulatory-authority-issues-warning-on-rwa-assets-in-hong-kong-here-are-the-details/,"The China Securities Regulatory Authority (CSRC) has advised several local brokerages to halt their real-world asset (RWA) tokenization activities in Hong Kong. At least two major brokerages have received informal warnings in this regard, according to sources. Chinese Regulator Puts Brakes on RWA Tokenization Activities in Hong Kong RWA tokenization involves converting traditional financial assets like real estate, bonds, or commodities into blockchain-based digital tokens. While this area has attracted interest from institutional investors globally, China has been cautious. Hong Kong has recently been taking steps toward its goal of becoming a leading digital asset hub in Asia. While the territory provides a relatively more liberal environment for crypto exchanges and token-based financial products, mainland China is more cautious, citing financial stability and risk management concerns. According to experts, the CSRC's warning is a reflection of Hong Kong's search for a balance between its digital asset strategy and Beijing's strict regulatory focus. Industry analysts say the temporary restriction on Chinese brokerages raises questions about whether it will limit Hong Kong's appeal to global investors. However, market players are unanimous in their view that in the long term, Hong Kong will not back down from its goal of creating a safe environment for digital assets by clarifying the regulatory framework. *This is not investment advice.

New survey data from June 2025 confirms that families across Europe are spending less, expecting prices to rise, and cutting back on U.S. goods in direct response to the trade war kicked off by the White House earlier this year. The ECB Consumer Expectations Survey shows inflation fears, personal financial stress, and slowing economic growth tied to these tariffs are shaping how people shop, save, and think about the future. Roughly 40% of people in the Eurozone now believe the tariffs are raising inflation. About 13% say their own finances have been hurt, and 24% believe the entire economy will slow down because of the U.S. trade moves. This isn’t speculation. The ECB gathered these numbers after Trump’s April tariff announcement, and they show real shifts in what people expect and how they behave. Consumers in the Eurozone brace for higher inflation and slower growth People who believe the tariffs will fuel inflation have already raised their own forecasts. The survey shows that, compared to January 2025, those individuals now expect inflation to be 0.2 percentage points higher one year out. Their three-year forecast went up 0.13 points, and even their five-year expectations rose by 0.06. That’s a lot for long-term inflation, which usually doesn’t move much. It shows they think this situation isn’t going away fast. On growth, it’s the same story. People who see the tariffs as recession triggers cut their 12-month growth expectations by 0.4 percentage points. That’s double the cut seen from people who don’t think the tariffs will hurt the economy. The ECB says this split shows a clear divide between people who are feeling the pressure and those who aren’t. But either way, the mood is cautious. Spending drops and consumers ditch U.S. goods The reaction isn’t just in forecasts, it’s in wallets. 26% of survey respondents said they’ve already stopped buying American products. 16% said they’ve reduced their overall spending since the tariffs were announced. Richer households are more likely to skip U.S. goods, while lower-income families are tightening up across the board. What’s driving that divide? Financial literacy. People who understand economics more deeply are the ones switching brands. Those with less understanding are just buying less of everything. A big chunk of the spending cuts is hitting non-essential items. The ECB says spending on basic needs, like food and rent, hasn’t changed much. But anything extra? That’s where the squeeze is. When comparing January to April 2025, households that changed their habits after the tariffs slashed their spending more than others. All the damage hit discretionary expenses. Mislav Matejka, strategist at JPMorgan Chase, said this slowdown might not last. “The potential turn up in earnings and buybacks could be one of the supports for the more positive Eurozone stance entering next year, once the current consolidation runs its course,” Matejka wrote in a note to investors. The Eurozone stock market, tracked by the Stoxx 600, is up 9% this year, but that’s still behind the S&P 500’s 13% rise. Profits in the Eurozone are already down 1% this year. Consensus expects Stoxx 600 earnings-per-share to climb 11% in 2026, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. S&P 500 profits are expected to grow about 14% next year, the data show.

A significant development is on the horizon as OKX, a leading global crypto exchange, prepares to list AVNT perpetual futures . This eagerly anticipated event is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. UTC on September 22, marking a new chapter for those looking to expand their trading portfolios. What Exactly Are AVNT Perpetual Futures? For many, the term “perpetual futures” might sound complex, but it’s essentially a type of futures contract without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, which obligate traders to buy or sell an asset by a specific date, perpetual futures allow positions to be held indefinitely. This flexibility is a major draw for many in the crypto space. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions as long as they wish, without the pressure of a looming settlement date. Funding Rates: A unique mechanism called a funding rate ensures the price of the perpetual future stays closely tethered to the spot price of the underlying asset, in this case, AVNT. Leverage Opportunities: These contracts often allow traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This amplifies both potential gains and losses. The listing of AVNT perpetual futures on OKX introduces a dynamic new instrument for speculating on the price movements of AVNT, offering enhanced flexibility and potential for profit. Unleashing Trading Potential with OKX’s AVNT Perpetual Futures The decision by OKX to list AVNT perpetual futures is a testament to the growing demand for diverse trading instruments. For traders, this listing opens up several avenues to capitalize on market movements. OKX is known for its robust trading infrastructure, high liquidity, and a wide array of tools designed for both novice and experienced traders. When you trade AVNT perpetual futures on OKX, you benefit from: Deep Liquidity: Ensuring that trades can be executed quickly and efficiently, even for large orders. Advanced Trading Features: Access to various order types, charting tools, and analytical resources to inform your trading decisions. Security: OKX prioritizes the security of user assets, employing industry-leading measures to protect funds and data. This listing empowers traders to take long or short positions on AVNT, giving them the ability to profit whether they believe the price will rise or fall. It’s a powerful tool for portfolio diversification and strategic market engagement. Navigating the Risks: Important Considerations for AVNT Perpetual Futures While the prospect of trading AVNT perpetual futures is exciting, it is crucial to approach it with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Futures trading, especially with leverage, carries significant potential for both substantial gains and losses. Consider these vital points before diving in: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Sudden price swings can lead to rapid liquidations, particularly when high leverage is employed. Leverage Magnifies Outcomes: While leverage can boost profits, it equally magnifies losses. A small adverse price movement can wipe out an entire margin balance. Funding Rates Impact: Be aware of funding rates, which can either add to or subtract from your position’s profitability, depending on market conditions. Actionable Insight: Always conduct thorough research on AVNT itself. Understand its project fundamentals, market capitalization, community support, and recent news. A well-informed decision is your best defense against unexpected market turns. Are You Ready to Trade AVNT Perpetual Futures Responsibly? Trading AVNT perpetual futures on OKX presents a compelling opportunity, but it demands a disciplined and informed approach. Success in futures trading often hinges on a strong understanding of market dynamics and a robust risk management strategy. Here are some tips for responsible trading: Start Small: Begin with smaller position sizes to familiarize yourself with the market and the platform’s mechanics. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: These are crucial for limiting potential losses by automatically closing a position if the price moves against you beyond a certain point. Never Invest More Than You Can Afford to Lose: This golden rule applies universally in cryptocurrency trading. The upcoming listing of AVNT perpetual futures by OKX is undoubtedly a milestone, offering advanced trading capabilities to its users. By staying informed, managing risks diligently, and continuously learning, traders can position themselves to potentially benefit from this new offering. The listing of AVNT perpetual futures on OKX is a noteworthy event for the crypto trading community.

Rounded bottom breakout on SOL/BTC may retest support before trend continuation resumes. Pantera Capital sees growing interest in Solana as ETF speculation and adoption rise. Rejection at Resistance Sends SOL Lower Solana (SOL) is trading around $223, after falling more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, it has declined by nearly 5%. The move down comes after the price tested the $250 resistance level, which is the same zone that capped it before the previous all-time high. Meanwhile, the weekly chart shows that this level continues to act as strong resistance. Despite the rejection, the longer-term trend remains upward. Analyst Lennaert Snyder commented: $SOL in a nutshell. It perfectly tested key $253 resistance, the last stop before a new ATH. The market dumped, but @solana maintains its strong uptrend. As long as we’re trading above $186 weekly support, the uptrend remains intact. Deeper retests are perfect for longs. pic.twitter.com/Xdg8VTt6rk — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) September 22, 2025 This area had served as resistance before and now holds as the key support in the current market structure. On the 4-hour chart, this zone has acted as a base during earlier consolidation phases. If this level holds, it could open the way for a short move toward $240–$245. Market watcher BitGuru noted : “If this level holds, we may see another bounce toward $240–$245, but a breakdown could send it lower toward $220.” Price action remains uncertain at this level. If it breaks, the next key support sits near $220, an area where buyers previously stepped in during sideways movement. Source: BitGuru/X SOL/BTC Shows Breakout, Retest Still Possible The SOL/BTC chart on the weekly timeframe shows a completed rounded bottom pattern, formed between March and August this year. The breakout above the 0.00185–0.002 BTC range led to a 60% rally, with the price now above 0.0032 BTC. According to analyst Cas Abbé, a retest may be due after the sharp move up. “SOL/BTC could retest its major support zone,” he said, adding that a return to the breakout level would not be unusual after such a move. The support zone has acted as a pivot area before and may be monitored closely in the days ahead. $SOL /$BTC could retest its major support zone. SOL/BTC pumped nearly 60% from its bottom, so a correction is expected. Once that happens, the next rally will start. pic.twitter.com/1ZyWHVsaYF — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) September 22, 2025 In addition, as reported by CryptoPotato , Pantera Capital said that Solana is reaching a major point in its adoption path. The firm pointed to rising attention from fintech firms, developers, and retail users. They also mentioned that institutional exposure to SOL remains low relative to other large-cap assets. Pantera suggested that if a Solana-based ETF is approved, it could lead to stronger institutional inflows. While the timeline is uncertain, the firm described Solana as being well-positioned in its ecosystem and infrastructure.

The company announced this morning that its treasury, valued at $11.4 billion as of Sept. 21, consists of 2,416,054 ETH at $4,497 per token, 192 bitcoin (BTC), $345 million in cash and a $175 million equity stake in Eightco Holdings. BitMine described itself as the world’s largest public holder of ether and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, trailing only Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. (MSTR). BitMine is chaired by Tom Lee, who is also head of research at Fundstrat and chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital. Lee said the company is pursuing what he calls the “alchemy of 5%,” aiming to accumulate 5% of the total ETH supply. “Wall Street and AI moving onto the blockchain should lead to a greater transformation of today’s financial system. And the majority of this is taking place on Ethereum,” Lee said. Raising funds to grow the treasury A few hours later, BitMine announced a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor covering 5.2 million shares of common stock at $70 per share — about 14% above its Sept. 19 close — along with warrants for up to 10.4 million additional shares at $87.50. The offering is expected to raise $365 million in gross proceeds, with the warrants potentially adding another $913 million, bringing total potential proceeds to about $1.28 billion. Lee said the primary use of funds would be to expand BitMine’s ether holdings, calling the premium pricing “materially accretive” to existing shareholders. BitMine added that institutional demand reflected growing interest in ethereum as Wall Street integrates blockchain into financial infrastructure.

Despite a strong rally above $250 earlier in September, market sentiment appears to be shifting, with whale deposits into centralized exchanges hinting at potential headwinds ahead. Most recently, a staggering 312,233 SOL tokens were deposited into Coinbase, fueling concerns that whales may be positioning for significant profit-taking. Solana Whale Deposits Signal Rising Selling Pressure Blockchain tracker Whale Alert reported one of the largest Solana transfers in recent weeks, with 312,233 SOL valued at approximately $75.1 million, moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutional on September 21. The size and timing of this large-scale transfer immediately raised concerns that whales could be positioned to sell. Related Reading: XRP Price At $23, Dogecoin To $2, And Solana At $1,800? Analyst Unveils 2026 Predictions Before this transfer, Whale Alert had flagged another massive transaction of 227,928 SOL, worth around $54.5 million, being funneled into Coinbase on the same day. Together, these two deposits represent more than $129 million in Solana potentially at stake of being sold off. The implications of such moves are significant, as large holders typically send tokens to exchanges with the intention to sell, ultimately adding considerable downward pressure to the market. Notably, Solana’s price rally in September has been fueled by strong demand; however, these recent transfers raise the risk of oversupply, particularly as the token hovers around $224. If whales follow through with the selling, it could cap SOL’s bullish breakout attempt and force the price back to lower support zones. Interestingly, this is not the first time Solana has faced similar whale-driven headwinds this month. Just over a week ago, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported multiple whale dumpings into various crypto exchanges. A wallet tagged “CMJiHu” deposited 96,996 SOL ($17.45 million) into Coinbase, while “5PjMxa” moved 91,890 SOL ($15.98 million) to Kraken. The same day, another wallet “HiN7sS” transferred 37,658 SOL ($6.73 million) to Binance, securing a profit of $1.63 million. These earlier transfers, combined with the latest inflows, show a pattern of whales steadily reducing their exposure as market sentiment shifts. SOL Momentum Weakens Under Heavy Selling Crypto analysts now view Solana as being at a pivotal crossroad, where strong fundamentals clash with mounting selling pressure and technical risks. Market expert Tom Tucker notes that SOL has climbed more than 150% in 2025, but its rally is showing signs of fatigue. The analyst’s chart reveals a rising wedge formation, often a precursor to a breakdown, combined with weakening momentum indicators. Related Reading: Solana price At Risk Of 10% Crash With Descending Broadening Wedge The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is narrowing into a triangle, suggesting indecision, while the MACD has flattened after months of strength. This setup, when paired with heavy whale deposits into exchanges and rising sell pressure, underscores the growing possibility of a short-term pullback. Yet, the outlook is not entirely bearish. Tucker points to optimism surrounding a potential Solana ETF, the upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, and steady treasury accumulation as fundamental drivers that could extend SOL’s long-term growth.

Layer 0, usually referred to as the blockchain of blockchains, serves as the base hardware infrastructure of the blockchain hierarchy. Just above Layer 0 are Layers 1, 2, and 3. Blockchain layers In this guide, we will explore the core functionalities and utility of Layer 1 chains. Let’s get started. What is a layer 1 blockchain? The definition of layer 1 A Layer 1 chain (or “L1”) is the foundational network of a blockchain ecosystem that independently manages transaction execution, data validation, and consensus mechanisms. L1s operate independently from other blockchains and contain several components working together to provide decentralization, security, and usability. Network nodes – Computers worldwide that store blockchain copies and communicate with each other Consensus layer – Rules for how nodes agree on what’s valid (like Bitcoin mining or Ethereum staking) Data layer – Stores the entire blockchain history so that past transactions cannot be changed or tampered with. Transaction layer— This layer handles token transfers and smart contracts to ensure they can only run according to the network’s rules. Application layer – This layer is the interface for decentralized apps (dApps), DeFi platforms, and other blockchain services. Native Tokens – These are the currencies that power the blockchain. Tokens are used to pay transaction fees, reward validators, and facilitate governance participation. Architecture components of layer 1 blockchains Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin are examples of Layer 1 chains, all with their security architecture, native tokens, and consensus mechanisms. How layer 1 differs from layer 2 Layer 1 networks form the foundation, while Layer 2 builds on this foundation to fix limitations such as speed, cost, and efficiency. Here’s how the two compare: Feature Layer 1 (L1) Layer 2 (L2) Dependency Operates independently as the main blockchain Built on top of a Layer 1 network Transaction processing All transactions are processed directly on the main blockchain Transactions are handled off-chain, then batched* and finalized on L1 Speed Slower because all nodes must validate each transaction Much faster with reduced validation requirements Cost Higher fees, especially during peak demand Lower fees due to off-chain processing and efficient batching* Security Secures itself through its own consensus Inherits security from the underlying Layer 1 network Scaling Base protocol changes, such as increased block size or a change in consensus mechanism, can improve scalability Involve the use of off-chain networks or services to improve scalability * Batching means combining many small transactions into one and sending them to the main blockchain as a single entry rather than processing them individually. Why are layer 1s called the base layer Layer 1 chains are called the “base layer” because they serve as the foundational layer for the blockchain ecosystem, upon which other layers and applications are built. L1 chains provide core services such as transaction validation, consensus, and security, and typically do not rely on another underlying network. Core functions of layer 1 chains Transaction validation and security Layer 1 blockchains are the fundamental mechanism for validating and recording transactions directly on the blockchain. Each transaction is rigorously examined for authenticity and legitimacy before it is permanently added to the distributed ledger. This process is essential for preventing fraudulent activities, such as double-spending or manipulating transaction history. Layer 1 blockchains thus establish a secure and trustworthy foundation for decentralized systems. Consensus mechanisms (PoW vs PoS) Every L1 has a consensus mechanism at its core. These mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), define how transactions are validated and agreed upon. For example, Bitcoin uses the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism; miners must attempt to solve a cryptographic problem (mathematical puzzle) to validate a transaction. Ethereum, on the other hand, uses the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism; validators will lock up tokens to validate transactions and secure the network. Native token economics (e.g., ETH, BTC, SOL) Each Layer 1 has a native token that powers its ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) are prime examples. These tokens are used to pay transaction fees, incentivize validators or miners, and maintain network security. They also form the economic foundation for applications built on the blockchain. Smart contract deployment (Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche) Blockchains like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Solana aren’t just built for handling transactions. They support smart contract deployment, which means developers can launch decentralized apps (dApps), DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and other Web3 services right on-chain. These networks have evolved into comprehensive development environments rather than just transaction ledgers. *A smart contract? Think of it as an automated program that executes specific actions on the blockchain when certain conditions are met. Examples of leading layer 1 blockchains Bitcoin – The original layer 1 for payments Bitcoin, launched in 2009, is the first and most widely used Layer 1 blockchain. It was designed as a decentralized digital currency and peer-to-peer payment system without banks or intermediaries. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger and validated by miners using Proof of Work, where miners compete to solve complex puzzles and earn Bitcoin rewards for securing the network. Ethereum – The smart contract pioneer Ethereum revolutionized blockchain by introducing smart contracts, which made it possible to build dApps on-chain. Launched in 2015, Ethereum has become the foundation for DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web3 ecosystems. Ethereum also has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, and has become the world’s second-largest blockchain platform by market capitalization. Solana – High-performance L1 for speed and dApps Solana is designed for high throughput and low-cost transactions, capable of processing thousands of transactions per second. It achieves this using a hybrid model of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH), which provides precise transaction time-ordering. Avalanche – Subnets and custom chains Through its subnet architecture, Avalanche provides a Layer 0 framework, which allows developers and enterprises to launch customizable blockchains tailored for specific use cases. These subnets can have their own governance models and tokens, making Avalanche especially attractive for businesses that need flexibility. With its fast transaction finality (within a few seconds) and low fees, Avalanche has positioned itself as a competitor to Ethereum for both DeFi and enterprise blockchain adoption. Polkadot & Cosmos – Interoperability-focused layer 1s Polkadot and Cosmos have interoperability as their main feature. Polkadot connects specialized blockchains, called parachains, to its main relay chain, allowing them to share security and communicate. Conversely, Cosmos uses the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to link independent blockchains together. Both aim to solve the “silo problem” in blockchain by creating an ecosystem where multiple blockchains can seamlessly interact, trade assets, and share data. The challenges of layer 1 blockchains Scalability and throughput limitations Layer 1 blockchains often struggle to process a high volume of transactions per second (TPS). For example, Bitcoin handles approximately 7 TPS, and Ethereum handles 15–30 TPS on its base layer. Compare this to traditional payment systems like Visa, which processes around 1,700 TPS in regular operations with a peak capacity of 65,000 TPS, and those numbers for L1s are far from what’s needed for global-scale payment systems or mass adoption. Several interventions have emerged to address this challenge, including on-chain (L1) solutions like sharding, hard forks , and consensus mechanism upgrades (like Ethereum’s move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake), as well as off-chain (L2) solutions like rollups, batching, and the Lightning Network. High gas fees and network congestion When network demand increases, transaction costs can become prohibitively expensive. Ethereum users experienced this firsthand during DeFi Summer in 2020 and the NFTs boom of 2021, when simple actions like swapping tokens or buying an NFT could cost $50-200+ in gas fees . These high costs effectively locked out smaller users and drove many to seek alternatives like Binance Smart Chain or newer Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which process transactions more cheaply by building on Ethereum. Security vs decentralization trade-offs Bitcoin and Ethereum maintain security and trust by involving thousands of decentralized participants in consensus, but this slows down transaction speeds. In contrast, Binance Smart Chain offers faster and cheaper transactions but relies on a much smaller validator set (around 21), raising questions about centralization and censorship risk. This small group of validators could collude or be pressured to block specific transactions, making the network vulnerable to centralized control. Energy efficiency and sustainability concerns Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mining now consumes about 187 TWh of electricity per year, roughly equivalent to Thailand’s annual power usage and around 0.6% of global electricity consumption. This has drawn growing criticism from environmental groups and regulators. In response to these concerns, Ethereum completed “The Merge” in 2022, switching from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake and reducing its energy consumption by over 99%. However, this shift has sparked new debates about whether the network is predisposed to increased centralization as a tradeoff for sustainability. With a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, large staking pools could potentially concentrate network control. Layer 1 vs layer 2: Key differences Settlement, security, and finality Layer 1: The base blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) is responsible for validating transactions, maintaining the ledger, and ensuring consensus. Settlement and finality happen directly on-chain, meaning transactions recorded here are considered the ultimate “source of truth.” Layer 2: Built on top of Layer 1, Layer 2 inherits the security and settlement guarantees of the base layer but processes transactions off-chain in small batches. The results are later bundled together and returned to Layer 1 for final settlement. Arbitrum and Optimism execute thousands of transactions off-chain, but results are periodically settled on the Ethereum mainnet. Cost and speed of transactions Layer 1: Limited block space means high demand leads to higher fees and slower confirmations. For instance, gas fees soar during NFTs or DeFi activity spikes on Ethereum, making small transactions impractical. Layer 2: By handling transactions off-chain or batching them together, L2s reduce costs dramatically and speed up processing. Instead of competing directly for L1 block space, users benefit from aggregated settlements. A swap that might cost $30+ in gas on Ethereum Layer 1 can cost under $1 on Arbitrum. Similarly, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network enables instant, near-zero-fee payments compared to the slower, more expensive base Bitcoin chain. Examples of L1/L2 pairings (Ethereum + Arbitrum/Optimism, Bitcoin + Lightning Network) Ethereum + Arbitrum/Optimism: Ethereum is providing security and settlement. Arbitrum and Optimism (rollups) provide scalability by executing the transactions off of the chain and then settling back to Ethereum. Bitcoin + Lightning Network: Bitcoin offers secure, immutable settlement, and the Lightning Network enables fast, off-chain micropayments, which can be used for day-to-day things like tipping or a retail payment. Polygon (PoS Chain) + Ethereum: Polygon offers faster, cheaper transactions with bridges to Ethereum, making it a hybrid Layer 2/sidechain scaling solution. The future of layer 1 chains Ethereum’s roadmap and sharding Ethereum initially planned to use sharding, splitting the blockchain into smaller parallel chains to boost transaction speed. However, this approach was dropped when Layer 2 rollups (solutions that process transactions off-chain) proved more effective for scaling. Instead, Ethereum adopted a rollup-centric strategy. The goal is to make Ethereum the most secure base layer while providing cheap data storage for rollups. This new approach is called danksharding – it doesn’t split Ethereum into transaction-processing shards, but increases how much rollup data the network can handle efficiently. The first step, proto-danksharding (EIP-4844), launched on March 13, 2024, with the Dencun upgrade. It introduced “blobs” – a cheaper way to store rollup data, which has already cut Layer 2 fees by 10-100x. Over time, Ethereum will expand blob capacity and fully implement danksharding, targeting over 100,000 transactions per second through rollups while maintaining decentralization and security. Growth of multi-chain ecosystems The blockchain space is shifting toward specialized networks instead of relying on one chain to do everything. Bitcoin acts as digital gold for institutions. Ethereum leads DeFi with over $90 billion total value locked (TVL), Solana powers fast-paced gaming and NFTs, and Avalanche attracts enterprises with customizable subnets. Major protocols such as Aave and Uniswap are no longer limited to a single blockchain. Instead, they run on several networks simultaneously, allowing users to choose where to interact. On Polygon, they benefit from low fees; on Solana, they get faster execution; and on Ethereum, they gain maximum security and decentralization. In practice, a user might store wealth on Bitcoin, earn yields on Ethereum, and play games on Solana, all within the same ecosystem. This creates a stronger, more efficient blockchain economy rather than forcing one network to simultaneously handle security, scalability, and low cost. Role of interoperability (Cross-chain bridges, IBC) As various blockchains specialize in various functions, users need methods of moving their assets and data across blockchains. Cross-chain bridges serve as digital highways connecting multiple blockchain networks. With a cross-chain bridge, users can transfer tokens from a more expensive blockchain like Ethereum to cheaper blockchains like Polygon or faster blockchains like Solana and back when desired. Some of the popular bridges are Polygon’s PoS Bridge which provides Ethereum to Polygon transfers, while protocols like Cosmos’s Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) connect dozens of blockchains and create an ecosystem with a primary focus. There are also services like LayerZero and Wormhole which provide cross-chain bridge services across a variety of networks. However, these bridges have a major problem: they’re prime targets for hackers because they hold large amounts of cryptocurrency. Major attacks like the Ronin Bridge ($625M stolen) and Wormhole ($320M stolen) show that bridge security is still developing. Despite these risks, bridges remain essential for users who want to utilize different blockchain strengths. Institutional adoption of layer 1 networks Bitcoin remains the most deeply adopted Layer 1 among institutions. Corporations like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Metaplanet, and MARA Holdings hold significant amounts of Bitcoin in their treasuries, treating it as “digital gold” and a hedge against inflation. Ethereum has also shown strong institutional momentum. Public companies hold nearly 966,000 ETH, valued at approximately $3.5 billion.

The company is being blamed for a design flaw that has made its latest flagship products a “scratch magnet.” Technology blogger Zack Nelson, known through his JerryRigEverything YouTube channel, posted a video showing how little resistance the iPhone 17 Pro models have against scratches and scuffs. “The anodized aluminium does not stick to corners very well,” Nelson explained, adding that Apple knowingly accepted this tradeoff. The electrochemical anodizing process cannot cover sharp edges, but the company’s choice not to round them has left devices exposed. “That decision to look cool out of the box is going to plague everyone who owns this phone down the road,” he surmised. Scratchgate was seen on iPhone 17 demo phones During launch week, Bloomberg reported that demo units displayed in Apple stores had already shown scratches and scuffs after only a few hours. Deep blue iPhone 17 Pro models and the black iPhone Air appeared to be the most prone to visible damage. iPhone 17 Pro durability test by Zack Nelson. Source: JerryRigEverything YouTube channel The anodization process finishes the iPhone’s aluminum frame with a hard oxide layer rated 9 out of 10 on the Mohs hardness scale. This layer might resist most environmental wear, but cannot be applied uniformly on sharp edges. According to the DIN industrial standard, Apple could have avoided the problem by adding a subtle radius or chamfer to the camera plateau’s corners, making the edges as scratch-resistant as the rest of the device. On the JerryRigEverything test video , everyday objects like keys or coins scraped off the thin oxide layer. Marks elsewhere on the phone from scratches can be wiped clean, but those on the plateau edges remove the protective coating permanently unless a case shields the device from the outset. Hardware durability is not the only problem troubling Apple’s new phones. CNN’s Henry Casey reported that the iPhone 17 camera software produces a black square on images under certain lighting conditions. Apple confirmed the bug, stating it can occur when an extremely bright LED light shines directly into the camera. The company said it is working on a fix to be released in an upcoming software update, though no timeline has been given. iOS 26 drains batteries at record pace Alongside the new iPhones, Apple released its latest operating system update, iOS 26, initially announced at June’s Worldwide Developer Conference. But the rollout has been met with backlash from users who say the update is draining their phone’s battery life. “Just fully charged my phone 58 minutes ago and it’s already down to 79%,” one customer complained on X, alongside thousands of posts bashing Apple, claiming devices now die within hours of use. Among other polarizing changes is the new lock screen clock feature, which activates automatically when the phone is placed sideways in low light. The design shows a large red clock against a black background, a look some have described as “scary” or “evil.” The update also comes with a “Liquid Glass” design, which makes icons, menus, and pop-ups appear translucent enough to look like frosted glass. While intended to create a dynamic visual effect, naysayers say it makes the interface confusing and unpleasant to use. “Liquid glass is a cool effect, but it makes the user experience actively worse. This is a hostile design,” Daniel Shteremberg, founder of the Spiral app, wrote on X after using the update for a week. “I’m the biggest Apple fanboy ever, and even I think they’ve lost their way.” The iPhone 17 line is also still being mocked over its aesthetics and has been labelled “ugly.” The Apple smartphone debuted in the United States at a starting price of $799 for the base model, while the iPhone 17 Pro began at $1,099.

Certain metrics now suggest buyers’ confidence is diminishing. In fact, Alphractal founder and CEO Joao Wedson believes that Bitcoin appears to be flashing unmistakable signs of cycle exhaustion. He warned that this is what most market participants are failing to recognize. Profitability Drying Up In his latest analysis on X, Wedson flagged the SOPR Trend Signal, a reliable indicator of blockchain profitability, which now indicates that investor gains are drying up. He stressed that never before in Bitcoin’s history have investors accumulated BTC so late and at such elevated prices. The Short-Term Holder (STH) Realized Price is currently hovering around $111,400, and serves as a critical benchmark for institutions that ideally should have built positions at much lower levels. To top that, Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio is notably weaker than in 2024, which depicts a deteriorating risk-to-return profile and limited profit potential. As such, these are some of the factors that may dampen institutional appetite despite the allure of new all-time highs. Social interest, meanwhile, has fallen sharply, and the crypto analyst predicted that attention will only rebound because of altcoins rather than Bitcoin. According to him, market makers are already rotating capital by partially selling BTC and redirecting stablecoin reserves toward altcoins after a continued period of accumulation. While Bitcoin may still climb to fresh records, Wedson argues that its profitability will remain lackluster compared to the compelling opportunities emerging across the altcoin market. He pointed out that early 2022 buyers are enjoying 600% gains, but those accumulating now face a dramatically different landscape. Declaring 2025 an active Altcoin Season, Wedson urged investors to shift focus and emphasized that many altcoins currently boast far more attractive on-chain metrics and risk-reward profiles than Bitcoin. Exchange Inflows Surge During the September 7-15 rally, CryptoQuant found that outflows exceeded inflows, which supported the then-bullish momentum. Large BTC outflows, such as nearly 65K leaving exchanges at the end of August and early September, typically indicate accumulation in personal wallets and reduced immediate selling, which often coincides with price recoveries. However, heightened selling activity was observed around September 17-19, as inflows spiked to nearly 40K BTC, which pushed BTC down from $117K to $112K. Following September 20, outflows weakened even further, meaning more coins remained on exchanges and selling pressure dominated. Currently, inflows remain high while outflows are weak, which means that short-term downside risk persists. If outflows resume, accumulation could fuel a strong rebound from the current level; otherwise, further declines remain possible.

Sources report that institutional capital, DeFi growth, and upcoming network upgrades are pushing SOL toward new highs, while ambitious new players in the PayFi space are capturing investor imagination. Meanwhile, a young altcoin, Remittix , is breaking through the noise: a PayFi token whose live wallet beta and exchange listings have ignited whale activity. That project is showing real promise in terms of utility, security, and community engagement. Solana Price Prediction: Institutional Pressure and Resistance Breaks Solana (SOL) continues to benefit from growing institutional adoption and technical strength. Analysts have raised Solana’s price targets for late 2025 into 2026, citing increasing DeFi TVL, network throughput improvements, and rumors around ETF approvals. At present, SOL is trading in the $220-$250 range after breaking through some earlier resistance. Some forecasts believe that if SOL can decisively clear resistance near $239-$250, it could push toward $270 . More bullish analysts believe a move up toward $400 is possible under strong momentum and favorable macro conditions. However, caution remains. Analysts warn that while SOL’s fundamentals are strong, its large market cap and prior periods of high volatility mean that explosive gains are less likely compared to smaller, utility-driven altcoins. Remittix (RTX): The Altcoin Poised for Real Utility and Growth Remittix (RTX) is a PayFi project built for real world payments, not just speculation. Its system allows crypto transfers directly into bank accounts in over 30 countries. It supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, and has real-time foreign exchange conversion with very low fees. Its wallet beta is now live, with members of the community testing it. It also has strong security credentials: the team is verified by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms. Centralized exchange (CEX) listings are confirmed on BitMart and LBank. Additionally, there is a referral reward system: users who refer someone to Remittix get a 15% bonus paid in USDT directly to their wallet. That boosts early adoption and helps build community. Why Remittix Is Attracting Whales & Traders Utility-first token powering real transaction volume Security First: Audited by CertiK, one of the top blockchain security firms Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Built for borderless payments with global reach Why Buying Remittix Now Makes Sense We’re not talking only hype. Remittix shows signs of real world change. Its verified audit by CertiK gives confidence. The live beta wallet is real. Exchange listings on BitMart and LBank are in place. The referral reward system (15% bonus in USDT) adds momentum. And there’s a $250,000 giveaway going on now. For people seeking the next big altcoin in 2025, and looking beyond large caps for maximum growth, Remittix is one of the top projects to buy now.

Vivo and Oppo will launch the first phones with MediaTek’s new chip in October in Europe, South America, and Asia. However, no release date for the US has been given yet. The new Dimensity 9500 is a big step up from last year’s Dimensity 9400. MediaTek says the new CPU delivers 29% higher single-core and 16% higher multi-core scores while using 37% less power. Transition to Universal Flash Storage 4.1 from UFS 4.0 results in 2x read and write speeds. According to the company, this cuts large AI model loading times by 40%. The chip keeps a familiar layout, but updates the cores to Arm’s renamed C1 series. The CPU cluster pairs one Arm C1-Ultra clocked at 4.21 GHz with three Arm C1-Premium cores at 3.5 GHz and four Arm C1-Pro cores at 2.7 GHz. The graphics capabilities have also increased significantly. MediaTek reports a 33% bump in GPU performance and a 42% gain in energy efficiency. The company says that this should help phones last longer during gaming sessions. MediaTek added that ray tracing performance has doubled, enabling more realistic reflections and shadows. With ray tracing on, the chip can render up to 120 frames per second. It supports modern game technologies, including Vulkan 1.4 and Unreal Engine 5.6. MediaTek’s new chip is highly focused on AI The Dimensity 9500’s NPU 990 is billed as 100% faster on the smaller, 3-billion-parameter models often used on phones, which typically top out around 7 billion parameters. MediaTek also claims a 42% power-efficiency improvement when running these small AI models. The chip is described as the first in the industry to generate 4K images using AI. For large language models, MediaTek says the Dimensity 9500 is the first mobile platform to support BitNet 1-bit, a technique the company links to 50% lower power use when running LLMs. Together, these steps are aimed at making more AI features practical to run on the device rather than the cloud. Camera features see upgrades, too. The image pipeline adds support for 4K portrait video at 60 frames per second. For slow motion, the chip can handle 4K at 120 FPS, with Dolby Vision video and optical stabilization. As with its predecessor, the platform supports camera sensors up to 200 megapixels, keeping headroom for high-resolution photography. Connectivity improvements include 5CC carrier aggregation, which MediaTek says increases bandwidth by 15% compared with the prior generation. That, combined with the efficiency gains in CPU and GPU subsystems, is meant to help phones sustain high data rates and performance without quick battery drain. TSMC to raise prices for 3nm Chips, affecting MediaTek and Qualcomm Another storyline could shape how these chips reach the market. All next-generation premium phone processors–including Apple’s A19 series, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and MediaTek’s Dimensity 9500–are expected to use TSMC’s advanced N3P 3nm process. A report from China says TSMC has raised prices for this technology, which could put extra pressure on Android chipmakers’ costs. According to a report by the China Times, TSMC increases N3P pricing by about 20% compared with the previous generation. This cycle, MediaTek would face 24% extra costs for the Dimensity 9500. On the other hand, Qualcomm will face an increase of 16 percent for its Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. The impact on Apple, however, has not yet been cited. As TSMC’s largest customer, projected to account for 22% to 25% of the foundry’s total revenue by 2026, Apple may have secured more favorable terms, which would give it a cost advantage over rivals using the same node.

The memecoin opened near $0.2659 before sliding steadily through the evening and plunging overnight. By midday, DOGE had dropped to $0.2386, reflecting a 10.57% loss on the day. Despite the decline, trading activity surged. Dogecoin posted $4.76 billion in 24-hour volume, a jump of more than 180%. The spike in activity suggests traders remain highly engaged even as the token battles short-term weakness. Analysts Eye $2.28 to $5.30 Upside for DOGE Analyst @JavonTM1 highlighted Dogecoin’s performance across its two previous market cycles. Each cycle displayed progressively stronger upward momentum, supported by Fibonacci extensions and broader market behavior. Based on this analysis, Dogecoin could stage a rally of more than 730%. That would push prices toward $2.28 in the next bullish leg. If the cycle extends further, projections suggest DOGE could climb above $5.30. Such a move would represent nearly a 20-fold increase from its current range. These forecasts underline Dogecoin’s cyclical strength and resilience after sharp corrections. Investors now face the challenge of weighing immediate selling pressure against the possibility of historic long-term gains. Institutional Momentum Grows Around Dogecoin ETFs Institutional interest is also building. Rex-Osprey’s standard DOGE ETF debuted Thursday , generating about $17 million in first-day trading volume. According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, that figure ranked among the top five ETF launches this year. Meanwhile, Grayscale has advanced its own efforts. The firm filed an amended S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The update confirmed Coinbase as both prime broker and custodian for the proposed Dogecoin fund. If approved, the ETF will trade on NYSE Arca under the ticker GDOG. Approval would represent a major milestone for Dogecoin, opening access to a wider base of institutional and retail investors. Dogecoin Faces Bearish Pressure with $0.2320 Target Technically, Dogecoin remains under strain towards the downward direction. The Relative Strength Index is between 39 and 42, which is an indication of almost over sold. This level implies a decrease in momentum but the probability of a short-term recovery is also present. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence is negative with the signal line less than zero. This implies that the bearish momentum is still prevailing over the short run price movements. Provided that selling pressure is maintained, DOGE may challenge support levels between $0.2320 and $0.2300. The most probable short term target would be the zone of $0.2320 unless there is a change in momentum and this makes the range of about $0.2320 to $0.2500 the most probable short term target.",News|Memecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-09-22 16:00:49

Yet history shows that the most profitable opportunities usually emerge in these very moments of uncertainty. While retail sentiment leaned toward fear in the latest dip, one trader demonstrated a contrasting mindset — treating the sell-off as a chance to strengthen his position. Bale’s Bold XRP Accumulation XRP commentator Bale took to X to reveal that he had purchased 80,000 XRP “like it was nothing on a Monday morning.” Bale, known within the community for outspoken takes and frequent XRP discussions, emphasized calm and composure over panic, effectively using the downturn to position himself for potential upside. At the time of his purchase, XRP was trading at $2.816, valuing the acquisition at $225,280. This size of buy underscores a level of confidence in XRP’s long-term potential and sends a signal of resilience to retail investors unnerved by market volatility. The whole market is down and you are panicking. Stop panicking. I just bought 80,000 XRP like it was nothing on a Monday morning. Lock in pic.twitter.com/dAaBIxL5aS — BALE (@AltcoinBale) September 22, 2025 The Broader Market Context Bale’s move came amid a sharp pullback across the digital asset market . Major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, faced downward pressure as liquidations surged, pushing XRP into the red alongside the broader market. Analysts attributed the drop to a combination of macroeconomic jitters and cascading leverage unwind across exchanges. While many investors saw red screens as a cue to retreat, Bale framed the same event as an opportunity to enter at more favorable levels. Such conviction buying during downturns often sets the stage for stronger positioning once markets recover. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Means for XRP Holders Large and public accumulations, like Bale’s, often have an outsized effect on community sentiment. They act as a counterweight to panic-driven narratives, reinforcing the case for disciplined holding or gradual accumulation strategies. However, it is essential to note that such actions reflect personal conviction rather than guarantees of market direction. For XRP holders, the key takeaway lies not in mirroring Bale’s purchase but in understanding the principle behind it: composure in downturns can create room for strategic accumulation, provided it aligns with risk tolerance and portfolio structure. Final Thoughts Bale’s decision to acquire 80,000 XRP during a market dip highlights the difference between trading from fear and trading with conviction. His move illustrates that successful strategies often involve seeing opportunity where others see risk. For everyday holders, the lesson is clear — volatility is part of the crypto landscape, and how one responds to it can make all the difference. Rather than panicking in the face of downturns , adopting a disciplined plan, managing risk, and keeping a long-term perspective can turn market fear into a strategic advantage.

It recently announced a major plan to buy back 50 million LayerZero ZRO tokens from its early investors. This substantial move, initially reported by Unfolded, represents a considerable 5% of the token’s total supply. For many in the crypto community, this raises an important question: what exactly does this strategic buyback signify for the future of LayerZero ZRO and its ecosystem? Why is LayerZero ZRO Initiating This Massive Buyback? A token buyback is a strategic financial maneuver often employed by companies to reduce the number of outstanding tokens or shares in the market. In the context of LayerZero ZRO , this action serves several key purposes. Firstly, it demonstrates a strong vote of confidence from the LayerZero Foundation in its own project and its long-term viability. By reducing the circulating supply, the Foundation aims to create a more stable and potentially valuable asset for its community. Moreover, buybacks can signal to the market that the Foundation believes the token is undervalued. This particular buyback involves early investors, which suggests a desire to consolidate a significant portion of the supply. This can help to: Reduce selling pressure: With fewer tokens held by early investors who might be looking to cash out, the market could experience less downward pressure. Align interests: It helps align the interests of the Foundation with the broader community of LayerZero ZRO holders. Signal strength: It projects an image of financial health and strategic planning. The decision to repurchase such a large amount, 5% of the total supply, highlights the Foundation’s commitment to actively managing the token’s economic model and fostering a robust ecosystem. What Does This Mean for Current LayerZero ZRO Holders? For existing holders of LayerZero ZRO , this buyback could bring several potential benefits. A reduction in the circulating supply, all else being equal, typically leads to an increase in scarcity. Increased scarcity can, in turn, contribute to a higher token value over time. While market dynamics are complex and no guarantees exist, a buyback often creates a positive sentiment around the asset. Investors often view buybacks as a bullish signal because they suggest that the project is not only financially stable but also actively working to enhance token value. This strategic move could potentially: Boost investor confidence: It reassures current holders and attracts new ones, knowing the Foundation is invested in the token’s success. Improve market stability: By reducing potential large-scale selling from early participants, the market for LayerZero ZRO might become more predictable. Support future growth: A stronger token economy provides a better foundation for the LayerZero protocol’s ongoing development and adoption across various blockchains. It is important for holders to monitor the execution of this buyback and its subsequent effects on market liquidity and price action. However, the initial reaction from many analysts suggests a positive outlook for the LayerZero ZRO token. How Does This Impact the Broader LayerZero Ecosystem? The LayerZero protocol is a crucial omnichain interoperability layer, designed to connect various blockchains seamlessly. This buyback of LayerZero ZRO tokens extends beyond just price implications; it also strengthens the overall health and perception of the LayerZero ecosystem. A more stable and valuable token can directly support the protocol’s development efforts, community incentives, and strategic partnerships. When the core asset of a decentralized network gains strength, it often leads to increased participation and innovation within that network. Developers might feel more confident building on a platform with a robust token economy, and users might be more inclined to engage with its services. This move underscores the Foundation’s long-term vision for LayerZero to become a cornerstone of the multi-chain future. Furthermore, by managing its token supply effectively, the LayerZero Foundation is setting a precedent for responsible tokenomics. This can enhance its reputation within the competitive blockchain space, attracting more talent and capital to its mission of creating a unified blockchain experience. Conclusion: A Bold Step for LayerZero ZRO’s Future The LayerZero Foundation’s decision to buy back 50 million LayerZero ZRO tokens is a significant and strategic maneuver. It reflects a deep commitment to the project’s long-term success, aiming to enhance token scarcity, boost investor confidence, and strengthen the overall ecosystem. While the full impact will unfold over time, this bold move signals a proactive approach to tokenomics and a clear vision for the future of omnichain interoperability. This buyback could pave the way for a more stable and robust market for LayerZero ZRO , reinforcing its position as a key player in the evolving blockchain landscape. The community will undoubtedly watch closely as LayerZero executes this plan, eager to see the positive ripple effects across its expansive network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the purpose of the LayerZero ZRO token buyback? The buyback aims to reduce the circulating supply of LayerZero ZRO tokens, signal confidence in the project’s future, potentially increase token scarcity, and align the interests of the Foundation with its community. How many ZRO tokens are being bought back? The LayerZero Foundation plans to buy back 50 million LayerZero ZRO tokens, which constitutes 5% of the token’s total supply. Who are the early investors involved in the buyback? The buyback targets early investors of the LayerZero ZRO token. Specific names of these investors have not been publicly disclosed. What potential impact could this buyback have on the ZRO token price? A buyback can potentially lead to increased scarcity and positive market sentiment, which could contribute to an increase in the LayerZero ZRO token’s value. However, market prices are influenced by many factors and are never guaranteed. Is a token buyback common in the crypto space? Yes, token buybacks are a relatively common strategy in the cryptocurrency space, similar to stock buybacks in traditional finance. Projects use them to manage token supply, enhance value, and signal confidence. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

Despite the decline, trading activity spiked, with volume surging 128% to $351 million. The token’s market capitalization now sits at $7.15 billion, highlighting a market still buzzing with trader interest. Shiba Inu Loses September Gains After $2.4M Bridge Exploit The latest retracement has erased all of SHIB’s early September progress. The token had touched an intra-month high of $0.00001484 but has now dipped below its monthly opening price of $0.00001219. This sharp fall underscores the renewed bearish pressure that continues to weigh on the token’s outlook. Market watchers point to ecosystem setbacks as a trigger for the recent weakness. A $2.4 million flash loan exploit hit the Shibarium bridge on September 12. Blockchain security firm PeckShield first flagged the incident, noting suspicious activity in the bridge contract. Although the Shiba Inu team offered a 50 ETH bounty to resolve the issue, progress has remained limited. The attack dented investor confidence and contributed to selling pressure across the token’s market. Shiba Inu Nears Breakout as Analysts Eye $0.00001800 Despite recent setbacks, analysts are now focusing on a crucial resistance area that has capped gains for several months. SHIB Price is currently testing a descending trend line. A confirmed breakout above this level could alter sentiment and spark bullish momentum. Analyst suggest that a move past this barrier could push SHIB toward the $0.00001400 to $0.00001800 range. Traders believe such a rally would mark the start of a more sustainable bullish phase. Can Shiba Inu Break Above $0.00001280 Resistance? Momentum indicators are also being monitored closely. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows early signs of convergence, hinting at a potential bullish crossover. If confirmed, SHIB could soon retest resistance levels near $0.00001250 to $0.00001280. Analysts note that a decisive breakout above $0.00001280 may open the path toward $0.00001320.

Valued at approximately $144 million at the time of the move, this activity, reported by AmberCN, signals potentially crucial developments within the Worldcoin ecosystem. This isn’t just a simple transfer; it involved a strategic cross-chain movement and a deposit to a major exchange, sparking discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike about the future trajectory of Worldcoin WLD . What Exactly Happened with the Worldcoin WLD Transfer? Roughly 30 minutes before the report surfaced, the Worldcoin team initiated a two-pronged transfer of its native WLD tokens. Understanding these movements is key to grasping their potential impact. Firstly, a substantial 85 million WLD was moved across chains to World Chain, a blockchain integral to the Worldcoin project’s vision. Secondly, another 25 million WLD found its way to the Kraken exchange, a well-known platform for cryptocurrency trading. These large-scale transfers are not uncommon in the crypto space. However, the specific destinations and the sheer volume involved in this Worldcoin WLD transaction make it particularly noteworthy. It prompts questions about the underlying strategies and future plans the Worldcoin team might be enacting. Why is World Chain Important for Worldcoin WLD? The transfer of 85 million Worldcoin WLD to World Chain is a pivotal detail. World Chain is designed to be a scalable and privacy-preserving blockchain, aiming to support Worldcoin’s ambitious goal of creating a global identity and financial network. Moving such a significant portion of WLD to this specific chain suggests a strong commitment to its development and adoption. Boosting Liquidity: This influx of WLD could be intended to enhance liquidity within the World Chain ecosystem, making it easier for users to transact and participate. Ecosystem Development: It might also be earmarked for various ecosystem development initiatives, such as grants for developers building on World Chain or incentives for early adopters. Strategic Positioning: The move could strategically position WLD as a core asset for future applications and services built directly on World Chain. Therefore, this cross-chain transfer is more than just a movement of funds; it’s a strategic declaration of intent regarding World Chain’s role in the broader Worldcoin vision. What Does the Kraken Deposit Mean for Worldcoin WLD? Simultaneously, the deposit of 25 million Worldcoin WLD to the Kraken exchange presents a different set of implications. Exchanges like Kraken serve multiple purposes, from facilitating trading to providing liquidity for institutional and retail investors. This specific deposit could have several reasons: Increased Liquidity: Depositing tokens to an exchange can increase the available supply for trading, potentially improving market depth and reducing price volatility for WLD. Operational Funding: The team might be preparing to liquidate a portion of these tokens to fund ongoing operational costs, development expenses, or marketing initiatives. Partnership or Listing Preparations: While speculative, such deposits sometimes precede new partnership announcements or even expanded listing opportunities, though this is less common for already listed assets. It is important to note that a deposit to an exchange does not automatically mean an immediate sell-off. However, it does provide the team with the option to sell, which could, depending on market conditions, introduce selling pressure on the Worldcoin WLD token. Navigating the Market Impact of Large WLD Movements Large transfers of any cryptocurrency, especially those from project teams, often draw significant attention from the market. Traders and investors closely monitor such movements, attempting to decipher their potential impact on price. For Worldcoin WLD , the $144 million valuation of this transfer highlights its scale. While the long-term implications are yet to unfold, the immediate market reaction can vary. Some might view the World Chain transfer as bullish, signaling development and adoption, while the Kraken deposit could be seen as potentially bearish, due to the possibility of increased supply on the market. Understanding these nuances is crucial for anyone following the project. In conclusion, the recent 110 million Worldcoin WLD transfer is a multi-faceted event. It underscores the team’s ongoing commitment to developing its ecosystem, particularly World Chain, while also providing operational flexibility through the Kraken deposit. As the Worldcoin project continues to evolve, such strategic movements will undoubtedly remain a key indicator of its progress and direction. Investors and enthusiasts should stay informed, observing how these foundational transfers contribute to the project’s broader goals and market dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions About Worldcoin WLD Transfers Here are some common questions regarding the recent Worldcoin WLD movements: Q1: What was the total value of the recent Worldcoin WLD transfer? A1: The Worldcoin team transferred 110 million WLD tokens, valued at approximately $144 million at the time of the transaction. Q2: Where were the 110 million Worldcoin WLD tokens transferred? A2: The transfer involved two main destinations: 85 million WLD were moved cross-chain to World Chain, and 25 million WLD were deposited to the Kraken exchange. Q3: What is the significance of moving WLD to World Chain? A3: Moving a large amount of Worldcoin WLD to World Chain likely aims to boost liquidity within its ecosystem, support development initiatives, and strategically position WLD as a core asset for future applications on the chain.

52107122,https://timestabloid.com/?p=84051,1758560427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"September’s Top Crypto Moves: HBAR Aims for $0.30, SOL Faces $255 Resistance, BlockDAG Ships Miners in Over 130 Countries!",https://timestabloid.com/resistance-blockdag-ships-miners-in-over-130-countries/,"When you look at Hedera’s (HBAR) price forecast, the picture often feels incomplete. The project has partnerships and enterprise traction, but its price momentum keeps getting stuck at resistance levels. A look at Solana (SOL) price analysis shows strength in tech and speed, yet selling pressure from long-term holders and repeated blockages near $250 limit upside. So the question is, why stick with projects that need perfect conditions to move forward when another chain is already proving itself on the ground? BlockDAG has rolled out 20,000 X-Series miners across more than 130 countries, with 2,000 new units shipping every week. That’s physical infrastructure live today, not a future promise. For anyone tracking top crypto performers, this combination of global deployment and real-time mining is why BlockDAG stands apart from the usual forecasts and price debates. Why BlockDAG’s Mining Network Changes the Game! BlockDAG has done something most projects only talk about: putting thousands of miners into the hands of real users. More than 20,000 X-Series units are already live across 130+ countries, with another 2,000 being shipped out every single week. That means the network is being powered by physical hardware spread worldwide, giving it a reach and resilience few presales can claim. Instead of waiting on promises of decentralization, BlockDAG is proving it now by turning buyers into direct contributors to network security and validation. This level of infrastructure rollout builds a moat that separates BlockDAG from typical token launches. For many presales, adoption starts and ends with wallets holding coins. Here, adoption is measured in plugged-in machines and real-time hashing power. It’s a strategy that creates credibility and positions BlockDAG among the top crypto performers not just for speculation, but for how the chain is built and scaled from day one. The presale itself adds fuel to that momentum. With over $410 million raised, 312,000+ holders onboarded, and $40 million flowing in just the past month, demand is clear. Early buyers have already seen gains with the coin price at $0.0016 for a limited time and set for a $0.05 launch. The ROI math makes the upside hard to ignore, especially with a roadmap that ties presale funding directly into expanding infrastructure and community growth. For investors scanning the market for the next big run, BlockDAG combines tangible hardware deployment with strong presale performance. That mix makes it one of the leading top crypto performers, standing out from coins that only rely on charts and predictions to drive interest. HBAR Eyes $0.30 With Strong Support The current Hedera (HBAR) price forecast places the token in the $0.24–$0.25 range, with resistance levels close to $0.25 and support near $0.23. Analysts see short-term potential for HBAR to reach $0.30–$0.33 if it can push through resistance, while mid-term projections extend toward $0.40. On the downside, slipping below support could drag it back to $0.22. This balance of risk and upside is why traders keep HBAR within the list of top crypto performers, even if price progress has been slower than its enterprise traction might suggest. The strong network partnerships continue to give the project weight in market discussions. Looking further ahead, extended hedera (HBAR) price forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could test $0.75, with some long-range models even hinting at levels above $2 in bullish conditions. For investors comparing choices for the best crypto to buy, HBAR provides an interesting mix of steady enterprise adoption and the chance to break into higher ranges if demand builds. It may not always move quickly, but its combination of real-world use and consistent forecasts keeps it in the conversation as one of the leading top crypto performers with room for growth. Solana Struggles at $250 Resistance The latest Solana (SOL) price analysis shows the token trading between $235 and $250, with resistance building near $255 and a support floor at $230. Indicators like a bullish MACD crossover and a positive Chaikin Money Flow point to buyer inflows, but price action has struggled to push beyond the $250 mark. Analysts suggest that if SOL can hold above $230 and secure a breakout past $255, short-term targets of $270–$300 are realistic. Failure to clear that level, however, could see pressure drag the price back toward $220. This makes it a closely watched case among top crypto performers, especially for traders eyeing near-term gains. Looking forward, broader forecasts for late 2025 put Solana in contention for $300–$400 levels, provided market sentiment remains constructive. Such scenarios keep it in the mix as one of the leading top crypto performers, even if progress requires consistent demand from institutions and ecosystem activity. For those comparing options for the best crypto to buy, Solana remains attractive because of its speed, active development, and deep liquidity. Still, the variation of Solana (SOL) price analyses makes it clear that breaking resistance will be key to unlocking the next growth phase. Final Thoughts The latest Hedera (HBAR) price forecast shows the token testing resistance near $0.25, with upside targets around $0.30–$0.33 if momentum builds. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) price analysis highlights its current range between $235 and $250, with bullish potential if it can break past $255. Both remain important players among the top crypto performers, though each depends heavily on technical breakouts and broader sentiment to deliver gains. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is proving strength in a different way, by rolling out 20,000 miners across 130+ countries and scaling shipments by the week. That hardware-backed expansion separates it from coins that rely only on charts or predictions. For those asking what the best crypto to buy looks like in 2025, BlockDAG’s mix of presale momentum, global infrastructure, and user-driven mining makes it the clear choice!

XYZVerse has secured more than $15 million, fueled by its sports engagement features and meme-driven appeal. Little Pepe has grown rapidly as a meme coin with real infrastructure, raising $24 million and distributing over 15 billion coins. Still, neither compares to the scale achieved by BlockDAG (BDAG) . Starting at $0.001 in Stage 1, BlockDAG has raised nearly $410 million, sold over 26.4 billion coins, and gained 312,000 holders. More than 3 million X1 miners are already active, and nearly 20,000 hardware miners are shipping worldwide. The limited $0.0016 entry price will close in a few days, making this a critical moment for those tracking top crypto to invest in 2025. Could XYZVerse Become 2025’s Breakout Project? XYZVerse has gained strong attention for merging memes with sports-driven interaction, creating more than just viral buzz. By integrating real-world sports perks and fan engagement, the project targets a global audience with unique rewards. The presale has crossed $15 million, with its price climbing from $0.0001 to $0.0054, marking a 5,300% gain. It also highlights well-structured tokenomics, including a 17.13% burn rate, 15% liquidity allocation, and completed SolidProof and Pessimistic audits. With this combination of culture, audits, and steady growth, XYZVerse is proving that meme projects can deliver real utility. Projects like XYZVerse are stepping up as strong choices among the top crypto to invest in 2025. Little Pepe’s Rapid Growth in the Meme Coin Market Little Pepe has become one of 2025’s fastest-growing meme coins, crossing $24 million raised and distributing 15 billion coins to 39,000+ holders on Ethereum’s Layer-2 network. Its scalable, low-cost network is key to sustaining momentum. Security is a highlight, with a CertiK audit scoring over 95%, reinforcing confidence. The project has also launched a $777,000 giveaway, increasing community activity. By combining meme energy with strong infrastructure and verified contracts, Little Pepe is set to be more than just hype, placing it among the top crypto to invest in for 2025. BlockDAG’s $410M Presale and Global Mining Base BlockDAG is proving it can deliver far beyond promises. While others announce future hardware plans, BlockDAG is actively shipping nearly 20,000 miners to users worldwide, a rare sign of infrastructure readiness before exchange listing. This rollout shows that BlockDAG is constructing a real ecosystem ready to operate from day one. Its numbers are striking: $410 million raised, 26.4 billion coins sold, and 312,000+ holders onboarded. The 3 million daily miners using the X1 app show adoption at a massive scale. The special $0.0016 entry price offers a potential 3,746% ROI compared to the $0.05 confirmed listing price, but will soon rise to the Batch 30 price of $0.03. BlockDAG’s ability to combine hardware rollout, live mining adoption, and growing funding makes it the most compelling project for those looking at the top crypto to invest in 2025. This is measurable adoption and a rare entry point that is quickly closing. Final Say When comparing XYZVerse, Little Pepe, and BlockDAG, the difference lies in execution and scale. XYZVerse mixes cultural appeal with sports integration, and Little Pepe validates meme coins with security and scalability. Both show why meme-driven projects attract huge traction. BlockDAG, however, sets a new bar. With nearly $410 million raised, 26.4 billion coins sold, and millions mining before launch, it represents a fully operating Layer-1 ecosystem. The limited $0.0016 entry price, still available for a few days, provides one of the highest ROI opportunities, making BlockDAG the leading top crypto to invest in 2025 .

Backed by Yzi Labs (formerly Binance Labs) and carrying the public endorsement of former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the token quickly drew massive attention from traders and investors. Related Reading: Tron Integration Marks Next Phase Of PayPal USD’s Multi-Chain Growth – Details Upon launch, ASTER surged to nearly $1.94, sparking excitement around its potential to rival leading decentralized derivatives platforms. However, the enthusiasm was quickly tested as the token dropped 33% to lows of $1.33 within days, reflecting the volatility often seen in new market entries. Despite this sharp correction, ASTER has since stabilized and recovered to trade around $1.57, showing early signs of resilience. With CZ’s visible support and Yzi Labs’ backing, Aster positions itself as a formidable competitor to Hyperliquid in the decentralized perpetuals sector. The project’s narrative of combining deep liquidity, advanced trading infrastructure, and a strong ecosystem presence is already attracting both retail and institutional attention. Aster’s Setup And Competitive Outlook Top analyst Big Cheds recently shared a technical perspective on Aster, pointing to a bullish signal forming on the 1-hour chart. According to his view, ASTER printed a hammer candle with notable volume at the lower Bollinger Band breach, right near the 50-period simple moving average (SMA). This type of setup often suggests strong accumulation at support levels and can serve as a precursor to a rebound. For traders, the combination of a lower BB breach and hammer formation indicates potential exhaustion of selling pressure and the possibility of renewed upside momentum. The timing of this technical development is crucial. The broader crypto market has entered a volatile phase following aggressive selloffs across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major altcoins. While many tokens are struggling to recover, analysts argue that Aster is carving out a unique position, benefiting from strong institutional backing and favorable technical patterns. This resilience has led some to view ASTER as one of the more compelling short-to-midterm plays in the altcoin market. Beyond technicals, Aster’s fundamentals add weight to this outlook. Positioned as a direct competitor to Hyperliquid, Aster is aiming to capture market share in the growing decentralized perpetuals sector. Backed by Yzi Labs and publicly supported by CZ, its ecosystem growth potential is considerable. Analysts believe that if momentum continues, Aster could see accelerated adoption, supported by both speculative interest and long-term infrastructure development. Related Reading: Crypto Leverage Whipeout: $600M+ In BTC & ETH Longs Liquidated ASTER Price Analysis: Technical Levels To Hold The 1-hour chart of ASTER/USDT highlights the token’s volatile but constructive price action since launch. After an explosive surge to nearly $1.94, the price corrected sharply, retracing to the $1.33 level before finding support. The recent bounce has seen ASTER recover to around $1.49, signaling that buyers remain active at lower levels despite ongoing volatility. The chart shows that ASTER is consolidating just under the 50-period simple moving average (SMA), currently near $1.51. This moving average has acted as both resistance and guidance for short-term momentum, meaning a decisive break above could trigger renewed upside momentum. Conversely, rejection here could lead to another retest of the $1.40–$1.33 support zone.

Specifically, Strive, a prominent asset management firm focused on Bitcoin treasury strategies, is acquiring Semler Scientific, a biotech company that was one of the first US public companies to adopt BTC as a treasury asset. Strive makes blockbuster move As announced on September 22, 2025, Strive has entered a definitive agreement to acquire Semler Scientific in an all-stock transaction. Strive, which manages over $2 billion in assets through its SEC-registered subsidiary Strive Asset Management, LLC, has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin exposure in recent months, and Semler Scientific is its latest move as it looks to scale further its Bitcoin treasury bet . At the heart of this merger lies a strategic amplification of Bitcoin holdings. Strive has bolstered its treasury by acquiring 5,816 BTC at an average price of $116,047 per coin. The total outlay on the strategy is $675 million. Meanwhile, the addition of Semler’s portfolio, which currently stands at over 5,000 BTC. Notably, it bumps the company’s total bitcoin on the balance sheet to more than 10,000 BTC. “This merger cements Strive’s position as a top Bitcoin treasury company, and we believe our alpha-seeking strategies and capital structure position us to outperform Bitcoin over the long run. This transaction showcases how we can grow Bitcoin holdings and Bitcoin per share at an unmatched pace in the industry to drive equity value accretion,” Matt Cole, chairman and chief executive officer of Strive, said in a statement. According to the press release, the boards of directors of both companies have given a nod to the all-stock deal, with each share of Semler Scientific common stock set to be exchanged for 21.05 shares of Strive’s Class A common stock. This move aligns with Strive’s “preferred equity only” leverage model. Importantly, the model eschews traditional debt to mitigate maturity risks and focuses on perpetual preferred offerings, which have the backing of ample cash reserves. As Eric Semler, executive chairman of Semler Scientific, said, the deal will be of value to shareholders. “We believe this merger creates significant value for our stockholders by delivering a substantial premium and direct participation in one of the most innovative Bitcoin strategies in the public markets…Just as importantly, this merger can drive shareholder value by expanding our medical diagnostics business into a robust preventative care and wellness platform focused on early detection of chronic disease.” The deal comes as corporate adoption of digital assets accelerates, with Bitcoin companies on the rise in 2025 following Bitcoin’s bull run and Michael Saylor’s Strategy playbook. Altcoins have also attracted such moves, including for Ethereum, Solana, BNB and XRP.

Platforms that remained steadfast through regulatory storms didn’t just keep trading lines open—they proved their commitment to customers . Uphold’s appearance on the list of top XRP holders reflects that commitment. Far from a marketing ploy, it signals a history of standing firm when others wavered. Simon McLoughlin Clarifies the Numbers Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin recently addressed the exchange’s presence among the largest XRP holders. In a statement on X, McLoughlin explained that while on-chain data shows Uphold with massive XRP balances, those tokens “belong to our customers, not us.” He emphasized that Uphold’s position is custodial, not speculative, describing the platform’s XRP holdings as “built on trust, not hype.” This distinction underscores a broader point: aggregated wallet data often reflects client funds stored in exchange-controlled addresses, not corporate ownership. You’ll see @UpholdInc listed among the biggest $XRP holders. But those assets belong to our customers, not us. People remember who stood strong in difficult times. This “holding” is built on trust, not hype. Big difference. pic.twitter.com/RoB8SBN2CF — Simon McLoughlin (@SMcLoughlin00) September 14, 2025 Custody Versus Corporate Treasury Transparency reports released by Uphold back up McLoughlin’s statement. The company publishes proof-of-reserves data showing that XRP assets match customer liabilities on a one-to-one basis. This practice helps dispel confusion created when blockchain explorers label exchange wallets as if they were personal hoards. In reality, these are pooled customer deposits that the platform safeguards on behalf of millions of account holders. Standing by XRP During the SEC Fight Uphold’s credibility was forged during one of XRP’s most challenging periods: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. Beginning in late 2020, many exchanges delisted or suspended XRP trading to avoid potential regulatory fallout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Uphold took a different path, keeping XRP available to its users throughout the legal battle. The decision, informed by legal counsel and a commitment to customer service, became a hallmark of the company’s resilience and earned lasting respect from the XRP community. Market Impact and User Confidence Independent blockchain trackers show that Uphold now secures more than a billion XRP tokens for its customers, placing it among the network’s largest custodians.

AVAX exhibited wild price swings this year. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits later in the year.

This isn’t just a typical market fluctuation; it stems from an urgent UXLINK security alert issued by a leading firm. Investors are grappling with the news that a suspicious transaction, valued at a staggering $11.3 million, has been flagged, sending shockwaves through the community and causing the token’s value to plummet. What Triggered the UXLINK Security Alert? The core of the recent market turbulence surrounding UXLINK lies in a critical UXLINK security alert . This alert was first raised by Cybalert, a reputable security firm known for its vigilance in detecting potential threats within the blockchain ecosystem. Cybalert identified an unusual transaction amounting to approximately $11.3 million. Such large, unexpected movements of funds often raise red flags, prompting security analysts to investigate the nature and intent behind them. While the specifics of the transaction are still under scrutiny, its designation as ‘suspicious’ indicates that it deviated from normal operational patterns or involved an unverified source or destination. This swift identification by Cybalert underscores the ongoing need for robust monitoring in the fast-paced crypto landscape. Immediate Market Impact: The 40% Plunge Following the public disclosure of the UXLINK security alert , the market reaction was swift and severe. UXLINK’s price saw an approximate 40% plunge on Bithumb, a major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange. This significant drop highlights the sensitivity of crypto markets to security concerns. Investor Panic: The news likely triggered a wave of selling, as holders reacted to the uncertainty. Liquidity Concerns: Rapid price declines can lead to reduced liquidity, making it harder for traders to exit positions without further impacting the price. Exchange Scrutiny: Bithumb, like other exchanges, faces increased scrutiny during such events, as traders look for explanations and reassurances. The dramatic fall underscores how quickly trust can erode when a UXLINK security alert of this magnitude emerges, affecting investor confidence and market stability. Navigating the Aftermath: Advice for UXLINK Holders For those holding UXLINK, this UXLINK security alert naturally raises questions and concerns. What steps should you consider in light of such a significant event? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official announcements from UXLINK, Cybalert, and reputable crypto news sources. Avoid relying on unverified social media rumors. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your exposure to UXLINK. Consider your personal risk tolerance and investment strategy. Secure Your Assets: Ensure your wallets and exchange accounts have strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled. This is always good practice, especially during periods of heightened security concerns. Exercise Caution: Be wary of phishing attempts or scams that might try to capitalize on the situation by offering ‘solutions’ or asking for private keys. While it’s a challenging time, informed decisions are crucial for navigating the potential volatility and uncertainty surrounding this UXLINK security alert . Broader Implications for Crypto Security The recent UXLINK security alert serves as a stark reminder of the persistent challenges in the cryptocurrency space. The digital asset industry, despite its advancements, remains a prime target for malicious actors. Vulnerability of Protocols: Even established projects can face unexpected vulnerabilities or be targeted by sophisticated attacks. Importance of Security Firms: The role of independent security firms like Cybalert is paramount in identifying and flagging potential threats before they escalate further. Their expertise is vital for maintaining ecosystem integrity. Investor Due Diligence: This incident emphasizes the need for investors to conduct thorough research not just on a project’s utility, but also on its security audits, team transparency, and incident response plans. Ultimately, every UXLINK security alert , while concerning, contributes to the collective learning and strengthening of the overall blockchain security infrastructure. It pushes the industry towards more resilient and secure practices. The dramatic 40% plunge in UXLINK’s value, triggered by a substantial $11.3 million suspicious transaction flagged by Cybalert, is a significant event for the crypto community. It underscores the inherent risks and the critical importance of robust security protocols in the digital asset space. While the full implications of this UXLINK security alert are still unfolding, it serves as a powerful reminder for investors to remain vigilant, stay informed, and prioritize security in their crypto endeavors. The industry continues to evolve, and with it, the need for heightened awareness and proactive measures against potential threats.

For those deeply invested in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space, understanding the broader trajectory of technological advancement, especially in AI, is crucial. The integration of advanced AI into mainstream devices like our televisions signifies a monumental shift, potentially paving the way for future decentralized AI applications and new forms of digital interaction. Google’s latest move to embed its powerful Google Gemini AI into Google TV is not just an upgrade; it’s a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with our home entertainment systems. What Does Google Gemini AI Bring to Your Living Room? Gone are the days of rigid, command-based interactions with your television. Google is ushering in an era of free-flowing, natural language conversations with your TV, powered by Gemini. This expansion is set to bring Google’s sophisticated AI capabilities to an impressive installed base of over 300 million active Google TV and other Android TV OS-powered devices. Imagine settling down for an evening and instead of endlessly scrolling, you simply ask your TV, “Hey Gemini, my partner likes sci-fi and I’m in the mood for a comedy, what’s something we’d both enjoy?” The AI will then leverage its understanding of vast content libraries and user preferences to offer tailored suggestions. The utility of Gemini extends far beyond simple content recommendations. Here’s a glimpse of what you can expect: Personalized Content Discovery: Gemini can help you find movies or shows even if you can’t remember the exact title, based on plot points or actors. Review and Information Retrieval: Instantly check reviews for a title to decide if it’s worth your time, or get a quick recap of a past season of your favorite series. Bridging Interests: Effortlessly find content that satisfies the diverse tastes of everyone in your household. The Evolution of AI on TV: Beyond Entertainment While entertainment is a primary focus, the true power of AI on TV lies in its versatility. Because Gemini is a comprehensive AI chatbot, its capabilities aren’t limited to just media. This means your television could become a central hub for various daily tasks and learning. Consider these practical applications: Educational Support: Kids and parents can utilize Gemini for homework assistance, brainstorming school project ideas, or exploring new topics. Planning and Organization: Families could plan their next vacation, research destinations, and gather information right from their living room screen. Skill Development: Individual users might leverage Gemini to learn a new skill, get step-by-step instructions, or explore new hobbies. This deep integration transforms the TV from a passive consumption device into an active, intelligent assistant, making it a truly interactive and invaluable tool for the entire family. Google emphasizes that the introduction of Gemini will not replace the existing Google Assistant functionality; those familiar voice commands will continue to work seamlessly. Redefining the Smart TV AI Experience The arrival of Smart TV AI at this level signifies a significant leap in user experience. Unlike previous iterations of voice assistants that often required precise commands, Gemini’s natural language processing allows for more intuitive and human-like conversations. This ease of interaction democratizes advanced technology, making it accessible to a broader audience and reducing the learning curve often associated with new tech. The scale of this rollout, impacting hundreds of millions of devices, underscores Google’s commitment to making AI ubiquitous and genuinely useful in everyday environments. To understand the difference, let’s consider a quick comparison: Feature Traditional Google Assistant (TV) Google Gemini AI (TV) Interaction Style Command-based, keyword-focused Free-flowing, natural language conversations Contextual Understanding Limited context retention Advanced contextual awareness, remembers previous queries Query Complexity Best for direct, simple requests Handles complex, multi-part, and abstract questions Scope of Information Primarily TV functions, basic web searches Broad knowledge base, creative assistance, planning tools When Can You Experience Gemini Google TV? The rollout of Gemini Google TV is commencing with the TCL QM9K series, starting today. This phased approach ensures a smooth integration and allows Google to gather feedback for continuous improvement. Later in the year, more devices will receive the update, expanding its reach significantly. Keep an eye out for Gemini on the Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn 4K Pro, and several 2025 models, including Hisense U7, U8, and UX, as well as TCL QM7K, QM8K, and X11K models. Google has also indicated that more functionality and features will be added over time, suggesting a continuous evolution of the AI’s capabilities on the platform. The Broader Impact of AI Innovation in Home Entertainment This strategic move by Google highlights a larger trend of AI innovation permeating every facet of our digital existence. For the cryptocurrency community, these advancements are particularly pertinent. The underlying technologies that power sophisticated AI models often share principles with blockchain – data processing, complex algorithms, and distributed intelligence. As AI becomes more powerful and integrated, the discussions around data privacy, ownership, and decentralized AI solutions will only intensify, creating new avenues for Web3 applications and services. The seamless, intelligent interaction offered by Gemini on TV is a testament to how far AI has come, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in consumer electronics and setting a new benchmark for smart home integration. In conclusion, Google’s Gemini AI coming to Google TV is more than just a software update; it’s a transformative step towards a truly intelligent and interactive home entertainment experience. By enabling natural language conversations and offering a vast array of functionalities, Gemini is poised to make our televisions not just screens, but active participants in our daily lives.

For those chasing the best new coins for exponential returns, 2025 is shaping up as a pivotal year. This is not just about speculation, it’s about identifying projects with real narratives, vibrant communities, and innovative tokenomics. Among the rising stars, three names stand out: BullZilla , Toncoin, and Bitcoin Cash. These three assets cater to different corners of the market, from meme coin enthusiasts to seasoned blockchain developers. Yet they share one common trait: their ability to capture attention and spark debate. For financial students, analysts, and crypto explorers, understanding these tokens is essential to identifying the best new coins for exponential returns. BullZilla ($BZIL): A Beast Among the Best New Coins for Exponential Returns BullZilla ($BZIL) has quickly become one of the best new coins for exponential returns, not because of hype alone, but thanks to carefully designed mechanics. Now in Stage 3 (Whale Signal Detected), the presale has already raised more than $570,000, with over 1,900 token holders participating at a price of $0.00007908. Roar Burn Mechanism Driving Value What sets BullZilla apart in the hunt for the best new coins for exponential returns is its Roar Burn Mechanism. Each chapter milestone sees a portion of tokens burned live on the Ethereum blockchain. This reduces supply while triggering what the community calls a “Roar Surge”, a live spectacle that signals scarcity to the market. The result? Investors perceive every burn as a direct driver of value. This burn-to-scarcity model cements BullZilla’s position as one of the top crypto for exponential gains, because it ties growth directly to community engagement and measurable supply reductions. Forged in Ethereum’s Blue Fire Ethereum provides BullZilla with the infrastructure to scale securely. Its staking rewards, referral programs, and burn mechanics are anchored to Ethereum’s liquidity and DeFi systems. Many meme coins fail due to weak networks, but BullZilla’s Ethereum base strengthens its credibility as one of the best new coins for exponential returns. A $9,000 Scenario Consider a $9,000 presale allocation. At $0.00007908, this secures over 113 million tokens. If BullZilla later trades at $0.001, the position could grow beyond $113,000, a potential 1,150% gain. No guarantees exist in crypto, but scenarios like this demonstrate why $BZIL often headlines discussions on the best new coins for exponential returns. How to Buy BullZilla Coins For those eager to participate, purchasing BullZilla is straightforward: Set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH) via exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, then transfer it to your wallet. Connect your wallet to the official presale portal, and swap ETH for $BZIL. These tokens will be claimable after presale completion. This simplicity ensures that BullZilla remains accessible to both beginners and veterans, expanding its reach among the new crypto coins for massive ROI. Toncoin (TON): Resistance in the Path of Growth Toncoin remains a fascinating project with its origins tied to Telegram’s blockchain. Trading at $6.15 with a $21.5 billion market cap, TON is struggling below the $7.20 resistance level. While the fundamentals are intact, repeated failures to break higher have kept investor sentiment cautious. The problem? Liquidity often migrates to hotter opportunities. BlockchainFX ($BFX), a presale boasting a 127% confirmed upside and over $7 million raised, has siphoned attention away from TON. For those searching the market for the cryptos for exponential growth, this trend is telling: investors favor momentum. Still, Toncoin’s position should not be dismissed. If it conquers resistance at $7.20, it may reenter the conversation of the best new coins for exponential returns. But without fresh catalysts, its progress risks stagnation. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Veteran Among New Challengers Bitcoin Cash remains in the top 20, trading around $586.99 with a market cap of $11.69 billion. Yet, it recently slipped 2%, weighed down by broader market weakness. With a peak of $4,355.62 in 2017 and an all-time low of $75.08 in 2018, BCH embodies both resilience and volatility. While BCH commands respect as an early innovator, its narrative lacks the excitement of presales like BullZilla. For analysts scouting the best new coins for exponential returns, BCH demonstrates that legacy status is not enough. It survives, but fresh projects with burn mechanisms or real-world utilities are outpacing it. That said, its stability keeps it relevant for those valuing proven networks over speculative surges. Whether it belongs among the new exponential coins to buy October 2025 depends on one’s risk appetite. Conclusion: Where the Best New Coins for Exponential Returns Will Emerge Momentum, scarcity, and community drive value in cryptocurrency. In 2025, BullZilla embodies these forces, earning its spot among the best new coins for exponential returns. Its Roar Burn Mechanism, Ethereum foundation, and presale dynamics create a cycle of scarcity and growth difficult to ignore. Toncoin’s fate hinges on overcoming resistance, while Bitcoin Cash stands as a veteran under pressure. Yet, when evaluating the trending exponential return coins, it is the bold presales that often shine brightest. Investors must remember: with high potential comes high risk.

The update came just days after President Donald Trump said he was finalizing the deal, and it marks another step in Larry Ellison’s growing influence inside the Trump administration. Oracle’s involvement is part of a new joint venture that gives American investors control over the video-sharing app’s U.S. division, with Ellison’s firm and private equity group Silver Lake leading the charge. This is according to details confirmed Monday by the White House and reported by Yahoo Finance. The structure of the deal moves TikTok’s U.S. assets under a new American company where Oracle and Silver Lake will hold the majority stake and board seats. China-based ByteDance, TikTok’s current owner, will retain under 20% of the new entity. The joint venture will also take control of TikTok’s algorithm by copying it, retraining it, and placing it under U.S. authority. A senior White House official said, “We feel [this] meets every security requirement that we need for the algorithm to make sure it’s behaving appropriately.” Oracle will serve as the security provider for the group, tasked with overseeing the data, code, and regular inspections by government officials. Oracle takes over security while ByteDance gets pushed aside Clay Magouyrk, who now serves as one of Oracle’s new co-CEOs, was already managing the company’s cloud business, where the app’s user data is currently stored. That cloud deal alone brought in around 5% of revenue for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure during its 2025 fiscal year, based on estimates from MorningStar’s Luke Yang. The arrangement is expected to continue under the new ownership model. The U.S. government has made clear it won’t take a board seat, a “golden share,” or any equity stake in the joint venture. However, officials are considering a one-time fee for facilitating the transaction. Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week declaring the deal a “qualified divestiture” under the ban-or-sale law passed last year. He also plans to extend the enforcement pause for another 120 days to allow final regulatory steps and paperwork to be completed. ByteDance will simultaneously sign an agreement with the new American investors outlining the full framework. Trump extended the original ban until December 16, giving enough time for the entire deal to be completed early next year. The White House said the agreement still requires approval from Chinese regulators, but officials expect no major problems. The deal also follows a recent call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. “We are 100% confident that a deal is done,” said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt over the weekend. She added that signatures are expected “in the coming days.” Oracle installs two new CEOs while insiders cash out As all this happens, Oracle quietly replaced its CEO, Safra Catz, on Monday behind the scenes. Safra had served in the role since 2014 and will now take a new position as executive vice chair of the board. Oracle appointed Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as its new co-CEOs. Clay previously led Oracle’s AI cloud business, and Mike ran Oracle Industries, both were promoted to their former president roles back in June. Insider trading among Oracle insiders also picked up as director William Parrett sold 11,500 shares between September 15 and 19 at a price of $306 each, totaling about $3.52 million, with the remaining stake now at 27,075 shares. The full list of investors in the TikTok venture hasn’t been disclosed yet, but Oracle and Silver Lake are confirmed to be leading it. ByteDance’s minority stake means it’ll have no real say in the joint venture. The deal marks the likely end of years of debate in Washington over whether TikTok should be allowed to operate in the U.S. under Chinese ownership. With this new structure, that question is finally getting a clear answer—and Oracle is now at the heart of it. Get seen where it counts.

However, the bank has said that Gold will keep its lead in official holdings for now. According to the German lender, the more Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility falls, the more its acceptance grows, and the currency is adopted by companies, retail investors, and governments. Now, Bitcoin’s volatility is going down, which has been a problem for a long time in terms of its reserve status. In August, its 30-day volatility hit an all-time low, even as its price broke records above $123,500. This suggests that the currency may be moving away from its speculative roots. Gold rallies while Bitcoin tanks DBK sees bitcoin’s adoption following a path similar to gold’s, moving from skepticism to widespread acceptance, with regulation, macroeconomic trends and time paving the way. The bank said that Bitcoin and gold will continue to coexist as complementary hedges against inflation and geopolitical risk because of their scarcity and low correlation to other assets. 🚨 Deutsche Bank New Research: Bitcoin to Coexist with Gold on Central Bank Balance Sheets by 2030 >Bitcoin vol to decline >Neither needs to ""replace"" USD as reserve asset >This time is not different (Gold was once risky) >BTC & other alternative assets are part of human nature pic.twitter.com/Zk3m392jCw — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) September 22, 2025 Investors often compare gold to safe money. Today, it jumped 1% to set a new record high and bring its 2025 gain to 43%. It hit a record high of $3,763. The precious metal has risen over 40% year-to-date. The price of the metal went up about an hour after BTC dropped 3% in 24 hours, bringing its price down to $112,000. This ended its year-to-date gain of 17%. Based on the date, it’s possible that profits from selling bitcoins were turned into gold. Although the two assets rarely move in tandem, there are occasional instances in which they rise or decline simultaneously, frequently with a brief lag. This time, the divergence is more pronounced. However, gold is not the sole metal that attracts flows. Silver increased by 1.5% on Monday to reach $44, its third-highest level since 1975. It has now increased by over 50% year-to-date. DBK says that no currency will dethrone the dollar The report noted that the US dollar still makes up 57% of global reserves, but signs of diversification are emerging. China’s US Treasury holdings fell $57 billion in 2024, and momentum for crypto regulation is building in major markets. For instance, Norway’s Norges Bank, the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, doesn’t hold bitcoin or any related ETFs, but it does hold about 2.9 million shares of Strategy as of its second quarter report. Many US state pension and retirement funds do too, including CalPERS, the country’s biggest pension and retirement fund. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, more than 180 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Many of these companies have only been around for a year. They hold 4.7% of all the Bitcoins that are ever made. However, since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points, US government yields have increased. The 10-year yield is now 4.125%, which is 2.5% higher than a year ago, and the 30-year yield is now 4.7%, which is 2% higher. The dollar got stronger; the DXY measure went up by 1% to 97.5. Risky assets tend to lose value when the dollar gets stronger, and Bitcoin has lost over 3.5% since the Fed’s move. Assets performance since Fed’s rate cuts.

The tech giant is making bold moves in its executive suite, promoting two key figures to co-CEO roles as it aggressively positions itself for dominance in the burgeoning AI infrastructure sector. This strategic pivot by a major enterprise player underscores the profound importance of AI in the global economy, a trend that reverberates across all tech sectors, including the foundations supporting the cryptocurrency world. A New Era of Executive Leadership at Oracle Oracle recently announced a significant change in its top management, elevating Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to the pivotal roles of co-CEOs. This move is more than just a personnel change; it signifies a clear strategic direction for the company. Magouyrk, who joined Oracle in 2014 from Amazon Web Services, was instrumental in founding Oracle’s cloud engineering team and has led its cloud infrastructure business unit for over a decade. His deep expertise in cloud services positions him perfectly to steer Oracle’s AI ambitions. Mike Sicilia, on the other hand, has been the president of Oracle’s industries division since June and brings a wealth of experience from various roles since joining Oracle through an acquisition in 2008. His extensive background across different company divisions will be crucial in integrating AI capabilities across Oracle’s diverse industry offerings. This transition also sees Safra Catz, who served as Oracle’s CEO since 2014, moving into a new capacity as the executive vice chair of Oracle’s board of directors. Catz expressed confidence in the company’s direction, stating, “Today, Oracle is recognized as the cloud of choice for both AI training and inferencing. I’m very proud of that. Oracle’s technology and business have never been stronger. And our breathtaking growth rate points to an even more prosperous future. At this time of strength is the right moment to pass the CEO role to the next generation of capable executives.” This change in executive leadership is designed to capitalize on Oracle’s current momentum and accelerate its future growth, particularly in AI. Oracle’s Bold Vision for AI Infrastructure While Oracle has long been recognized as a formidable cloud infrastructure provider, its recent actions clearly demonstrate an intensified focus on securing a leading position in the AI infrastructure race.

This proactive approach to tech innovation ensures Oracle remains a relevant and powerful force in the evolving digital economy. What Does This Mean for Oracle AI ? The appointment of co-CEOs and the intensified focus on Oracle AI infrastructure signal a clear message: Oracle is all-in on artificial intelligence. This strategic alignment at the highest levels of management, combined with massive investments and key partnerships, positions Oracle to be a major enabler of AI innovation globally. For enterprises, this means more robust and scalable options for deploying AI solutions. For the broader tech ecosystem, including the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, Oracle’s strengthened AI capabilities contribute to a more powerful and accessible digital infrastructure. The company’s commitment to being a “cloud of choice for both AI training and inferencing” is not just a slogan; it’s a strategic imperative backed by significant investment and executive restructuring. As AI continues its transformative journey, Oracle aims to be at its core, providing the foundational compute power that drives the next wave of technological advancement. Conclusion: A Future Forged in AI Oracle’s executive shake-up and aggressive pursuit of AI infrastructure dominance mark a pivotal moment for the company. By promoting seasoned leaders Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia to co-CEO roles, and with the continued guidance of Safra Catz as executive vice chair, Oracle is strategically aligning its leadership with its most ambitious growth opportunities. The company’s substantial investments in projects like Stargate and its significant compute deals with OpenAI and Meta underscore its commitment to becoming a central player in the AI revolution. This bold strategy not only strengthens Oracle’s position in the enterprise market but also contributes to the broader digital infrastructure that supports all forms of technological innovation, including the expanding world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.

The initiative, called the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future, was unveiled last week during U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK, marking a significant step toward closer alignment between the world’s two largest financial hubs. Transatlantic Crypto Task Force Targets Unified Approach to Digital Asset Regulation According to a statement from the UK government, the task force will focus on enhancing collaboration across capital markets while laying the groundwork for a unified approach to digital assets. https://twitter.com/btc_archive/status/1970136942554550688?s=46 It will explore short- and medium-term options for cooperation while legislation and regulatory regimes continue to develop, as well as long-term opportunities to advance wholesale digital market innovation. The announcement followed a high-level meeting in London between UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The meeting hosted on September 17 was also attended by executives from major crypto firms, including Coinbase, Circle, and Ripple, alongside global banks such as Citi, Bank of America, and Barclays.

The task force will be chaired jointly by officials from HM Treasury and the U.S. Treasury, with participation from regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It is expected to report back to both finance ministries through the UK–US Financial Regulatory Working Group within 180 days. Industry experts will also be consulted to ensure recommendations reflect the priorities of businesses and investors. Key areas under review include the interoperability of regulatory frameworks, particularly around asset custody, anti-money laundering standards, and stablecoin oversight. Stablecoins are expected to be a central focus, with officials noting that aligning UK rules with U.S. standards could improve cross-border access for firms and draw more American investment into Britain’s financial sector. The move comes as the UK faces pressure to remain competitive in global finance amid concerns about companies shifting listings to U.S. markets in search of higher valuations. For Washington, the initiative reflects the Trump administration’s push toward technology-neutral digital asset regulation, a stance intended to accelerate innovation while maintaining financial stability. Recent months have seen increasing calls from industry groups on both sides of the Atlantic for governments to provide clarity on digital asset regulation. Sources familiar with the London discussions said the agreement was finalized at short notice, following letters from crypto associations urging the UK to prioritize digital assets during Trump’s visit. By strengthening transatlantic ties, the task force aims to reduce burdens for UK and U.S. firms raising capital across borders while laying the foundation for a coordinated approach to digital assets. Officials said the initiative reaffirms the “deep and historic connection” between the two economies and represents a milestone in preparing markets for the next phase of financial innovation. At the time of the announcement, both governments emphasized that stability, trust, and innovation would guide the group’s work, with the first set of recommendations expected in early 2026. Chainalysis Ranks U.S. Second in Adoption as UK Pushes Faster Crypto Approvals The launch of the UK–US crypto task force comes as both countries advance their domestic approaches to digital asset regulation.

The filing was completed last Friday through the S-3 automatic registration structure. David Namdar, CEO of CEA Industries, outlined the company’s upcoming priorities and progress within the BNB-focused treasury strategy. He emphasized that the firm is building on its early adoption of BNB, describing it as a leading digital asset supported by a large ecosystem of centralized and decentralized exchanges alongside Web3 applications. BNC authorizes $250 million for share buyback programme CEA Industries (BNC), formerly VAPE, has accumulated its holdings to 418,888 BNB tokens since August 5, valued at $368 million. The asset has gained 18.8% over the past month, with a YTD of 42.52%. The current market cap is $139.95 billion, with a total supply of 139.18M BNB. BNC holds about 0.3% of the current total supply and needs just 0.7% to reach its goal of accumulating 1% of BNB. CEO David Namdar noted that the company’s approach parallels other treasury strategies, such as MicroStrategy, which adopted Bitcoin. He highlighted Saylors’ initiative to grow from an initial $425 million to over $70 billion in holdings, suggesting that CEA is at the start of such a trajectory with BNB. He believes that BNB is still undervalued despite a record performance this year, currently trading at $1004.53. CEA Industries also authorized $250 million to be invested in a share buyback programme. The program will capture discounts to the net asset value, enhancing concentration of BNB per share and increasing shareholder value. According to the company, the program will be regulated and limited in volume. Namdar stated that CEA confirmed that the company would begin issuing more details on the NAV indicators and dashboards to track the treasury activities and asset strength, as well as maintain consistent reporting and transparency. Binance serves more than 250 million customers across the globe, offering daily utility in trading fee discounts on major exchanges and gas fees across over 4000 apps. CEA Industries’ stock falls 15.7% on NASDAQ today According to CEA, BNB’s deflationary supply model is a structural driver of its strategic treasury. The token supply halves every quarter, ultimately shrinking the circulating supply. This contrasts with other blockchains like Ethereum and Solana, which experience inflationary pressures. The firm believes the mechanism aligned with Bitcoin’s halving dynamic is essential for long-term growth. Namdar outlined BNB’s performance this year, saying it’s the only token to consistently outshine Bitcoin in price since 2017. He also highlighted that holders could benefit from yield opportunities such as airdrops, token allocations, custody incentives, and ecosystem-driven rewards. He added that CEA continues to maintain reserves to support upcoming acquisitions, describing the reserve as dry powder. If BNC fully executes the treasury plan, including the potential $750 million warrants, its holdings could exceed $1.25 billion. CEA Industries’ stock on NASDAQ has dropped 15.7% today, trading at $8.15 from the previous close of $9.69. Nanolabs is the second-largest BNB treasury, with current holdings of 128,000 valued at $128.24 million. The firm initiated its $1 billion BNB accumulation strategy in July with an initial purchase of 74,315 tokens worth $50 million at an average price of $672.45. Cryptopolitan reported that the firm targets securing 5% to 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply. The firm also participates in BTC accumulation, with the recent increase of 600 BTC via convertible notes, some of which it divested to BNB. Treasury accumulations have fueled the growth in BNB price, which has seen a 58% over the past six months.

They’ve announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for UXLINK, citing a potential UXLINK security incident . This news has certainly caught the attention of many in the crypto community, highlighting the ever-present need for vigilance in digital asset management. What Triggered the UXLINK Security Incident Suspension? Upbit’s official statement points to ""signs of a security incident"" as the primary reason for their decisive action. While specific details about the nature of this incident remain undisclosed, the exchange’s swift response underscores its commitment to user protection. When an exchange observes unusual activity or potential vulnerabilities, halting transactions is a standard, albeit disruptive, procedure to prevent further compromise. Upbit detected suspicious activity related to UXLINK. The immediate response was to suspend all UXLINK deposit and withdrawal services. This measure aims to safeguard user funds and investigate the root cause. What Does This Mean for UXLINK Holders on Upbit? For users holding UXLINK on Upbit, this suspension means they cannot move their tokens in or out of the exchange for now. It’s a challenging situation, but it’s important to remember that such actions are usually taken to protect assets. Users should: Stay informed by monitoring Upbit’s official announcements. Avoid attempting any UXLINK transactions until the suspension is lifted. Consider reviewing their overall crypto security practices. This event serves as a stark reminder that even established exchanges can face security challenges.

Top New Crypto to Watch in 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-mutuum-finance-mutm-flip-shiba-inu-shib-top-new-crypto-to-watch-in-2025/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the most popular memecoins, supported by its staunch user base and large volumes. Its price action has generally followed the chaos of hype cycles rather than utility, however. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently presale at $0.035, is moving fast to become a serious alternative challenger to 2025. With a focus on a DeFi borrowing-and-lending protocol, MUTM has utility in the real world that could allow it to outperform purely speculative altcoins like SHIB. Shiba Inu Supports Near $0.0000128 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at approximately $0.00001287, illustrating that it has kept a crucial support level amidst recent volatility. Its ecosystem building continues through layers like Shibarium, token burn initiatives to increase, and new integrations like cross-chain lending, aimed at cementing its utility over meme connection. But SHIB is still faced with headwinds from low realized volatility, profit-taking from large holders, and resistance near higher price levels that have been hard to break through. While its community support remains strong, analysts believe a newer presale project with a utility-driven model could offer relatively more potential for rapid percentage gains. Mutuum Finance Speeds Up in Presale Mutuum Finance presale has raised over $16.15 million in presale and more than 16,470 investors are registered. Stage 6 is available for sale at a minimum of $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance envisions long-term growth within the DeFi ecosystem. The project is promoting early adoption by conducting a $100,000 giveaway campaign, during which 10 users on the platform will be awarded $10,000 MUTM each. Mutuum Finance and CertiK also have an ongoing Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward pool. The Program is meant to incentivize white-hat hackers and security researchers to search for bugs in the project codebase. Bugs are scored on the severity level, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low, and the rewards are issued in same. How Mutuum Works Mutuum Finance retains the shape of a liquidity-balanced dynamic rate of interest model. Borrowing is highly desirable in times of low interest and stimulates lending and utilization. Payment is driven by high interest, together with further injections of capital. Fixed rates of interest are best suited for highly liquid funds, anchored and reopenable on market fluctuation. As a fully decentralized system, ownership rights are held by the MUTM token holders such that lending and borrowing are decoupled. The interest rate mechanism incentivizes long-term efficiency, promotes portfolio auto-diversification, and rises with the expansion of the DeFi market. Correct pricing allows lending, borrowing, and liquidation trades to be completed profitably. Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles to gain access to USD and natively native assets such as ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, composite feeds, and time-weighted averages of decentralized exchanges are used by the platform to provide correct valuations even in stressed market conditions. Overtaking Shiba Inu (SHIB) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining traction as investors benchmark its potential against established tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB). At $0.035 during Stage 6 presale, over $16.15M raised, and 16,470+ backers on board, MUTM’s momentum is clear. Unlike SHIB’s highly speculative waves, Mutuum Finance offers real-world utility from its DeFi lending-and-borrowing protocol, dynamic interest models, and oracle-backed price infrastructure. Supported by a $100K giveaway and a $50K CertiK bug bounty, the project is committed to growth, as well as security. Though SHIB remains a cult favorite, analysts are projecting that MUTM will fare better in 2025 by combining utility, scalability, and early-stage potential upside. Secure your Stage 6 tokens before the price increases in the next stage.

This move could ease the way for crypto firms looking to operate on both sides of the Atlantic. Chancellor of the UK, Rachel Reeves, and the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, decided to form the official group last week in Downing Street, before Trump’s state visit to Britain. The UK Treasury said that the task force’s goal will be to make it easier for UK and US companies to get cross-border funding. Both Racheal Reeves and Scott Bessent will co-chair the task group. Also, regulatory bodies from both sides of the Atlantic will be members and will be in charge of overseeing capital markets and digital asset control. BREAKING: The US and UK are joining forces on a new crypto task force to explore regulation cooperation. #CryptoCommunity #Trump #CryptoTaskForce https://t.co/wQ9PcPvzrT pic.twitter.com/PFq7MzhW4j — Roundtable Network (@RTB_io) September 22, 2025 The group has been tasked to deliver recommendations within 180 days on coordinating policy for emerging financial technologies, including digital assets, stablecoins, and tokenized securities. “This is about unlocking opportunities for investors, businesses, and market participants on both sides of the Atlantic,” a Treasury official said . Coinbase offers support to the joint task force Coinbase has announced its support for the UK and the US collaboration. According to the crypto exchange, “The US and UK have deep capital markets Cooperation between these two leading financial centres is critical given the profound opportunity facing global capital markets, coming from tokenisation.” Coinbase has suggested that the two nations focus on tokenising traditional financial assets, stablecoin leadership, and mutual recognition of the regulatory regimes. According to Coinbase, tokenization will change how global capital markets work and make financial services more accessible to everyone. It will also allow regular investors to trade, borrow, and invest in ways only possible for big investors. In addition, the company said that the US is leaning into stablecoins as part of its strategic focus on tokenisation of traditional financial assets. On the other hand, the Bank of England is proposing caps that will effectively preclude the use of stablecoins in wholesale markets. “The UK needs stablecoin leadership, and a viable Sterling stablecoin, to deliver on the opportunities associated with this partnership, and to drive progress in capital market innovation more generally,” the company added. Crypto companies move their listings from London to New York Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has appointed crypto-friendly regulators, dismissed lawsuits against major companies in the sector, and passed landmark legislation overseeing stablecoins. By contrast, Britain has been accused by crypto executives of dragging its feet on regulation, leaving it lagging behind the US and other rival financial centres. Last month, former Conservative chancellor George Osborne launched a withering attack on the Labour government’s approach to crypto. He warned that Britain risked becoming irrelevant in a revolution reminiscent of Nigel Lawson’s Big Bang in the 1980s. Osborne, who now sits on the global advisory council of US crypto exchange Coinbase, said Reeves and Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey were leaving Britain in the slow lane. The joint task force comes as the UK tries to get its capital markets back on track after a long period of decline. As a result, many companies have moved their listings from London to New York in search of better valuations. Therefore, this initiative is expected to revive the country. The UK Cryptoasset Business Council, a trade group, said the task force’s announcement marked a clear vote of confidence from the US in the UK economy. “Get this right and it has the potential to turbocharge the City of London and the transatlantic economy,” it added.

OpenAI plans to deploy Nvidia systems that together will need 10 gigawatts of power, the companies said . The gigawatt measure, used more often now to better describe large AI chip clusters, sets the scale of the project. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in San Jose, California, that 10 gigawatts equates to around 4 – 5 million GPUs. That matches what Nvidia expects to ship in total this year and is “twice as much as last year.” “This is a giant project,” Huang said in the interview, seated with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the company’s president, Greg Brockman . Nv idia shares surged to a new record high of $184.55 after the announcement, adding $200 billion in its market cap in a single hour. BREAKING: Nvidia stock, $NVDA , surges to a new record high of $184.55 after announcing a $100 billion investment in OpenAI. Nvidia has now added +$200 BILLION of market cap over the last hour. pic.twitter.com/WWvWmTB57H — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) September 22, 2025 Huang called the partnership “monumental in size,” underscoring how closely OpenAI and Nvidia remain linked after kicking off the recent AI boom . “Nvidia invests $100 billion in OpenAI, which then OpenAI turns back and gives it back to Nvidia,” Bryn Talkington, managing partner at Requisite Capital Management, told CNBC after the announcement. “I feel like this is going to be very virtuous for Jensen.” The commitment signals how much Nvidia technology OpenAI expects to require for the next wave of AI that goes beyond its current systems. OpenAI’s chip needs were already rising to serve users at scale. The company said it has 700 million active weekly users. “You should expect a lot from us in the coming months,” Altman said in the interview. “There are three things that OpenAI has to do well: we have to do great AI research, we have to make these products people want to use, and we have to figure out how to do this unprecedented infrastructure challenge.” The funding will roll out progressively The companies said the funding will roll out “progressively” as new capacity is built, and that Nvidia will be a “preferred” supplier of chips and networking gear. Nvidia leads the market for AI accelerators, but it faces rising competition from Advanced Micro Devices and from cloud providers that are building their own chips and tightly integrated systems. Huang told investors in August that it takes between $50 – $60 billion to construct a data center with one gigawatt of capacity, and almost $35 billion is linked to Nvidia chips and systems. The first phase of the new buildout is scheduled to come online in Q2 2026, using Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin systems. Nvidia’s move follows a recent secondary sale that valued OpenAI at $500 billion, backed by a roster of investors. Microsoft was one of OpenAI’s early backers and has a strategic pact to bring OpenAI models to its Azure cloud and Microsoft Office. Thrive Capital and Softbank are also major investors in OpenAI. The Nvidia-OpenAI effort will complement infrastructure work underway with Oracle, Microsoft, the Stargate project, and SoftBank. In the CNBC interview, Altman described Microsoft and Nvidia as “passive” investors and as two of OpenAI’s “most critical partners.” Huang said Nvidia’s investment is “additive to everything that’s been announced and contracted.” He told CNBC that the plan sits on top of what Nvidia has already told Wall Street to expect. While this commitment far exceeds Nvidia’s earlier outlays, the company has been spending widely across the AI landscape. According to an earlier Cryptopolitan report, Nvidia’s AI spending is expected to reach $1.5 trillion in 2025. Last week, Nvidia announced that it took a $5 billion Intel stake and that they would collaborate on AI chips. Nvidia has also invested $700 million in Nscale, a UK-based data center startu p . According to a CNBC report from Thursday, Nvidia spent more than $900 million to bring the CEO of Enfabrica, Rochan Sankar, on board, along with other employees from the firm, and license Enfabrica’s technology.

Speaking to the WSJ, Bostic said he expects only one rate cut in 2025. Bostic said the Fed is hesitant to support further interest rate cuts in October due to inflation running above its 2% target. He noted that despite the economic risks shifting toward weak employment, he currently expects only one rate cut in 2025. “I'm concerned about inflation, which has been too high for a long time. So I won't take action or support it anymore, but we'll see what happens.” Bostic said the latest rate cut in September was reasonable, but uncertainty remains high. At this point, Bostic stated that the 2025 inflation forecast will be 2.9% and core inflation will be 3.1%, and said he does not believe inflation will fall to the 2% target “probably until early 2028.” He warned that tariffs and immigration restrictions could slow labor force growth and maintain moderate price pressures. He said that the current policy environment is one of the most challenging, with risks to both inflation and growth increasing. *This is not investment advice.

The London company said its self-driving system has been installed on Nissan Ariya electric models and has been driven on public roads in Tokyo. The work follows an agreement reached with the Japanese carmaker in April. Wayve is trying to show carmakers that its approach can scale as it competes with Tesla, Google’s Waymo, and China’s Baidu. The firm has grown into one of the UK’s best-funded young companies and a rare homegrown artificial intelligence player. Nissan is the first automaker to say in public that it is using Wayve’s technology . Founder Alex Kendall said the startup is also working with large manufacturers in Europe, North America, and Japan. Nissan is developing its own autonomous driving features Nissan has been developing its own driver-assist and autonomous features, including trials held in London. Choosing to add Wayve’s system is a notable vote of confidence for the British firm. In Nissan cars, the feature will be an “eyes on, hands off” setup, the industry’s Level 2. The vehicle can handle speed and steering in some conditions, but the human driver must be alert and ready to take back control at any time. Kendall said so-called “eyes off” systems, in which the car takes full control, are “very similar from an AI perspective.” Robotaxis run by rival software are already in service in parts of the U.S. and China, though operators have faced issues when vehicles meet unusual obstacles or unexpected events. Toyota Motor Corp. has a partnership with Waymo, Google’s autonomous driving unit. Waymo has also entered Japan, though operations there remain in the testing phase. Other major carmakers pushing automated driving include Honda Motor Co., General Motors, and Mercedes-Benz. Companies from outside the traditional auto industry are also in the mix, including Amazon and its subsidiary Zoox. Nissan’s push comes as the wider Japanese auto market faces pressure tied to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Nissan, in particular, has struggled. It has cut jobs and named a new chief executive, Ivan Espinosa, to lead a turnaround effort. The maker of the March compact, the Leaf electric car, and the Infiniti luxury brand posted losses for the April–June period, after a full fiscal year in the red. Wayve’s tests in Tokyo are the company’s most visible step so far and a move toward its 2027 consumer goal. Wayve signed a deal with Nvidia On Friday, Cryptopolitan reported that Wayve and Nvidia have signed a letter of intent that could lead to a $500 million investment in its next financing round. The startup has already raised $1.3 billion from investors, including Japan’s SoftBank, money that is being used to expand in the U.S., Germany, and Japan, as well as to grow the team in London. Nvidia supplies the computing hardware that runs Wayve’s software in vehicles and the much larger systems used for training in data centers. Cars equipped with Wayve’s system carry one or two Nvidia chips. Many more chips are used off the road to train a foundation model on large volumes of driving data, including video of drivers dealing with real streets and unpredictable situations. Kendall, 33, is a New Zealander who started Wayve in 2017 after studying deep learning for computer vision and robotics at the University of Cambridge. “We want to build a trillion-dollar company,” Kendall said. He added that the company had reached “a real inflection point in the capabilities of this technology,” which has helped the system learn quickly how to manage Tokyo’s crowded roads. Wayve’s method relies on models that learn to drive by finding patterns in huge amounts of video and other driving data, and then applying those patterns to new situations. That stands apart from approaches that sought to code detailed rules and maps into the stack for each scenario. Get seen where it counts.

52109766,https://invezz.com/?p=2893292,1758563486,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"OMNI defies market slump, signals strong reversal ahead of token swap",https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/22/omni-defies-market-slump-signals-strong-reversal-ahead-of-token-swap/,"Omni Network’s native token OMNI is showing renewed strength at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is under pressure. The cryptocurrency has managed to push higher in the past week, defying a wider downturn, and technical signals point to the possibility of a stronger reversal if key levels hold. OMNI’s market resilience draws attention The price of OMNI has risen by 3.2% in the last 24 hours to trade near $4.22, even as the global crypto market slipped by more than 3%. Over the past week, OMNI gained more than 22%, a sharp contrast to the broader sell-off. Notably, this upswing follows months of sideways action and comes just three months after the token touched its all-time low of $1.37 in July. The token is currently ranked #371 with a market capitalisation of about $167.7 million and a daily trading volume exceeding $82 million. Its trading range in the past day stretched between $3.86 and $4.62, reflecting both volatility and resilience. Omni Network rebrand momentum fuels speculation Much of the recent price activity has been tied to Omni Network’s rebrand to Nomina (NOM) , which is accompanied by a token migration at a 1:75 ratio. This rebrand comes after Omni’s August decision to reposition itself as a user-friendly DeFi layer, an upgrade that continues to attract developer and community interest. The transition has already triggered exchange responses, with KuCoin delisting OMNI perpetual futures on September 22, while Phemex and Binance announced support for the token swap scheduled between September 25 and 26. Delistings often create uncertainty, but in this case, the price has held firm. Traders appear to be positioning ahead of the migration, betting that the rebrand will improve liquidity and long-term utility. Technical analysis shows a strong bullish trend On the technical front, OMNI has been defending a crucial support zone at $4.00, which also aligns with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The 30-day simple moving average sits lower at $3.48, offering another layer of support. The MACD histogram has turned positive, signalling growing bullish momentum, while the RSI reading of 59.97 indicates strength without being overstretched. OMNI price analysis: Source: CoinMarketCap Market analysis points to $4.27 as the immediate key level to watch, with a sustained hold above this level reinforcing the bullish case, with resistance levels standing at $5.10, $8.70, and $10.33. A decisive break of $5.10 could unlock a path toward $14.07, a level that marks a full bullish projection and a potential 174% move from current prices. Higher lows hint at accumulation Beyond the numbers, OMNI’s price structure has been gradually improving. The token has formed higher lows since July, a pattern often associated with early accumulation. This suggests that buyers have been steadily positioning, even during quieter trading phases, laying the groundwork for a stronger breakout. Traders are cautious, however, as failure to hold support could invalidate the setup. The invalidation zone remains at $2.41, meaning a move below that level would negate the bullish thesis and likely trigger deeper losses. For now, the favourable risk-to-reward profile remains intact, making OMNI a closely watched asset. While the altcoin has gained 159% over the past 90 days, underscoring the optimism surrounding its transition to Nomina, the coming weeks will test whether this enthusiasm can withstand the turbulence caused by exchange delistings and migration logistics.

Meanwhile, news around Pepe Coin shows traders watching breakout resistance and whale activity for signs that its bullish cycle could resume. Remittix enters as a serious contender in this environment: while SHIB and PEPE battle for meme coin glory, Remittix offers PayFi utility, solid metrics and recent developments that some analysts believe could generate huge returns before January. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: What Analysts Are Saying Technical signals around Shiba Inu are mixed but leaning toward a potential rally. SHIB is holding support near $0.000013, and analysts point out that if SHIB breaks above $0.000017, targets of $0.000032 or even $0.000035 may be possible. Without a solid catalyst like large exchange partnerships or renewed demand from new wallet addresses, SHIB’s upside may remain capped until momentum returns. Pepe Coin News & Momentum Pepe Coin is showing signs of resurgence in volatility and speculative interest. PEPE is consolidating near $0.0000107 after recent spikes to about $0.00001259, and resistance around $0.00001270 is being closely watched. Without deeper utility or use case growth, PEPE’s volatility may deliver big moves but also carries a significant risk of correction if resistance holds firm. Remittix Could Build 100s Of Millionaires By January Remittix is increasingly contrasted with SHIB and PEPE because it aims to combine meme energy with real utility. Where SHIB and PEPE are driven largely by narrative, burns, and community hype, Remittix offers features that suggest scalability and sustainability. Early adopters see value in its PayFi wallet features, cross-border transfers, and rewards mechanisms. Some analysts are speculating that Remittix could generate outsized returns by January for those positioned early. Remittix is verified by CertiK and ranked number one among pre-launch tokens by CertiK. Its beta wallet is live and supports crypto to bank transfers in over 30 countries. The project has raised over $26.3million, sold over 668 million RTX tokens, and the token price is $0.1080. Remittix has secured two CEX listings after surpassing $20 million and $22 million milestones, and another listing is coming. Here are what make Remittix especially well placed to potentially deliver life-changing returns: Audited by CertiK, built with trust and transparency Direct crypto to bank transfers in 30+ countries Mass market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd Utility first token powering real transaction volume Time-sensitive entry point before listings and parabolic growth These features give Remittix more than promise; they show product execution, trust, and positioning. For investors considering SHIB or PEPE, Remittix may offer a better reward-to-risk ratio thanks to its utility, metrics, and growing ecosystem strength. Who’s Most Likely To Bring The Gains Shiba Inu continues to capture attention thanks to the potential to rally to $0.000032 or more if resistance breaks, but SHIB’s upside remains constrained by vast supply, regulatory and security concerns, and community fatigue. Pepe Coin may rebound toward $0.000017 or higher under the right conditions, but its dependency on hype makes it a riskier bet. Remittix, though newer, presents a blend of utility, solid metrics, and attractive reward mechanics that could make it the asset capable of making hundreds of millionaires by January. Remittix stands out for bridging the gap between meme coin excitement and functional crypto finance, and could well be the story to watch in the months ahead.

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has just delivered an urgent announcement that demands your attention. The platform has temporarily suspended all deposit and withdrawal services for UXLINK due to what it describes as a potential UXLINK security issue. This crucial development highlights the ever-present need for vigilance in the fast-paced world of digital assets. What’s Behind the Urgent UXLINK Security Suspension? Bithumb, one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, didn’t make this decision lightly. The exchange issued a formal warning to its investors, stating that it has identified ‘circumstances suggesting a potential security issue’ with the UXLINK token. This means that during their routine monitoring and due diligence, Bithumb’s security team found something concerning enough to warrant immediate action. The specifics of the identified vulnerability haven’t been fully disclosed yet. However, the move underscores Bithumb’s commitment to safeguarding user assets. For now, the suspension will remain in place until the stability and integrity of the UXLINK token can be thoroughly confirmed. This proactive measure is a common practice among reputable exchanges when faced with potential risks. This temporary halt serves as a critical pause, allowing Bithumb to conduct a deeper investigation without exposing users to potential harm. It’s a stark reminder that even established tokens can face unexpected challenges related to their underlying security. Why is Robust UXLINK Security So Critical for Investors? For investors, the news of a suspension due to security concerns can be unsettling. When an exchange identifies a potential vulnerability, it directly impacts trust and the perceived safety of your holdings. A robust UXLINK security framework is paramount for any digital asset, as it protects against various threats, including hacking, exploits, and unauthorized access. The decision by Bithumb acts as a protective shield. Imagine if the exchange allowed transactions to continue while a significant flaw existed; users could potentially lose funds. This incident emphasizes why choosing an exchange with strong security protocols and a transparent communication policy is vital. They are your first line of defense. What does this mean for current UXLINK holders on Bithumb? While deposits and withdrawals are paused, your existing UXLINK tokens remain on the exchange. However, you won’t be able to move them in or out until the issue is resolved. It’s a moment for caution, not panic, but it does necessitate staying informed. Navigating UXLINK Security Risks: What’s Next for Holders? The immediate future for UXLINK on Bithumb involves a period of intense scrutiny. Bithumb’s team will be working diligently to confirm the token’s stability. This investigation could involve technical audits, collaboration with the UXLINK project team, and assessing the nature and scope of the identified security issue. Only once they are fully satisfied will services resume. Investors should closely monitor official announcements from Bithumb. Avoid relying on unverified information from social media. Transparency from the exchange is key during such times. If you hold UXLINK on other exchanges, it might be prudent to review their security advisories as well, though Bithumb’s suspension specifically applies to their platform. This situation serves as a valuable lesson in portfolio diversification and risk management. While Bithumb’s action aims to protect, it highlights that even seemingly stable assets can present unforeseen UXLINK security challenges. Always consider the potential for such events when investing in cryptocurrencies. Bithumb’s temporary suspension of UXLINK deposits and withdrawals due to potential UXLINK security concerns is a significant event for its users. While disruptive, it underscores the exchange’s commitment to investor safety. As the investigation unfolds, staying informed through official channels and understanding the implications of such security measures remains paramount for all cryptocurrency investors. This incident reminds us that vigilance and due diligence are constant companions in the crypto journey. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Bithumb suspend UXLINK services? Bithumb identified circumstances suggesting a potential UXLINK security issue with the token and temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals to protect investors. Are my UXLINK tokens safe on Bithumb? While deposits and withdrawals are suspended, your existing UXLINK tokens remain on the exchange. Bithumb’s action is intended to prevent further risk, but it’s crucial to await their official updates. When will UXLINK services resume on Bithumb? Services will resume once Bithumb confirms the stability and resolves the identified UXLINK security issue. There is no specific timeline provided yet. What should UXLINK holders do now? Monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates. Avoid panic and consider the broader implications for your crypto portfolio. Does this affect UXLINK on other exchanges? Bithumb’s suspension specifically applies to its platform. However, it’s wise to check for similar advisories or news from other exchanges where you might hold UXLINK.

Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), and MAGACOIN FINANCE are some of the major recommendations, with analysts referring to new technical structures, solid on-chain expansion, and market differentiation. Based on the chart structure given by Cardano to the direction of $1.25, the ascending movements of Avalanche and the prospective ETFs, the future looks promising. MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has hit its $14 million presale cap and is gaining traction, completes the trio as one of the best altcoins to monitor towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction Cardano is showing a bullish trend, implying a possible upswing to $1.25. As per TradingView data, ADA is trading within a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart. A close above the upper trendline of about $0.925 would verify a breakout, and a projected target would be around $1.25, which is approximately 38% more than current levels. Since early August, the relative strength index has increased from 40 to 55, which signifies a positive buying momentum. On a shorter time frame, ADA shows a cup-and-handle pattern on the four-hour chart. Bulls aim to clear the neckline around $0.96, which could trigger a move toward $1.20, about 32% above today’s price. ADAUSD 4-Hr Chart Analysis showed that a break above $0.94 is critical for momentum to accelerate toward the $1.25 objective. Market derivatives also signal rising optimism. The open interest in futures at Cardano increased by 22% in a span of 12 days to a high of $1.95 billion. Large price movements can easily follow high open interest, as was the case this year with ADA, almost doubling following a comparable OI spike. More so, the bullish case is enhanced by the added speculation of a possible spot Cardano ETF, where approval odds have recently soared to 90% from 59%. As long as the buying pressure holds and major levels of resistance are broken, analysts think ADA may soon rally and hit its 2024 highs. Combinations of technical patterns, derivatives trading and ETF speculation provide good reasons to believe in a Q4 rally . Avalanche (AVAX) Price to Hit $50 Avalanche is rising due to its fundamentals and expanding ecosystem. On Friday, AVAX was trading at $35, a 137% increase from its yearly low and its highest point since January. The most critical catalysts are the planned $1 billion raise by the Avalanche Foundation to establish two treasury companies to amass AVAX tokens, which will directly increase demand. In the meantime, institutional interest is increasing. Bitwise recently submitted a spot AVAX exchange-traded fund, joining VanEck and Grayscale. Analysts emphasize that Avalanche being a layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum that has a range of ETFs, enhances the chance of being approved by the SEC. This may provide access to more mainstream investment. Bullish sentiment is supported by the network metrics of Avalanche. The chain has increased its supply of stablecoins 32% over the last month to reach $1.9 billion, transactions reached $27.2 million, and 30-day volume has been over $142 billion. DeFi has been strong, with 24-hour volumes reaching $708 million and monthly volumes of up to $13.7 billion, surpassing networks like Sui, Unichain, and Polygon. Technically, AVAX has risen above a double-bottom neckline of $26.70 and a golden cross on the daily chart. Momentum is good with RSI approaching 65 and the Average Directional Index at its highest point since February. Analysts estimate that with long-term demand and a possible approval of the ETF, AVAX shares will increase to a price of $50 in a few weeks. With the strengthening of Avalanche, other upcoming altcoins such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are also under consideration as a way of diversifying growth opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly developing into a top project for 2025. The Ethereum-based token has already surpassed a presale of over $14 million, with over 13,500 early investors already backed and 75% of its early allocation sold. Its stage-based presale system decreases supply in every round, which generates scarcity and incentivizes early involvement and sets the foundation for exchange listing. Also, market analysts have added MAGACOIN FINANCE to the top 2025 altcoins as a Bitcoin alternative with impressive early adoption. As its popularity increases, the project will be in a position to attract attention in the expected altcoin boom in Q4. Conclusion: The last quarter of 2025 is looking promising to be a defining moment for altcoins. Cardano is gaining momentum with strong technical setups and rising futures activity. Therefore, MAGACOIN FINANCE , backed by a fast-moving presale and scarcity-driven tokenomics, is quickly earning a spot among promising new entrants. Collectively, these aspects indicate that ADA, AVAX, and MAGACOIN FINANCE will attract a lot of investor momentum as the market experiences the next bull cycle.",Press Release,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|TRADING|AVAX|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-09-22 18:00:00

This comes amid the downtrend in the XRP price , which has dropped below the psychological $3 level. XRP Ledger Hits New ATH In Active Addresses Amid Price Struggles In an X post , XRPScan revealed that the number of accounts currently active on the XRP Ledger has crossed the 7 million mark, representing a new ATH. The platform explained that this refers to accounts that have maintained a minimum balance of 1 XRP. XRPL validator Vet suggested that a more appropriate term would be “activated accounts” instead of active accounts. However, XRPScan questioned whether activated accounts may imply excluding accounts. The platform added that the total number of accounts ever activated is approximately 7.7 million. Meanwhile, in a separate X post , Vet applauded the XRP Ledger’s growth and described it as just the beginning. He added that on-chain is the new online. Santiment data provides insights into the number of daily active addresses on the XRP Ledger, which refers to users who are actively using the network rather than just accounts. On September 21, there were 38,471 daily active addresses on the network. The daily active addresses on the network have ranged around this level for a while now and well below the highs recorded in June. Back then, the daily active addresses reached as high as 581,080 on June 14. Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger’s adoption has also been on a downtrend. Further data from Santiment shows that the network growth has drastically dropped from a high recorded on July 18, when 11,058 new addresses were added. However, at the moment, the number of new addresses is trending just below 5,000. XRP Price On The Decline Amid Crypto Market Downtrend The new ATH in activated addresses for the XRP Ledger comes as the XRP price declines as part of a crypto market downtrend . The altcoin has dropped below the psychological $3 level and has further lost key support levels in the $2.90 range. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto stated that the 50 EMA looks on track to meet XRP at around $2.77. The analyst further remarked that if the XRP price breaks through this target, it could lead to further downside for the altcoin. He added that $2.65 remains the most critical zone of the upcoming bull run for the altcoin. In line with this, Egrag Crypto declared that while the lower time frames are worth monitoring closely, the higher time frame trends remain crystal clear. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.88, down over 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|Altcoin|Coinmarketcap|Egrag Crypto|EMA|ripple|Santiment|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPL Validator Vet|XRPScan|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|WALLET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-22 18:00:23

The decline comes despite fresh institutional buying, with Tom Lee–led BitMine purchasing approximately $84 million worth of ETH in just 24 hours, lifting its holdings to over 2.15 million coins. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Drops Over 5% – Is This the Start of a Bigger Crash? BitMine’s aggressive accumulation, executed in five separate tranches, proves the growing institutional adoption. However, the market remains in “fade-the-rally” mode, as short-term traders continue to sell into strength. Fed Rate Cut Bounce Fizzles Ethereum (ETH) initially spiked above $4,600 after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a 25 basis-point rate cut and hinted at a softer policy path for 2025. But the rally quickly lost momentum, with selling pressure intensifying as unrealized profits among large holders reached levels last seen in 2021. ETH's price records major losses on the daily chart. Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview On-chain flows indicate that more ETH is moving from staking contracts to centralized exchanges, signaling caution among whales. Likewise, low network fees show subdued on-chain demand, reinforcing bearish short-term sentiment. Technical Outlook: $4,000 Ethereum (ETH) Test in Play From a technical perspective, Ethereum’s price action has turned negative after breaking below its 50-SMA ($4,502) and 200-SMA ($4,396) on the two-hour chart. Analysts note that the breakdown candle resembled a Marubozu pattern, a strong bearish signal that often precedes further downside. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to oversold levels near 18, suggesting conditions are stretched but not yet bullish. Immediate downside targets lie at $4,242, $4,159, and potentially $4,065 if selling pressure persists. A routine retest of the $4,395–$4,502 band is expected; failure to reclaim this level could pave the way for a drop toward $4,000 support. For bulls, only a decisive reclaim above $4,502 would shift momentum back toward $4,588 and $4,699. Until then, traders are advised to treat rallies as shorting opportunities rather than signs of recovery. Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Conviction Despite short-term weakness, institutional accumulation still supports Ethereum’s long-term growth. BitMine’s latest acquisition shows that deep-pocketed investors continue to bet on ETH’s rise, even as short-term volatility unsettles retail traders. The wider market remains delicate, with Bitcoin hovering around $114,000 and major altcoins like XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin also declining. Analysts believe that the upcoming week, marked by Fed Chair Powell’s speech and key U.S. economic reports, could influence Ethereum’s next significant move.

Just as blockchain redefined digital finance, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now orchestrating a revolution of its own. But this isn’t just about groundbreaking algorithms; it’s about the colossal physical and financial AI infrastructure required to power them. As AI models grow more sophisticated, the demand for computational power is skyrocketing, leading to an unprecedented spending spree that will profoundly impact global economies, energy grids, and technological landscapes – a scale that even seasoned crypto enthusiasts will find astonishing. What’s Fueling the Trillion-Dollar AI Boom? Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently made a staggering prediction: an estimated $3 to $4 trillion will be invested in AI infrastructure by the end of this decade. This isn’t just a projection; it’s a testament to the furious pace of development within the AI sector. The quest to build and train advanced AI models is creating an insatiable demand for computing power, pushing global power grids to their limits and straining the industry’s capacity to construct the necessary facilities. This incredible AI boom is being driven by the very companies developing AI products, transforming their balance sheets into blueprints for the future. From tech giants like Microsoft and Google to innovative startups like OpenAI, the race is on to secure the computational backbone for the next generation of intelligence. Microsoft’s Pivotal OpenAI Investment and Cloud Evolution The contemporary AI boom arguably ignited with Microsoft’s strategic move in 2019: a $1 billion OpenAI investment . This wasn’t merely a cash injection; it fundamentally reshaped the landscape by making Microsoft the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI. As the computational demands for training models like GPT-3 and subsequent iterations soared, a significant portion of Microsoft’s investment began flowing as Azure cloud credits, proving mutually beneficial. Microsoft boosted its Azure sales figures, while OpenAI secured crucial funding for its most substantial operational expense – raw compute power. Over the years, Microsoft’s commitment deepened, reaching nearly $14 billion, a move anticipated to yield substantial returns as OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit entity. However, the dynamics of this exclusive partnership have recently evolved. In January, OpenAI announced it would no longer be solely reliant on Microsoft’s cloud, granting Azure a right of first refusal but allowing exploration of other providers if needs weren’t met. This strategic diversification was mirrored by Microsoft, which began exploring other foundation models for its own AI products, fostering greater independence. The success of the Microsoft-OpenAI model has set a precedent. Other major cloud providers are now forging similar alliances. Anthropic, a prominent AI research company, secured an $8 billion investment from Amazon, engaging in kernel-level hardware modifications to optimize for AI training on AWS. Google Cloud has also brought smaller AI innovators like Loveable and Windsurf into its fold as “primary computing partners,” albeit without direct equity investments. Even OpenAI itself has continued to expand its compute acquisition strategy, securing a massive $100 billion investment from Nvidia in September, ensuring ample capacity for purchasing the company’s highly coveted GPUs. Oracle AI’s Ascendance in the Compute Race Amidst the escalating demand for compute power, Oracle has emerged as a formidable player in the AI infrastructure arena, particularly through its strategic partnership with OpenAI. On June 30th, 2025, Oracle sent shockwaves through the tech world by revealing a $30 billion cloud services deal with an unnamed partner in an SEC filing – a figure surpassing its cloud revenues for the entire previous fiscal year. The partner was subsequently identified as OpenAI, instantly positioning Oracle alongside Google as a key post-Microsoft hosting provider for the AI giant. Unsurprisingly, this announcement sent Oracle’s stock soaring. Just a few months later, on September 10th, Oracle made an even more monumental announcement: a five-year, $300 billion deal for compute power, slated to commence in 2027. This unprecedented agreement propelled Oracle’s stock even higher, briefly elevating founder Larry Ellison to the status of the world’s richest man. The sheer scale of this commitment is astonishing; OpenAI does not currently possess $300 billion to spend, indicating immense projected growth for both companies and a profound belief in the future of AI. This deal, even before a single dollar is spent, has firmly cemented Oracle’s position as a leading Oracle AI infrastructure provider and a financial force that commands attention. The Construction of Hyperscale Data Centers: Meta’s Massive Investments For tech behemoths like Meta, which already possess vast legacy infrastructure, the journey into advanced AI infrastructure is complex and incredibly capital-intensive. Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated Meta’s ambitious plan to invest $600 billion in US infrastructure by the end of 2028. The first half of 2025 alone saw the company spend $30 billion more than the previous year, primarily driven by its expanding AI aspirations. While some of this expenditure covers substantial cloud contracts, such as a recent $10 billion agreement with Google Cloud, an even greater portion is being directed towards constructing two monumental hyperscale data centers . One such project is Hyperion, a sprawling 2,250-acre site in Louisiana, projected to cost an estimated $10 billion to build. This facility is designed to provide an astounding 5 gigawatts of compute power and notably includes an innovative arrangement with a local nuclear power plant to manage its immense energy demands. Another significant project, Prometheus, a smaller site in Ohio, is expected to come online in 2026, powered by natural gas. However, this rapid expansion of hyperscale data centers comes with significant environmental implications. Elon Musk’s xAI, for instance, constructed its own hybrid data center and power-generation plant in South Memphis, Tennessee. This facility has rapidly become one of the county’s largest emitters of smog-producing chemicals, attributed to a string of natural gas turbines that experts contend violate the Clean Air Act. The balance between technological advancement and environmental responsibility is becoming an increasingly critical challenge in this high-stakes race. The “Stargate” Moonshot: An Ambitious AI Infrastructure Vision In a bold move signaling the geopolitical importance of AI infrastructure , President Trump, just two days after his second inauguration, announced a joint venture known as “Stargate.” This ambitious project, named after the 1994 film, involved SoftBank, OpenAI, and Oracle, with a colossal goal: to spend $500 billion building AI infrastructure across the United States. Hype surrounding the project was immense, with Trump proclaiming it “the largest AI infrastructure project in history,” a sentiment echoed by Sam Altman, who deemed it “the most important project of this era.” The conceptual framework for Stargate involved SoftBank providing the substantial funding, with Oracle overseeing the construction and OpenAI offering crucial input on technical specifications. President Trump pledged to streamline regulatory processes, removing potential hurdles to accelerate the build. Yet, skepticism emerged early on, notably from Elon Musk, a business rival of Altman’s, who questioned the project’s financial viability. As the initial fervor subsided, the project’s momentum faced challenges, with Bloomberg reporting in August that the partners were struggling to reach consensus. Despite these obstacles, progress has been made, with the construction of eight data centers underway in Abilene, Texas, and the final building anticipated to be completed by the end of 2026, underscoring the enduring ambition behind this immense AI infrastructure initiative. The race to build the foundational infrastructure for artificial intelligence is far more than a technological challenge; it’s an economic and strategic imperative. From Microsoft’s pioneering OpenAI investment to Oracle’s audacious multi-billion dollar deals, and Meta’s commitment to building massive hyperscale data centers , the scale of investment is reshaping global industry. The environmental impact and the immense strain on existing resources are significant concerns that will require innovative solutions. As the AI boom continues its rapid ascent, the foundational infrastructure being laid today will determine the capabilities and limitations of tomorrow’s intelligent systems, creating both unparalleled opportunities and complex challenges for the world ahead.

With prices hovering near the $2.8 to $3.0 range, the digital asset sits at a critical juncture. Market participants are weighing the combined impact of technical signals, institutional flows , and a far more stable regulatory environment than in recent years. The question dominating the conversation is whether these forces can propel XRP into a strong rally before the end of October. CryptoBull’s Price Target Prominent X analyst CryptoBull has projected a bold target of $5 for XRP by the close of October 2025, sharing a detailed weekly chart to support the call. The chart highlights a large symmetrical triangle pattern that has been tightening since midyear. Such formations often precede significant price moves, and the yellow breakout path on the chart reflects a classic measured-move calculation that aligns with the $5 forecast. #XRP price will be $5 by end of October! pic.twitter.com/EoFQNHG4YJ — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) September 22, 2025 Technical Indicators Supporting the Case Technical analysts across the market have noted that XRP’s weekly chart is showing constructive signals. Momentum indicators, including long-term moving averages, hint at a potential “golden cross,” a pattern that historically suggests upward strength. The symmetrical triangle pattern itself indicates that if XRP can close decisively above the upper trendline on strong weekly volume , a measured move toward the $4–$5 range becomes technically reasonable. However, without a convincing breakout and follow-through, traders remain cautious of a possible false move. Beyond technicals, XRP benefits from a clearer regulatory landscape. The resolution of its court case removes a major source of uncertainty, making XRP more attractive to institutional investors who previously hesitated due to legal risks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Conditions and Risks Despite the optimistic projections, market volatility remains a key factor. XRP recently slipped more than 5%, trading at $2.83 as of report time amid broader crypto market weakness tied to global macroeconomic shifts. For CryptoBull’s target to materialize, XRP would need to rally roughly 60–80% in a short window, demanding not only technical breakout confirmation but also favorable macro conditions and sustained trading volume. Outlook CryptoBull’s $5 end-of-October target places XRP at the center of one of the market’s most closely watched trades. While the technical and fundamental factors present a compelling bullish case, success hinges on a decisive breakout and continued investor confidence. Traders and investors alike will be watching the weekly closes and volume spikes in the days ahead, as the next move could define XRP’s trajectory for the remainder of 2025.

Bitcoin is now losing ground against critical moving averages , including the 100-day and 200-day EMAs positioned at $114,635 and $114,180, respectively. The breach of these technical levels has analysts questioning whether the bull market has reached its end, as multiple indicators now point toward bearish territory. Bitcoin Price Slip Points to Bull Market Exhaustion CryptoQuant data reveals Bitcoin’s taker buy/sell ratio has fallen to -0.86, a key sentiment indicator that signals bearish market conditions. This metric serves as a barometer for market control – values below 1 suggest selling pressure dominates, while readings above 1 indicate buying strength prevails. Source: CryptoQuant The current -0.86 reading demonstrates that sell orders are significantly outweighing buy orders, painting a picture of pessimistic market sentiment. Historical context shows that this level last appeared during the January 20 market top, around $109,000, which preceded a three-month decline that erased 32% of Bitcoin’s value, with prices falling to $74,000 in April. Joao Wedson, Founder & CEO of Alphractal, revealed that Bitcoin’s latest dip shows signs of cycle exhaustion that many market participants are not paying attention to. According to his SOPR Trend Signal , which excels at showing when blockchain profitability is declining, never in Bitcoin’s history have investors accumulated BTC so late and at such high STH Realized prices of $111,400. Source: X/ Alphractal Similarly, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio is weaker than in 2024, meaning risk versus return is lower, reducing profit potential that won’t attract as many institutions as most people believe. Social interest has dropped sharply, and according to Wedson, many market makers are partially selling their BTC and taking their stablecoin reserves to invest more in altcoins after a long accumulation period. Bitcoin is already showing signs of cycle exhaustion — and very few are seeing it. The SOPR Trend Signal is excellent at signaling when blockchain profitability is drying up. Never in Bitcoin’s history have investors accumulated BTC so late and at such high prices. Maybe only… pic.twitter.com/I1GBdEJH03 — Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) September 22, 2025 “ So, even if BTC hits new all-time highs, and there’s nothing wrong with that, profitability will remain low, and the real focus will be on altcoins ,” Wedson added. Crypto trader Honey_xbt believes BTC is in a consolidation zone, with the next direction dependent on where Bitcoin closes. According to her analysis, a 1-day close above $117,500 would be highly bullish and could send Bitcoin to new highs above $124,000. okay enough drama for the day, let's get back to business BTC seems to be in our chop zone and our next direction would be based on where we close 1D above 117.5k = super bullish and we probably go for new highs below 111.8k = bearish and we probably go for new lows around… pic.twitter.com/FugTVJRAeK — Honey (@honey_xbt) September 22, 2025 However, a close below $111,800 would be bearish and could see BTC target new lows around the 1-day EMA200 near $106,000. Historical Q4 Rally Could Overwrite Bitcoin Bearish Price Slip Market observers show conflicting views regarding potential October gains following the recent bearish shift. Despite current bearish indicators, several positive factors could send the Bitcoin price upward by next month. The Federal Reserve’s recent pivot to monetary easing shows that market participants expect the rate-cutting cycle to continue with two additional reductions projected before the end of 2026. Historical trends also support optimism for the final quarter of the year. Since 2013, Bitcoin has demonstrated particularly strong performance during Q4, delivering average returns of roughly 85% during this seasonal period. Bearish Wedge Pattern Signals a BTC Dip to $108k On the technical front, Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a clear bearish wedge pattern breakdown from the recent uptrend channel. After failing to sustain momentum near $117,836, the price broke down from the rising wedge, confirming weakness and shifting the short-term bias bearish. The rejection has already taken BTC toward the first target zone around $112,967, with momentum signaling further downside pressure. If selling continues, the next key support sits near $110,662, followed by a deeper retracement toward $108,073, which aligns with the final projected target of the wedge. Overall, the technical setup suggests Bitcoin is likely to extend lower in the short term, with rallies more likely to face resistance unless buyers reclaim $115,000 levels to invalidate the bearish outlook.

The task force, announced on Sep. 22 by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, will bring together officials from HM Treasury, the U.S. Treasury and market regulators across both jurisdictions. Two of the goals of the task force is to develop approaches to digital asset oversight and explore new opportunities in wholesale digital markets. The group will report within 180 days through the existing U.K.–U.S. Financial Regulatory Working Group, delivering recommendations shaped in close consultation with private industry, the release said. “London and New York remain the twin pillars of global finance,” Reeves said, adding that closer alignment is essential as technology reshapes markets. Bessent echoed that sentiment during a Downing Street roundtable, calling the initiative a commitment to ensuring innovation in financial markets “does not stop at borders.” Crypto at the forefront While the task force’s remit spans traditional capital markets, digital assets are expected to take center stage. Officials will look at both short-term measures, such as facilitating cross-border use cases while legislation remains in flux, and long-term strategies for advancing wholesale digital market infrastructure. “With the creation of a joint U.K.-U.S. task force on capital markets and digital assets, we can expect meaningful developments on both sides of the Atlantic,” Mark Aruliah, head of EMEA policy and regulatory affairs at Elliptic, said in an email. While noting that the U.S. has “set the pace with a pro-innovation agenda,” Aruliah suggested the task force “signals a strong intent to close that gap and position the U.K. more competitively.” More broadly, the firm described the collaboration as a validation of the digital assets industry itself: “Structured collaboration of this kind will strengthen a shared commitment to higher standards of transparency and accountability, and may establish a global benchmark if other jurisdictions follow suit.”",Finance|HM Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-09-22 18:10:29

This transaction represents 5% of the total supply. In addition to its a16z Crypto investment in April, the Foundation has repurchased over $150 million in ZRO this year. The statement noted that Stargate revenues will be the primary source of future buybacks, but this latest acquisition is a completely independent and separate transaction. The LayerZero Foundation also noted that further buybacks may be made if similarly attractive opportunities arise.

Snapshot data showed that over 15,100 addresses participated in the vote, with approximately 95% of the voting power supporting the deal. However, further analysis revealed that over half of the votes came from just two addresses. This was striking compared to the Stargate DAO's past voting dynamics. With the agreement, Stargate, valued at approximately $110 million, returned to the control of its original developer and the Stargate DAO was dissolved. *This is not investment advice.

The altcoin briefly slipped below the $4100 mark, which triggered a significant shift in trader positioning across major exchanges. As such, data indicates that sellers may be in control. Bears Dominate Futures Markets On Binance, cumulative open interest (OI) dropped to $9.84 billion, and nearly returned to $9.58 billion – the support levels last seen on September 6 and representing a 15% decline from its September 13 peak of $10.73 billion. This contraction in OI, coupled with a net taker volume of -$1.66 billion, highlights aggressive sell-side dominance likely driven by panic exits or tactical position unwinds, CryptoQuant explained in its latest report. Such a retracement in OI alongside deeply negative taker volume is indicative of capitulation-style behavior among late buyers, pointing to a market under pressure. Funding rates across exchanges also supported this bearish tone. Binance funding turned slightly negative at -0.004%, while OKX reflected the strongest short-side control with -0.02%. Other platforms, such as Bitmex, Bybit, HTX Global, and Deribit, are hovering near zero or negative, which suggests market-wide pessimism across the ETH derivatives ecosystem. Negative funding implies that shorts are paying longs, meaning seller dominance or forced liquidation of long positions has entered at higher prices. Previous instances show that such conditions, particularly deeply negative funding near established support zones, can indicate capitulation and potential oversold levels, often preceding periods of consolidation or rebound. Overall, Ethereum’s current derivatives reveal a market dominated by short positions, aggressive exits, and cautious sentiment. For now, the combination of falling open interest, negative net taker volume, and bearish funding rates depicts that bears are firmly in control of the near-term ETH market. Not all commentary is pessimistic; certain experts view this dip as a chance to strategically buy ETH. Positioning For Next Leg Upward? Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, for one, observed that the market is undergoing a significant flush. According to him, this phase of selling pressure is natural and healthy, since it creates opportunities for strategic accumulation. Van de Poppe pointed to key price regions where buyers are actively scooping up ETH. As such, these zones could serve as entry points for traders positioning themselves for the “next leg upwards.” The post Ethereum Derivatives Flash Warning: Open Interest Drops 15%, Funding Goes Negative appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|ETHBTC|ETHUSD|Ethereum (ETH) Price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-09-22 18:17:59
