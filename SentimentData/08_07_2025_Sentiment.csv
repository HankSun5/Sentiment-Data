BONK developers announced in a statement that the token burn amount was set at 1 trillion tokens. This corresponds to approximately $22 million at the time of writing. BONK's market value is currently around $1.8 billion. Although the developers did not give a clear date or time, they announced a few minutes ago that they were about to reach 1 million token holders. One million holders soon Then one trillion $BONK burned — BONK!!!

It should not be forgotten that memecoins are particularly high-risk assets. In such developments, especially in the cryptocurrency market and memecoins, the expected impact may sometimes not come or may have been priced in in advance. It should also be kept in mind that the burn level is low compared to the total market value. *This is not investment advice.

The regulator has opened a new public comment window, which stalls decision-making. The latest revision mandates that responses be filed within 21 days and rebuttals within 35 days of publication in the Federal Register of the filing. The companies also had S-1 registrations with Fidelity, placing it with a Solana ETF on June 13, followed by 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary. The SEC review process has now officially reached a critical evaluation phase, with the agency seeking comments on matters touching on the products’ structure, market integrity, and investor protection systems. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said this was a largely expected delay. More recently, he cited the gradual manner in which the SEC has treated altcoin-secured or tied ETFs, citing regulatory uncertainty as a factor that has chilled broader adoption. MORE delays. @Fidelity 's Solana ETF filing was just delayed as expected. We're still waiting for some sort of movement from the SEC on a generalized digital asset ETP framework. pic.twitter.com/8m2DSdHJYV — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 7, 2025 Push for revised applications hints at progress Even after the most recent hold, the SEC seems to be gearing up toward reviewing more formally. The agency has directed the issuers to revise and refile the Solana ETF applications no later than the end of July. The revisions will also need to contain more current language related to in-kind redemption and staking, which will align with the SEC, which changed its guidance. The demand for amended filings is an indication of a more proactive regulatory approach to altcoin ETFs. According to sources, the SEC plans to rush through at least one SOL-based product before its October 10 deadline to issue a final ruling. There is some internal speculation that reviews will be completed long before that date. In June, the SEC released its initial official guidance regarding exchange-traded products that track digital assets. In parallel, there is a second regulatory document under development. It would potentially cut the ETF listing process timeline in half, bringing down the average timeframe of 200 days to approximately 75. In case of adoption, the change will represent a significant step that will be hailed by crypto ETF applicants, aiming to enter the market faster. Firms turn to workarounds amid delays Some asset managers are diverting to different alternatives as spot ETF authorizations have stalled. Recently, the REX-Osprey Sol + Staking ETF was launched between REX Financial and Osprey Funds. Although not a direct Solana ETF , the product provides exposure to SOL-linked assets and staking-related yields. The ETF shall not directly own Solana, but aims to track its economic profile by applying structured exposure to assets of the Solana ecosystem. Despite their lack of SEC regulation, this launch underscores the growing demand for Solana-related offerings. Other altcoin ETFs , such as those connected to XRP and meme-based tokens, have also been filed, but regulatory decision-making is still pending.

Donald Trump Unleashes on Elon Musk Trump had some choice words for Musk after he announced the creation of the “America Party” in a Saturday, July 5 X post. By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom. https://t.co/9K8AD04QQN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025 “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump stated in part in the July 6 social media post. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States…” Trump also took a swipe at his Democratic political opponents – who have spoken out against his latest crypto ventures in recent months – by stating that they had “lost their confidence and their minds!” “The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump added. Elon Musk Criticizes Trump’s Big Beautiful Big Trump’s commentary comes amid a growing divide between Musk and the sitting U.S. president just months after the X CEO stepped away from his White House role. Musk has openly expressed criticism of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” in recent weeks, arguing that the budget legislation would negatively impact America’s economy. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” he wrote. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Trump indicated in Sunday’s Truth Social post that the long term crypto investor was unhappy with the bill’s lack of an electric vehicle mandate. “I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate – It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had,” Trump said. “He said he had no problems with that – I was very surprised!” It remains to be seen what stance the America Party will have toward digital assets once fully fleshed out.

TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , “TON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community’s interest and enthusiasm, it’s necessary to provide clarity.” According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,” the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE’s joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country’s ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: 🇦🇪 TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. – STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS – 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA – SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED – $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION 🚀 pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, “We fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.” This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk’s xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven’t always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country’s Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a “gold card” program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project.

Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi — ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls “fairer deals.” By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House’s trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. “President Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,” Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz — CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , “Any decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.” Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on “the quality of deals, not the quantity,” but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin’s volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin’s trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC’s 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of “equal lows,” an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. “If buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,” one analyst warned. Still, there’s room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it’s the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump’s economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

This insight is powered by Outset PR , a data-driven crypto communications agency that helps digital assets gain attention through a combination of media intelligence, strategic narrative timing, and performance-driven outreach. The Market Impact This marks the first time XRP has been included in a U.S.-regulated spot ETF, following its long-running legal battles with the SEC. The inclusion legitimizes XRP in the eyes of institutional investors, reinforcing its status as a core asset in the crypto space. Through GDLC’s ETF wrapper, institutional and retail investors can now gain indirect exposure to XRP without needing to hold or custody the token themselves. This lowers the barrier to entry and may drive new capital into XRP markets. With XRP under regulatory scrutiny since 2020 due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its inclusion in a spot ETF signals a turning tide in regulatory perception. This move could influence the approval of other XRP-related financial products in the future. XRP Price Analysis and Prediction Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35. It has been on a positive trend lately. In the past week, its price saw a rise of about 5.7%. Over the past month, it climbed by nearly 7.9%. If XRP can break through the nearest resistance level of $2.43, it might aim for the $2.60 mark, which would mean a potential growth of more than ten percent from its current range. Overall, XRP appears to have a promising outlook, with support levels not too far below, suggesting a strong market interest. The recent price increase and current momentum indicate a healthy interest from investors.

You might wonder which coins truly offer potential and not just empty promises. That’s where this guide helps. We’ve looked into BlockDAG, Toncoin, Hedera, and Litecoin, four names that are grabbing attention for good reasons. Each of these is making waves because of their growth, real use cases, or strong plans for the future. Whether you’re interested in new tech, solid systems, or coins that have stood the test of time, these picks cover it all. And yes, these are some of the fastest growing cryptos worth watching right now. Keep reading to see why they are in focus today. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Growth Numbers with Key Features Already in Place BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing cryptos this year. The project is now in Batch 29, with a current price of $0.0276. But thanks to BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release promo, buyers can grab coins at a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. This brings back one more chance to jump in with a low price. So far, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $332 million and sold 23.5 billion coins. The launch price is set at $0.05, which means early buyers have already seen a 2,660% gain compared to the first batch price. What’s pushing BlockDAG ahead is not just its price. The project has over 2 million users on its mobile mining app. The X30 and X100 mining rigs will ship by July 7, with the X10 rigs coming in August. The team has also passed checks from top security firms like CertiK and Halborn. Big exchange listings are lined up, including MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. BlockDAG shows how a project can build trust while being one of the fastest growing cryptos today. 2. Toncoin: Gaining Momentum with Telegram’s Support Toncoin continues to draw attention as one of the fastest growing cryptos because of its strong link to Telegram. This popular messaging app helps Toncoin reach millions of users easily. The coin is making crypto use simple inside chats, whether for payments or bot functions. This makes its role more than just hype; Toncoin offers a real-world solution people can use now. Toncoin’s price recently touched around $7. Even with the ups and downs of the market, it has held its ground well. More upgrades and tools are coming, so Toncoin still offers a fresh chance for those looking at coins with actual use. It’s not just early excitement, it’s about growth that’s tied to real demand. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Tech Focused and Ready for Business Hedera has carved out a spot among the fastest growing cryptos by offering something different. It runs on Hashgraph, not a traditional blockchain. This tech lets it process transactions faster and with lower fees. Big names like IBM and Google support Hedera as part of its council, adding to its strength. HBAR is trading at around $0.075. Its steady price moves and real-world uses make it stand out. You won’t see sudden price spikes like with meme coins. But Hedera’s true power is in its steady progress. It’s used in areas like identity and supply chains, showing its value beyond just trading. This mix of tech and trusted partnerships keeps Hedera on lists of top coins to check out. 4. Litecoin: Longtime Player Still in the Game Litecoin proves that older coins can still be part of the fastest growing cryptos list. It’s often called digital silver and is known for faster, cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin. People still use it for payments, and it’s accepted widely across exchanges and by merchants. Right now, Litecoin is priced near $73. It’s showing strength again after earlier dips this year. Events like halvings keep Litecoin in the news, but what really keeps it going is trust. Even with newer projects on the scene, Litecoin holds a spot as a solid choice for those who want reliability. Wrap Up! When you look at the fastest growing cryptos, these four projects offer a good mix of what’s working today. BlockDAG offers big growth potential with a rare low entry price during its promo window. Toncoin and Hedera show how crypto can blend with daily tools and business systems. Litecoin proves that being around for years doesn’t mean a coin can’t still deliver. If you’re thinking about getting into crypto or adding to your list, these fastest growing cryptos give you options that are trending for good reasons. Focus on what’s growing for the right reasons and not just hype. BlockDAG’s current low price, Toncoin’s app ties, Hedera’s smart tech, and Litecoin’s steady path are all worth keeping an eye on right now.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining momentum. This scenario raises an intriguing question: which cryptocurrency will make the next big move? Readers will find an in-depth analysis of the current market trends and potential breakout opportunities for both BTC and ETH in this article. This spotlight analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , the leading crypto-native agency that blends media intelligence, strategic timing, and results-driven outreach to help web3 projects break through the noise and capture market attention at the moments that count. Bitcoin Eyes Upward Movement with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price hovers between a bit over $106K and $111K. Since last month, the value has increased by nearly 4%, showing signs of positive momentum. Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin testing the resistance level just under $114K, with further potential to reach nearly $119K if this barrier is crossed. This would mean a possible increase of around 12% from the lower price range. The coin's recent six-month gain of over 11% hints at long-term strength. Support levels at around $103K and $97K help cushion any downside. With such dynamic moves, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a growth opportunity. Ethereum on a Steady Climb: Will It Break New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently moving between two thousand four hundred and nineteen dollars to slightly over two thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. It's been on a gentle rise over the past week with a near two percent increase. Analysts see it challenging the next resistance level at two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars. If it manages to surge past this, the next target to watch is around the three thousand fifty-dollar mark. If achieved, this could mean an increase of about fourteen to twenty-four percent from its current range. As the crypto scene buzzes with anticipation, investors maintain a watchful eye on these key levels.

We don’t want an emperor”. Lula rejected any suggestion of U.S. economic dominance, Reuters reported. The comment came as the BRICS summit wrapped up in Rio de Janeiro on Monday, where leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa pushed back against President Donald Trump’s threat of extra tariffs on their countries. They made clear that emerging economies intend to chart their own course in global trade. Trump’s warning arrived late on Sunday, just as his administration was finalizing a series of trade deals ahead of a July 9 deadline for imposing so-called “retaliatory tariffs.” U.S. officials have said these measures could target any nation whose policies are judged hostile to American interests. A source from the U.S. told Reuters that Washington does not aim to immediately impose a further 10% levy on BRICS imports. Instead, the option would only be used if a country implements what the administration labels measures viewed as unfriendly to U.S. interests. Lula said the BRICS bloc comprises countries pursuing a different approach to the global economic order. He suggested that the desire for change is what unsettles traditional powers. “This is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from the economic perspective” he explained to journalists. In February, Trump escalated the rhetoric by warning of “full-scale duties” if BRICS moved to weaken the U.S. dollar’s role in global markets. In response, Brazil’s BRICS presidency dropped earlier talks on a shared currency, an idea some members had floated the previous year. Brazilian President calls for a slow shift from the dollar in trade On Monday, Lula again called for reducing dependence on the dollar in trade settlements. “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through the dollar,” he said. He added that any change must be gradual and coordinated through discussions among central banks until new arrangements are solidified. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, said that the bloc does not want to single out one power. He was confident that there could still be a trade agreement between the U.S. and South Africa. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that tariffs “should not be used as a tool for coercion and pressuring”. She stressed that the BRICS framework promotes mutually beneficial collaboration and is not aimed at any particular nation. A Kremlin spokesperson echoed that view, saying Russia’s cooperation with BRICS is based on a shared global outlook and “will never be directed against third countries.” India stayed silent towards Trump’s threat. Indonesia’s coordinating minister for economic affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, who attended the summit in Rio, was scheduled to fly to Washington on Monday to lead discussions on U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, which joined as a partner after its 24 % tariffs were removed, said it maintains independent economic policies and does not align itself on ideological grounds. With forums such as the G7 and G20 hampered by divisions and Washington’s “America First” approach, BRICS has positioned itself as a forum for multilateral diplomacy amid rising trade conflicts and regional tensions. In a combined statement on Sunday, summit leaders condemned the recent bombing of Iran and warned that growing tariff barriers threaten the stability of world trade, a veiled critique of U.S. policy. BRICS first came together in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India and China. South Africa joined in 2010, and last year the group expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has accepted an invitation to full membership but is attending this summit only as a partner. More than 30 nations have expressed interest in joining BRICS as either full members or partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The latest blow came just two days after Elon announced plans to create a new political party, a decision that’s now rattling Wall Street and hammering Tesla’s valuation again for a second consecutive session. Elon said Saturday the party’s goal would be to flip “2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” claiming that would give him enough leverage to decide which laws pass. “Enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” Elon wrote. Traders didn’t seem to share his optimism. Shares of Tesla plunged immediately after markets opened Monday, dragging the Nasdaq deeper into red as investors digested the consequences of their CEO turning into a full-time political actor. Elon Musk stands by his decision as Tesla sinks Elon’s renewed focus on politics comes as US equities take broader hits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 400 points Monday, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9%. The entire stock market took a hit after Trump announced new tariffs that will go into effect August 1. The penalties target 14 countries, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia, across a wide range of imports. Trump’s administration said the new tariffs would be just the first batch. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that more announcements are coming this week. She added that Trump will sign an executive order extending the tariff implementation deadline to August 1, replacing his original, earlier date. Dow futures dropped 87 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.16% and 0.15%, respectively, just hours before the cash markets opened Monday. With all that background noise, Elon’s latest headline-grabbing play couldn’t have landed at a worse time. Danny Ives, who leads global tech research at Wedbush Securities, said in a client note that the decision is only making things worse. “Very simply Elon diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Danny wrote Sunday. He added that while Elon’s loyalists will back him no matter what, “there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Elon keeps heading down the political track.” On Sunday, Trump told reporters that Elon’s plan to launch a party was “ridiculous” and said the Tesla CEO had gone “completely off the rails.” Market strategists still think the sell-off may be temporary. Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, told CNBC’s Closing Bell that confusion is playing a big role. “If you go through the details, I don’t even know if anybody understands the difference between what was announced today, what was there previously, and if it will actually be implemented, and which companies it actually impacts,” Parker said Monday. He added that it could just be a breather before earnings season. “So, I think it’s just a little bit of selling as we got the highs, and kind of recalibrating before July earnings season,” he said. “But I don’t think this is the sign of a new regime at all.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It has already launched a cryptoasset named Polaris Share (POLA), which it operates via its subsidiary Polaris Share Tech. Polaris Share (POLA) prices in KRW over the past 12 months.

The media outlet quoted a Polaris Office spokesperson as saying: “Stablecoins are the starting point of the web3 transition. They are part of a digital infrastructure that connects data, payments, and contracts. In the future, we will create a range of new markets, as well as a knowledge-sharing platform centered around POLAKRW.” More South Korean Banks Eye Stablecoin Launches Busan Ilbo , meanwhile, reported that the BNK Financial Group has also applied for 25 stablecoin trademarks.

Contrary to assumptions that he received tokens as compensation for his foundational role in the project, Schwartz confirmed that he acquired his XRP holdings independently from the open market. Early Purchase Confirmed at $0.006 In a recent interaction with the XRP community, Schwartz disclosed that he bought XRP for $0.006 per token. His comments came in response to a post from Stedas , a well-known community figure, who suggested that XRP veterans, often referred to as “OGs”, entered the market when the token was trading around $0.50. Schwartz’s response underlined that his entry was at a significantly earlier and lower valuation. $0.006 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 5, 2025 This clarification also aligns with statements Schwartz has made in the past. In earlier interviews, he explained that he did not receive XRP as part of Ripple’s initial token distribution. Instead, he opted to take Ripple stock, a decision he has publicly reflected on given XRP’s superior liquidity. Schwartz also mentioned that during the early days of Ripple, he was offered the choice to receive his salary in XRP but chose to take payments in cash for immediate financial needs. He emphasized that acquiring XRP from exchanges was always an option available to him. XRP’s Long-Term Price Action and Market Behavior Between 2022 and late 2025, XRP traded near the $0.50 mark for extended periods, providing several windows of opportunity for accumulation at that price level. However, the token eventually broke out above that range during a significant market rally in November 2025, which coincided with a broader uptick across the crypto space. Following this breakout, XRP surpassed both the $0.50 and $1 levels and has more recently maintained a price of around $2.28. During this price surge, many new investors entered the market. Still, long-term holders who purchased during its extended consolidation phase have seen significantly larger gains. Schwartz’s early acquisition at $0.006 places him among the earliest adopters with one of the lowest known entry points. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP at $10 In April, Schwartz revealed that at one point, his XRP balance peaked at 26 million tokens. Although the exact timing of these purchases is unclear, if he acquired the entire amount at his reported entry price of $0.006, the total investment would have amounted to just $156,000. At the current trading price of $2.28 , those 26 million tokens would be valued at approximately $58.5 million. This represents an unrealized gain of over $58 million, assuming the holdings were maintained in full. However, Schwartz has previously stated that he has not sold significant amounts of his XRP, though his current holdings are not publicly known. If XRP were to reach $10, as forecasted by analysts such as EGRAG based on technical indicators, the value of Schwartz’s peak holdings could climb to $260 million, assuming he still holds the full 26 million XRP. While projections vary, Schwartz’s early investment provides a compelling case study of long-term value appreciation in the cryptocurrency sector.

47755541,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=761999,1751931021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47755541.jpeg,Chinese exporters crushed under the weight of rare earth export controls,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-exporters-losers-china-rare-earth/,"China’s dominance in the rare earth supply chain has historically given it leverage over global markets. Its recent export restrictions, however, are having a lasting negative effect on the sector. Chinese magnet producers are now facing piling inventories while also dealing with a failing economy and weakened EV demand. China’s rare earth export restrictions , which were implemented in April as a retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have dealt a heavy blow to the country’s domestic magnet manufacturers, many of whom were already contending with a weak economy and declining demand for electric vehicle (EV) makers. Rare earth magnets are essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and a host of other high-tech applications, and China produces around 90% of the world’s supply. Chinese exporters crushed under the weight of rare earth export controls Public filings from the 11 largest listed Chinese magnet producers show that exports accounted for 18% to 50% of their 2024 revenues, which shows the sector’s reliance on international customers. The short-term fallout has been severe on the industry. Magnet exports have dropped by 75% within two months of the restrictions, and some global automakers were also forced to pause production. In the meantime, inventory was piling up in domestic warehouses as producers waited on export licenses, according to Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange, a state-backed trading platform. “Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends—disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” Ellie Saklatvala, the head of metal pricing at Argus, said. Some small and mid-sized producers responded by cutting production by 15% in April and May, according to industry insiders. But for many, this was not enough to stave off what the Baotou exchange described as a “crisis” for local magnet makers. Long-term uncertainty despite rare earth control easing Even though the U.S. and China announced a deal on June 27 to reverse the export restrictions , the damage has already been done. The Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange warned that any resumption of normal export activity would take time, stating that inventory levels remain high and licensing requirements continue to delay shipments. “Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals—such as antimony—it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” Argus’ Saklatvala said. Export curbs on germanium and antimony imposed in 2023 and 2024 still haven’t fully recovered. Europe is still receiving only a fraction of the antimony volumes seen before the controls. This has already impacted lead-acid battery production, particularly in the automotive sector. In the case of rare earths, the challenge is compounded by the specialized nature of magnet products. Many of them are tailor-made for specific clients and cannot be easily resold within China, forcing companies to store finished goods while they await the necessary licenses. Four industry sources told Reuters that the licensing process was both opaque and burdensome, further complicating the recovery efforts. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said. “The large amounts of information now required by licensing authorities represent a permanent change for the industry and will add delays and costs for producers.” Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co. noted in its April annual report that deteriorating international conditions could cut into export revenue. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had obtained export licenses and that production remained normal, but refrained from making detailed comments until its upcoming financial filings. Industry analysts and insiders speculate that the increased pressure could spur consolidation among the hundreds of manufacturers that populate China’s rare earth sector , which may not be a bad outcome for Beijing. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” said Abraham. Two rare earth magnet manufacturers told Reuters anonymously that they expect significant revenue declines this year, although they didn’t offer exact forecasts. “The impact on our export business will be huge, although it’s hard to tell exactly how much loss we will suffer,” said one of the producers. In April, share prices of listed magnet producers fell sharply following the export restrictions, but they have recovered somewhat in recent months. According to Cory Combs, the head of critical mineral research at consultancy Trivium China, the rebound is not based on any tangible improvement in the business outlook. “I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” Combs said. And because many magnet makers are privately held, public share prices only reveal part of the story. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-heating-up-nvt-golden-cross-hints-at-potential-local-top/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently – on June 16 – it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn’t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don’t rush to exit – historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC’s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action ​​The NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing? For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a “deceptive setup,” warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode forecasts BTC’s short-term peak at $117,000. At press time, BTC trades at $108,204, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The sale will be done on both Gate.com and on the site itself, Pump.fun, with 150 billion tokens sold at $0.004 each. This is 15 percent of the total supply, amounting to up to 4 billion in the project. According to a page on Gate crypto exchange, which appeared to have been deleted after mass social media commentary, the sale will be on a first-come, first-served basis. It will be held over 72 hours or until the allocation is exhausted. The buyer will not face any purchase limit, but must also hit a minimum. Separate announcements on the details of distribution and trading will be made on official channels. 🚨 @pumpdotfun Public Token Sale: All You Need to Know – Token: $PUMP – Total Supply: 1 trillion – Date: July 12 – July 15 (3 days) – Tokens for Sale: 150 billion – Sale Price: $0.004 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $4 billion pic.twitter.com/8jijGWgVBp — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 7, 2025 “For individual subscriptions, as long as the quota is sufficient, only a minimum purchase amount is required and there is no upper limit,” the FAQ page noted. The PUMP token is the utility token of the expanding Pump.fun ecosystem. Pumpfun has established itself as a frictionless market that lists tokens on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to mint and trade freely without any costs or programming skills. Every newly minted token entails a standard fair launch model. Pumpfun offers zero pre-mines and zero team distribution, combined with zero trading taxes, making it attractive to traders and memecoin developers alike. Revenue falls 92% from January peak as user interest declines In spite of its scheduled token launch, Pump.fun has suffered a significant drop in its protocol income and fee earnings. According to on-chain metrics provided by DeFi Llama, daily revenue dropped to $533,410 on July 6. Fees generated were less than $922,890- a daily low since March 2025. The platform generated a high of $7.07 million in revenue and fees on January 23. This is a 92% drop in revenue and 86% in fees. Despite the temporary surge in late March that saw fees rebound to $6.6 million, revenue did not pass $2.05 million across the same interval. This trend of weakness can also be found in monthly data. Pump.fun recorded a combined fee and revenue of $137.12 million in January. In June, the fee totals fell to $64.47 million, or only about half the high mark. June revenues were only $39.08 million, or less than 30% of the January high. According to Dune Analytics, as of July, less than 0.01 percent of addresses had generated more than $1 million in profits on the platform, with more than 60% of users registering losses. Recently, Pump.fun has received renewed competition in the form of BONKs meme coin launchpad, LetsBonk, backflipping Pump.fun in tokens created for the first time on Monday. Notable meme tokens such as Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) were generated on Pump.fun, and other previously popular tokens are generated through the platform, such as Moo Deng and Chill Guy.

FCA Exposes London Crypto Scheme Between February 2017 and June 2019, Bedi and Mavanga defrauded at least 65 investors out of a total of £1,541,799, nearly equivalent to $2,100,000 USD. According to a November 2024 press release , Bedi and Mavanga cold-called consumers to direct them to a website offering crypto investment opportunities. In reality, the site and its supposed high return cryptocurrency offerings were a sham for their own financial gain. Bedi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and money laundering offences at a May 2023 hearing. Meanwhile, Mavanga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and possession of false identification documents with an improper intention in June 2023. ‘Bedi and Mavanga lured investors with promises of high returns on crypto investments, but their schemes were nothing but a callous scam,” Smart said in a statement at the time. “If you’re contacted out of the blue about an investment opportunity that sounds too good to be true, then it probably is,” he continued. “If you’re in any doubt – don’t invest.” The post London Duo Jailed for $2 Million Crypto Scheme appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|FCA|UK|UK Crypto,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-07 23:47:38
47756651,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762008,1751932207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47756651.jpeg,China’s central bank is quietly surveying financial institutions about the U.S. dollar’s weakness,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-pboc-poking-about-dollar-weakness/,"The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has reportedly reached out to financial institutions in recent days to assess market sentiment surrounding the ongoing weakness of the U.S. dollar. According to people familiar with the matter cited by Reuters, the PBOC sent out an informal survey last week, probing for opinions on why the dollar has been slipping, how long the trend might last, and what it could mean for the Chinese yuan. The act signals that Beijing may be growing uneasy about the yuan’s recent gains against the faltering dollar and the potential knock-on effects on Chinese exports. The yuan has steadied while the dollar slumps The U.S. dollar has had a bruising 2025. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, has fallen 11% so far this year, its worst start since 1973. Since early April when President Donald Trump announced a broad freeze on tariffs, the dollar has tumbled 6.6% as markets began pricing in looser U.S. trade and fiscal policies. In contrast, China’s yuan has held relatively steady, gaining about 1.3% over the same period. That’s good news for consumers and importers, but not so much for Chinese exporters who suddenly find their goods more expensive on the global market, just when they need every edge in a slowing economy. The dollar’s decline has now put the PBOC in a delicate spot . On the one hand, a stronger yuan helps reduce imported inflation and reinforces Beijing’s image as a steady hand in global finance. On the other, it could squeeze manufacturers and exporters, especially as the country tries to revive growth after a bumpy few years. The PBOC has long preferred stability over sharp moves, and its governor, Pan Gongsheng said earlier this year that keeping the yuan “reasonably stable” is essential for both domestic and global confidence. The survey could be a precursor to policy action The survey alone doesn’t signal immediate policy change, but it could be a first step. In similar situations in the past, the PBOC has used subtle levers to manage the yuan’s value without direct intervention. In April , the central bank reportedly nudged state-owned banks to curb dollar buying, a move many saw as a quiet way of putting a floor under the yuan. Most analysts believe the PBOC is unlikely to intervene unless the yuan strengthens dramatically. But the timing of this latest outreach has raised eyebrows. It comes just days before the expiration of Trump’s 90-day global tariff pause, set to end on Wednesday, July 10, and just a month ahead of the expiration of separate U.S. tariffs on Chinese tech imports.

The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins. According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we’re breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024. Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC . “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we’ll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. “The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it’s going to be providing a big move. Given that we’ve hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we’ll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor ( TAO ). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target. “TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

If Bitcoin continues to double in value each year until 2030, it could drive substantial gains across the crypto sector, including for XRP. This projection, though ambitious, aligns with some market forecasts and long-term bullish expectations. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $108,000 . Should it sustain a doubling pattern annually, it would reach $216,000 in 2026, $432,000 in 2027, and by 2029, surpass $1.7 million. By 2030, its value could climb to roughly $3.45 million, representing a cumulative increase of around 3,100%. This outlook corresponds with previous predictions, such as one from Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer, who suggested Bitcoin could hit $3.5 million by the decade’s end. If XRP mirrors this percentage growth, the implications could be significant. With XRP currently valued at $2.28, a 3,100% increase would place its price at approximately $70.72 per token. While this is a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the potential upside should market dynamics remain favorable. XRP’s Correlation With Bitcoin and Market Behavior Although XRP and Bitcoin are different in utility and structure, their market prices often move in tandem. Over the past month, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has generally followed Bitcoin’s market direction. There was a brief exception from June 25 to June 28, when XRP experienced a sharp drop while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. However, since then, both assets have resumed similar movement patterns. This price correlation has both advantages and risks. When Bitcoin experiences upward momentum, XRP often benefits . Conversely, Bitcoin downturns tend to weigh on XRP’s value as well. In recent months, despite periods of divergence, XRP has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s trend, particularly during consolidation phases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs in the past five months, altcoins have remained mostly stagnant. This divergence has contributed to an increase in Bitcoin market dominance. However, some analysts anticipate a shift in this trend soon, as altcoins are expected to regain traction during what is commonly referred to as “altcoin season.” Outlook for XRP Amid a Possible Altcoin Recovery XRP, being one of the top altcoins by market capitalization, is well-positioned to benefit from any broader altcoin recovery. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins tend to follow, though often with a delay. If such a recovery materializes, XRP could see renewed momentum and price growth. If Bitcoin’s value increases dramatically over the next five years and XRP continues to follow its market trajectory, a substantial rise in XRP’s price is conceivable. Although market predictions are inherently speculative, the long-term potential remains compelling, especially for investors seeking exposure to top-tier altcoins influenced by Bitcoin’s performance.

Mark Zuckerberg’s mobile-based Threads, launched as a simpler alternative to Musk’s X, reached 115.1 million active users regularly on phones last month, according to Similarweb data reported by TechCrunch . That figure places it just behind 32 million daily users on X mobile in the same timeframe. Even more striking, Threads has climbed 127.8 percent compared with June last year, while X’s daily mobile count has dropped by 15.2 percent over those twelve months. Yet the story shifts when desktop visits are taken into account. X still leads on web browsers, with almost 145.8 million daily desktop visits in June, TechCrunch notes. By contrast, Threads managed only 6.9 million desktop views. This split likely reflects user habits: long-time Twitter fans often log in on computers, whereas Instagram users, and now Threads users, tend to open the app briefly on their phones, scroll through a few posts, and then close it. Bluesky still remains a tiny competitor to Threads and X For those curious about Bluesky, the smaller newcomer also saw a spike but remains tiny in comparison. TechCrunch reports that Bluesky’s daily active user count rose by 372.5 percent year after year, reaching around 4.1 million. In total, about 37 million people have registered on the platform so far. Despite its rapid percentage growth, Bluesky is still a minor player next to the giants. However, it does have potential in the long term. And that is less related with new surges of users who appear on the platform only to protest about the policies of another network, and more related to Bluesky’s push towards becoming a more open ecosystem. On the other hand, picking sides between Musk’s X and Zuckerberg’s Threads can feel like a lose-lose decision. While Zuckerberg hasn’t stoked as much controversy as Musk, he did indirectly back and support Musk’s push on X at one point. In the meantime, Threads’ rapid growth shows that Zuckerberg can compete by offering a cleaner, mobile-focused space, even if it doesn’t yet match X’s desktop stronghold. At the end of the day, many users may keep both apps on their phones, dipping into Threads for quick updates and relying on X when they want live-breaking news and constant conversation. The competition is far from over, but for now, Threads is showing that it can at least run alongside X in the race for daily attention.

This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-another-460-run-rare-fiat-signal-returned/,"The Global Money Supply has just hit a rare yearly growth rate of 9%. Here’s what followed for Bitcoin the last few times this signal appeared. Global Money Supply Is Currently Sharply Going Up In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about the latest trend in the Global Money Supply. The “Global Money Supply” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins—62% Held By Just 10 Whales Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the data for the year-on-year growth in the metric: As displayed in the graph, the metric’s value has recently been witnessing an increase, indicating that fiat supply is going up. “Central banks are flooding the market with fiat money,” notes the analyst. Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. “This is extreme and rare,” says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Interestingly, the Apparent Demand indicator has remained positive for Bitcoin even after these transactions, as Edwards has explained in another X post. This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). “Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand is still bullish,” says the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,400, up 0.7% over the last week.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Fund manager Jeff Dyment of Saphira Group wants you to zoom out and stop sweating the short-term charts. His thesis: Data points that suggest institutional bitcoin (BTC) buying is losing steam miss the bigger picture. In a note shared with CoinDesk, Dyment argues that fears of fading institutional demand for bitcoin are overblown, rooted in narrow snapshots of the market. Yes, ETF and corporate purchases have cooled recently – Michael Saylor's Strategy bought just 16,000 BTC last month, down sharply from December’s 171,000 BTC haul. But this, Dyment insists, is not a sign of decline. It’s a natural ebb in what he calls a “cyclical wave” of adoption. “Institutional flows often come in waves rather than a steady linear increase,” Dyment wrote. “Short-term demand fluctuations in the spot market are minor ripples on what is, in fact, a rising tide of institutional engagement.” Dyment points to the addition of 51 new corporate BTC treasuries in the first half of 2025 alone, equal to the total from 2018 to 2022 combined, and a 375% year-over-year increase in corporate BTC buying. Public companies now hold 848,902 BTC, or approximately 4% of the total supply, with Q2 2025 alone seeing 131,000 BTC added to their balance sheets. He also highlights the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs as further evidence of deepening institutional participation. BlackRock’s IBIT fund, now the largest in the world, holds 699,000 BTC, more than 3.3% of total supply, after becoming the fastest-growing ETF in history. U.S. spot ETFs have collectively captured approximately 1.25 million BTC , or roughly 6% of the total supply, in just 18 months since their launch, he points out in the note. Dyment's thesis is finding echoes in the options market. In QCP Capital's recent note, the Singapore-based fund pointed to whales that are continuing to build exposure to upside risk, snapping up September $130K BTC calls and holding $115K/$140K call spreads. “Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110K resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid,” QCP wrote in a Monday note. So while bears may point to stagnant spot flows and the nearly empty mempool as signs of fatigue , Dyment argues those are just surface-level ripples. Underneath, the tide is rising, and Wall Street, with its trillions upon trillions of regulated capital, is hungry for crypto. It's just not going to come all at once. BTQ Pushes Quantum-Safe Framework for Stablecoins BTQ Technologies has introduced the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN), a framework designed to help banks, payment firms, and digital asset platforms future-proof stablecoin issuance against threats from quantum computing. In a press release , BTQ detailed how the system could support quantum-secure versions of popular stablecoin models, including JPMorgan’s proposed USD deposit token (JPMD), by upgrading privileged actions like minting and burning with dual cryptographic signatures (ECDSA and Falcon-512), while preserving compatibility with existing token standards, workflows, and wallets. The launch comes as the stablecoin market surpasses $225 billion and lawmakers push for regulation with an eye on cybersecurity. The GENIUS Act, currently advancing in the U.S. Congress, would formalize federal standards for fiat-backed stablecoins and encourage quantum-safe architecture. BTQ, which has worked with NIST for over a decade, aims to shape those standards and position QSSN as critical infrastructure. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin fell 1.02% from July 6 at 22:00 to July 7 at 21:00, testing key support at $107,519.64 amid heavy selling, before staging a V-shaped recovery off $107,800 as on-chain data showed strong support clusters at $106,738 and $98,566 held by 1.68 million addresses, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis bot. ETH: ETH rose 1.67% amid volatile trading, swinging nearly 3% between $2,529 and $2,604 as support at $2,530 held firm, institutional inflows topped $1.1 billion, and above-average volume marked both the surge and subsequent sell-off. Gold: Gold dipped on a stronger dollar but rebounded on tariff-driven safe-haven demand, with central bank buying and de-dollarization fueling forecasts of a rally toward $4,000. S&P 500: Stocks fell Monday as Trump announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, sending the S&P 500 down 0.79% to 6,229.98. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose despite Trump announcing steep U.S. tariffs on 14 trading partners, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.36% as duties of up to 40% were outlined for countries including South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The project is fast-gaining attention amongst investors and analysts alike as it powers through its presale. The only close match to the expected returns of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Bitcoin (BTC). From less than $1 over a decade ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a major force in the crypto sector and is now valued at over $107k. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market today to rekindle the massive returns that early BTC investors experienced. One of the main factors that is working in its favor is that it is built on the solid foundation of utility. In the crypto market of 2025, the push towards utility continues to gain momentum as hype-based meme coins lose out. Let us take a close look at MUTM tokens and why they could deliver the life-changing returns you have been looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to receive interest. Interests are calculated based on an annual percentage yield (APY). MUTM Presale Powers Past $11.8 Million The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised over $11.8 million from around 12,800 unique buyers. These figures are expected to continue rising geometrically as word of the success of the presale spreads. Tokens in the current phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the next phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This price increase is something you do not want to be caught up in. The reason for this is that the token price increase will wipe out the massive 50% discount currently available to buyers in the current phase 5. So far, many investors have rushed to capitalize on this massive discount, with over 65% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 already sold out. The pace has been blazing, with the tokens selling out barely a month after they launched. At the current pace, analysts rightly assess that the tokens will have sold out by the end of July. That means you need to act fast and direct capital into the presale in anticipation of the expected returns. MUTM Tokens Could Rise By 53x According to the latest estimates by analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 53x when they go live. That means if you purchase $1400 worth of tokens in the current phase, you could see your investment grow to over $74,000. It is worth noting that there is no upper cap on how much you can invest in the presale. Consequently, you could make some truly life-changing returns with the MUTM token presale. One reason why there is so much optimism for MUTM tokens is the expected crypto market rally. The crypto market is currently going through a consolidation phase, which is expected to pass quickly. Already, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of retracing its most recent all-time high, which signals a massive breakout is on the way. The best way to capitalize on these expected returns is to hold MUTM tokens at the current low price and await this massive wave to come and take you to the top. Another reason for the optimism for the MUTM token price is that the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. Unlike other projects like Pi Network, where the team made the community wait for years, the Mutuum Finance developer team will hit the ground running. This launch is expected to stir up excitement in the crypto community and provide a great opportunity for feedback from future users. One of the direct effects of the beta launch is that it will push doubters to act and get their MUTM tokens. This fresh inflow of capital could push the price to new highs. By joining the presale now while there is still a massive 50% discount, you ensure that you get the full benefits of this expected surge. CertiK Partnership Mutuum Finance has recently announced that they are partnering with CertiK on a massive $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. This program will reward security experts who help identify vulnerabilities in the protocol and the overall ecosystem. To ensure rewards are distributed fairly, the program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. Those who identify the most pressing issues on the protocol will receive the biggest rewards. Whales in the crypto market, who are known for their due diligence, an ability to spot massive gains early, have already secured their token in the MUTM token presale. With tokens available at a 50% discount, this represents your best opportunity to copy the whales. However, the window is fast closing, and over 65% of the tokens available at the discount have already sold out. If you fail to act fast enough, you will have to contend with a massive increase in price in the next phase.

The fund's investment strategy and asset origination is led by Qatar National Bank while DMZ Finance provides the technology underpinning its digital architecture, the companies said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. The regulatory approval serves as evidence of Dubai and the Middle East's growing role as a hub for compliant digital asset finance, particularly in the tokenization market. According to a joint report by Ripple and BCG, the global market for tokenized RWAs is projected to surge to $18.9 trillion by 2033, with jurisdictions like Dubai and Doha emerging as early leaders of this transformation. ""As the Middle East rapidly emerges as a global hub for financial innovation, the successful deployment of QCDT further consolidates QNB's leadership in the regional financial ecosystem and reflects our long-term vision to shape the next generation of financial infrastructure,"" Silas Lee, CEO of QNB Singapore, said in the statement. The fund, launched to bring traditional assets, such as U.S. Treasuries, on-chain, aims to serve a broad spectrum of institutional applications, including bank-eligible collateral, stablecoin backing, exchange reserves and Web3 payment infrastructure. With its regulatory compliance, yield stability and on-chain transparency, the backers say they expect it to catalyze adoption across both financial and crypto-native institutions. “Tokenization of real-world assets is no longer experimental — it is foundational,"" said Nathan Ma, co-founder and chairman of DMZ Finance. ""Our goal at DMZ is to provide the connective tissue between traditional markets and the digital asset ecosystem, particularly in regions ready for innovation.” DMZ Finance is a real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure platform.

DMZ. has established a strategic partnership with Qatar National Bank, the largest bank in the Middle East and Africa to jointly advance the integration of asset tokenization into the regional financial system.

The price is trading below $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $108,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $106,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $108,500 resistance. BTC cleared many hurdles near $109,000 to start a decent increase but it failed to clear $110,000. A high was formed at $109,700 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $109,200 and $108,500 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $108,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,674 low. The first key resistance is near the $108,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,674 low.

According to several analysts, the cryptocurrency is set to re-test previous highs as it completes a key bullish price pattern. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $20-$30 — Elliott Wave Theory Holds The Key At the time of writing, the XRP price trades at $2.33.

Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP Price Poised For Further Gains Analyst Ali Martinez has been following the XRP price performance. As seen on the chart below, the cryptocurrency is close to completing an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the cryptocurrency successfully completes this pattern, the analyst believes that it can achieve a breakout to the $2.6 area. In that sense, traders should closely monitor any bullish price action close to the $2.35 area, and an hourly close above this level as potential confirmation. XRP Price close to completing an inverted head and shoulders pattern hinting at further gains. Source: Ali Martinez via X Last week, Martinez pointed at a similar breakout as the XRP price trended around the $2.2 level. However, at that time, the cryptocurrency failed to achieve the $2.35 breakout and continued trading in a tight channel between this level and $2.13. A separate analyst believes that XRP is close to a rally and placed the target above Martinez’s claiming that the cryptocurrency could hit $2.69 on short timeframes. For this analyst, a breakout above $2.4 holds the key to future gains. The analyst stated: $XRP strength is telling. Something is brewing What’s Behind the Momentum? The XRP price positive performance could be attributed to the massive inflow of capital coming into its ecosystem. A report from CoinShares claims that the total Asset under Management for cryptocurrencies hit a high of $188 billion, and $1 billion just over the past week. XRP has seen $335 million in year-to-date inflows, and a $10.6 million inflow over the past week. Several analysts believe these inflows represent bullish expectations for the cryptocurrency as Ripple is close to securing a banking license from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Bitcoin slipped to the $107,500 region on Monday but has now recovered and currently trades above $108k. Institutional demand continues to be Bitcoin’s primary driver and could empower it to rally higher over the coming days and weeks. Bitcoin stays above $108k despite renewed tariff talks It’s the start of the new week, and tariff talks are back. On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States has set a 25% tariff against South Korea and Japan starting August 1. The president also revealed a 25% levy against Kazakhstan and Malaysia, 30% against South Africa, and 40% for Myanmar and Laos. Furthermore, Trump threatened additional tariffs on countries aligning with the policies of the BRICS. The announcement saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $108k, but the leading cryptocurrency has since bounced back and could rally higher soon. Bitcoin’s resilience can be attributed to increasing institutional demand. On Monday, Japanese firm Metaplanet added over 2k bitcoins to its balance sheet for $239 million. Furthermore, recent data by SoSoValue revealed that US-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded over $769 million in inflows last week. These figures suggest that institutional investors continue to demand Bitcoin, and this could be a catalyst for a price surge in the medium to long term. Bitcoin price forecast; technical strength hints at new highs The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish as buyers remain in control. The pair is also efficient, suggesting that liquidity on the downside has been swept and Bitcoin could be preparing for another leg up. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $108,040, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52 indicates that Bitcoin could experience buying pressure soon, while the MACD lines are still within the positive territory. BTC seems to be currently consolidating tightly around $110,000, just beneath overhead resistance. A decisive move above the all-time high price of $111k in the short term could see Bitcoin target $120k, setting a new all-time high in the process. Analysts still expect Bitcoin to touch $150k in this cycle, and this could be possible if BTC breaks out and hits $120k. However, failure to break out from this consolidation area could see Bitcoin retest the support and Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $105,328. This level could serve as a springboard for Bitcoin to rally higher. However, if the bulls fail to take advantage of this, BTC could drop to the next major support level at $98k. Bitcoin’s short-term performance depends on institutional demand for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the renewed tariff talks could play a significant role in how the broader crypto market performs over the next few weeks.

Ruoming Pang, a distinguished engineer and head of Apple’s foundation models team, is leaving the company to join Meta’s newly formed superintelligence group , according to sources familiar with the matter. Pang, who joined Apple in 2021 from Alphabet, had been overseeing a team of roughly 100 engineers responsible for its large language models that underpin “Apple Intelligence” features across its devices. Meta lures Apple’s AI chief with multimillion-dollar offer amid talent war To secure Pang, Meta reportedly offered a compensation package worth tens of millions of dollars annually. The move adds to a growing list of high-profile AI talent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has poached recently, including Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang, entrepreneur Daniel Gross, and ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. On Monday, Meta also brought on Yuanzhi Li, formerly of OpenAI, and Anton Bakhtin from the Claude developer Anthropic, continuing a hiring spree that has seen AI talent from leading labs snap up. While Meta declined to comment, Apple, Pang, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not responded to requests for comment. Meta has declared AI its top priority , with Zuckerberg deeply involved in building out the company’s AI unit. He’s known to personally recruit engineers, hosting them at his homes in Silicon Valley and Lake Tahoe. The company recently reorganized its AI division to concentrate on “superintelligence” — AI systems capable of matching or surpassing human-level cognitive tasks — and has committed tens of billions of dollars this year toward AI infrastructure, including chips and data centers. Apple’s AI division faces internal struggles as morale dips and departures mount Pang’s departure comes at a time of internal friction at Apple. Although his team’s foundation models are used in Apple Intelligence features such as Genmoji, email summarization, and the revamped Siri , the company has been exploring third-party AI solutions. Apple has held talks with both OpenAI and Anthropic to power future Siri iterations, reportedly impacting morale within Pang’s team. Apple is leaning heavily on external partners despite publicly touting its in-house AI efforts. At its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, only a few AI features were presented as native innovations, with several reliant on partnerships, including call translation and text analysis powered by OpenAI and Google. Apple’s updated Xcode tool taps into third-party models like Claude and ChatGPT for code completion. The departure of Pang — considered the most critical AI exit since Apple began developing Apple Intelligence — signals broader turbulence in Cupertino’s AI division. Sources say that Pang’s deputy, Tom Gunter, exited last month, and several engineers within the foundation models team, internally known as AFM, are also planning to leave for Meta or other companies. The AFM group, once under Pang’s direct leadership, will now be led by Zhifeng Chen, with a new hierarchical structure involving multiple managers such as Chong Wang, Zirui Wang, Chung-Cheng Chiu, and Guoli Yin. Apple’s AI strategy is steered by software head Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell; the engineering lead behind the Vision Pro and now Siri. Meanwhile, AI research remains under John Giannandrea, who was recently stripped of direct oversight of key AI consumer products amid delays and criticism of Apple’s AI rollout. As the talent war in AI intensifies, Pang’s high-profile defection underscores Apple’s challenges in retaining top minds — and the pressure it’s under to stay competitive against faster-moving rivals like Meta, OpenAI, and Google.

The price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,520 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Revisits Support Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,550 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,565 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. However, the bears remained active near the $2,600 resistance zone and protected more gains. The price faced rejection near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . ETH is now testing the $2,520 support. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,550 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,580 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. A clear move above the $2,600 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,580 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,520 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,450 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

The South Korean technology giant announced an operating profit of 4.6 trillion won , or about $3.3 billion, which was short of market expectations. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected a less severe drop of roughly 41%. Revenue for the quarter was 74 trillion won. Several factors contributed to the earnings slump. The tech firm blamed one-time inventory costs and delays in completing shipments of its most advanced memory chips. These problems weighed on the performance of its semiconductor division, a crucial profit center for the company. The company’s chip-making business has also been struggling for much of the past year, but the company said that operating losses are expected to be lower in the second half of the year. The increase is also anchored to a longer-term, gradual rebounding of global demand for semiconductors, including those for AI and high-performance computing. The firm intends to publish a comprehensive full earnings report later this month, with all net income figures accompanied by detailed breakdowns by business division. Samsung falls behind in AI chip race Samsung’s hardest task at the moment is its underperforming business in the thriving artificial intelligence chip market. The company has been playing catch-up with its biggest domestic competitor, SK Hynix , which has a big lead over Samsung in producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. These are very important chips for AI hardware systems, especially for companies like Nvidia, which control so much of the AI training and inference chips market. Samsung had expected to win major contracts from Nvidia for its latest chip — the 12-layer HBM3E — but hasn’t yet received final quality certification. By contrast, SK Hynix announced a few days ago that it has begun the early shipping of 1.8V 12-Layer HBM4 samples to clients. This coup has elevated SK Hynix to Nvidia’s supplier of choice, giving it a massive head start in the competitive AI memory space. US vendor Micron Technology has also made inroads, sending out HBM samples in June. Analysts say that postponing that date could have long-term repercussions. The Samsung note from Bernstein and analyst Mark Li cut Samsung’s projected HBM market share. Now, they expect SK Hynix to have approximately 57% of the HBM market in 2025, while Samsung has 27% and Micron 16%. Samsung prepares to rebound in second half Still, Samsung is hopeful. The company started shipping better HBM3E samples, nicknamed Superman, out to key customers, including Nvidia, hoping that production would finally commence if the final stages of certification were passed. The tech firm also said it plans to start mass production of HBM4 chips, the next generation of high-bandwidth memory, in the second half of 2025. At its annual shareholders’ meeting in March, Samsung’s president of semiconductor business, Jun Young-hyun, admitted that the company failed to secure an early lead in the HBM market. He promised this would not happen with HBM4, which will feature prominently in Nvidia’s next-gen Rubin GPU architecture. Although certification delays remain a concern, analysts have expressed optimism that Samsung could catch up. In a June report, Daishin Securities analyst Ryu Hyung-keun said that while Samsung’s 12-layer HBM3E certification process has taken longer than expected, the company appears to be on track for a strong HBM4 rollout in the third quarter of 2025. Samsung is betting large on this upturn. The company’s long-term strategy is to lessen dependence on consumer electronics and smartphones for sales and place greater emphasis on advanced memory chips, AI infrastructure, and foundry services. If it can overcome its challenges now and execute its HBM4 roadmap, it could be competitive again in the cutthroat contest for leadership in the AI chip market. But for now, SK Hynix is unquestionably in the lead — a position Samsung is waging a fierce battle to take back.

The figure marks twelve straight weeks of positive momentum, logging total inflows at $18 billion. Price increases during the week lifted total assets under management to a record $188 billion. Meanwhile, trading volumes hit $16.3 billion, which aligned with the average weekly volume observed in the year so far. Ethereum Dominates Proportional Inflows The latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin investment products attracted $790 million in inflows last week, a slowdown from the previous three-week average of $1.5 billion. The asset manager explained that this deceleration hints at growing caution among investors as Bitcoin nears its record highs. This sentiment is further validated by a minor $0.4 million in inflows to short-bitcoin products in a turnaround from the previous week’s direction. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its 11th straight week of inflows as it added $226 million and pushed the total for this period to $2.85 billion. On a relative basis, Ethereum’s weekly inflows have averaged 1.6% of its assets under management, which is notably higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%, which points to a change in sentiment toward Ethereum. Next up was Solana with inflows of $21.6 million, followed by XRP with $10.6 million, and Sui at $1.6 million during the same period. Chainlink and Cardano also saw modest but steady inflows, as each attracted $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, over the week. On the other hand, the multi-asset product was the only category that flashed red across the leaderboard as it witnessed $12.4 million in outflows. Regional Divide The United States topped regional inflows last week with $1 billion, followed by Germany at $38.5 million and Switzerland at $33.7 million over the past week. Australia also saw a smaller inflow of $4.1 million. Contrastingly, Canada and Sweden experienced weaker sentiment, recording outflows of $29.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Brazil and Hong Kong also saw capital leaving, as they saw outflows of $9.7 million and $3 million.

The tech behemoth urged the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse a 2023 US International Trade Commission (ITC) determination that Apple had infringed on patents of medical device producer Masimo. Due to their use of pulse oximetry technology, the ruling could effectively ban imports of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, two of Apple’s latest models. Apple attorney Joseph Mueller of WilmerHale said the ITC ruling had a devastating impact on Apple Watch users. He said millions of Apple Watch users were blocked from a popular health feature. Mueller also contended that Masimo’s product was still in the prototype stage when the lawsuit was filed in 2021. The clash concerns the blood-oxygen sensor Apple rolled out with its Series 6 watches in 2020. Masimo said that Apple copied this technology after it had been informed about it during discussions ahead of past collaboration. Masimo defends its patent victory Masimo, a California-based medical technology company, has accused Apple of using unfair practices to gain an edge in the emerging market for health-related wearable devices for years. Apple was in talks with Masimo in 2013 to collaborate on health monitoring features. Still, instead of coming to terms with it, Apple reportedly snapped up some of Masimo’s staff and brought Masimo’s pulse oximetry technology in-house, Masimo says. Masimo introduced its smartwatch, the W1, in 2022 after Apple introduced its models with blood-oxygen tracking. However, Masimo insists that its intellectual property was violated months before the W1 was released. Two years later, the ITC sided with Masimo in a decision that Apple violated its patents. In late December 2023, the ruling resulted in a brief cessation of Apple’s ability to sell its most current watch series in the US. Apple promptly requested a temporary block on the ban, allowing it to continue sales. However, the court reinstated the ban in January 2024, prompting Apple to strip the blood-oxygen-sensor feature from the models in question in the US. Masimo’s attorney, Joseph Re of Knobbe Martens Olson & Bear, said the ITC ruling was justified. He argued that Apple was trying to rewrite the law by claiming that a final, market-ready product must exist to enforce a patent violation. He added that this was not how patent protection works. Judges scrutinize fairness of the ITC ruling At an appeals court, a three-judge panel indicated a strong interest in the timing of events. At the heart of the preliminary investigation was whether Masimo had a product with adequate standing to trigger the ITC’s trade-related enforcement capabilities in 2021. Apple had argued the ban was unjustified because Masimo possessed only prototypes at that point. Apple argues that the ITC’s trade protection rules are intended to stop unfair competition with real products, not ideas that aren’t real yet. Masimo pushed back, contending that its domestically produced rival was sufficiently advanced that there wasn’t even close to what the statute calls an “end product” and that the agency doesn’t need a finished product for it to act. The judges did not rule immediately, but they hammered both sides with rapid-fire questions about product readiness, patent rights, and how to balance protecting innovation and encouraging consumer access. The court’s ultimate decision could create an important precedent for resolving patent disputes when emerging technologies coincide. Should the court rule in Apple’s favor, it could hamper the ability of companies like Masimo to wield the ITC to block imports of partially developed devices. If the ban is upheld, tech companies may have to reconsider how they strike partnerships and leverage the innovation of third parties.

The asset recorded a seven-day high of $110,307, but it has since cooled, with current trading levels around $108,311, representing a slight 0.3% drop over the last 24 hours. While the broader market maintains cautious optimism, several indicators suggest that market participants remain split on where Bitcoin is headed next. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So Bitcoin Shorts Increase on Binance Despite Price Climb Despite the price strength seen in recent days, certain signals hint at increasing friction between bullish price action and bearish positioning from traders. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, Bitcoin’s rise is being met with a counterintuitive decline in funding rates on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume. This trend could play a crucial role in shaping short-term market behavior. BorisVest noted that as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000 to $110,000 range, funding rates on Binance have gradually declined. This suggests that a significant number of traders are taking short positions—essentially betting that Bitcoin’s rally will soon reverse. The analyst explained that this behavior indicates skepticism about the sustainability of the recent price gains, particularly among retail and leverage-focused traders. “The declining funding rates show that users on Binance are increasingly shorting Bitcoin,” he explained. “This dynamic often creates forced exits as short positions come under pressure, leading to liquidations or forced margin increases. These events can further propel upward price movement as positions get closed out automatically.” Given Binance’s dominance in trading volume, BorisVest emphasized that its funding rate trend serves as a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. If current positioning continues, the market may see a short squeeze, which could accelerate Bitcoin’s momentum toward new highs. On-Chain Metric Flags Caution as NVT Golden Cross Edges Higher While futures market dynamics are drawing attention, on-chain data is also showing signs worth monitoring. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlighted the movement of Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross metric, a tool used to assess market value in relation to on-chain transaction volume. This metric has historically signaled local tops when it moves above specific thresholds. In his analysis, Kesmeci pointed out that the NVT Golden Cross successfully identified three prior short-term peaks in 2025, each followed by corrections ranging from 9% to over 20%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High? The metric currently sits at 1.98, below the 2.2 threshold that has often indicated overheated market conditions, but is trending upward. “While the current level isn’t yet in the danger zone,” Kesmeci wrote, “its upward trajectory could be an early warning that price momentum is beginning to overextend.” However, the analyst cautioned against interpreting the signal as immediately bearish. In previous cases, the NVT Golden Cross remained elevated for several days before a correction followed. This behavior may instead point to continued strength among bulls, at least in the medium term, even if a near-term pullback remains possible.

Garlinghouse shared his excitement on social media, saying he’s honored to speak before the Senate Banking Committee about the need for clear crypto market rules. He thanked Senators Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Ruben Gallego for their leadership in supporting digital assets. The timing is important, as lawmakers are also reviewing other crypto-related bills, including one for stablecoins and another focused on market structure for digital assets. If approved, these bills could provide much-needed clarity for the U.S. crypto industry. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next? Meanwhile, XRP’s price has been showing some bullish signs. On the 12-hour chart, XRP recently found support at around $2.20 and is now eyeing a key resistance zone between $2.31 and $2.35. However, the price has struggled to break above it several times in the past. If XRP manages to close above $2.36 on the daily chart, it could open the door for a move toward $2.44 in the short term, with a stronger resistance waiting between $2.60 and $2.65, a range last seen in mid-May. However, analyst Josh of Crypto World also warns that XRP might be forming a rising wedge pattern, which statistically tends to break to the downside. If this happens, XRP could drop back toward $2.20 or even $2.16-$2.17. The broader crypto market is still in an accumulation phase, with large investors quietly buying XRP while prices remain stable.

A clear move above the $2.2880 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance or even $2.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.40. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.2880 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.240 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.205 swing low to the $2.353 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.240 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.250 and $2.240.

He also signed an executive order extending the reciprocal tariff deadline to August 1 from July 9, allowing more time for negotiations. On Monday, President Trump released letters announcing new 25% tariffs set for goods imported to the US from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Tunisia. The letters stated that the US may “perhaps” reconsider tariff levels, “depending on our relationship with your Country.” Countries affected include South Africa (30%), Indonesia (32%), Thailand (36%), Malaysia (25%), Myanmar (40%), Laos (40%), and Kazakhstan (25%). Bangladesh and Serbia will face a 35% tariff, effective next month. Gold dropped to around $3,330 per ounce on Tuesday amid hopes for potential trade deals that could reduce demand for the safe-haven metal. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.22% to surpass 39,700, while the broader Topix Index added 0.1% to 2,815 on Tuesday, recouping some losses from the previous session after US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Japanese goods, set to take effect on August 1. While lower than the previously threatened 35%, the tariff remains well above the baseline 10% levied on most countries, adding pressure on Tokyo to reach a trade deal with Washington. The Japanese yen weakened past 146 per dollar on Tuesday, hitting a two-week low. On the economic front, Japan’s current account surplus for May came in above expectations, offering a positive signal for external balances. Bank lending in Japan rose by 2.8% year-on-year in June 2025, up from a 2.4% increase in May and surpassing market expectations of 2.3%. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.58% to around 3,480 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.8% to 10,520 on Tuesday, recouping losses from the previous session, and the offshore yuan stabilized to around 7.17 per dollar on Tuesday, supported by a retreat in the US dollar after President Trump announced an updated round of tariffs targeting fourteen countries that have yet to finalize trade deals with Washington. While China was not on the latest tariff list, Trump also warned of an additional 10% levy on countries aligning with the “Anti-American policies of BRICS,” as the bloc convened for a summit in Brazil. In a bid to further open financial markets, China is reportedly weighing a plan to increase the Southbound Bond Connect quota to CNY 1 trillion. Regulators are also discussing a new, dedicated CNY 500 billion annual allocation specifically for non-bank financial institutions, such as mutual funds and insurers, which are currently unable to participate. Markets now await June CPI, which is expected to remain soft, along with PPI and trade data. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.74% to 24,051 in Tuesday morning’s session, snapping a three-day losing streak. In local data, Hong Kong’s forex reserves rose for the second straight month in June, hitting the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.06% Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.19% to 8,567 on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session. The Australian dollar rose to around $0.651 on Tuesday, rebounding from sharp losses in the previous session. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Tuesday that he will visit China starting this Saturday, with stops in Shanghai, Beijing, and Chengdu, as Beijing seeks to deepen cooperation on AI, green energy, and the digital economy. Australia’s NAB Business Confidence Index jumped to 5 in June 2025 from 2 in May, improving for the third straight month and marking the highest print since January. “The survey is encouraging that sluggish momentum in early 2025 will improve into the second half,” said NAB’s Gareth Spence. In Australia, investors now await the latest monetary policy decision due later today. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended fell sharply as President Trump reignited trade tensions by unveiling a wave of new tariffs and extending the deadline for their implementation to August 1. Investors are now awaiting the release of the June FOMC meeting minutes, scheduled for Wednesday, for further insights into the Fed’s policy outlook.

Next Leg Incoming?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/08/xrp-builds-strength-above-226-with-238-in-sight-next-leg-incoming,"XRP posted a 4.5% surge between July 7 and 8, peaking at $2.35 before stabilizing near $2.26. The rally was driven by higher-than-usual trading volume, with over 182 million XRP changing hands during peak hours. Despite broader market hesitation, the token is showing signs of sustained strength, forming solid support zones that suggest continuation potential if key resistance levels are broken. News Background As global trade disputes escalate and geopolitical risks rattle markets, cryptocurrency remains caught between risk-off sentiment and institutional tailwinds. Amid the turbulence, XRP is emerging as a standout, bolstered by strong on-chain activity and renewed institutional attention. Grayscale recently added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund for the first time since regulatory restrictions were lifted, and ten XRP spot ETF applications are currently pending before U.S. regulators, with decisions expected as early as October. The anticipation of regulatory clarity — combined with Ripple’s ongoing pursuit of a U.S. bank charter — has given the asset a bullish narrative. Analysts view XRP as one of the most technically promising large-cap tokens, with a clean break above $2.38 likely to open upside targets toward the $3.40 zone. Technical Analysis According to CoinDesk's Analytics, XRP surged from $2.25 to a high of $2.35 over the 24-hour period from 7 July 05:00 to 8 July 04:00, marking a 4.5% increase on the day. The 13:00–16:00 trading window was the most active, with volume spiking to 144M–182M, pushing the price to its session high before profit-taking set in. Initial resistance formed at $2.32 before sellers took control; the price retraced to stabilize at $2.26. The $2.25–$2.26 range has emerged as a key support zone, repeatedly absorbing sell pressure during late-session volatility. In the final hour, XRP experienced 2.0% volatility, rallying from a session low of $2.25 at 04:22 to $2.30 by 04:33. The sharp recovery was driven by a volume burst approaching 1 million units at 04:29, pushing price to a post-session high before consolidating around $2.26.",Markets|AI Market Insights|XRP|News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-08 05:06:19

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $620 support zone. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $655 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $620 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $645 and $650 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . The price even surged above the $660 level. A high was formed at $666 before there was a downside correction. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $662 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $665 level. A clear move above the $665 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $672. A close above the $672 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $662 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $655 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The next major support is near the $650 level. The main support sits at $644. If there is a downside break below the $644 support, the price could drop toward the $632 support.

Experts Weigh In on the Latest Developments",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-struggles-to-surpass-110000-but-why-experts-weigh-in-on-the-latest-developments/,"Despite topping $111,000 in May, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain higher levels in recent weeks. The slowdown could be due to long-term investors taking profits, according to Tom Lee, director of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “We have clients who bought Bitcoin at $100. Even if Bitcoin goes to $1 million, they’ll probably sell at $100,000,” Lee said on CNBC’s “ETF Edge.” While the Bitcoin price is stuck at psychological resistance levels, other areas of the cryptocurrency market continue to rise. While digital asset infrastructure providers stand out in this process, Coinbase shares in particular experienced their best month since November 2023, rising 40% in June. Coinbase also became the only stock to double its value in the S&P 500 index in the second quarter of 2025, closing its first three-month rise since 2023. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market Factors that contributed to this rise include the Genius Act passed by the US Senate, Circle’s successful IPO, and the growing optimism towards stablecoins. For crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana, which have seen limited price increases throughout the year, investors are turning to alternative methods such as “staking” to make a profit. According to independent ETF expert Dave Nadig, thanks to staking, investors can make significant returns not only from price increases but also by contributing to blockchain networks. “These returns can often be several percentage points higher than classic fixed-income instruments,” he said. Financial giants like BlackRock believe in the growth potential of staking. Speaking to CNBC, Johann Kerbrat, head of Robinhood’s crypto division, said the proliferation of Ethereum and Solana staking services is a significant step towards “mass adoption.” Another notable trend is the preference for ETFs that provide the same exposure, rather than buying crypto assets directly. Nadig comments on this situation as follows: “Let's be realistic, it's much easier and cheaper to buy ETFs.” Nadig added: “Bitcoin has moved from one wallet to another; this new wallet is now ETFs.” *This is not investment advice.

Meme coin platform Pump.fun has announced that its PUMP token will launch on Gate.io starting July 12, offering 15% of its total supply in a 72-hour sale. The announcement comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) signals an accelerated timeline for spot Solana ETFs, requesting amended filings from issuers before the end of July. Pump.fun to Launch PUMP Token With $6B Ambitions as Solana Meme Coin Craze Evolves In a highly anticipated step, Solana -based meme coin protocol Pump.fun is gearing up for the official launch of its native token, PUMP, with a public sale scheduled to begin on July 12, according to a countdown posted on the cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io. The token sale will last 72 hours and operate on a first-come, first-served basis, with 150 billion PUMP tokens to be made available at $0.04 USDT each, totaling a raise of up to $6 billion if fully subscribed. The PUMP token offering will account for 15% of the total 1 trillion supply, though specific allocation details beyond the public sale have yet to be disclosed. Gate.io’s FAQ notes that there will be no upper purchase limit, only a minimum threshold to qualify — a decision that could set the stage for high-demand volatility when the sale goes live. While the listing has not been formally announced by the Pump.fun team, a representative reportedly declined to comment when contacted, leaving much of the speculation up to the broader crypto community. The listing was first reported by X user @zoomerfied, who posted screenshots of the sale page prior to Gate’s official announcement. Valuation and Tokenomics Under the Spotlight Pump.fun is targeting a $4 billion valuation for the project, with the team internally discussing whether to include a revenue-sharing mechanism for token holders — an increasingly popular model among emerging protocols looking to reward long-term supporters. Given the platform's massive earnings potential and role as the hub for meme coin experimentation on Solana, investor interest in the PUMP token could be significant. With $700 million in cumulative revenue since its inception and peak daily revenues of over $7 million as recently as January 2025, the launch of the token may mark a transition from a niche builder tool to a formal DeFi powerhouse. Pump.fun was launched in early 2024 and quickly rose to dominance by providing a frictionless way for anyone — even non-developers — to create, launch, and trade meme coins on the Solana blockchain. Its simplicity and virality helped the platform go mainstream within the Solana ecosystem, contributing heavily to Solana’s meme coin surge in the first half of 2025. Even as its daily revenue has tapered to around $1 million, the project remains one of the top-performing decentralized applications in the entire crypto space, offering evidence of sustained market interest in community-driven tokens and speculative trading tools. A co-founder of Pump.fun first hinted at a token launch back in October 2024, fueling months of anticipation. With the announcement now confirmed through Gate.io’s listing page, attention is rapidly shifting to how the token will integrate into the existing Pump.fun ecosystem — and whether holders of PUMP will gain access to protocol governance, fee-sharing, or early access to new meme coin launches. Market Readiness and Risk Appetite Despite its popularity, Pump.fun’s token launch is not without risk. Critics have raised concerns about sustainability, fair launch mechanisms, and the highly speculative nature of meme coins in general. Given the lack of formal disclosures and a first-come, first-served structure, the token launch may favor whales and bots over small retail investors. Still, for the growing cult of crypto traders who see meme coins as a new frontier for decentralized innovation — and meme culture as a new form of economic power — the PUMP token represents a chance to own a piece of one of the most viral platforms in DeFi. As the launch draws near, all eyes will be on Gate.io and Pump.fun to see whether this token sale can live up to the hype, or if the project risks becoming a victim of its own meme-fueled success. Spot Solana ETF Approval Could Come Early as SEC Accelerates Review Process In related news, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may fast-track the approval process for a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), potentially paving the way for it to hit the market far earlier than anticipated. According to sources familiar with the matter, the SEC has requested that ETF issuers submit amended S-1 filings by the end of July, hinting at a regulatory effort to accelerate the launch timeline. While the SEC’s technical deadline for ruling on these filings is Oct. 10, multiple signs now point to a potential approval well ahead of schedule. The sudden urgency appears linked to the unexpected approval and launch of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF (SSK), which began trading last week. This fund, structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, effectively bypassed the more stringent vetting process associated with the Securities Act of 1933. Due to its classification, the SEC had no choice but to allow the fund to launch, unless it had taken active steps to block it within a specific review window — which it didn’t. The result: SSK became the first Solana -related staking fund to hit US markets, giving it a first-mover advantage over the pending Solana spot ETF applications still waiting for approval under the Securities Act. Historically, the SEC has worked to avoid giving any one issuer a head start — as seen when it simultaneously approved multiple spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier in 2024. The First Official Communications on Solana ETFs The SEC’s recent communication with potential issuers marks a significant milestone in the approval process for spot Solana ETFs, which would become the third category of spot crypto ETFs in the US after Bitcoin and Ethereum. In June, the SEC requested that issuers revise their S-1 filings to include language around in-kind creations and redemptions, as well as clarity on staking mechanisms — the first formal signal that the agency is engaging directly with Solana-based product proposals. This request suggests that the SEC is actively preparing for approval and wants to ensure that the filings are technically and legally sound ahead of a potential green light. The accelerated review may also be driven by market dynamics. The launch of the REX-Osprey SSK ETF caught many market participants off guard, highlighting how less conventional regulatory pathways can give certain products an edge. The SEC's desire to restore competitive balance may explain the sudden push to expedite spot Solana ETF approvals across the board. If approved, Solana ETFs would not only provide traditional investors with exposure to SOL, but also help cement the token's place as one of the top-tier assets in US crypto markets. The token has already seen surging institutional interest due to its performance, speed, and cost-efficiency relative to Ethereum. Meanwhile, other applications for spot crypto ETFs — including those tracking XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) — remain pending, but have not shown the same signs of accelerated review from the SEC. A Turning Point in Crypto ETF Policy? The SEC’s evolving posture around Solana could mark a turning point in how it handles crypto-based ETFs more broadly. Its historical caution around altcoin-related products, often citing concerns about market manipulation and liquidity, may be softening — particularly in the wake of legal clarity, competitive pressures, and precedent-setting product launches like the SSK ETF. While no official approval has yet been granted for any of the spot Solana ETFs, the current signs suggest it may not be long before multiple issuers join the SSK ETF on the public market, giving US investors a broader set of tools to gain exposure to the Solana ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-08 05:15:25

From AI compute to enterprise supply chain tokenization, the right cryptocurrencies are already outperforming the market and drawing institutional attention. This list explores the best crypto coins to invest in now, each uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging trends.One name making waves is Qubetics ($TICS), which has catapulted into the CoinMarketCap top 10 following a historic launch. With unmatched transaction finality, a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, and governance-first architecture, Qubetics is capturing demand that older Layer 1s failed to meet. In contrast to hype-driven assets, it delivers functionality grounded in real-world use cases. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Next-Gen Blockchain With a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and Scalable Governance Qubetics features a built-in non-custodial multi-chain wallet designed for global users demanding privacy, speed, and cross-chain compatibility. Unlike wallets limited to a single ecosystem, Qubetics’ wallet allows seamless management of assets across Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and its native Qubetics chain. A freelance developer can use the wallet to handle payments in multiple tokens from clients worldwide. An NFT collector can store digital assets without relying on browser extensions prone to phishing. A startup in Dubai can use it to move stablecoins across chains to optimize treasury flows. All of this is secured via private keys stored locally on the user’s device, not a third-party server. The wallet is deeply embedded into the Qubetics dApp layer, enabling in-wallet token swaps, staking, asset tracking, and one-click interaction with DeFi protocols. For businesses, it offers enterprise-grade multi-signature features to protect internal treasury movements. Exchange Debut and Market Momentum On June 30, Qubetics launched on MEXC and LBank at a starting price of $0.40. Within 60 minutes, it surged 950% to reach $4.20. MEXC alone recorded over $700,000 in trade volume on the first day. Currently, the token is seeing strong support around the $2 mark, signaling long-term interest from early buyers and larger market participants. Qubetics is also available on SWFT Bridge, allowing easy movement across blockchains without traditional wrapping or custodial solutions. The listing is now fueling broader access and higher token velocity as Qubetics climbs the ranks of CoinMarketCap’s trending charts. The Qubetics presale began at $0.01 and concluded at $0.3370 in its 37th stage. This structured ramp-up allowed organic community growth and gave early buyers a fair path to build positions. Analysts are projecting a trading range of $5 to $10 in the current cycle, with a mainnet-driven target of $10 to $15 by Q4 2025. This debut is more than a simple liquidity event. It marks the beginning of retail onboarding, expanded developer deployment, and institutional interest in the Qubetics ecosystem. DPoS for Speed, Transparency, and Inclusive Participation Qubetics utilizes a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus system to support high-speed, low-latency finality. Token holders use their stake to vote on a limited set of trusted delegates who take turns validating transactions in a secure and transparent manner. This architecture eliminates the inefficiencies of energy-intensive mining and ensures that community participation directly shapes governance. Validators require 25,000 TICS tokens, while delegators need just 5,000 to start earning a share of up to 30% APY. The rotation model ensures fairness while maintaining throughput needed for real-world dApps.

While established tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain in the spotlight, a rising competitor, Pepeto , is capturing attention with its unique approach. Unlike many meme coins built mainly on internet buzz, Pepeto blends advanced technology with a solid token strategy. Rather than aiming only for viral growth, it’s positioning itself as a project built on real use cases and a framework for sustainable performance. DOGE and SHIB still thrive on active communities and hype cycles, but Pepeto sets out to redefine what memecoins can be. DOGE and SHIB Hold Gains But Stay Volatile Dogecoin saw a fresh rally, climbing to $0.1689 after a 3.91% gain in a day. An attempt to break $0.175 resistance was rejected, but DOGE maintains support near $0.1650 . Source: CoinMarketCap Volume soared 82.68% , a strong signal that traders are watching closely. If interest continues, the next target could be $0.180 , a major psychological barrier. Source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu has also climbed higher, gaining 3.53% in 24 hours to reach $0.00001177 . The token surged past consolidation levels and briefly touched $0.00001190 before easing back. Key support sits around $0.00001150 , with strong volume suggesting more upside potential. Though both coins are moving up, their reliance on speculative sentiment stands in sharp contrast to Pepeto’s utility-focused foundation. Pepeto: A New Standard in Meme Coins With a presale launch price of $0.000000139 , Pepeto has secured over $5.52 million from early supporters. Rather than relying on hype alone, the project has put real utility at the forefront. Central to the platform is a generous 270% APY staking reward , encouraging holders to lock up their tokens and support long-term stability. Beyond staking, Pepeto is developing its own memecoin-focused exchange and cross-chain bridge, giving traders an integrated environment to swap tokens easily. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here. Live trading charts, swap and bridge features, and over 850 high-quality tokens already approved for listing once $Pepeto secures its Tier 1 exchange. While markets remain uncertain, the team behind the God of Frogs… pic.twitter.com/ndk5gYs6y4 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 23, 2025 Why Pepeto’s Strategy Could Outperform in Q3 Pepeto has outlined a detailed plan, moving through four development phases covering contract audits, staking rollouts, live AMAs, and top exchange listings. Phase three will introduce the exchange and bridge, enabling live swaps and liquidity migration. The final phase will launch full staking operations and a worldwide marketing campaign. Compared to DOGE and SHIB, which often depend on momentum alone, Pepeto’s strategy shows greater depth. The allocation model 30% for staking, 30% for presale, and reserves for liquidity and marketing demonstrates forward-thinking design. With over 31 trillion $PEPETO tokens staked, confidence among early investors is clear. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a next-generation memecoin that mixes the energy of viral tokens with the strength of a real product ecosystem. It offers a zero-fee exchange, cross-chain bridge, and staking incentives to help shape the future of meme coins.

By Tuesday, the asset was holding steady just under $108,000 after a brief sell-off on Monday night. Major crypto assets saw a bout of profit-taking. Solana (SOL) lost 2.3% to $149, while dogecoin (DOGE) fell 4.1% to lead slides. Ether (ETH) hovered near $2,530, and XRP held steady around $2.26. In broader markets, Asian equities wobbled but avoided a selloff after President Donald Trump signaled openness to resume trade talks, postponing fresh tariffs until at least Aug. 1. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index traded flat despite Korea and Japan facing new levies. Risk appetite crept back as the yen softened and the won rallied, while the euro gained on reports of a potential EU deal. “Markets are hovering around record highs again,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. “Earnings season kicks off this week, and sentiment is being driven by the hope that CEOs guide positively, especially after being blindsided last quarter by sudden tariff headlines,” Fan said. Crypto continues to track equities tightly, with BTC-SPX correlation near local highs. Fan noted that unless volatility picks up, we’re likely in for “a hot but quiet summer,” albeit one where breakouts can still come from thin air. Meanwhile, at least one trader eyed a break of bitcoin’s $112,000 record highs in the coming weeks. “Bitcoin is well-positioned to break its previous high in July, with upside potential toward $120,000 by month-end. Institutional demand and consistent ETF inflows continue to reinforce bullish momentum,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said in a message to CoinDesk. “Ethereum is also gaining strength, supported by sustained whale accumulation and renewed optimism under a crypto-friendly U.S. administration. ETH could test $3,000 by the end of July, though market volatility remains a factor,” Lee said, adding that the anticipated Fed rate cut in September may serve as a further catalyst.

This pivotal decision, reached through a joint agreement with the influential advocacy group Coin Center, sees the case dismissed, marking a significant moment for digital asset privacy and regulatory oversight. What does this mean for the future of crypto, and why is this outcome considered a historic turning point? Tornado Cash: Unpacking the Historic Legal Retreat For those new to the space, Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based decentralized protocol designed to enhance transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. It functions as a crypto mixer , pooling together various transactions to obscure their origins, a feature highly valued by privacy advocates but also criticized for its potential misuse in illicit activities. In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took the unprecedented step of sanctioning Tornado Cash, including its smart contract addresses, alleging its use by malicious actors like the North Korean-backed Lazarus Group for money laundering. This move sparked immediate controversy and a robust legal challenge. Critics argued that sanctioning an immutable, open-source software protocol was an overreach, potentially violating constitutional rights and setting a dangerous precedent for censorship in decentralized finance (DeFi). The legal dispute centered on whether code could be considered an entity subject to sanctions and if such actions infringed upon privacy and free speech rights. Why Did the U.S. Treasury Drop the Appeal? The recent dismissal of the appeal by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was not a sudden turn but the culmination of several factors. A key precursor was OFAC’s decision in March to lift sanctions on certain addresses associated with Tornado Cash . While this didn’t fully de-list the protocol, it signaled a potential shift in the government’s stance or at least an acknowledgment of the complexities involved. According to Coin Center, the government chose not to defend its sanctions authority in court. This suggests that facing the legal arguments presented by Coin Center, the U.S. Treasury might have recognized the difficulties in prevailing or the broader implications of a potentially unfavorable ruling. Rather than risking a precedent-setting loss, a dismissal by joint agreement allowed both parties to conclude the dispute without a definitive court ruling on the legality of sanctioning decentralized software. This strategic retreat by the government highlights the intricate balance between national security interests and the fundamental principles of open-source software and digital privacy. The Broader Ramifications of OFAC Sanctions on Digital Assets The initial OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash sent a chilling effect throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Developers, users, and even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) found themselves grappling with questions of compliance and potential liability. The incident raised profound questions about: The Definition of a Sanctionable Entity: Can immutable code, without a central controlling party, be considered an entity subject to sanctions? This case challenged the traditional understanding of how sanctions apply in a decentralized world. Censorship and Decentralization: The sanctions led to some centralized entities blocking interactions with sanctioned addresses, raising concerns about censorship resistance, a core tenet of blockchain technology. Developer Liability: Would developers creating open-source privacy tools be held liable for their misuse by bad actors? This uncertainty threatened to stifle innovation in the privacy-enhancing technology (PET) space. Due Process Concerns: Critics argued that sanctioning a protocol without a clear mechanism for individuals to contest their inclusion on a sanctions list raised significant due process issues. The dismissal of the appeal provides some much-needed clarity, suggesting that sanctioning decentralized, unhosted software presents significant legal hurdles for regulators. While it doesn’t preclude future actions, it certainly makes such actions more difficult. Coin Center’s Relentless Advocacy: A Win for Crypto Privacy? At the heart of this legal challenge was Coin Center , a non-profit advocacy group dedicated to promoting public policy that protects the open, permissionless nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain networks. Their lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury was a bold move, arguing that OFAC’s actions were unconstitutional and exceeded its statutory authority. Coin Center’s arguments centered on several key points: First Amendment Rights: They argued that open-source code is a form of speech, protected under the First Amendment, and sanctioning it amounted to censorship. Due Process: They contended that the sanctions deprived users of their property without due process, as there was no clear way for innocent users whose funds might have passed through Tornado Cash to challenge their inclusion. Lack of Control: Coin Center highlighted that the developers no longer controlled the protocol after deployment, making it impossible for them to enforce sanctions. The government’s decision not to defend its position in court against these arguments can be seen as a significant victory for Coin Center and the broader crypto privacy movement. It underscores the power of persistent advocacy in shaping regulatory outcomes and defending fundamental rights in the digital age. This outcome offers a beacon of hope for other privacy-enhancing technologies facing similar regulatory scrutiny. What’s Next for Crypto Mixers and Decentralized Privacy Tools ? The dismissal of the Tornado Cash appeal is undoubtedly a positive development for the development and use of crypto mixers and other decentralized privacy tools . However, it does not mean a free pass for illicit activity or an end to regulatory scrutiny. Here are some key takeaways and what to expect: Increased Legal Clarity: The outcome suggests that simply sanctioning immutable, decentralized software protocols will be legally challenging for regulators. This could encourage further innovation in the privacy tech space. Continued Scrutiny: While the legal battle is over, regulators will likely continue to monitor the use of privacy tools for illicit finance. The focus might shift from sanctioning the protocol itself to targeting the individuals or entities who knowingly use them for illegal purposes. Responsible Innovation: The crypto community is encouraged to develop and utilize privacy tools responsibly, emphasizing compliance features where possible and educating users on their lawful applications. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: This case highlights the dynamic nature of crypto regulation. As technology evolves, so too will the approaches taken by governments to balance innovation with financial security. The resolution of the Tornado Cash case provides a crucial precedent, indicating a growing recognition of the unique challenges posed by decentralized technologies to traditional regulatory frameworks. It’s a testament to the power of legal advocacy and a reminder that the conversation around privacy, innovation, and regulation in the crypto space is far from over. This historic decision by the U.S. Treasury to drop its appeal against Tornado Cash marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a hard-won battle for digital privacy advocates like Coin Center and offers a glimmer of hope for the future of decentralized crypto mixer and privacy tools . While regulatory challenges persist, this outcome underscores the importance of legal challenges in shaping a balanced and equitable regulatory environment for the evolving world of digital assets. It’s a powerful reminder that the fight for freedom and innovation in the decentralized space continues, one legal victory at a time.

This move coincided with a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering that is aimed at funding future BTC purchases. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet continued to ramp up its Bitcoin reserves by acquiring another 2,204 BTC and solidifying its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder. CleanSpark also saw major growth when it boosted its mining output by over 50% year-over-year and raised its hashrate to 50 EH/s. However, its stock dipped nearly 8% despite the operational progress. Strategy Tops $14B Gains Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, reported $14.05 billion in unrealized gains on its digital asset holdings for the second quarter of 2025. Alongside this impressive figure, the company disclosed a deferred tax expense of $4.04 billion, according to its latest filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of June 30, the carrying value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings reached $64.36 billion, while the related deferred tax liability stood at $6.31 billion. Despite the very impressive gains, Strategy paused its consistent Bitcoin accumulation last week. The firm’s total holdings stayed unchanged at 597,325 BTC after its most recent acquisition of 4,980 BTC. This break in weekly purchases was the first since April 2025 and came as Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped to $105,400 before rebounding above $110,000. The company previously halted purchases when Bitcoin fell below $87,000 earlier in the year. After that pause, Strategy resumed buying with a 3,459 BTC purchase on April 14, just two weeks after its massive 22,048 BTC acquisition on March 31. The newly reported unrealized gains slightly exceeded Bloomberg’s earlier projections, which estimated Strategy would post at least $13 billion in such gains for the quarter. In conjunction with the earnings announcement, Strategy also unveiled a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for its 10% Series A perpetual Stride (STRD) preferred stock, priced at $0.001 per share. This latest ATM program is part of the company’s equity-raising strategy that is designed to fund future Bitcoin purchases. According to an investor presentation , Strategy already issued $477 million under the STRK ATM and $163 million under the STRF ATM. The firm reported a total remaining ATM capacity of $44.8 billion across its various programs, which includes $18.1 billion for MSTR, $4.2 billion for STRD, $20.5 billion for STRK, and $1.9 billion for STRF. These strategic funding mechanisms are part of Strategy’s continued effort to maintain its dominant position in the Bitcoin market while navigating short-term volatility and tax considerations. Metaplanet Buys More BTC It does not seem like Metaplanet plans to slow down its Bitcoin buys at all. Japan’s leading corporate Bitcoin holder expanded its holdings with the acquisition of 2,204 BTC for $237 million, according to a filing on Monday. The purchase was made at an average price of 15.64 million yen per Bitcoin, or roughly $107,700. This latest acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 15,555 BTC, with an average purchase price of approximately $99,985 per coin. With this addition, Metaplanet solidified its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company surpassed Tesla in late June when it added 1,234 BTC to its reserves, raising its total to 12,345 BTC while Tesla stayed at 11,509 BTC. It then outpaced Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark's holdings of 12,502 BTC with another strategic buy of 1,005 BTC valued at $108 million, which was disclosed on June 30. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The news comes during a surge in activity among corporate Bitcoin treasuries. ProCap , the investment firm led by Anthony Pompliano, made its first entry into the Bitcoin space with a 3,724 BTC purchase totaling $386 million. Semler Scientific also announced plans to dramatically increase its Bitcoin holdings from 3,808 BTC to 105,000 BTC. Despite the growing trend, some analysts are a bit more cautious. James Check , lead analyst at Glassnode, recently warned that the Bitcoin treasury strategy may already be losing its luster for new entrants. He suggested that the biggest gains may have already been captured by early adopters and pointed out that latecomers could struggle to stand out, saying “nobody wants the 50th Treasury company.” A report by venture firm Breed also warned that only a few firms will manage to avoid a potential “death spiral” in the Bitcoin treasury space, due to the risks that come with chasing a strategy already embraced by many. CleanSpark BTC Output Jumps In other Bitcoin-related news, CleanSpark reported a big surge in its Bitcoin mining output, with production rising over 50% year-over-year despite the increasingly challenging post-halving environment for miners. In June, the company achieved an operational hashrate of 50 EH/s, up from 20.4 EH/s a year ago, which was a 145.1% increase in mining capacity. This boosted output to 685 BTC mined last month, valued at approximately $74.2 million based on current market prices, compared to 445 BTC mined in June of 2024. (Source: CleanSpark ) CEO and president Zach Bradford credited the achievement to the efforts of the operations and technology teams, and pointed out that more than 10 EH/s of capacity was added across four US states, representing a 9.6% month-over-month growth. CleanSpark sold 578 BTC in June, most of its production for the month, and now holds 12,608 BTC—up slightly from 12,502 in May. This places CleanSpark seventh among publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Only MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms hold more BTC among miners, with MARA holding 50,000 BTC and Riot holding 19,225 BTC. Bradford noticed the growing adoption of Bitcoin by global corporations, and mentioned that corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have outpaced ETF net inflows for three straight quarters. CleanSpark stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the operational gains, CleanSpark’s stoc k saw an almost 8% drop on Monday after the update. This decline took place amid broader market softness, with the Nasdaq index falling over 1% thanks to U.S. trade policy discussions that weighed on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty continued to rise, and reached an all-time high of 126.9 trillion on May 31, compounding the economic pressures on miners from reduced block rewards and rising energy costs. Since February of 2024, CleanSpark greatly expanded its US operations by establishing facilities in Georgia, Mississippi, Wyoming, and Tennessee. In August 2024, the company also purchased 26,000 Bitmain immersion mining rigs in a $168 million deal.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-08 05:30:00

Dogecoin URPD Shows These Price Levels Stand Out In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared DOGE levels that could be important resistance boundaries. The levels in question correspond to major supply walls on the Dogecoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator from the analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the total amount of the memecoin’s supply that was last purchased at the different price levels that it has visited over history. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned Now, here is the chart posted by Martinez that shows how the URPD looks for Dogecoin right now: As displayed in the above graph, the level closest to the latest Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of the URPD is $0.18. The investors last purchased around 8.94% of the asset’s supply around this mark. Naturally, as the level is above the spot price, all of these holders would be in the red at the moment. Generally, investors in loss look forward to retests of their break-even mark so that they can get their money ‘back.’ Often, these holders push for the exit as soon as this happens, fearing that the price would go back down again in the near future. As such, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a notable part of the supply from below, a significant selling reaction can sometimes appear in the market. This can provide resistance to the cryptocurrency. Considering that the $0.18 level is particularly large, it can act as a point of notable resistance. Similarly, the analyst has also flagged two other levels: $0.21 (7.24% of supply) and $0.36 (3.82% of supply). Interestingly, between these two, there aren’t any significant supply walls, meaning that if Dogecoin can get into this zone, it may, at least in theory, have an easier time climbing up. In the scenario that DOGE gets rejected at the resistance, however, it may have to find support at the in-profit supply zones. Holders belonging to these levels can react to declines to their cost basis by buying more, as they may believe the drawdown to be just a dip-buying opportunity.

It hosts the acquisition mark of 20.03% of the memecoin’s supply, which means that it’s massive in size, and so, could be a strong support center. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, up 1.6% in the last seven days.

Recently, the White House delivered a significant update that has ripple effects across various sectors, including potentially influencing the broader sentiment in global markets. Get ready to dive into the details of a pivotal decision concerning the tariff deadline and what it means for businesses, consumers, and investors worldwide. Understanding the Extended Tariff Deadline: What’s Changing? In a move that provides a brief reprieve and perhaps an opportunity for further negotiations, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order (EO) today. This order will extend the existing tariff deadline from its original July schedule to August 1. The news, initially reported by the reliable Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, has immediately become a focal point for economic analysts and market participants. But what does this extension truly signify? At its core, it means a few more weeks of certainty – or perhaps, continued anticipation – for industries heavily reliant on international trade. For businesses that import or export goods subject to these tariffs, an extended deadline offers: Additional Planning Time: Companies can adjust supply chains, re-evaluate sourcing strategies, and prepare for potential future changes with a slightly longer runway. Reduced Immediate Pressure: The immediate crunch to meet the July deadline is alleviated, preventing hasty decisions that could lead to inefficiencies or losses. Opportunity for Dialogue: It could signal an ongoing willingness for trade discussions and negotiations to continue, rather than an immediate imposition of new or increased tariffs. While a few weeks might not seem like a monumental shift, in the fast-paced world of global commerce, every day counts. It’s a pause, a moment to breathe, and potentially a sign of strategic maneuvering on the international stage. The Significance of a White House EO in Trade Policy When we talk about the White House EO , it’s important to understand the power and implications behind such an executive order. An Executive Order is a directive issued by the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government. While not legislation passed by Congress, EOs carry the full force of law and are often used to implement or interpret statutes, constitutional provisions, or treaties. In the context of trade, a presidential executive order can swiftly alter policy, bypass lengthy legislative processes, and send clear signals to both domestic and international stakeholders. This particular EO regarding the tariff extension highlights the executive branch’s direct authority in shaping the nation’s trade posture. It demonstrates a presidential prerogative to manage economic pressures and diplomatic relations in real-time. Historically, presidents have used EOs to address various economic and trade matters. This specific action is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a broader approach to trade management that prioritizes flexibility and direct intervention when deemed necessary. The immediate impact of this White House EO is to delay the imposition of certain tariffs, offering a temporary reprieve and perhaps setting the stage for future negotiations or policy shifts. Recalling the Era of Donald Trump Tariffs: A Brief History The concept of tariffs gained significant prominence during Donald Trump’s previous presidential term. The administration frequently employed tariffs as a key tool in its trade arsenal, aiming to reshape global trade relationships and protect domestic industries. The overarching philosophy behind these Donald Trump tariffs was often centered on reducing trade deficits, bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., and compelling trading partners to adhere to what the administration viewed as fairer trade practices. Key tariff actions during that period included: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs: Imposed broadly on imports from many countries, citing national security concerns. Tariffs on Chinese Goods: A wide range of products from China faced tariffs, leading to a prolonged trade war between the two economic giants. The stated goal was to address intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. Threats of Tariffs on European Automobiles: Though largely not implemented, these threats aimed to pressure the European Union on various trade issues. These actions led to significant debate among economists and policymakers. Supporters argued they leveled the playing field for American businesses, while critics pointed to increased costs for consumers, retaliatory tariffs from other countries, and disruptions to global supply chains. The current extension of the tariff deadline is a direct echo of this past policy, indicating that trade tools remain a significant part of the current administration’s economic strategy. Navigating Complex Trade Policy in a Dynamic World The decision to extend the trade policy deadline underscores the intricate and often delicate nature of international commerce. Modern trade policy is far more than just setting tariffs; it involves a complex web of agreements, diplomatic relations, and economic strategies designed to balance national interests with global economic stability. This extension could be interpreted in several ways: A Strategic Pause: It might provide more time for the U.S. to negotiate with specific countries or blocs, aiming for more favorable terms before making a definitive move on tariffs. Economic Data Review: The administration might be waiting for more economic data to assess the potential impact of new tariffs on inflation, consumer spending, or specific industries. Domestic Political Considerations: In an election year, every economic decision is scrutinized. Delaying a potentially disruptive tariff imposition could be a politically calculated move. The challenges in modern trade policy are numerous. Supply chains are increasingly globalized, meaning tariffs in one area can have unforeseen ripple effects across multiple industries and countries. Furthermore, retaliatory tariffs from affected nations can harm American exporters, creating a tit-for-tat scenario that ultimately hurts global growth. Here’s a simplified look at the potential challenges and benefits: Aspect Potential Challenges Potential Benefits (of Extension) Businesses Ongoing uncertainty, difficulty in long-term planning, potential cost increases. More time to adjust supply chains, reduced immediate financial burden, opportunity for lobbying. Consumers Potential for higher prices if tariffs are eventually imposed, reduced product variety. Delay in potential price increases, continued access to current product ranges. Global Relations Risk of retaliatory measures, strained diplomatic ties. Opportunity for continued negotiation, potential for de-escalation of trade tensions. Analyzing the Ripple Effects on Global Markets Any significant announcement concerning trade, especially from a major economic power like the United States, inevitably sends ripples through global markets . Investors, traders, and businesses worldwide pay close attention to such developments, as they can influence everything from stock prices and commodity values to currency exchange rates. The extension of the tariff deadline could evoke a mixed reaction in markets: Initial Relief: For sectors heavily exposed to tariffs, such as manufacturing, automotive, and technology, the delay might be met with a sigh of relief, potentially leading to a short-term positive sentiment in related stock indices. Continued Uncertainty: While the immediate threat is postponed, the underlying issue of tariffs remains unresolved. This prolonged uncertainty can prevent significant long-term investment decisions and keep market volatility elevated. Currency Fluctuations: The U.S. dollar’s strength or weakness can be influenced by trade policy. An extension might lead to minor adjustments as traders reassess the likelihood of future trade agreements or disputes. Commodity Prices: Tariffs on raw materials or agricultural products can directly impact their global prices. A delay might stabilize prices in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains tied to the August 1 decision. For those interested in cryptocurrencies, while not directly impacted by tariffs, the broader sentiment in global markets can subtly influence digital asset prices. When traditional markets experience uncertainty or instability due to macroeconomic factors like trade wars, some investors might seek safe havens, which can sometimes include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Conversely, a stable and predictable economic environment might reduce the perceived urgency of alternative investments. Thus, understanding these macro-level shifts is crucial for any market participant. What Happens Next? The Road to August 1 and Beyond The period leading up to August 1 will be critical. It’s a window for diplomacy, negotiation, and economic assessment. While the specific reasons for choosing August 1 are not explicitly stated, it provides a defined endpoint for this temporary extension. What could unfold in the coming weeks? Intensified Negotiations: We might see a flurry of diplomatic activity as the U.S. engages with key trading partners to resolve outstanding issues. Economic Data Analysis: The administration will likely be closely monitoring inflation rates, employment figures, and manufacturing data to gauge the health of the U.S. economy and the potential impact of future tariff actions. Public and Industry Input: Businesses and industry groups will likely continue to lobby the White House, presenting their cases for or against the imposition of tariffs. Beyond August 1, several scenarios are possible: Tariffs Imposed: The tariffs could be fully implemented as initially planned. Further Extension: Another extension could be granted if progress is being made in negotiations or if economic conditions warrant it. Tariffs Modified: The tariffs could be adjusted in scope, rate, or target, reflecting partial agreements or new strategies. Tariffs Withdrawn: In the event of a comprehensive agreement, some or all of the tariffs could be withdrawn. The uncertainty inherent in these possibilities means that businesses and investors must remain agile and informed, preparing for various outcomes. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors Given the ongoing fluidity of trade policy, what steps can individuals and organizations take? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official White House announcements, economic news, and analyses from reputable sources. Reliable information is your best defense against market volatility. Assess Your Exposure: Businesses should conduct thorough assessments of their supply chains and customer bases to understand their direct and indirect exposure to tariffs. Diversification of suppliers and markets can mitigate risks. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different outcomes post-August 1. What if tariffs are imposed? What if they’re extended again? Having a plan for each scenario can save time and resources. Engage with Industry Groups: Participate in industry associations that lobby policymakers. Collective voices can have a greater impact on trade decisions. Review Investment Portfolios: Investors should consider the potential impact of trade policy on different asset classes. While direct links to crypto are nuanced, overall market stability affects sentiment across the board. Conclusion: A Critical Watch on Trade Developments The White House’s decision to extend the tariff deadline to August 1 is a significant development that offers a temporary pause in the ongoing saga of global trade relations. While it provides a brief respite for industries and markets, it also underscores the continued uncertainty surrounding international commerce. The legacy of Donald Trump tariffs and the broader complexities of trade policy continue to shape the outlook for global markets . All eyes will now be on the developments leading up to the new deadline, as stakeholders await clarity on the future of these crucial economic levers. Staying informed and adaptable will be key for navigating these dynamic times.

Key Takeaways: Dubai has approved its first tokenized money market fund, led by QNB and DMZ Finance. The fund brings traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries on-chain for use in Web3 and institutional finance. The move highlights the Middle East’s growing leadership in real-world asset tokenization. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) granted approval to the QCD Money Market Fund (QCDT), jointly launched by Qatar National Bank (QNB) and DMZ Finance, according to a recent announcement . The fund will be domiciled in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), with QNB handling asset origination and investment strategy, while DMZ Finance powers the underlying blockchain infrastructure. Tokenized Fund Brings U.S. Treasuries On-Chain According to both firms, the product is designed to bring traditional instruments like U.S. Treasuries on-chain, enabling use cases such as stablecoin reserves, Web3 payment systems, exchange collateral, and institutional liquidity tools. The approval reflects the Middle East’s rising profile in the global race to digitize real-world assets (RWAs). “The tokenization of real-world assets is becoming a fundamental bridge between traditional capital markets and the digital asset economy,” Nathan Ma, Co-Founder and Chairman of DMZ Finance, said. A recent joint study by Ripple and BCG projects the RWA tokenization market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, with jurisdictions like Dubai and Doha emerging as early leaders. QNB, the region’s largest bank, is leveraging its deep institutional reach, while DMZ Finance, part of Qatar’s Digital Lab cohort, is working to embed tokenization into local financial infrastructure.

UAE Continues to Attract Crypto Firms The move comes as the UAE continues to position itself as a regional hub for blockchain innovation and crypto finance, with regulatory clarity attracting major global players. As reported, a state-backed investment firm in Abu Dhabi is set to make a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange Binance using USD1, a stablecoin developed by World Liberty Financial — a crypto venture closely tied to the Trump family. Experts claim the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulatory framework, which took full effect on December 30, is creating significant challenges for crypto firms within the 27-member bloc, prompting many to consider relocating, according to industry experts. Among its stringent requirements, small stablecoin issuers must hold 30% of their reserves in low-risk EU-based commercial banks, while major players like Tether face a mandate to maintain 60% or more in similar institutions.

The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at the heart of this transformation lies the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrencies. For years, investors have eagerly awaited regulated, accessible pathways into this volatile yet potentially lucrative market. The latest news has sent ripples through the industry: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged receipt of applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) products from an unexpected player – Truth Social. This development marks a potentially pivotal moment for digital asset investment , signaling a new chapter in the ongoing integration of digital currencies into mainstream finance. What Exactly Happened? The SEC and Truth Social’s Bold Move In a move that caught many by surprise, the SEC , the primary regulator for the U.S. securities markets, confirmed it had received formal applications from Truth Social for both a spot Bitcoin ETF and a spot Ether ETF. For those unfamiliar, Truth Social is a social media platform launched by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). While the company’s primary focus has been on social media and media services, its foray into the cryptocurrency ETF space through these applications signifies a bold and intriguing diversification strategy. This acknowledgment by the SEC is a procedural step, indicating that the applications have been received and the formal review process will now commence. It does not imply approval, but it certainly puts these applications on the regulatory radar. Understanding the Landscape: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Why Does it Matter? To fully grasp the significance of Truth Social’s applications, it’s crucial to understand what a Spot Bitcoin ETF entails and how it differs from other crypto investment vehicles. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot Bitcoin ETF directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This means that if you invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF, you are essentially gaining exposure to the actual price movements of Bitcoin without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency yourself. This contrasts sharply with futures Bitcoin ETFs, which invest in Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the actual cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETF Futures Bitcoin ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds actual Bitcoin Holds Bitcoin futures contracts Price Tracking Aims to track Bitcoin’s real-time market price closely Tracks the price of futures contracts, which can deviate from spot price Custody Fund manager handles secure custody of Bitcoin No direct Bitcoin custody needed by the fund Investor Experience More direct exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price Indirect exposure, subject to futures market dynamics The significance of a spot Bitcoin ETF lies in its ability to democratize access to Bitcoin. It removes technical barriers for traditional investors, offering a familiar, regulated investment product that can be bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts. This dramatically expands the pool of potential investors beyond crypto-native individuals. The Journey to Acceptance: A Look at Past SEC Deliberations The path to a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long and arduous, marked by numerous rejections from the SEC over several years. The commission’s primary concerns consistently revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, a landmark shift occurred in January 2024 when the SEC finally approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, following a court ruling that challenged the basis of their previous rejections. This approval was a monumental victory for the crypto industry, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream adoption. The precedent set by these approvals is crucial for understanding the current landscape and the potential trajectory of new applications, including those from Truth Social. Ether ETF Applications: Following in Bitcoin’s Footsteps? With the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, attention has now firmly shifted to Ether ETF applications . Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a robust ecosystem supporting decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Proponents argue that Ether, like Bitcoin, is mature enough for a spot ETF, citing its increasing institutional adoption and the evolution of its underlying blockchain. Several major financial institutions have already filed for spot Ether ETFs, and the SEC’s acknowledgment of Truth Social’s application adds another interesting dimension to this developing narrative. While the regulatory hurdles for Ether may differ slightly due to its smart contract functionality and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the general sentiment in the market is optimistic, anticipating similar approvals down the line. Truth Social’s Play: A New Frontier for Digital Asset Investment? Why is Truth Social , primarily known as a social media platform, venturing into the complex world of cryptocurrency ETFs? This move could be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it might be an attempt to diversify revenue streams and capitalize on the growing interest in digital asset investment . By offering regulated crypto investment products, Truth Social could potentially attract a new user base interested in both their social platform and financial offerings. Secondly, it aligns with a broader trend of technology companies exploring Web3 and blockchain technologies. For a platform that champions free speech and aims to disrupt traditional media, embracing decentralized finance could be seen as a natural extension of its ethos. It also presents a unique marketing angle, potentially appealing to a demographic that values both alternative media and alternative investments. The question remains how the SEC will view an application from a non-traditional financial entity like Truth Social, given their strict scrutiny of financial products. Benefits of Spot Crypto ETFs: Unlocking New Avenues for Investors The introduction of spot crypto ETFs, including the potential ones from Truth Social, offers several compelling benefits for investors and the broader market: Enhanced Accessibility: These ETFs make investing in Bitcoin and Ether as straightforward as buying a stock, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, exchanges, or understanding complex blockchain technology. Increased Liquidity: Being traded on major stock exchanges, ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, providing a layer of investor protection and transparency that may be perceived as lacking in direct crypto purchases on unregulated exchanges. This is a key focus for the SEC . Diversification Opportunities: For traditional investors, spot crypto ETFs offer a simple way to diversify their portfolios with exposure to a new asset class, potentially enhancing returns. Lower Entry Barriers: Investors can gain exposure with smaller capital amounts compared to directly buying whole units of Bitcoin or Ether. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Risks for Crypto ETFs Despite the excitement, the path for crypto ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. The SEC ‘s historical reluctance stems from legitimate concerns that still persist to some degree: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations, which can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses for investors. ETFs do not mitigate this inherent volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the U.S. has seen some clarity with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the broader regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving. Future policy changes could impact these products. Custody Risks: While the ETF provider handles custody, the underlying risks associated with securing large amounts of digital assets (e.g., hacks, loss of private keys) remain, albeit managed by professional custodians. Market Manipulation Concerns: Despite improvements, the crypto market is still susceptible to manipulation due to its relative immaturity and concentration of ownership. The SEC remains vigilant on this front. Operational Risks: The infrastructure supporting these ETFs, including the underlying exchanges and custodians, must be robust and secure to prevent operational failures. The Road Ahead: What to Expect from the SEC’s Review Process The SEC ‘s review process for ETF applications is rigorous and follows a specific timeline, typically involving several stages. After acknowledgment, the applications enter a period of public comment, followed by a series of deadlines for the SEC to make a decision, which can be extended. For Truth Social’s Ether ETF applications and their spot Bitcoin ETF, the process will involve: Initial Review: The SEC staff examines the application for completeness and compliance with securities laws. Public Comment Period: The public, including industry experts and investors, can submit comments on the proposed ETF. Potential Amendments: Based on feedback and SEC inquiries, the applicant may need to amend their filing multiple times. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines (e.g., 45 days, extendable to 90, then 180, and potentially 240 days) to approve, deny, or delay a decision. Given the precedent set by previous spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, and the ongoing discussions around Ether ETFs, the market will be closely watching each stage of Truth Social’s applications. The SEC’s ultimate decision will hinge on whether the proposed ETFs meet the necessary investor protection and market integrity standards. Broader Market Implications: How Could Approvals Reshape Digital Asset Investment? If Truth Social’s applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Ether ETF applications are eventually approved, the implications for digital asset investment could be profound. Firstly, it would further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The entry of a high-profile, non-traditional applicant like Truth Social could signal a broader acceptance of crypto across diverse sectors. Secondly, it would likely drive increased institutional capital into both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially leading to greater price stability and market depth. Thirdly, it could spur more innovation in crypto-related financial products, as other companies seek to follow suit. Finally, it might encourage a more favorable regulatory environment globally, as other jurisdictions observe the success and impact of regulated crypto products in the U.S. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Should You Consider? For investors considering exposure to the crypto market through ETFs, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Due Diligence: Even with SEC-regulated products, understand the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ether), its volatility, and the specific ETF’s structure and fees. Understand the Risks: Recognize that while ETFs offer convenience, they do not eliminate the inherent market risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Only invest what you are prepared to lose. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on the SEC ‘s decisions regarding Truth Social’s applications and other pending crypto ETF filings. Regulatory changes can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Crypto ETFs can be a valuable addition, but they should be part of a well-diversified investment strategy, not the sole focus. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice, especially if you are new to crypto or complex financial products, seek guidance from a qualified financial professional. Conclusion The acknowledgment by the SEC of Truth Social’s applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications marks a fascinating and potentially transformative moment for the world of digital asset investment . While it’s merely a procedural step and not an approval, it underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and demand for regulated crypto investment products. Truth Social’s unexpected entry into this space adds a unique dimension, blending social media with financial innovation. As the regulatory review process unfolds, the industry will be watching closely, anticipating how these developments could further shape the future of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The journey towards fully integrated crypto finance continues, promising both opportunities and challenges for investors worldwide.

According to a monthly chart shared by crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), breaking above the 0.886 logarithmic Fibonacci retracement level, positioned at approximately $2.258, could kickstart a major rally. The chart starts from 2017 to the present, and highlights XRP’s long consolidation phase between 2021 and early 2025, during which the price remained largely suppressed despite broader market fluctuations. This stagnation was followed by a breakout surge that pushed XRP beyond the significant 0.786 ($1.61) and 0.707 ($1.23) levels. $XRP monthly chart Break 0.886 log fib, making all time highs https://t.co/Whs31W09HF pic.twitter.com/AOVoFy2vrY — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 5, 2025 Multiple analysts have predicted an impending breakout , and a monthly close above $2.258 would draw attention to the full Fibonacci extension target near $3.32 and speculative higher targets extending to $8.29 (1.272) and $13.38 (1.414), should momentum persist. Historical Importance of this Resistance Level The 0.886 Fibonacci level is often viewed as the last meaningful resistance before an asset revisits its prior highs. For XRP, this level has held firm since its all-time high in January 2018. While other large-cap assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum reached new all-time highs in subsequent years, XRP has remained below its former peak, constrained by legal uncertainties and shifting investor sentiment. The digital asset closed above this level in January, when it recorded its highest monthly close ever , but market pressure held it down in subsequent months. Now, with momentum building , the digital asset could retest this level again. While XRP has not yet surpassed its historic peak, breaking this barrier would signal an end to its extended accumulation and position the asset in a stronger technical stance than at any point in recent years, setting the stage for a push toward a new all-time high.

Here Are the Latest Data and Expert Opinions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/where-are-ripple-xrp-etfs-now-are-hopes-still-alive-here-are-the-latest-data-and-expert-opinions/,"With the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) focusing on institutional reforms rather than XRP spot ETF approval, XRP investors’ hopes are fading. According to prediction platform Polymarket, by the end of July the probability of approval for an XRP spot ETF had dropped to just 7%, down from 50% in April and 32% at the beginning of July. The SEC is currently working on guidelines that would streamline the approval process for crypto spot ETFs, according to Reuters, but the regulatory pipeline suggests that any ETF approvals are unlikely to come soon. The SEC’s initial 12-page guidance document, published earlier this month, outlined standards for what ETFs must disclose. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan called the existence of the guidance “an indication of the process of crypto ETFs integrating into the traditional financial system.” Related News: Unexpected Developments in Solana Spot ETFs - Dates for Potential SEC Approval Begin to Clarify However, the main development that the markets are eagerly waiting for is hidden in the second directive, which has not yet been published. This document is expected to include new listing standards that will replace the current 19b-4 application process. It is said that negotiations within the SEC are ongoing and this second document may be completed in the fall. Therefore, market expectations for a new crypto ETF approval have also been postponed to these dates. In this context, there were some expectations that a Solana (SOL)-based ETF could be the first product to be approved. The staking-based Solana ETF, which was launched in the past period, was considered the beginning of the “crypto ETF summer.” However, the SEC’s current approach seems to have weakened these hopes for now. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, global cryptocurrency research firm Populus made a significant declaration that has reverberated across the industry: KRW stablecoin issuance should fundamentally be anchored on the Ethereum network. This isn’t just a casual recommendation; it’s a strategic assertion rooted in Ethereum’s proven track record and unparalleled advantages. But why is Populus so adamant about Ethereum being the definitive home for a Korean Won-backed stablecoin? Why Ethereum Stands Out: A Deep Dive into Populus’s Arguments Populus, in its compelling report titled “KRW Stablecoin Must Be Issued on Ethereum,” laid out a clear rationale for its stance. The firm meticulously detailed several core strengths that position Ethereum as the optimal choice for such a critical financial instrument. These aren’t merely theoretical benefits but are observable realities that have shaped the blockchain landscape: Overwhelming Liquidity: Ethereum boasts the largest and most vibrant decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, translating into immense liquidity. This means a KRW stablecoin on Ethereum would immediately benefit from deep trading pools, easy convertibility, and widespread usability across countless applications. A Proven System: Having operated for years without significant security breaches at its core protocol level, Ethereum has demonstrated remarkable resilience and reliability. Its battle-tested infrastructure provides a robust foundation of trust essential for any national currency-backed stablecoin. Powerful Network Effects: Ethereum’s vast developer community, extensive user base, and interconnected dApps create powerful network effects. A KRW stablecoin issued here would instantly gain access to a broad audience and integrate seamlessly into existing financial primitives. High Security Scale: The sheer scale of Ethereum’s decentralized network, supported by thousands of nodes globally, contributes to its formidable security. The cost and complexity of attacking such a network are prohibitively high, offering a secure environment for valuable assets. Excellent Decentralization: Ethereum’s commitment to decentralization minimizes single points of failure and reduces the risk of censorship or manipulation. This is crucial for a stablecoin, as it ensures transparency and integrity, building confidence among users and regulators alike. The Vision for KRW Stablecoins: Paving the Way for Korean Digital Finance The concept of a KRW stablecoin is not just about digital currency; it’s about bridging traditional finance with the efficiency and innovation of blockchain technology. Such a stablecoin could revolutionize cross-border payments, facilitate instant settlements, and open up new avenues for financial services within Korea and internationally. For a stablecoin to achieve widespread adoption and truly serve as a reliable medium of exchange, its underlying platform must instill absolute confidence. Populus emphasizes that while other networks might offer certain technical efficiencies, none currently match Ethereum’s holistic package of security, liquidity, and decentralization that is critical for a national currency-backed asset. Imagine a future where transferring Korean Won across borders is as simple and instantaneous as sending an email, with minimal fees and complete transparency. This is the promise of a well-executed KRW stablecoin, and Populus argues that Ethereum provides the most fertile ground for this vision to flourish securely and effectively. Navigating Stablecoin Issuance: Ethereum’s Strategic Advantage Populus acknowledges that the landscape of blockchain technology is diverse and constantly evolving. They state that “native issuance support can be provided on networks other than Ethereum.” This is a crucial nuance. While various blockchains offer smart contract capabilities and can theoretically host stablecoins, the initial launch and primary operational base for a significant asset like a Korean Won-backed stablecoin should, according to Populus, be centered on the Ethereum network. This strategic choice is not about exclusivity but about leveraging a platform that has already proven its mettle in high-stakes environments. The process of stablecoin issuance involves not just technical deployment but also significant considerations around regulatory compliance, market acceptance, and long-term stability. Ethereum’s established ecosystem provides a framework where these complex factors can be addressed with greater certainty and less risk. Its robust tooling, well-understood smart contract standards (like ERC-20), and extensive auditing capabilities make it the preferred environment for launching a new, high-stakes financial instrument. Unlocking Unprecedented Blockchain Liquidity with Ethereum One of Ethereum’s most compelling attributes, particularly relevant for a stablecoin, is its unparalleled blockchain liquidity . The network is home to the vast majority of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and other DeFi applications. This means that a KRW stablecoin issued on Ethereum would immediately become accessible to a global network of traders, investors, and users. Consider the following implications: Deep Trading Pools: Instant access to billions of dollars in daily trading volume across various decentralized exchanges, ensuring seamless conversion between the KRW stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies or fiat. DeFi Integration: The ability to easily integrate into existing DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and other financial services, significantly increasing its utility and reach. Global Reach: While a KRW stablecoin would primarily serve the Korean market, its presence on Ethereum would grant it global accessibility, facilitating international trade and remittances. This inherent liquidity reduces slippage, improves price discovery, and makes the stablecoin a more reliable and efficient medium of exchange for all participants. Fortifying the Future: Ethereum’s Unwavering Blockchain Security For any stablecoin to gain public trust and widespread adoption, its underlying platform’s security is non-negotiable. Populus highlights Ethereum’s high blockchain security as a cornerstone of its recommendation. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (after the Merge) and its vast network of validators make it incredibly resilient against attacks. The economic incentives for validators to act honestly, coupled with severe penalties for malicious behavior, create a highly secure environment. Furthermore, the transparency inherent in Ethereum’s public ledger means that all transactions are auditable and verifiable, building a foundation of trust that is critical for a currency-backed asset. The decentralized nature of its governance and operation also minimizes the risk of single points of failure, ensuring that the stablecoin’s integrity is maintained even under adverse conditions. This level of security is paramount for a financial instrument that aims to mirror the stability and reliability of a national currency. Challenges and the Path Forward While Ethereum offers compelling advantages, it’s also important to acknowledge common discussions around its challenges, such as network congestion and gas fees. However, with ongoing developments like Ethereum 2.0 (now the execution layer and consensus layer upgrades) and Layer 2 scaling solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync), these concerns are being actively addressed. These advancements promise to significantly enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs, making Ethereum an even more attractive platform for high-volume financial applications like stablecoins in the future. A Compelling Case for the Future of KRW Stablecoins Populus’s report presents a powerful and well-reasoned argument for establishing the KRW stablecoin on Ethereum. The combination of overwhelming liquidity, a proven and secure system, robust network effects, and unparalleled decentralization creates an environment where a national currency-backed digital asset can thrive. As the world moves further into digital finance, the choice of foundational technology becomes critical. Populus’s insights underscore that for a stablecoin as vital as the KRW, opting for a network that offers stability, security, and expansive reach is not just an advantage—it’s a necessity.

The America Party (AP) crypto token has exploded by over 420% in just hours, riding the wave of excitement around Elon Musk’s plan to form a new political party, “ the America Party .” Although Musk himself isn’t tied to the token, the announcement sparked a frenzy in the meme coin market, sending AP soaring purely on name association.

However, beneath the hype lies a lack of clarity. With a documentation rating of just 48%, the project is missing critical details like its purpose, roadmap, or development team, raising serious questions about its legitimacy. Despite clear disclaimers on platforms like CoinMarketCap denying any official link between Elon Musk and the America Party token, traders have latched onto the timing and branding to fuel speculation. It’s a classic memecoin play, capitalizing on real-world buzz for fast, short-lived gains. Others join the party Key gainers include FLOKI , which soared 14.23% after its Valhalla mainnet launch, and BONK, up 6.37% on strong ecosystem growth and a $50M grant program. PEPE rose 5.25% due to whale accumulation, while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu gained 6.3% and 3.43% respectively, fueled by Elon Musk’s pro-crypto stance and massive SHIB burns. Political Drama Adds More Fire Coming back to Elon Musk, his political ambitions haven’t gone unnoticed by rivals. President Donald Trump criticized Musk’s plan, calling it a “ridiculous” third-party agenda that only adds confusion. Interestingly, Musk was previously offered a role heading the Department of Government Efficiency , named D.O.G.E., echoing the Dogecoin meme. This kind of crossover between pop culture, crypto, and politics is what keeps fueling these meme tokens. [post_titles_links postid=”479809″] Polls conducted by Quantus Insights reveal that 40% of Americans would consider supporting Musk if he were to launch a legitimate third party. While 14% said they were “very likely” to back it, 26% were “somewhat likely,” showing a notable appetite for political disruption. Just Hype, No Substance? The American Party crypto seems to be riding the wave of political buzz rather than offering real utility. With no official ties to Elon Musk and limited project transparency, it stands as yet another speculative memecoin fueled by hype, not fundamentals. Analysts are urging caution, comparing it to the TRUMP token pump-and-dump cycle seen just before Trump’s inauguration, suggesting AP could follow a similar path.

It’s a question on many investors’ minds, especially with the recent news of major U.S. stock indices closing lower. While the world of digital assets often prides itself on decentralization and independence, the reality is that traditional market movements can and often do ripple through the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the volatile waters of both financial worlds. Understanding the Recent US Stock Market Downturn The past trading session saw significant declines across the board for the three major U.S. stock markets, signaling a cautious, if not outright bearish, sentiment among investors. Let’s break down the numbers: S&P500: Dropped by -0.79% Nasdaq: Also saw a decline of -0.79% Dow: Led the losses with a more pronounced dip of -0.94% These figures represent more than just percentages; they reflect a collective decision by millions of investors to pull back, re-evaluate, or de-risk their portfolios. Such a broad-based market downturn often stems from underlying economic concerns, and its implications extend far beyond just traditional equities. Table: Major U.S. Stock Market Closures Index Percentage Change S&P500 -0.79% Nasdaq -0.79% Dow -0.94% What Drove the Market Downturn? While a single day’s movement doesn’t tell the whole story, several factors typically contribute to such a broad market downturn . These can include: Inflation Concerns: Persistent high inflation often prompts central banks to consider or implement stricter monetary policies, like interest rate hikes, which can dampen economic growth and corporate earnings. Interest Rate Hikes: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing down economic activity and making bonds more attractive relative to stocks. Geopolitical Tensions: Global conflicts or political instability can create uncertainty, leading investors to seek safer assets or reduce exposure to riskier ones. Corporate Earnings Reports: Disappointing earnings or cautious outlooks from major companies can trigger sell-offs, especially if they signal broader economic weakness. Recession Fears: Growing concerns about a potential economic recession can lead to widespread selling as investors anticipate reduced consumer spending and business activity. These macroeconomic headwinds create a challenging environment for all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Crypto Market Correlation For a long time, cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, were touted as uncorrelated assets – digital gold that would act as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, recent years have shown a growing crypto market correlation with the traditional stock market, particularly with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq. Why this increasing correlation? As institutional money flows into crypto, and as more traditional investors enter the space, crypto assets are increasingly treated like other risk assets. When there’s a broader ‘risk-off’ sentiment in the market – meaning investors are pulling money out of riskier assets – both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies tend to suffer. Conversely, during ‘risk-on’ periods, when investors are willing to take on more risk, both tend to perform well. Bitcoin, often seen as the bellwether for the crypto market, has frequently mirrored the movements of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq during periods of significant macroeconomic shifts. This doesn’t mean they move in lockstep every day, but the directional trend often aligns, especially during major market events. This growing correlation means that paying attention to the US stock market is no longer just for traditional investors; it’s crucial for anyone in crypto too. Analyzing Nasdaq Performance and Its Wider Implications The Nasdaq performance is particularly relevant for the crypto space. The Nasdaq Composite Index is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, many of which are speculative and sensitive to interest rate changes. Cryptocurrencies, too, are often viewed as growth assets, representing the cutting edge of financial technology. When the Nasdaq takes a hit, it often reflects a broader investor sentiment shift away from high-growth, high-risk assets towards more stable, value-oriented investments. This sentiment directly impacts crypto for several reasons: Investor Demographics: Many crypto investors also hold tech stocks, and a downturn in one can lead to liquidity needs or rebalancing in the other. Risk Appetite: A decline in tech stocks signals a reduced appetite for risk, which directly affects speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies. Valuation Metrics: While crypto doesn’t have traditional earnings, the general economic environment that depresses tech valuations can also lead to a reassessment of crypto’s perceived value and future potential. Therefore, understanding the nuances of Nasdaq performance provides valuable clues about the potential trajectory of the crypto market. Navigating the S&P 500 Decline: Strategies for Crypto Investors The S&P 500 decline , representing 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is a broad indicator of the health of the American economy. Its downturn suggests a widespread pullback in investor confidence. For crypto investors, this isn’t just a signal to panic, but an opportunity to refine strategies and think long-term. So, what actionable insights can crypto investors glean from this? Diversification Beyond Crypto: While you might be bullish on crypto, consider diversifying some of your portfolio into less correlated assets, or even traditional safe havens, if your risk tolerance dictates. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals can smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average purchase price during a downturn. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, solid projects with strong use cases, active development, and robust communities tend to weather the storm better than speculative tokens. Do your research! Manage Emotions: Fear and greed are powerful drivers in financial markets. A market downturn can trigger panic selling. Stick to your investment plan and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Stay Informed: Keep an eye not just on crypto news, but also on global economic indicators, central bank policies, and traditional market trends, as they increasingly influence the crypto market correlation . Challenges and Opportunities Amidst Market Volatility A broad market downturn , as seen with the recent declines in the US stock market , presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities for investors. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Downturns often lead to heightened price swings, making it difficult to predict short-term movements. Emotional Stress: Seeing portfolio values drop can be psychologically taxing, leading to fear and potentially irrational decisions like selling at a loss. Uncertainty: It’s hard to know how long a downturn will last or how deep it will go, which adds to investor anxiety. Opportunities: Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, market corrections can offer a chance to acquire assets at lower prices, potentially leading to significant gains when the market recovers. Portfolio Rebalancing: Downturns are a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio, shed underperforming assets, and reallocate to those with stronger long-term potential. Innovation Continues: Bear markets often weed out weaker projects, allowing truly innovative and resilient ones to shine and build for the future. The key is to approach these periods with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective, rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. In conclusion, the recent dips in the US stock market indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones serve as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While cryptocurrencies strive for independence, their growing maturity and institutional adoption mean they are increasingly susceptible to broader economic trends and investor sentiment that impact traditional assets. Understanding the crypto market correlation with traditional markets, especially the Nasdaq performance and S&P 500 decline , is no longer optional but essential for informed decision-making. By staying vigilant, employing sound investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging, and focusing on the long-term fundamentals of projects, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and potentially emerge stronger.

According to an analyst, with Bitcoin holding steady near $108,000, several altcoins are showing signs of bouncing back. Altcoin 1: Solana Solana (SOL) remains one of the top tokens to stack right now. Price recently bounced around the $150 support zone, and as long as it stays above $146, SOL could aim for $160-$165 in the short term. Solana continues to attract developers and is often seen as a high-potential layer-1 token for the next alt season. Altcoin 2: Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) is another solid bet, holding near its key $2,490 support. This zone marks ETH’s 200-day moving average and a crucial bullish level. If the market turns around, ETH could be one of the first majors to push higher, especially with activity on its network staying strong. Altcoin 3: XRP XRP’s latest chart action has traders watching closely as it approaches a critical resistance level, the 200-day moving average (MA). Historically, this level has acted as both strong support and resistance for XRP, and it’s currently blocking the token’s upward movement. For short-term, support levels to watch are around $2.31 and $2.295. These are possible dip-buy zones where a quick bounce might occur if the price drops. Other Altcoin Plays Lastly, meme coins like Bonk (BONK) and Popcat (POPCAT) are on analysts’ radars for high-risk, high-reward plays. Bonk has been seeing fresh interest from smart money, while Popcat is testing key support around $0.285, with expectations of a short-term bounce from these oversold levels. Virtuals is also hitting a big demand area near $1.47. With multiple indicators like trend lines and moving averages lining up, the analyst expects a bounce of 5-8% soon. It might not be a trend reversal yet, but it’s a spot where short-term upside could play out. SUI is approaching its first major support at $2.78. If the dip continues, a stronger demand zone sits at $2.60. These levels could offer good entries for those looking to build positions at lower risk points.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|SOL|XRP|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-08 06:03:48

In a recent post on X, Cobb responded to criticism of the cryptocurrency by predicting that its value could reach $15 by the end of 2025, a move that would represent a dramatic increase from its current market price. The forecast was prompted by an X user who dismissed XRP and criticized community sentiment surrounding the asset. Cobb countered with the view that such negativity could quickly shift if XRP experiences a significant rally over the next few months. Price Target Signals Renewed Optimism The $15 target reflects a roughly 560% increase from XRP’s current value of $2.27. Achieving this level would mark a new all-time high, far surpassing its 2018 peak of $3.84. According to Cobb, this outcome could lead some of the project’s harshest critics to regret their earlier dismissals, especially if they miss out on potential gains. For holders of the token, the implications of a price jump are significant. A position worth $2,270 today would grow to $15,000 if Cobb’s projection is realized, and many community members and analysts have expressed confidence that XRP can hit targets around this level. Drivers Behind Bullish Outlook Cobb’s bullish stance is not isolated. Several analysts have identified technical and structural factors that could support a price move toward $15. Crypto researcher Rob Cunningham has predicted that XRP can reach this level . Chart analyst Ali Martinez has also noted that XRP recently broke out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern, a development often interpreted as a prelude to upward momentum. This technical signal has further reinforced expectations of a sustained rally targeting $15 . In addition, earlier this year, community commentator Zach Rector suggested that XRP’s price could benefit from the approval and adoption of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which may bring new capital inflows into the asset.

Though his message was cryptic, it sparked conversation among long-time supporters. Cobb was among those who responded, posting an image and comment referencing XRP’s long-standing presence in the crypto ecosystem. However, the response drew backlash from some observers, including a critic who dismissed Cobb’s post as unserious and harmful to XRP’s reputation. Critics have not deterred him as he is confident the asset can reach $15 target this year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This isn’t a fantasy; it’s precisely what happened in the world of cryptocurrency, specifically with an Ethereum wallet that recently stirred from a nearly decade-long slumber. This extraordinary event highlights the incredible potential and long-term value appreciation within the crypto space, captivating investors and enthusiasts alike. The Awakening of a Decade-Old Dormant Wallet The cryptocurrency community was abuzz recently with news of a significant transaction originating from an Ethereum wallet that had been inactive for an astonishing 9.9 years. This isn’t just any old wallet; it’s a pre-mine address, meaning its contents were acquired during Ethereum’s earliest distribution phase. The wallet, which held 900 ETH, was reactivated, leading to the movement of these long-held assets. This kind of activity from a dormant wallet often sparks curiosity and speculation within the market, as it can sometimes signal shifts in long-term holder sentiment or simply a forgotten fortune being rediscovered. Let’s break down the remarkable numbers behind this reawakening: Initial Acquisition: 900 ETH Acquisition Price (ICO Era): Approximately $0.31 per ETH Total Initial Investment: Around $279 Current Valuation: Over $2.27 million Value Multiplier: A staggering 8,100 times increase! This dramatic surge in value underscores the volatile yet potentially highly rewarding nature of early cryptocurrency investments, particularly for those who held through multiple market cycles. A Glimpse into the ICO Era: When ETH Was Pennies To truly appreciate the magnitude of this gain, we need to transport ourselves back to the ICO era . The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for Ethereum took place in 2014. During this period, participants could acquire ETH for a fraction of a dollar. For many, it was a speculative investment in a nascent technology with an uncertain future. Ethereum, then just a whitepaper vision, promised to be a decentralized world computer, a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Few could have predicted the profound impact it would have on the global financial and technological landscape. The individual behind this particular dormant wallet was one of those early believers, or perhaps someone who simply bought a small amount and forgot about it. Their initial outlay of just $279 for 900 ETH seems almost unbelievable today, especially when considering the millions it’s now worth. This serves as a powerful reminder of the ‘pioneer’ advantage in emerging technologies – getting in early can yield exponential returns, but it also comes with significant risk and uncertainty. Understanding the ETH Price Trajectory: A Decade of Growth The journey of the ETH price from its humble beginnings to its current multi-thousand-dollar valuation is a saga of innovation, adoption, and market cycles. After the ICO, ETH saw gradual growth, followed by the massive bull run of 2017, where it first breached significant price points. Then came the crypto winter of 2018, testing the conviction of many holders. However, Ethereum continued to build, evolve, and attract developers, leading to another parabolic rise in 2021 and maintaining a strong position in the market ever since. Here’s a simplified timeline of ETH price milestones (approximate): Year Key Event/Price Action Significance 2014 Ethereum ICO (approx. $0.31) Foundation of the network; early investor entry point. 2017 Breaks $100, then $700+ First major bull run; widespread awareness. 2018 Crypto Winter (price decline) Market correction; testing investor conviction. 2021 All-time high (over $4,800) Fueled by DeFi, NFTs, and institutional interest. 2022-2023 Merge Upgrade, Market Consolidation Transition to Proof-of-Stake; continued ecosystem growth. 2024 Current Price (over $2,500) Resilient market performance; sustained utility. This wallet’s activation after such a long period perfectly encapsulates the ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) philosophy, demonstrating that patience can indeed be a virtue in the volatile crypto markets. Implications for the Broader Crypto Market When a significant dormant wallet moves its assets, it often draws attention from analysts and investors. While 900 ETH is a substantial amount for an individual, its impact on the overall crypto market is generally minimal. Ethereum’s daily trading volume runs into billions of dollars, so a $2.2 million transaction is a drop in the ocean. However, these movements are often seen as indicators or points of interest for several reasons: Long-Term Holder Sentiment: Does it signal that early investors are starting to take profits, or is it merely a rebalancing? Security Concerns: Is the wallet holder still alive? Did they lose their keys and just find them? Or was it a security breach (less likely if funds are just moved to another address)? Market Narrative: These stories reinforce the narrative of crypto as a generational wealth-building opportunity, attracting new interest. Such events serve as powerful case studies, reminding everyone of the transformational potential that has defined the crypto market since its inception. They highlight that while volatility is inherent, the long-term trend for foundational assets like Ethereum has been overwhelmingly positive. Lessons from the Long-Term Holder: What Can We Learn? The saga of this Ethereum wallet offers several invaluable lessons for anyone navigating the complex world of cryptocurrency investments: 1. The Power of Patience (HODL) This is perhaps the most obvious takeaway. While day trading can be lucrative for some, the most significant gains in crypto have historically gone to those with the conviction to hold through market highs and lows. This wallet’s journey from $279 to over $2.2 million is a testament to extreme patience. 2. The Importance of Security Whether this investor simply forgot about their ETH or deliberately held it, the fact that they maintained access to their private keys for a decade is remarkable. Securely storing your seed phrase or private keys offline (in a hardware wallet, for example) is paramount. Losing access to your crypto is equivalent to burning your money. 3. Early Adoption Rewards Being an early adopter in a revolutionary technology carries immense upside potential. However, it also means investing in unproven concepts with high failure rates. For every Ethereum, there are countless ICOs that failed. Due diligence and risk assessment are crucial. 4. Understanding Market Cycles The crypto market operates in distinct cycles of bull runs and bear markets. Long-term holders understand that dips are often temporary and that innovation continues regardless of price action. This allows them to avoid panic selling and position themselves for the next upward trend. 5. Diversification vs. Conviction While diversification is generally advised in traditional investing, crypto sometimes rewards strong conviction in a few foundational assets. This wallet holder had a singular focus on ETH. The challenge lies in identifying which assets have true long-term potential. What’s Next for Ethereum? The reawakening of an old wallet doesn’t change Ethereum’s fundamentals, but it does shine a spotlight on its enduring value. Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized web, with ongoing developments like the transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism (The Merge), scalability solutions (Layer 2s), and future upgrades aimed at enhancing its efficiency and reducing transaction costs. The network’s robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and various dApps, ensures its continued relevance and growth in the evolving crypto market . As the crypto space matures, stories like these will become more common, serving as powerful reminders of the early days and the incredible wealth creation that has occurred. They also highlight the increasing importance of secure asset management and a clear long-term investment strategy. Conclusion: A Fortune Rediscovered, A Future Reaffirmed The movement of 900 ETH from a wallet dormant for nearly a decade is more than just a transaction; it’s a compelling narrative of foresight, patience, or perhaps sheer luck, culminating in an unbelievable fortune. This single event encapsulates the transformative power of cryptocurrency and the unprecedented opportunities it has presented to early investors. It serves as a powerful reminder of Ethereum’s journey from a nascent project in the ICO era to a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, solidifying its position as a digital asset with enduring value. For anyone in the crypto space, this story is a beacon of hope and a testament to the potential rewards of a long-term vision in this dynamic market.

The pattern, defined by downward-sloping resistance and upward-sloping support, is now compressing toward an apex. According to crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), who reviewed the setup in a recent video, this structure may soon resolve with significant price action. Current market data shows XRP trading near $2.27, with volume at notably low levels across the crypto sector. Historically, subdued volume often precedes large moves, and Steph emphasized that this behavior is similar to conditions observed before the November 2024 breakout, when XRP jumped from around $0.5 to a multi-year peak of $3.39. Additionally, he noted that XRP’s Bollinger Bands are at their tightest since November, drawing attention to a key indicator of looming volatility. #XRP HOLDERS WILL GET RICH OVERNIGHT!!! (Price Prediction) pic.twitter.com/cV3iy9uV0F — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 6, 2025 Breakout Target Set at $5 To validate a breakout, Steph indicated a daily close above $2.33 is essential. If confirmed, he sees the $5 level as the first major price target, estimating a 120% potential gain from current levels. He did caution, however, that $5 could act as “massive resistance” and intends to take partial profits if that level is reached. Steph also reiterated the importance of risk management, stating, “Keep the leverage low to avoid liquidation.” He described the current setup as offering a strong risk-to-reward profile, with limited downside in the short term. Historic Parallels with 2017 Rally Multiple charts in the video compare XRP’s 2025 price structure to the 2017 rally. On both the 4-day and monthly time frames, XRP exhibited a long consolidation period of 210 days before its previous breakout. The current consolidation aligns closely with that timeframe, adding weight to the argument that a new rally could be imminent. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The monthly chart also highlights a completed double bottom pattern , with price now holding above the 2017 closing highs. Steph called this “one of the most bullish charts in crypto.” Additional Bullish Indicators Short-term analysis of liquidation data suggests significant liquidity exists above $2.35, primarily from short positions. In Steph’s view, this increases the likelihood of a short squeeze , driving prices higher. He also pointed out that while the U.S. stock market has entered extreme greed, the crypto market is lagging slightly behind. If crypto sentiment follows the stock market, increased bullish momentum may be just ahead. Steph’s technical breakdown shows a potentially pivotal moment for XRP, with multiple indicators aligning for a breakout scenario. He reaffirmed his bullish outlook, stating that any short-term pullbacks would be a huge buying opportunity .

This milestone is bumping up demand for BONK, the Solana-based token at the center of its ecosystem. New data show that Bonk.fun has facilitated over $540 million in volume across 175,000 launches, generating approximately $34 million in fees. That gives it a commanding 55.2% share of the meme launchpad market — ahead of Pump.fun’s 34.9% and $341 million in total volume. Pump.fun had dominated the sector since its January 2024 debut, accumulating over $800 million in fees within two years. Bonk.fun has flipped that lead in just two months, driven by deeper token incentives and faster platform traction and a BONK buy-back plan that has caught the eye of some early investors. ""The massive increase in Bonk.fun market share helps BONK through the aggressive market buy pressure it contributes to the BONK token,"" shared widely-followed crypto investor theunipcs in a message to CoinDesk. A key difference lies in Bonk.fun’s fee structure. 50% goes to buying then burning BONK, 8% goes to buying BONK for reserves, and the rest the platform keeps as revenue. ""50% of Bonk.fun fees goes towards buying and burning $BONK, and another 8% goes towards buying BONK for reserves. When you consider that Bonk.fun has generated over $1 million/day daily since it flipped Pump.fun, that's at least $500,000/day in revenue-driven BONK buy and burn,"" the trader added. The biggest Bonk.fun-issued token is USELESS, an intrinsically useless token that jibes at its own lack of utility that has built a cult following in past week, helping propel it to over $100 million in market capitalization just weeks after going live. If Bonk.fun continues to dominate at current pace, annualized BONK purchases could reach into the hundreds of millions, further tightening supply. Meanwhile, other Solana-based launchpads, such as Believe (3.8% market share), Jup Studio (2.1%), and Moonshot (1.7%), remain far behind in both volume and engagement.

Based on data from the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Tokyo-based investment firm’s stock trading volume reached 1.87 trillion yen or around $11.6 billion in June 2025 alone. Compared to the previous month, the company’s stock trading volume jumped 87% from 997.6 billion yen. Metaplanet’s stock trading volume even managed to surpass two of Japan’s corporate giants, Toyota Motor and Sony Group. In June 2025, Toyota’s trading volume amounted to 1.6 trillion yen, while Sony Group’s reached 1.3 trillion yen. However, the top ranked company by trading volume is still Advantest with a monthly stock trading volume of 4.8 trillion yen. According to Reuters Japan , the company’s stock price has been on the rise since mid-June due to its efforts to expand on its Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury strategy. On June 16, the stock price for Metaplanet closed on a peak of $1.895, jumping 25% from its earlier price of $1.509 only a day prior.

On June 16, the firm bought 1,112 BTC, which raised the company’s total BTC holdings to a staggering 10,000 BTC. Throughout the month of June, Metaplanet has made a total of five Bitcoin purchases, with the latest one being on June 29 at 1,005 after it issued an additional $207 million in ordinary bonds. After its latest purchase on July 7, Metaplanet’s BTC holdings reached a total of 15,555 BTC. The Japanese firm’s holdings are currently worth $1.68 billion in Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s 210k BTC strategy On June 6, the Japanese investment firm announced plans to acquire more BTC in accordance with its Bitcoin treasury strategy that was largely inspired by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. By 2027, the Tokyo-based company aims to purchase enough BTC to boost its total holdings to 210,000 BTC. The 210,000 BTC milestone represents 1% of the total existing Bitcoin supply worldwide. In order to reach this goal, the firm has decided to raise its annual BTC accumulation target for 2026 from just 21,000 BTC to 100,000 BTC. By the end of 2025, it plans to boost its holdings by over two-fold from just 8,888 BTC in early June to 30,000 BTC. Metaplanet has been accumulating BTC since May 2024 as a way to combat inflation and the effects of the weakening Japanese currency. Since November 2024, the company has consistently held the top spot on the standard market in terms of trading volume, followed by Namura Shipbuilding with 516 billion yen.

Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale is over 60% sold out at $0.03. Presale has raised over $11.9 million and added over 12,800 unique holders. This is the lowest MUTM will ever be. XRP may still be a staple for some portfolios, but the real alpha may lie in this new DeFi project that’s flying under the radar, for now. With whispers of listings, integrations, and major developments on the horizon, Mutuum Finance could easily become the best crypto to invest in this year. XRP Consolidates Around $2.22 as Ripple Secures Banking Ambitions XRP is now at $2.22 which is cautiously flat following the previous run above the $2.20 low support. The speculation that XRP might surpass the current resistance is arousing due to the current attempts of Ripple to acquire a U.S. banking charter and stablecoin, and analysts foresee an upside of XRP to hit a price range of $2.65 to $3.00 in the short term. With that said, there are some investors betting small in the emerging projects such as Mutuum Finance, which is now well into its presale. Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum in Phase 5 of its presale. The project stands out from others due to actual real-world use case instead of hype. Demand from investors is gathering pace with the project already exceeding over $11.9 million and having over 12,800 token holders. Mutuum Finance features a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users are allowed to keep their full ownership of assets. The initiative has a double-model strategy that involves the use of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to ensure greater flexibility as well as efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to facilitate automatic lending with zero human touch and instead the smart contracts respond to the market by offering variable interest rates. By the use of this auto mechanism, the world of the borrowers and lenders is made stable and predictable. Peer-to-Peer model, on the other hand, does not have middlemen and thus offers a direct link between lenders and borrowers. Mutuum Finance to Launch USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin would be immune to market volatility and depeg risk of algorithmic stablecoins. Top blockchain security company, CertiK, has also audited smart contracts of the project. Besides providing investors with confidence about the integrity and transparency of the code base, the audit done shows that the project is serious about the design of a secure DeFi protocol. To bring this pledge to life, the project has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The program is functional on four levels of vulnerabilities, critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners out of the early investors will be chosen to get $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens each. With its unique leaderboard mechanism the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders are incentivized. As users level up they receive rewards in bonus tokens token holding game and competitive fun. The mechanism encourages both excitement and loyalty, ecosystem growth in overdrive. XRP may be holding at $2.22, but real momentum is building with Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Over $11.9M raised, 12,800+ holders, and Phase 5 is 60% sold out at just $0.03, the lowest price before a 16.67% increase. Buy now before Phase 6 begins.

Each specialized subnet token, which is designated by “SN” numbers and powers different AI services on the network (e.g., language, image, sports predictions). These subnets foster an interoperable, incentive-driven AI marketplace where contributors are rewarded with TAO and subnet-specific tokens. Note: This list is sorted in no particular order. All data and information gotten from CoinMarketCap. Mainframe (SN25) About: Mainframe is subnet #25 on Bittensor, focused on decentralized AI processing and inference at massive scale. It allows contributors to provide compute and data services to the broader TAO network. Subnet status report for June’s highlights: SN9’s distributed pretraining architecture IOTA launched Novelty Search in The Louvre @proofoftalk SN1 GAN results SN13 gets SDK + payments go live Macrocosmos featured in @Forbes Key Token Metrics (as at the time of writing): Price Unit: ≈ $2.74 24‑h Volume: ≈ $31k Market Cap: $3.31M Maximum Supply: 21 M SN25 Exchanges: Mainframe is tradable on platforms aggregating Bittensor subnets—primarily decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While Mainframe has no on-chain circulating supply reported, volume data indicates active peer-to-peer trading via DEX and index providers. With a near-$3 price and roughly $267K volume, it’s attracting notable liquidity among Bittensor subnets. Sportstensor (SN41) Token Overview: Sportstensor is subnet #41, specializing in sports prediction models—forecasting outcomes, analytics, and game-related AI services within the Bittensor ecosystem. Recently announced the Official Almanac Beta Launch Almanac is a sports betting intelligence platform that democratizes access to professional-grade prediction data and comprehensive betting analytics. Built on the Sportstensor subnet, Almanac transforms complex sports data into clear, actionable insights for everyday users. Key Metrics: Price Unit: ≈ $2.50 24‑h Volume: ≈ $26,900 Market Cap: $3.15M Exchanges: Supported on Bittensor-aligned platforms. To conclude, Sportstensor trades at a similar price to Mainframe but carries significantly lower volume (~$27K). Thereby, making it more niche then, yet its sports AI angle could capture interest during major events. Sταking (SN88) About: Sταking (subnet #88) empowers decentralized PoS staking AI—possibly related to validator/node operations within Bittensor, aiding in staking-based network optimization. Key Token Metrics To Monitor: Unit Price: ≈ $1.35 24‑h Volume: $140k Market Cap: $703k Exchanges for active trading: Tradable within the broader Bittensor platform ecosystem. Likely listed on the same DEX/index platforms as other subnets. At roughly $1.35, Sταking looks budget-friendly compared to peers and supports a core blockchain function. Also, its niche might appeal to those interested in bridging AI and staking. Bitcast (SN93) Token About: Bitcast (subnet #93) is tailored for AI-generated media—audio, video, speech synthesis, and generative broadcasting powered by Bittensor’s distributed compute. Token Key Metrics to watch: Price: ≈ $1.07 24‑h Volume: ≈ $58,800 Market Cap: $346k Exchanges for active trading includes DEX/trading pairs visible via subnet. Bitcast offers a lower entry (~$1) with moderate volume, targeting the growing AI media market—its positioning may attract developers in generative audio/video sectors. Ridges AI (SN62) About Token: Ridges AI (subnet #62) focuses on structure extraction, analytics, or potentially AI linked to geospatial or text “ridge” learning within Bittensor’s pipeline. Vision is Competing with big labs by training massive end-to-end models isn’t viable. That’s it’s too expensive, and miners will lose.

Gate.io , one of the exchanges carrying the pre-market trading, has removed the pair from its platform. Gate.io , one of the leading centralized exchanges for new token listings, has removed the pre-market pairs for PUMPFUN. The ticker was selected to differ from the multiple PUMP meme tokens that have launched in the past, all making claims they could become the official asset of the platform. PUMPFUN saw limited activity in its pre-market OTC pairs. All traders that participated in the presale event would have their funds returned, announced the exchange. Gate.io did not hint at the eventual TGE or listing, saying it would communicate only through official announcements. The native token of Pump.fun was expected for months, possibly in July, creating demand for pre-market price discovery. The exchange announced it held a round of talks with Pump.fun, agreeing to remove the market pair and not trade PUMPFUN for the foreseeable future. Currently, there is no hint at the potential price for PUMPFUN. Gate.io briefly lists PUMPFUN pre-launch page Initially, the plan of Pump.fun was to launch 150B tokens, with an initial price of $0.004. The platform also previously intended to raise up to $1B in its token generation and presale event, with a total valuation of $4B. The parameters of the presale were widely circulated just days before the actual event, announced for July 12. Currently, the information is treated as a leak, with no assurance the token sale would happen based on those parameters. 🚨 @pumpdotfun Public Token Sale: All You Need to Know – Token: $PUMP – Total Supply: 1 trillion – Date: July 12 – July 15 (3 days) – Tokens for Sale: 150 billion – Sale Price: $0.004 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $4 billion pic.twitter.com/8jijGWgVBp — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 7, 2025 Gate.io only briefly listed Pump.fun, removing the pre-market pair hours later. The removal of the PUMP token infrastructure led to suggestions Pump.fun may decide to push the launch farther into the future. Previously, Gate.io had set up a countdown and a tracker for the presale, which was up for only a few hours before being removed. Pump.fun has not commented on the removal of the presale page, or given any explanation for the event. Is Pump.fun still slowing down? The recent removal of the presale page coincides with a generally slower performance for Pump.fun. The top Solana meme platform recently saw its primacy challenged by LetsBonk.fun. The alternative platform, linked to the BONK meme token, flipped Pump.fun based on daily fees. Pump.fun has locked in over $700M, liquidating a significant part of its SOL fees. Currently, the platform saw its daily fees sharing, coming down under $1M per day. The Pump.fun fees and activity are now back to the levels from the March and April slump, before the new wave of meme token mania. Only 5,580 addresses are creating tokens, with around 100K daily active users. Previously, up to 13K addresses created new tokens. Fees fell off abruptly in July, showing a clear slowing trend. Pump.fun activity slowed down, reflected in the daily fees, which dipped under $1M. | Source: DeFi Llama Before the TGE for Pump.fun, there were fears the native token could further erode the meme market, taking liquidity and traffic from memes. The recent summer slowdown also affected the meme market, which relies on general hype and confidence. This time around, the BONK meme community is showing more strength compared to the Pump.fun ‘trenches’, while in search for the next big meme trend.

Soon after announcing the public sale of its native token, PUMP, set to launch on July 12, Crypto exchange Gate.io deleted the page without warning. There’s strong hype around PUMP’s launch, but the deletion of its Gate sale page has raised doubts among traders. While social media shows clear FOMO, seasoned Solana users are cautious about the token’s large supply and high $4B valuation, especially as LetsBonk.fun gains more traction. Technical indicators show short-term bullish momentum, but with overbought signals (CRSI 85+), some volatility or profit-taking is likely. Despite the Gate.com hiccup, the launch timeline remains intact, though official updates are still key as last-minute changes could happen.

A Boost for Solana’s Ecosystem Pumpfun’s upcoming token sale is expected to amplify activity across the Solana network, especially within the memecoin segment.

A post shared by Mr. Rhodesian on X falsely indicated that a private equity fund being established by CapSign holds 4.7 million Ripple shares held by Liquidishares. Statement Clarity: Ripple And Linqto In June, it was reported that the investment company, Linqto, was heading toward bankruptcy. The reports gained more credibility after Mr. Rosendin encouraged false information that his company, CapSign, holds $4.7 million of Ripple, further boosting the false idea of Linqto’s bankruptcy. Linqto denied the false statement shared by Mr. Rosendin by saying , “Contrary to published reports on X, Linqto confirms that Liquidshares’ holdings of Ripple shares remain unchanged.” Ripple Stepped in to Confirm Linqto Shares Due to the growing speculations of Linqto’s bankruptcy reports, users feared their Ripple shares, bought through Linqto, might be at risk. To clear the rising doubts, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse clarified the confusion of Ripple’s connection to the Linqto. He stated– “What we know from our records is Linqto owns 4.7M shares of Ripple, solely purchased on the secondary market from other Ripple shareholders (never directly from Ripple).” Garlinghouse also said that, besides being a shareholder, Ripple has no connection with Linqto , and the trading between them was stopped in 2024 amid growing concerns. [post_titles_links postid=”479807″] Linqto Confirms the Security of Shares Linqto explained that the firm has incorporated a new management team to ensure the investments in the private held companies are secured. It also disclosed that Linqto retained an independent third-party analyst firm to review the internal analysis and check for any risks. Linqto has prioritized cooperating with regulators for the ongoing investigations regarding compliance violations. The company’s transactions will remain suspended until further notice from the officials is issued. Final Thought Currently, Linqto is under investigation by both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and and US Department of Justice (DOJ) for its misleading sales practices. Until the legal clarity is confirmed with Linqto, Ripple is keeping its distance from the troubled firm.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepeto gains momentum in Q3 2025 as a utility-focused memecoin, going head-to-head with DOGE and SHIB through staking, bridge tech, and a dedicated exchange Table of Contents DOGE and SHIB stay popular but face instability Pepeto positions itself as a utility-first memecoin Why Pepeto could leap ahead of DOGE and SHIB in Q3 About Pepeto The competition among memecoins is heating up as Q3 2025 begins. While established names like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to capture trader attention, a new challenger, Pepeto, is building momentum with a different approach. Unlike other tokens that rely solely on social hype, Pepeto is designed as an integrated ecosystem, merging real technology with structured tokenomics. Instead of simply capitalizing on internet trends, it focuses on delivering ongoing utility and confidence to long-term holders. As DOGE and SHIB depend mainly on market speculation and their loyal communities, Pepeto seeks to reset expectations for what a memecoin can achieve. DOGE and SHIB stay popular but face instability Dogecoin has recently moved higher, trading at $0.1689 after climbing 3.91% in one day. It attempted to break through $0.175, met resistance, and has now settled near the $0.1650 support range. Source: CoinMarketCap Trading volume spiked 82.68%, underscoring strong buyer interest. If momentum holds, the next level to watch is $0.180, which may act as psychological resistance. Source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu is also benefiting from renewed optimism. Its price has risen to $0.00001177, up 3.53% over 24 hours. SHIB recently broke out of a consolidation phase, reaching $0.00001190 before retracing slightly. It remains supported around $0.00001150, with elevated trading suggesting a potential second leg upward. Though both DOGE and SHIB have posted gains, their price action still hinges on short-term speculation rather than the clear frameworks driving Pepeto’s strategy. Pepeto positions itself as a utility-first memecoin Starting with a presale price of $0.000000139 , Pepeto has already attracted over $5.52 million in early funding. Unlike typical meme coins that trade on hype alone, Pepeto incorporates a thoughtful utility component. Central to the project is a staking model offering an annual yield of 270%, motivating holders to lock up tokens for sustained returns. This approach helps maintain stability and minimizes sudden sell-offs. Beyond staking, Pepeto’s standout features include a dedicated memecoin exchange and a blockchain bridge for seamless cross-chain transactions and swaps. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here. Live trading charts, swap and bridge features, and over 850 high-quality tokens already approved for listing once $Pepeto secures its Tier 1 exchange. While markets remain uncertain, the team behind the God of Frogs… pic.twitter.com/ndk5gYs6y4 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 23, 2025 Why Pepeto could leap ahead of DOGE and SHIB in Q3 Pepeto sets itself apart with a clear, phase-based roadmap that guides every stage of development. Its launch strategy includes smart contract audits, staking features, AMAs, and large-scale listings across multiple exchanges. Phase three will see the debut of its exchange and bridge platform, unlocking real-time trading and liquidity transfers. Phase four will roll out staking services alongside a global marketing effort. Compared to DOGE and SHIB both largely fueled by community sentiment, Pepeto offers measurable value. Allocating 30% of tokens for staking, 30% for presale buyers, and maintaining reserves for liquidity and promotion shows intentional planning. With over 31 trillion PEPETO tokens staked already, the project has proven early backing and trust. About Pepeto Pepeto is an innovative cryptocurrency project combining memecoin culture with a robust, utility-focused ecosystem. It provides a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for frictionless swaps, and staking rewards to fuel the next wave of meme coins. To learn more about Pepeto, visit its website and socials.

Exciting opportunities are emerging that could lead to substantial gains. This article dives into which digital currencies are poised for significant growth. Discover which coins might offer a fresh chance at transformative profits. The potential for remarkable investment returns is on the horizon. Ethereum Market Outlook: Past Trends and Current Trading Zones Ethereum showed modest gains over the past week and month with increases of 2.39% and 3.28% respectively, while over the last six months, its price dropped by 24.22%. The coin moved within a trading range between $2111 and $2870.69, demonstrating short-term strength but failing to reverse the longer-term downtrend. Technical indicators, including a moderate RSI of 54.57, suggest limited recovery attempts. Price behavior during this interval reveals a struggle between brief bullish spurts and a prevailing caution due to previous losses, indicated by overall percentage decline. Historical data shows sporadic upward movement unable to offset sustained pressure over extended periods. Current trading sees Ethereum operating within a defined resistance and support range. The price fluctuates between $2111 at support and $2870.69 at the upper limit, with immediate resistance near $3254.47 and secondary resistance at $4014. Support strengthens at $1735.41, with an additional cautionary level near $975.87. Bulls have enough strength to push prices upward, but bears still influence the market due to the long-term downtrend. Trading ideas involve watching for a breakout above $3254.47 as a bullish sign and potential rebounds at $1735.41 for short-term entries. A cautious approach between these levels, along with risk management around resistance and support zones, can help traders capitalize on market movements. Solana Price Analysis: Volatility Today, Future Potential Tomorrow Solana past performance shows a modest rebound within the month with a 2.98% gain, while over the past six months prices fell by 24.61%. Weekly data hints at minor corrections with a 0.65% decline during the last week. Price fluctuations reveal that short-term recoveries have not been sustained, indicating trader caution amid shifting market conditions. Recent swings suggest that while small gains are feasible, the longer trend has been downward, reflecting a period of readjustment and volatility. The current trading range sits between approximately $131 and $173, with immediate resistance around $191.77 and a secondary barrier at $233.73. On the downside, support appears near $107.88, with a deeper cushion around $65.93 offering entry points for buyers. Technical indicators show a positive Awesome Oscillator at 1.63, a Momentum reading of 10.20, and a neutral RSI of 52.63. Bulls are testing resistance levels, while bears push back near support. Trading ideas include watching for a break above $191.77 for bullish confirmation or accumulating near $107.88 for potential rebounds. Cardano Price Dynamics: Cautious Setup Amid Bearish Trends Last month, Cardano dropped by about 10.52%, although a modest one-week gain of 1.56% provided a brief moment of strength. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a substantial decline of 40.59%, revealing a prolonged period of bearish pressure. Price activity during these periods shows a general downward trend, with investors remaining hesitant despite occasional signs of recovery. Currently, Cardano trades within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, facing resistance near $0.83 and support at $0.38. A push above $0.83 could lead traders to target around $1.05, while a dip below $0.38 may trigger stronger selling. Technical indicators reveal mixed signals: the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.025, while the Momentum Indicator shows a mild uptick at 0.028. RSI close to 46.92 indicates neutral conditions without a clear trend. The market favors bears, suggesting traders might consider short-term entries near support with tight stop-loss measures to manage risk. Conclusion ETH , SOL , and ADA are showing promising signs. These coins have seen substantial development and growing adoption. ETH continues to be a strong player with its advancements. SOL impresses with high-speed transactions and efficiency. ADA focuses on innovative solutions. The market's current signals make it a favorable time to consider these cryptocurrencies. Such opportunities could lead to significant gains.

SpacePay’s Multi-Wallet Support and Instant Settlements Drive Presale Success,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/spacepays-multi-wallet-support-instant-settlements-drive-presale-success/,"The post Next Big Crypto? SpacePay’s Multi-Wallet Support and Instant Settlements Drive Presale Success appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SpacePay is helping merchants to accept crypto for everyday usage. Even though crypto is getting popular, using it for everyday transactions is quite difficult. That is where SpacePay comes with its technology. The success stems from SpacePay’s focus on usability and compatibility. Unlike many crypto payment solutions that work with limited wallets or currencies, SpacePay supports over 325 different wallet providers. This eliminates the need for users to change their preferred payment methods. 325+ Wallet Compatibility Sets SpacePay Apart SpacePay can also connect with other popular wallet options like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Ledger Nano S. Payments can be made using the user’s existing wallet setup without having to download additional apps or create new accounts. The payment process is founded on simple QR code scanning technology. The customers just scan a code generated by the merchant’s point-of-sale system and pay through the wallet interface of their preference. The process disposes of the complex setup procedures and reduces transaction time. Cross-platform compatibility enables one to access Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT of Tether, and many more cryptocurrencies on one platform. The immense selection offers the buyer the option to select the method of payment based on what they have in their portfolio or what they prefer. Merchants like the cross-compatibility because it gives them a larger pool of possible customers. Rather than confining payment to certain cryptocurrencies or wallets, companies can accept payment from almost any cryptocurrency owner without extra integration effort. Instant Settlements and Volatility Protection for Merchants SpacePay processes transactions with zero waiting times for merchants. Traditional cryptocurrency payments often involve confirmation delays that can take minutes or hours. SpacePay’s system completes settlements immediately after transaction initiation. The platform includes automatic crypto-to-fiat conversion capabilities. When customers pay with cryptocurrency, merchants receive the equivalent amount in their local currency instantly. This happens at the moment of transaction, protecting businesses from subsequent price movements. The pricing structure is the same at 0.5% per transaction regardless of payment size or network utilization. Per-transaction or network load-based pricing is the most common model for legacy payment processors, and therefore costs can’t be relied on for budgeting. Volatility protection is more than real-time conversion. SpacePay fixes the exchange rate when customers trigger payment, removing losses from price fluctuations during processing. This functionality provides merchants reassurance to accept cryptocurrency payments. Advanced Security and Decentralized Architecture SpacePay incorporates NFC technology with two-way encryption protocols for secure transactions. The platform uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to protect payment information during transmission between devices and processing systems. Device authentication mechanisms limit transactions to verified devices only. This security layer reduces fraud risks by preventing unauthorized access from unrecognized hardware. Users must authenticate their devices before completing payments. Unlike centralized payment systems where third parties hold user assets, SpacePay allows customers to manage their crypto from their own wallets throughout the payment process. SPY Token Features Drive Presale Growth The SPY token presale continues at $0.003181 per token with multiple payment options available. Participants can purchase tokens using USDT, USDC, ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, and BASE cryptocurrencies. Traditional bank card payments are also accepted for conventional users. Revenue sharing gives SPY holders passive income opportunities based on platform performance. Token holders receive portions of SpacePay’s transaction fee revenue, creating direct financial benefits from platform growth and adoption. Monthly voting rights allow SPY holders to influence platform development decisions. Token holders can vote on new feature proposals, partnership opportunities, and strategic direction changes. These voting sessions occur once per month with results binding on platform development. Early access benefits give SPY holders first access to new features before public release. This advantage allows token holders to test new capabilities and provide feedback while gaining competitive advantages in using platform features. Regular webinars provide direct interaction between SPY owners and the SpacePay management team. The 45-minute webinars include company news, upcoming releases, and business plans. The company CEOs respond directly to questions. SpacePay’s feature-rich approach addresses practical needs in cryptocurrency payments while providing tangible benefits to token holders.

Those looking for substantial growth opportunities should keep an eye on AI, Real-World Assets (RWAs), and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). The upcoming article will delve into which specific coins are primed to ride these surging waves, promising potential gains. Injective (INJ) Price Trends Face Key Support and Resistance Levels Last month INJ saw an 11.47% decline with a six-month drop nearing 55.69%. The past week also recorded a fall of 7.92%. Price movements remained confined within a range of $8.40 to $13.74, reflecting a steady downward trend. Overall sentiment has leaned bearish, with indicators showing a lack of strong upward momentum. Recorded declines point to reduced buyer engagement and increased caution among traders. This behavior highlights persistent pressure on price and indicates a risk-averse market stance, without any significant reversals or recoveries occurring. Currently, price hovers between immediate support at $6.01 and resistance at $16.71, with a broader floor at $0.66 and further top resistance located around $22.05. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook; the Awesome Oscillator is in negative territory, momentum remains flat, and the RSI is approximately 44.84, hinting at bearish influence without a complete takeover. The market lacks clear control from either buyers or sellers, resulting in sideways movement. Caution is advised when trading within these levels, as a dip toward support could present a buying chance if a reversal forms, while a breach may lead to heavier selling pressure. Stellar Shows Volatility and Steady Testing of Support Levels Last month XLM saw a slight decline of about 4.5%, while over the past six months, the coin experienced a much steeper drop near 40%. Recently, a one-week performance showed a rise of 4.2%, indicating a minor recovery amid fluctuations. The month and half-year charts reveal the coin’s sensitivity to market changes, with the longer-term downturn suggesting caution for holders and traders alike. The current price is trading within a range of $0.21 to $0.28, with immediate resistance at $0.31 and another barrier at $0.38. Support is established near $0.18, and a secondary level at $0.11 provides extra cushion. Price indicators offer mixed signals; the Awesome Oscillator is slightly below zero, momentum remains modest, and the RSI is around 51.8, suggesting neutral territory. Market sentiment is split between cautious optimism and bearish pressure, making it essential for traders to monitor price behavior approaching resistance levels. Bittensor (TAO): Mixed Momentum with Clear Key Levels Bittensor has faced a significant decline, recording price changes of -11.90% in the past month and -35.11% over the last six months. This persistent downward pressure indicates ongoing bearish sentiment, where the asset has struggled to maintain its value. The recent performance illustrates a market characterized by caution, prompting investors to monitor key support levels for potential signs of stabilization. Currently, Bittensor trades within a range of $267 to $422.83, with resistance near $510.97 and support at $199.37. There are additional resistance levels at $666.77 and a lower support around $43.57. Technical indicators reveal a strong bearish bias, with the Awesome Oscillator at -24.82 and the Momentum Indicator at -2.5. The RSI of 43.27 suggests a neutral to slightly bearish outlook. Traders should watch for movements beyond key levels to identify potential opportunities, focusing on breakouts for bullish positions or buying near support during signs of recovery. Conclusion The significant focus for the remainder of 2025 involves AI, RWAs, and DePIN technologies. INJ , XLM , and TAO are key players in this emerging market. These coins are positioned well to benefit from the increased interest and investment in these technologies. With their innovative features, they are expected to lead the charge and offer strong growth potential. As these sectors expand, INJ, XLM, and TAO will likely be pivotal in driving progress and adoption. The rapid evolution of these areas makes these coins essential to watch in the coming months.

On Monday, cumulative open interest in XRP perpetual futures listed on major exchanges briefly rose to 800 million XRP, the most since Jan. 19, according to data source Velo. The platform tracks activity in USDT and USD perpetuals listed on Binance, Bybit, OKX and Hyperliquid. Cumulative open interest is currently 743 million XRP, still 33% higher than on June 22, when XRP put in an interim price bottom at $1.90. Open interest refers to the number of futures contracts open or active at a given time. An increase represents an influx of money into the market, although it doesn't give any clues about the nature of the flows. That said, the recent surge in open interest seems to have been led by traders chasing bullish long bets. That's because perpetual funding rates have consistently held positive, occasionally topping the annualized 10% mark, pointing to demand for bullish exposure. Exchanges typically collect funding rates every eight hours and involve longs paying shorts when the demand for bullish bets results in perpetuals trading at a premium to the spot price. Also pointing to the bullish mood in the market is the ""top trader long/short ratio"" in the Binance-listed XRP/USDT market. As of writing, the ratio tracked by Coinglass stood at 1.90, implying that for every short, there are two long positions open. Short positions profit when the cryptocurrency declines. Last week, the Deribit-listed options market saw traders chase the higher strike XRP calls. Still, the cryptocurrency's spot price is yet to see notable bullish volatility. On Monday, prices rose to a high of $2.35, the level last seen at the end of May, only to quickly fall back to $2.25 and remain around that level.",Markets|XRP|Futures|Markets|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-08 07:43:07

With new projects gaining traction and innovations driving momentum, this guide delves into the top coins that show promise. Readers will discover which cryptocurrencies could yield notable returns, making them worth watching and possibly investing in this month. Celestia Faces Volatility Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Celestia has experienced notable volatility over the past month and half-year. The coin saw a significant decline with a one-month drop of nearly 17% that reflects short-term market uncertainty. Over the half-year period, the price deteriorated dramatically by over 66%, signaling a persistently bearish trend. Despite these declines, the recent one-week gain of 5.33% offers a glimpse of potential recovery amidst prevailing market challenges. Historical price movements indicate that traders have faced substantial downward momentum, while sudden short-term rebounds hint at opportunities for risk-takers. Overall, the fluctuations over the last month and six months underscore a period marked by rapid shifts and cautious market sentiment. Celestia currently trades between $1.04 and $2.02. At a price range anchored by a firm support at $0.69 and a strong resistance at $2.66, the coin appears to be trading in a confined channel. Traders are focusing on overcoming the $2.66 mark, which if breached could lead to further upside toward the secondary resistance near $3.64. Market signals reveal mixed indicators. The relative strength index stands near a neutral reading of 47.71 while momentum indicators show only mild optimism. Moving average and oscillator recommendations lean slightly negative, suggesting that bearish pressure still influences the market despite minor recovery signs. In this setup, short-term buyers and cautious sellers may adopt strategies including tight stop losses and waiting for confirmed breakouts. Hedera Market Analysis: Price Trends and Strategic Levels HBAR prices have shown modest movement over the last month with a slight decline of 3.10% and a one-week gain of 4.58%, indicating short-term stabilization amid overall volatility. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a sharper decline of 44.83%, reflecting prolonged downward pressure. Trading has taken place within a defined range between $0.12 and $0.18, suggesting that while the coin has maintained some momentum, it remains under pressure over the longer term. Price fluctuations during these periods have set the stage for traders to anticipate potential shifts as market sentiment reacts to both short-term recovery signals and longer-term bearish trends. HBAR currently trades between $0.12 and $0.18, with immediate resistance at $0.21 and a secondary cap near $0.27, while support stands firm at $0.09 with deeper safety at $0.0377. Bulls are testing the upper resistance, aiming for gains, while bears are active near lower support levels, creating a tug-of-war environment. No clear trend emerges as price remains range-bound, making it important to monitor breakout signs. Traders might consider buying on dips if the price respects the $0.09 support, setting profit targets around the $0.21 level, and exercising caution near the $0.27 zone. The current market is ripe for flexible trading strategies while maintaining prudent risk controls. Aave Market Trends and Key Price Levels AAVE recorded a 14.70% gain over the last month and a modest 3.35% rise during the past week, while the six-month period saw a slight decline of 6.13%. Price action has oscillated within the range of $216.91 to $328.64, reflecting short-term strength and longer-term caution. Data shows clear bursts of upward movement in the monthly figures, offset by an overall downturn over six months. Recent gains hint at renewed interest, even as longer spans highlight ongoing challenges. Current price levels balance bullish attempts with cautious resistance. Price is trading between $216.91 and $328.64, with immediate support at $159.44 and nearest resistance at $382.89. A secondary resistance at $494.61 provides another barrier, while a deep support around $47.72 sets a long-term floor. Momentum indicators show a neutral to mildly positive sentiment among traders, but no clear trend emerges. Traders might consider accumulating positions cautiously within this range while preparing for potential movements around key support and resistance levels. Conclusion TIA , HBAR , AAVE present strong opportunities this month. Each shows unique potential in growth and development. TIA focuses on innovative solutions. HBAR offers efficient transaction speeds. AAVE continues to lead in decentralized finance. SOL showcases impressive network capabilities. Monitoring these assets may lead to strategic investment decisions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Economists at the agency predict that the rate cut could begin in September as inflation pressures ease and the impact of tariffs weakens. This forecast means the previous December expectation has been brought forward by three months. The Goldman Sachs Research Team also revised its final level estimate for the FED's policy rate. The terminal rate expectation, which was previously in the range of 3.50-3.75%, was lowered to the range of 3.00-3.25%. This revision is driven by the expectation that the impact of tariff policies on prices will be more limited than expected and the stronger impact of other disinflationary factors. Goldman Sachs Chief U.S. Economist David Mericle said the probability of a September rate cut was “a little over 50%.” Mericle and his team expect rate cuts of 25 basis points in September, October and December 2025, as well as in March and June 2025. However, a July cut is not expected.

Although the labor market appears healthy, it is noted that finding a job has become more difficult. In addition, seasonal effects and changes in immigration policy pose downside risks to employment data in the near term. On the inflation front, positive signals stand out. According to Goldman Sachs, the impact of customs duties imposed on China on consumer prices was lower than expected. In addition, inflation expectations in the Michigan and Conference Board surveys declined. The slowdown in wage increases and the weakness in travel demand were among the additional disinflationary factors. Goldman Sachs said the revision to the terminal interest rate was not due to a change in the economy’s long-term natural interest rate. Mericle said, “The lack of clarity about the true neutral interest rate could cause the terminal rate to remain flexible depending on policymakers’ perceptions.” The fact that there was no significant change in the FOMC dot plot chart in June and that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term will end in 2026 indicates that new approaches to monetary policy may be adopted in the future. *This is not investment advice.

Among them, Sui and Aptos stand out, hinting at a robust rally ahead. The spotlight is now on the Move-language narrative, which has never seemed more compelling. Discover how these coins might be gearing up for a serious breakout. SUI Market Analysis: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels The past month SUI showed a modest retracement with a 0.29% increase over one week but an overall decline of 8.98%. In the last half-year, SUI faced a stronger drop nearing 39.16%. The coin has experienced notable volatility, reflecting a recent decline that counters its weekly steadiness. Pricing has been constrained within the range of $2.19 to $3.48, indicating a period of adjustment after prolonged bearish pressure and illustrating fluctuations in price dynamics over time. Current levels position SUI in a defined trading zone with resistance at $4.19 and support at $1.59. A secondary resistance is near $5.49, while a further support level exists around $0.30. Technical indicators suggest a neutral outlook, as the RSI hovers near 50 at 49.57, and the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.009. Price action does not exhibit a clear trend, with bulls and bears in a subtle tug-of-war. Traders may find opportunities within the $1.59 to $4.19 range, but caution is advised until a distinct direction emerges. Aptos Price Analysis: Past Decline and Current Key Levels Over the last month, Aptos experienced a decline of about 3.54% after suffering a dramatic 54.01% drop over the preceding six months. A one-week decrease of 10.20% further emphasizes the volatile nature of the coin. The steep half-year loss reflects a sustained period of selling pressure and uncertainty among traders, while the modest monthly drop suggests limited recovery attempts amid ongoing market challenges. Currently, Aptos trades in a price range between $3.99 and $5.55. The nearest resistance is pegged at $6.22, with a solid support level near $3.09. There is a second resistance at $7.78 and secondary support closer to $1.53. Indicators show bears are in control, although the trend remains uncertain. If buyers can push above $6.22, momentum might turn positive and challenge $7.78. Conversely, a dip toward $3.09 could trigger buying interest, leading to a possible recovery bounce. Conclusion SUI and APT have demonstrated their potential through impressive rallies. Their strong performance highlights the growing importance of the Move-Language narrative. This trend indicates that innovative technologies can drive significant growth in the market. The success of these coins suggests that they may continue to attract attention and investments. Their upward movement underscores the impact of new advancements and strategic developments. The rising interest in such projects might pave the way for more exciting opportunities in the industry.

On July 7, crypto community members on X circulated screenshots of a Gate.io page advertising a sale for Pump.fun’s native token, PUMP, scheduled to begin on July 12. The page detailed a 72-hour initial exchange offering, pricing 150 billion tokens at $0.004 each, implying a raise of $600 million and a fully diluted valuation of $4 billion. https://twitter.com/wublockchain/status/1942363254556352886?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The token sale, if accurate, would mark Pump.fun’s first official public fundraising round. However, the exchange has since deleted the announcement without explanation, with the page now displaying a 404 error. Neither Pump.fun nor Gate.io has addressed the page removal, and no formal updates have been posted by Pump.fun’s co-founder Alon Cohen. Speculation around a $1 billion raise at a $4 billion valuation first emerged in early June, though the platform has repeatedly avoided confirming or denying the rumors. The now-deleted Gate.io page appeared to align with those earlier reports, indicating a serious move toward monetizing the platform’s success, a plan now in limbo.

It has now facilitated over 11 million token creations, generating roughly $700 million in protocol revenue, as per Dune Analytics data . Yet, Pump.fun has faced increasing legal scrutiny. Following a warning from the Financial Conduct Authority, it was banned in the United Kingdom and is currently facing a class-action lawsuit in the United States regarding alleged unregistered securities. The abrupt removal of the IEO listing raises concerns about potential shifts in token economics, internal platform decisions, or regulatory pressure.

Chainlink and Pyth Network are key forces behind this shift. Their innovations in blockchain oracles are setting the stage for the next wave of DeFi growth. This article delves into the technologies and potential market movers poised for significant gains. Chainlink Price Review and Key Trading Zones Chainlink experienced a minor drop of approximately 0.25% over the past month, following a more significant decline of around 36.67% over the last six months. The price has been fluctuating between approximately $11 and $15.70. In the short term, a modest weekly decline of 1.16% sets the stage for potential price adjustments. Market indicators, such as a 51.24 Relative Strength Index and a momentum indicator close to 0.50, suggest balanced market activity despite the ongoing downtrend. Current price activity shows Chainlink navigating within clear support and resistance levels. The nearest support is around $8.63, with a second support at $3.93, providing potential entry points for buyers. Conversely, the nearest resistance stands at $18.03, followed by $22.73, where sellers may resist upward movement. The market lacks a strong trend, indicating a balance between bulls and bears. Traders could consider entering near support levels and using resistance for profit-taking or risk management, favoring cautious strategies until a decisive breakout occurs. Pyth Network Price Analysis Amid Bearish Trends and Key Levels Recent PYTH price data shows a clear decline over short and extended periods with weekly losses of 11.56% and a monthly drop of 12.60%, while the half-year performance marked a steep decline of 72.06%. Price movement remained confined within a narrow band between $0.08 and $0.13. These figures highlight a period marked by continued selling pressure and limited recovery attempts over the last month, with momentum fading over a much longer timeframe. Trends reveal that persistent bearish activity has eroded value steadily, emphasizing an environment of weakened investor sentiment. Current prices hover within the $0.08 to $0.13 range, with traders watching key levels closely. Immediate resistance stands at $0.16, with a further ceiling near $0.21. Support is seen at $0.06 and a lower benchmark at $0.007. Indicators show mixed signals with a slightly negative oscillator reading and a near-neutral momentum indicator, while RSI at 46.44 points to indecision in the market. Bears have a slight edge with negative moving average recommendations, but some oscillators suggest potential upward movement. Trading ideas suggest waiting for a break above the $0.16 resistance level, while any dip near $0.06 might present a buying opportunity.

On July 9, Garlinghouse and other top industry voices will share why the country urgently needs clear crypto market rules and what they believe lawmakers should do next. Pushing for Clear Crypto Rules In a recent tweet post, Garlinghouse announced that he feels honored to speak directly to lawmakers about why the U.S. needs proper rules for digital assets. Meanwhile, he thanked Senator Tim Scott, Senator Cynthia Lummis, and Senator Ruben Gallego for leading the way and supporting crypto-friendly rules. He believes that strong but fair rules can protect everyday people and still let new ideas grow.

Right now, it’s often confusing for crypto companies to know which agency they should answer to the SEC or the CFTC. Key Crypto Bills on the Table Meanwhile, this hearing comes as Congress looks at three big bills: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the GENIUS Act. Together, these could finally bring clear rules for how crypto companies, brokers, and exchanges work. One of the biggest pieces is the CLARITY Act . It aims to settle the fight over whether the SEC or the CFTC should control different digital coins. Senator Tim Scott has hinted that this bill could even pass by October if all goes well. Who Else Will Speak? Brad won’t be alone in this important hearing. Other speakers include Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin, Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, and a top Harvard expert. They will share why smart rules matter and how they can help the U.S. stay ahead in the global crypto space.

This marks the first time since late March that the largest corporate holder of BTC has not added to its impressive treasury, which currently stands at 597,325 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $64.71 billion. Strategy Bitcoin Investment Hits A Pause The lack of activity in Bitcoin acquisitions is surprising, especially given Strategy’s aggressive purchases over the past few months. These purchases have brought the company close to holding nearly 3% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. From April 7 through June 29, the company invested $6.77 billion in acquiring 69,140 BTC, averaging about $97,906 per coin. At current market prices, these investments have appreciated by 10.4%, now worth around $7.49 billion. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 In terms of trading, Strategy’s stock (trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol MSTR) saw a slight decline of 0.7% during morning trading hours, which is in line with the 0.8% drop in Bitcoin prices. As of this writing, MSTR closed the day at $395. This highlights the close relationship between the company’s performance and the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the company’s stock has enjoyed a rise of 38.5% in 2025, outpacing BTC’s 16.1% increase and the S&P 500’s modest gain of 6.1%. Up To $4.2 Billion For Future BTC Investments In addition to this pause in BTC purchases, Strategy did not issue any new common or preferred shares during the specified week. However, the company announced a sales agreement to potentially issue and sell up to $4.2 billion in 10% preferred stock. According to Monday’s press release on the matter by the Bitcoin proxy firm, the proceeds from this sales agreement are earmarked for general corporate purposes, which include future BTC acquisitions and working capital needs.

Here’s The Target The new preferred stock, known as Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, will be sold in a “disciplined manner,” taking market conditions into account, highlighting the firm’s ongoing commitment to leveraging its financial strategies to enhance its BTC holdings, even as it temporarily steps back from direct purchases. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,855, marking a 1.5% decline within the last 24 hours, increasing the gap between the current price and its record by 3.5%. This follows a failed attempt last week to overcome the cryptocurrency’s most significant resistance level of $110,000 and establish a new all-time high above its current record of $111,800.

With the next hearing on July 15, many are asking: When will they finally get their tokens back? July 18 marks one year since the big hack. A year later, victims are still stuck in the same place they started and are waiting, with no resolution in sight. Recently, just days before the July 18 hack anniversary, a user Romy Johnson filed a fiery 40-page affidavit demanding the return of unhacked funds. He accuses the company of hiding a Panama shell entity and shifting asset classifications. The key question now is whether this serves justice or if there is more courtroom drama ahead. Will Justice Be Delayed For Everyone? However, one user warns that the affidavit could yet again delay the WazirX Fund Recovery. He warns that this move could derail the entire recovery plan, which is designed to treat all users, hacked and unhacked, fairly.

This forecast ties together market momentum, investor psychology, and broader adoption patterns within the cryptocurrency space. As Bitcoin continues to be the dominant force in the market, speculation grows regarding its long-term price potential. One prediction suggests that a major Bitcoin rally could ignite large-cap and meme-based altcoins alike. Ethereum's Potential at $18,500: Market Factors and Network Strength Ethereum remains one of the most widely adopted innovative contract platforms. Its position as the leading Layer 1 network for decentralized applications, NFTs, and DeFi supports ongoing demand for ETH. If Bitcoin were to climb to $300,000, market analysts expect Ethereum to follow closely due to historical correlations and investor rotations from Bitcoin profits into altcoins. Ethereum’s ecosystem strength lies in its network effect. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) supports a broad range of applications across finance, gaming, and social platforms. Upgrades like the Merge and ongoing scalability improvements through Layer 2 solutions continue to enhance its efficiency. If institutional investment increases alongside a Bitcoin surge, ETH could benefit from capital inflows and renewed developer interest. Little Pepe's $3 Projection: Meme Utility Meets Layer 2 Technology The forecast also placed the meme-inspired token, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), at $3, presenting a dramatic rise from its current presale value of $0.0013. Little Pepe distinguishes itself from other meme coins by building on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 network that prioritizes speed and low fees. Its $LILPEPE token functions as a utility asset, supporting staking, transaction fees, and ecosystem activity. For LILPEPE to reach $3, several market conditions must align. One critical factor would be a surge in user adoption fueled by community growth, influencer promotion, and viral interest across social media. Moreover, if Layer 2 usage expands in applications like gaming and microtransactions, demand for efficient platforms like Little Pepe could rise substantially. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale, Little Pepe has already raised over $3.41 million by selling over 2.93 billion tokens, signaling strong investor confidence. Stage 1 launched on June 10 at a price of $0.001 per token and saw 500 million tokens sold, raising $500,000 within just 72 hours. Stage 2 followed with tokens priced at $0.0011, selling 1.167 billion tokens and raising $1.325 million ahead of schedule. The momentum carried into Stage 3, where tokens were offered at $0.0012—over 2 billion tokens were sold, bringing total funds raised to more than $2.5 million. Now in Stage 4 at $0.0013, Little Pepe is closing in on its $4.475 million presale hard cap. The meme coin also allows purchases through Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and card payments. This accessibility, along with its focus on zero taxes and high transaction speeds, adds to its appeal as a scalable and user-friendly alternative in the meme coin space. Conditions Required for a $300,000 Bitcoin and Its Impact on Altcoins The prediction centers on Bitcoin reaching $300,000, a level far above its current price. To get such a target, global macroeconomic conditions would need to favor risk assets. This scenario may include lower interest rates, increased inflation hedging, or rising institutional investment in digital assets. Capital inflows could also be achieved by spot Bitcoin ETFs, growth in corporate holdings, and the embrace of sovereign funds. In the past, altcoins followed the rise of Bitcoin when Bitcoin was experiencing a rally. This trend is referred to as altcoin season, with retail and institutional investors spreading investments across the board and generally gaining huge appreciation in the prices of smaller investments. In this regard, Ethereum and LILPEPE can also gain more attention, particularly if their utility and ecosystems are extended further. The movement of Bitcoin is usually a signal in the market. If the $300,000 target comes true, the total sum of all the crypto market caps would be higher than $10 trillion. In this environment, Ethereum can gain a larger share of this market, and well-utilized meme coins such as LILPEPE can do better because of speculative and viral marketing. Conclusion Ethereum's speculations at 18500 and Little Pepe's at three are based on the most optimistic view of Bitcoin. Although a hypothetical situation, it shows the level of interconnectedness that cryptocurrency markets find themselves in. When Bitcoin goes to new highs, Ethereum and tokens based on memes that have actual use might gain tremendously. Investors and analysts will still pay attention to the events occurring in macroeconomics, technological innovation (in blockchain), and regulatory policy to determine how probable a future it may be.

The legislation aims to settle long-standing regulatory uncertainty by assigning primary oversight of digital assets to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). At the same time, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would oversee digital assets classified as securities. This dual-framework approach eliminates years of ambiguity and jurisdictional conflict burdening the crypto industry. The letter urged politicians not to play politics but to concentrate on the long-term gains that the adoption of blockchain technology holds. “We know that there have been efforts to politicize crypto legislation, but with crypto drastically reshaping the global economy, the US risks falling behind unless we adopt pro-crypto policies that fully embrace blockchain technology,” it said. Crypto industry rallies behind CLARITY Act as US risks losing global edge The coalition of companies behind the letter, which includes some of the biggest names in the non-fungible token (NFT) business, like OpenSea and Dapper Labs, contends that its leadership in digital assets is dwindling at a high velocity. The absence of a consistent, national crypto framework drives startups, devs, and investors out of the US into countries with clearer and more embracing rules. The groups warned that failure to take action and ongoing uncertainty could endanger America’s economic future. They emphasized in the letter that the industry requires a reliable market structure to attract talent and drive innovation. They argued that without such a framework, the United States risked losing the benefits of blockchain technology and digital finance. The industry itself is extremely cyclical, with the super major oil and gas companies bouncing up and down in the markets over the years, and the CLARITY Act certainly provides stability, they argue. It would also clarify how different digital assets are treated under US law, allowing companies to build and grow here confidently. It would also enable regulators to regulate the industry without hampering innovation. House Republican leaders said July 14 would be “Crypto Week,” a special week for concentrated legislative work. While in session, members of Congress will look to hold discussions and consider the CLARITY Act, as well as two other marquee bills in the form of the GENIUS Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The GENIUS Act, which sets stablecoin rules, has already cleared the Senate. President Donald Trump publicly backed the bill and urged lawmakers to pass it before the August recess. The Anti-CBDC bill, on the other hand, would prevent a US central bank digital currency from being formed. The GENIUS Act may be the first to reach a vote, but the CLARITY Act isn’t far behind. It was approved by the House Financial Services Committee and the Agriculture Committee on June 10 and is awaiting a full House vote. If approved, it will head to the Senate, where Banking Committee Chair Senator Tim Scott reportedly stated that he would like to pass a crypto market bill in September. Democrats slam CLARITY Act as a ‘crypto con’ tied to Trump’s business interest The CLARITY Act is gaining traction despite strong opposition from Democrats. Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has criticized the bill as rushed and irresponsible, warning that it would weaken oversight of high-risk digital asset activities and open the door to potential abuse. Waters has also raised concerns about the growing entanglement between Donald Trump’s financial interests and federal crypto policy . She dubbed the bill “Trump’s crypto con,” pointing to the president’s expanding footprint in the digital asset space, including trading platforms, a stablecoin, a mining company, NFTs, and other token ventures, estimated to have brought in at least $620 million. This has led to concerns among Democrats that recent bills around crypto could have more to do with lining their own pockets than with the public interest. Democrats fear that recent crypto legislation may be more about personal gain than sound policy, sparking deeper concerns about conflicts of interest and the true motivations behind the push.

According to Reuters , Metaplanet’s trading volume rose to 1.86 trillion yen ($12.87 billion) in June. Tokyo Stock Exchange data shows that the numbers are nearly double the 997.6 billion yen ($6.82 billion) in May. The firm’s June trading volume surpassed that of Toyota Motor and Sony Group on the prime market, while the top spot was taken by Advantest. Further, the company has been maintaining its top position since November last year, the report added. The hotelier-turned Bitcoin acquisition company is currently the world’s fifth-largest corporate buyer of Bitcoin. Metaplanet’s Tokyo-listed shares have surged more than 345% this year, after it made a “strategic pivot” to become a Bitcoin treasury firm in 2024. ロイター報道：メタプラネット、6月の売買代金は1.86兆円でスタンダード市場首位。トヨタやソニーなどプライム市場の大型株を上回る取引規模に。 pic.twitter.com/Bv12J2BbuY — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) July 8, 2025 Japanese Bond Market Chaos: Investors Turn to Metaplanet Due to Transparency Per Metaplanet’s website , the company now holds 15,555 Bitcoin worth $1.69 billion at press time. With Japan’s 30-year government bond prices dropping 45% since 2019, investors are increasingly looking into Metaplanet as a Bitcoin proxy, due to the instability in fixed-income markets. Analysts noted that despite the rally, the company’s market net asset value (mNAV) is reasonable and has room to grow. Additionally, Metaplanet has been transparent in providing Proof of Reserves for its Bitcoin holdings, unlike its peers. The company CEO, Simon Gerovich, has publicly released on-chain verification of the company’s BTC assets. This comes in contrast with the largest BTC corporate holder, Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, who recently called on-chain proof-of-reserves a “bad idea” that could pose security threats. On Monday, Metaplanet announced a 2,205 Bitcoin acquisition , the latest purchase in its aggressive accumulation strategy. Since early 2025, the company has expanded its Bitcoin holdings from just 4,000 BTC in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, a fourfold increase in its position in just four months. Crypto Community Raise Concerns Over Corporate BTC Treasury Strategy However, there is skepticism among the community around the sustainability of the growing Bitcoin treasury trend. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, noted that BTC holding firms may have shaky ground , as rising threats might erode shareholder value. VanEck exec @matthew_sigel warns Bitcoin treasury strategies could backfire, as firms nearing NAV risk eroding shareholder value through continued BTC accumulation. #VanEck #BitcoinTreasury https://t.co/jEINL4NuxY — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 Besides, Glassnode lead analyst James Check, raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy. He argues that these firms have “a far shorter lifespan than most expect.” “It’s about how serious & sustainable your product & Strategy is to sustain the accumulation,” he wrote on X last week.

The scrutiny follows a public warning from OpenAI, which clarified that Robinhood’s so-called “OpenAI tokens” do not represent any equity stake in the company. According to CNBC, the Bank of Lithuania, Robinhood’s primary regulator in the region, is seeking clarifications before assessing whether the offerings comply with existing financial regulations. “Only after receiving and evaluating this information will we be able to assess the legality and compliance of these specific instruments,” said Giedrius Šniukas, a spokesperson for the Bank of Lithuania. Robinhood launched its layer-2 blockchain in the EU on June 30, aiming to support tokenized securities and attract European investors with more than 200 US stock and ETF tokens. However, the brokerage’s plans to issue private equity tokens for unlisted companies like OpenAI and SpaceX have triggered regulatory concerns, especially after OpenAI clarified that its tokens do not confer ownership rights. Robinhood’s Complex Products, Unclear Ownership The controversy centers on whether Robinhood’s tokens truly represent ownership or are merely derivatives providing indirect exposure to companies. Galaxy Research has described these instruments as “derivatives that provide indirect exposure to the underlying asset,” raising questions about transparency and investor understanding. Tokenized securities are increasingly being explored by brokerages looking to attract investors seeking fractional ownership and faster settlement times. Yet, the debate over Robinhood’s equity tokens highlights the challenges of balancing innovation with regulatory clarity in an emerging market. Industry experts note that the regulatory response to Robinhood’s offerings could set a precedent for tokenized securities across the EU, especially as financial authorities globally seek to ensure that new digital products align with existing investor protection frameworks. A Race for the Tokenization Market Despite the challenges, Robinhood’s expansion into tokenization aligns with a broader industry push into a market valued at over $24 billion, driven by growing interest from institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. A RedStone report recently highlighted that tokenization is gaining traction in private credit markets, offering lower barriers to entry and greater liquidity. At the “Tokenize This” conference in New York, industry leaders suggested that tokenized stocks alone could evolve into a trillion-dollar market. As Robinhood navigates regulatory hurdles, its ambitions reflect the broader race to capture a share of the tokenization pie while testing the boundaries of financial innovation in the EU.

However, a new contender, Ruvi AI (RUVI), is rapidly gaining attention among crypto enthusiasts and market analysts. With its innovative blend of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI), Ruvi AI not only offers practical utilities across diverse industries but also brings unparalleled transparency to investors. Analysts predict Ruvi AI’s token could reach $1 post-listing, representing a 66x return for investors, potentially outshining Avalanche’s performance this year. Here’s a closer look at why Ruvi AI is emerging as a strong challenger. Transparent Foundations Boost Trust Ruvi AI has earned investor confidence by prioritizing transparency and security. A critical step in this effort was a third-party audit by CyberScope, a recognized leader in blockchain security. The audit confirmed that Ruvi AI’s smart contracts are secure, tamper-free, and dependable, addressing concerns about the potential vulnerabilities that often accompany new projects. Adding further legitimacy, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange, ensuring liquidity post-presale. This partnership guarantees that investors can trade their tokens seamlessly on major platforms once the presale concludes, eliminating liquidity risks that are all too common in early-stage cryptocurrencies. Combined, these measures underpin Ruvi AI’s dedication to protecting its investors, a crucial factor in its rapid rise to prominence. Explosive Momentum During the Presale The numbers from Ruvi AI’s presale phase speak volumes about the demand for this project: $2.2 million raised, indicative of strong backing and market interest. Over 180 million tokens sold, showcasing investor enthusiasm. A community of 2,000+ holders, reflecting growing confidence in the project. Currently in Phase 2, Ruvi AI tokens are available for just $0.015 each, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Upon completion of the presale, token prices are set to rise to $0.07, delivering an almost 5x ROI for early buyers. Post-listing, analysts expect Ruvi AI’s valuation to soar to $1 per token, equating to an extraordinary 66x return, enough to rival or surpass Avalanche’s year-to-date prediction. Solving Real-World Problems with Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI separates itself from speculative tokens by addressing real-world challenges through its innovative use of blockchain and AI. Its scalable applications span multiple sectors, ensuring that its utility extends far beyond its presale allure. Smarter Marketing Solutions With Ruvi AI’s AI-powered marketing tools, businesses can fine-tune audience targeting, minimize ad spending inefficiencies, and maximize their ROI. These solutions are indispensable in the competitive landscape of digital marketing, offering companies the tools needed to thrive in a data-driven environment. Revolutionizing the Entertainment Industry For entertainers and creators, Ruvi AI provides blockchain-secured payment platforms, ensuring fair compensation and transparency. Additionally, AI-driven audience insights allow creators to engage audiences more effectively and uncover new revenue streams, making their efforts more sustainable and profitable. Transforming Financial Services Ruvi AI is making waves in fintech by integrating fraud detection systems and secure payment solutions. These innovations build trust in digital transactions, improve efficiency, and reduce risks, making Ruvi AI an attractive technology partner for businesses operating in financial services. By tackling real-world problems across these industries, Ruvi AI ensures demand for its token will remain strong long after the presale phase is over. Maximizing Returns Through VIP Investment Tiers Ruvi AI has created several VIP investment tiers, rewarding presale participants with substantial token bonuses. These structured tiers cater to both small-scale and large-scale investors, aligning with Ruvi AI’s focus on inclusivity and accessibility. VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers allow investors to amplify their potential returns significantly, providing a strong incentive to get involved early. Is Ruvi AI Set to Outshine Avalanche’s Predictions? Avalanche (AVAX), with its innovative blockchain capabilities, maintains a strong presence in the crypto space. However, its growth no longer mirrors the explosive momentum of its early years. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is emerging as a dynamic alternative with utility-driven applications, an audited foundation, and astronomical growth potential. With a projected post-listing price of $1 per token and an accessible Phase 2 price of just $0.015, Ruvi AI offers unmatched ROI potential for investors ready to act now. Beyond its financial appeal, Ruvi AI’s innovative use of blockchain and AI ensures it is well-positioned to disrupt industries and sustain long-term demand. For investors seeking a standout project with both security and scalability, Ruvi AI checks all the boxes.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Little Pepe is quickly capturing the spotlight in 2025’s memecoin race, with bold 50x growth projections and a purpose-built Layer-2 chain turning heads across crypto circles. Table of Contents A new meme titan emerges Why 50x isn’t just a dream Roadmap catalysts to watch Final words The crypto world moves in waves, and every so often, a new token arrives that captures the collective imagination of traders and speculators alike. In 2025, that token is Little Pepe (LILPEPE), a self‑proclaimed “heir” to Shiba Inu’s ( SHIB ) memecoin throne with ambitions of redefining what a viral crypto project can achieve. With the first three presale stages selling out in rocket‑speed succession and the fourth stage now live at just $0.0013 per token, LILPEPE is making a compelling case that its next phase could deliver returns as high as fifty‑fold in a mere fifteen weeks. A new meme titan emerges Rather than going the path of Shiba, LILPEPE introduces a purpose‑built Layer‑2 blockchain dedicated to memes, complete with ultra‑low fees, lightning‑fast finality, and an ecosystem designed to reward genuine believers. This isn’t a token crafted on a whim; it’s the culmination of battle‑tested code and viral marketing expertise. The same anonymous architects who have propelled previous meme successes are now backing LILPEPE, ensuring that both the technical underpinnings and the cultural resonance are equally robust. When the presale launched, stages one through three sold out in record time, reflecting both pent‑up demand and confidence in the project’s roadmap. With over $3.3 million raised so far, the community that’s rallied around Little Pepe isn’t merely chasing a fad, they’re placing strategic bets on a meme revolution. Why 50x isn’t just a dream Few investors take 50x targets at face value, and rightfully so. But the architects of LILPEPE believe they’ve crafted an environment where such gains are plausible. First, token scarcity plays a critical role. By reserving only 10% of the total supply for public liquidity and capping presale allocations at 50%, the token’s availability post‑launch will be limited, especially once the broader market catches wind of its innovations. Unlike traditional memecoins, which dwell exclusively on existing networks and compete for gas‑fee attention, LILPEPE’s Layer 2 allows it to capture every transaction fee, every staking reward, and every developer launch. When developers build meme launchpad applications, community‑driven NFT drops, or staking pools on the LILPEPE chain, token demand spikes organically. That network effect, combined with rapid staking rewards and a zero‑tax policy, is a catalyst for sustained upward pressure. With the internet abuzz over decentralized finance and meme metaverses, LILPEPE’s fourth presale stage at $0.0013 offers an inviting entry point before broader exchange listings. Historical patterns show that tokens trading at fractions of a cent before listing often multiply by tens or even hundreds of times within months of launch. Given LILPEPE’s presale performance, three sold‑out stages in rapid succession, there’s a strong precedent for another significant surge once the token hits Uniswap or major centralized exchanges. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Roadmap catalysts to watch Beyond its stellar presale performance, Little Pepe’s roadmap is studded with catalysts poised to drive real demand. The upcoming transition from presale to mainnet unlocks token staking and decentralized governance, giving holders a hands‑on role in the chain’s evolution. Plans for listings on major centralized exchanges will inject fresh liquidity, while the launch of a meme‑focused applications hub aims to attract new projects and users seeking a blockchain where their quirky creations can thrive. Crucially, the team’s promise of big‑name partnerships, already whispered among anonymous advisors, adds a layer of intrigue. When the first wave of established meme‑brands and influencers back the network, exposure will skyrocket, bringing a fresh cohort of participants eager to mint, trade, and speculate on the next viral token. Final words Little Pepe’s innovation around a dedicated meme Layer‑2 chain is shaping up to become a blueprint for future success stories. Should LILPEPE fully capitalize on its roadmap catalysts, the prospect of going 50x from $400 to $20,000 or even $20,000 into $1,000,000 moves from possible into strategic plausibility. With capital inflows already exceeding $3.3 million and token scarcity baked into the presale mechanics, the foundations for exponential growth are firmly in place. While skeptics may scoff at the notion of 50x in fifteen weeks, those who witnessed the lightning‑fast rises of past meme royalty know that, when executed flawlessly, the impossible becomes possible in the blink of a block confirmation.

Gareth West was arrested in Quebec on behalf of American authorities and is now facing extradition to the United States to face fraud charges, reports CBC/Radio-Canada. West is alleged to have posed as a wealthy real estate developer while running a complex “grandparent scam network” that employed more than 20 people and included multiple call centers in the Montreal area. He faces charges in the US of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). West is alleged to have been the mastermind behind grandparent scammers since at least 2021. The scammers would allegedly phone older Americans, pretend they were their grandchildren who had been arrested or hurt, and say they needed cash right away. Scammers would connect the elderly victims to fake lawyers or bail agents and arrange for cash pickups. Some 23 of West’s alleged scammer employees were arrested in March. Police allege that documents they’ve recovered from the suspected scammers show they scammed $30 million during a span of about 67 weeks. West faces up to 40 years in prison if extradited to the US and convicted of the crimes.

In a June 7 post on X, Coin Center director Peter Van Valkenburgh announced that the legal fight over the Treasury’s authority to sanction Tornado Cash has come to an end. His post came after the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals officially dismissed the case, per recent filings. “This is the official end to our court battle over the statutory authority behind the TC sanctions. The government was not interested in moving forward and defending their dangerously overbroad interpretation of sanctions laws,” he wrote. The dismissal follows a series of earlier rulings, including a November 2023 decision in which a district court rejected Coin Center’s argument that the sanctions violated First Amendment rights, ruling that the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) had acted within its authority when it sanctioned Tornado Cash. You might also like: ‘If I lose, DeFi dies with me:’ Tornado Cash co-founder doubles down on innocence ahead of trial OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash back in 2022, claiming the platform aided illegal financial activities, including the laundering of millions by the infamous North Korea-linked hacker group Lazarus . But earlier this year, a different Texas court ordered OFAC to lift the sanctions, and the government chose not to appeal that decision. As a result, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals said the case no longer needed to continue. “The government’s view is that OFAC’s rescission of the designation moots this appeal. Plaintiffs’ view is that this appeal will become moot after the Texas judgment becomes final and unappealable,” the court said. Still, Tornado Cash’s legal troubles are far from over. Roman Storm, who was indicted by the US Department of Justice over similar allegations of facilitating illicit financial activities, is set to stand trial next week. Storm has consistently maintained his innocence, stating that neither he nor his co-founders knowingly enabled criminal activity through the platform. Fellow Tornado Cash co-founder Alexey Pertsev was convicted in May 2024 on similar charges and sentenced to 64 months in prison. He was recently released but remains electronically monitored on house arrest. Meanwhile, the third developer involved in the creation of the platform, Roman Semenov, also named in the DOJ indictment, remains at large and has evaded authorities since the initial crackdown.

Short-term expectations for each memecoin are being shaped by retail interest, whale behavior, and ecosystem growth, even though market activity has generally decreased for the majority of altcoins. Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) is trading at $1.08 at press time, down more than 8% over the last day, but its trading volume has sharply increased by 78%, reaching $247 million. This jump in activity suggests increased trading interest, though price action points to near-term pressure. On the technical side, Fartcoin is moving toward the mid-band support around $1.06 after testing the upper Bollinger Band at $1.25. The lower band boundary, at about $0.88, is the next crucial support if that level breaks. The RSI is hovering just below 50, indicating a lack of strong momentum in either direction. Fartcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Even though higher trading volume can occasionally indicate accumulation, the recent rejection from resistance and the move lower on expanding volume may indicate distribution. Since Fartcoin is still trading in a small weekly range between $1.01 and $1.26, traders may wait for a clear breakout or breakdown before committing to a position. At $0.00008439, Floki ( FLOKI ) is up 15% over the last week but down 0.3% over the last day. Strong social traction and whale interest have kept sentiment around Floki bullish despite a sharp 46% decline in trading volume. Santiment data shows that Floki’s social volume and dominance recently reached their highest points since March, indicating a resurgence of retail interest and possible FOMO. According to on-chain data , exchange balances have continued to decline, reaching 1.93 trillion tokens, the lowest level since August 2023. This shows that investors are choosing to hold rather than sell. On the technical side, Floki is trading close to the upper Bollinger Band at $0.0000852 and above both its 10-day and 20-day moving averages. The price may move higher if it closes above this level, with resistance at $0.00009. With an RSI of 56, the market is moderately strong but not overbought. FLOKI price analysis. Credit: crypto.news At $0.00001178, Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) is down 0.2% from the previous day and is not moving much overall. It has fluctuated between $0.00001115 and $0.00001212 over the last week, and the 24-hour volume has decreased by 15.5% to $119 million, indicating a decline in market interest. SHIB is having trouble rising above the 50-day moving average and mid-Bollinger Band, both converging around $0.00001150. The RSI is close to 49, indicating that buyers or sellers are unsure and lack conviction. Shiba INU price analysis.

This allows the BlockDAG network to overcome the limitations of older blockchains, offering a platform engineered for real-world applications and massive decentralization. The urgency stems from the presale’s imminent conclusion. Currently in its 29th batch, the price of one BDAG coin is $0.0016. This price is fixed until the Global Launch on August 11, 2025 , after which it will be gone for good. With a projected launch price of $0.05, early participation represents a significant opportunity. The Final Call: Presale Price to Vanish on August 11 The core message from the BlockDAG team is direct: this is the final opportunity to get in on the ground floor. The project isn’t just building hype; it’s delivering tangible results that support its valuation and future potential: Over $330 Million Raised: Demonstrates immense investor confidence. 2 Million+ Active Users: The X1 mobile mining app already has a massive, engaged user base. Full Audits Completed: Top-tier security firms CertiK and Halborn have audited the project, ensuring its integrity. This isn’t just speculation. It’s an established infrastructure with a rapidly growing global community.

GOLD TICKET ($400 Deposit): Entry to win up to $2 MILLION USDT with the highest odds. This is a time-sensitive offer that directly ties investment to reward, allowing participants to accumulate BDAG at its lowest-ever price while aiming for a massive jackpot. BlockDAG’s Foundation: A Week of Relentless Progress The current momentum is built on a foundation of consistent execution. Last week’s developments showcase the project’s aggressive rollout strategy: U.S. Market Entry: Announced major sports partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) and Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket) to push BlockDAG into the mainstream. Hardware Shipping: As of July 7, 2025, deliveries for the powerful X30 and X100 miners officially began, shipped globally via DHL. iBeLink Partnership: A collaboration with a leading ASIC manufacturer ensures high-quality, custom-built miners for the ecosystem.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-big-move-likely-to-come-soon-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Cantonese Cat has shared an XRP technical analysis that highlights a potential for significant price movement. In a tweet posted on July 5, 2025, Cantonese Cat noted that XRP’s two-day chart is exhibiting a classic Bollinger band squeeze pattern, which often precedes heightened volatility and directional moves in price. The tweet stated concisely: “$XRP 2 day, Bollinger band squeeze. Big move likely to come soon,” accompanied by a chart illustrating the current setup. The chart posted by Cantonese Cat uses the XRP/USD pair on Bitstamp, displayed on a two-day timeframe. It features Bollinger Bands set to a 20-period simple moving average and two standard deviations, which is a common setup among traders. $XRP 2 day, Bollinger band squeeze Big move likely to come soon pic.twitter.com/RMqjScjsWC — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 5, 2025 The chart shows how XRP has been consolidating within a narrowing range since early May, with the Bollinger Bands contracting around the current price levels. According to the chart, XRP is trading at approximately $2.21 at the time of analysis, with the upper and lower Bollinger Bands coming closer. The analyst highlighted the current state by marking the bands with arrows at both the upper and lower boundaries, indicating the tight range that has formed over the past several weeks. Another set of arrows on the left side of the chart marks a previous period in late 2024 when a similar Bollinger band squeeze occurred. That earlier squeeze preceded a sharp rally in XRP’s price, which advanced strongly in November 2024. The implication in the current analysis is that a comparable breakout, either upward or downward, could follow the present period of low volatility. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context Remains Unclear on Direction Cantonese Cat did not speculate in the tweet on whether the expected move will be bullish or bearish, instead focusing on the likelihood of an imminent expansion in volatility. The Bollinger band squeeze is generally regarded as a neutral pattern until a breakout direction is confirmed. On the chart, XRP remains near its 20-period moving average, which has been relatively flat during the consolidation. Price action in XRP over the past six months has been mixed, with a strong uptrend visible in late 2024 giving way to a prolonged sideways movement in 2025. The two-day chart also shows how earlier Bollinger band contractions have historically preceded decisive moves. For traders monitoring the market, this technical setup suggests a period of waiting for confirmation of a breakout beyond the current range. Analyst Suggests Monitoring the Bands Closely The clear message from Cantonese Cat’s tweet is that the market is entering a critical phase where volatility is likely to return. The analyst did not provide any further commentary on potential catalysts or fundamental factors that might drive the next move . Instead, the focus was placed solely on the technical pattern visible on the chart. In summary, Cantonese Cat’s analysis presents a technical signal worth watching closely. The two-day Bollinger band squeeze on XRP’s chart, as highlighted in the tweet and accompanying chart, points to a high probability of a larger price move ahead. Whether that move materializes to the upside or downside remains to be seen. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Japan and South Korea also received notice of potential 25% tariffs. Can Bitcoin still surge to an all-time high in this kind of economic environment? More turmoil in US trade deals On Monday all seemed fairly serene as far as the long-running saga of US trade deals goes. However, US President Donald Trump put the cat back among the pigeons by announcing that any country that sided with the BRICS nations in deals that were “anti American”, would be hit by a 10% additional tariff. Not content with this, the US president also put allies Japan and S. Korea in the crosshairs, threatening a 25% levy on both, to come into force on 1 August. In the face of these impending tariffs, it might have been expected that the Asian stock market would be feeling the pressure. However, the opposite has been true. The Hang Seng Index is up more than 1% in overnight trading. Another fakeout narrowly avoided Source: TradingView In the midst of yet more tariff uncertainty, the 4-hour chart for $BTC shows that another fakeout has been narrowly avoided. The price was able to cling to the upper trendline of the bull flag without a candle body opening below. It seems that the price may just continue to roll along the top of the trendline until such time as the bulls are good and ready to send it skyward. SMAs on the daily are in order ready for upside move Source: TradingView The daily chart is shown with the simple moving averages (SMA). This illustrates that the 50 SMA (blue), 100 SMA (green), and the 200 SMA (red) are now in order. All three of these SMAs should now begin to angle upward, following the price as soon as it starts surging. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicators angled downward. If the price continues to move sideways for a few more days, the indicator lines can drop to the bottom and then tick back up, signalling upside price momentum for $BTC’s next rise. Weekly chart shows $BTC ready for lift-off Source: TradingView The weekly chart reveals that the $BTC price is just about ready to head higher. The breakout of the bull flag has happened, the confirmation has been made, and now it is just a matter of time. The indicator lines have crossed back up on the Stochastic RSI.

While Trump Media’s application progressed, the SEC delayed Fidelity’s Solana ETF by reopening public commentary. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) continues to dominate the market, and even recently surpassed 700,000 BTC in holdings. Additionally, it drove 42% of last week’s crypto ETF inflows. Crypto investment products saw $1.04 billion in total weekly inflows, with Ethereum posting its 11th consecutive week of gains. Investor sentiment also still looks optimistic, buoyed by strong institutional demand, record AUM, and Bitcoin’s recovery. SEC Starts Review of Trump Media Crypto ETF The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formally acknowledged Trump Media's application to launch a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), triggering the regulatory countdown for the agency to make a decision on the proposal. The ETFwill be listed on NYSE Arca, and give investors direct exposure to the two leading cryptocurrencies. It will allocate 75% of its holdings to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether. According to the filing, Crypto.com’s Foris DAX Trust Company will serve as the custodian, and Yorkville America Digital will sponsor the fund. The ETF’s valuation will rely on the CME CF reference rates , with Bitcoin tracked via the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate and Ethereum via the CME CF Ether Reference Rate, unless otherwise decided by the sponsor. To boost security, the fund’s crypto assets will be stored in cold storage and held in separate accounts from other customers. This development happened during a wave of crypto ETF applications and speculation that the SEC may soon streamline its ETF approval process through a simplified listing structure. Under the proposed structure, issuers would only need to file a Form S-1 and wait 75 days, during which the SEC can object. Trump Media initially submitted its S-1 form for the crypto ETF on June 16, and this latest update indicates a step forward in the process. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s proposed Solana ETF was delayed once again by the SEC, which has opened a new public comment period. Interested parties now have 21 days to respond and 35 days to submit rebuttals. The application to list the fund was originally submitted by Cboe BZX Exchange on March 25. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that the delay was anticipated and tied it to the broader lack of clarity around a comprehensive digital asset exchange-traded product framework. Despite the delay, Seyffart still believes that recent SEC interactions, including requests for amendments to SOL ETF filings, should be interpreted as a constructive sign. While not approvals, the back-and-forth between the agency and ETF issuers means that there is ongoing engagement with the crypto ETF landscape. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Tops 700K BTC Another crypto ETF is also turning heads. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF surpassed a major milestone as it now holds over 700,000 BTC , valued at approximately $75.5 billion. This achievement happened after its $164.6 million inflow on Monday, bringing the fund’s total holdings to 700,307 BTC according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) launched in January of 2024, and it saw very rapid growth. In fact, it currently represents over 55% of the total Bitcoin held across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Data from BlackRock’s own website shows the fund added 1,388 BTC in just two trading sessions, up from 698,919 BTC last Thursday. Since its inception, IBIT delivered a return of 82.67%. The success of IBIT is not only measured in holdings and performance. Reports suggest BlackRock is now earning more revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. This means that there is a dramatic shift in investor appetite towards digital assets over traditional equities. Demand for Bitcoin by major financial institutions continues to outpace supply. According to Galaxy Research , US Bitcoin ETFs and Michael Saylor’s Strategy together acquired $28.22 billion worth of BTC in 2025. This overshadows the $7.85 billion worth of new Bitcoin that was issued by miners during the same period. The aggressive accumulation outpaced supply every month this year except February, when the combined entities offloaded $842 million in Bitcoin. At the same time, regulators seem to be softening their stance on crypto-related ETFs. This regulatory momentum follows the launch of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF , the first US ETF to offer exposure to a staked crypto asset. The product allows investors to gain exposure to SOL while also benefiting from its staking rewards. BlackRock Drives 42% of Crypto Inflows Cryptocurrency investment products continued to attract strong capital inflows last week, despite the heightened market volatility that affected major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a report from CoinShares , global crypto exchange-traded products recorded $1.04 billion in inflows for the week ending Friday, pushing year-to-date inflows to nearly $19 billion. This is a new historical record. Assets under management in crypto ETPs also reached an all-time high of $188 billion, up from $184.4 billion the previous week. Weekly crypto asset flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin products led the charge after bringing in $790 million, and accounting for 76% of the total inflows. However, inflows into Bitcoin products were still lower than the $1.5 billion weekly average that was seen over the previous three weeks. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill attributed this slowdown to investors adopting a more cautious approach as Bitcoin nears its previous all-time highs. Meanwhile, Ethereum investment products saw their 11th consecutive week of inflows, with $225 million added. Butterfill pointed out that Etheeumr’s weekly inflows averaged 1.6% of assets under management, outpacing Bitcoin’s 0.8%. A big portion of the total crypto inflows was funneled through BlackRock’s crypto funds, which brought in $436 million, or 42% of last week’s total issuer inflows. (Source: CoinShares ) The United States dominated regional inflows once again by bringing in $1 billion despite markets being closed last Friday for the July 4th holiday. Germany and Switzerland followed with inflows of $38.5 million and $33.7 million, respectively. In contrast, Canada and Brazil recorded outflows of $29.3 million and $9.7 million. Canada’s outflows happened in the same month that local issuer 3iQ launched a spot XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Despite the volatility, investor sentiment remained bullish, with the Cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index holding at 66, firmly in “Greed.” Bitcoin’s price dipped as low as $105,400 last Tuesday before rebounding above $110,000 by Thursday.

Mutuum Finance is generating serious heat, and early buyers are already calling it the top token of the summer. MUTM is priced at $0.03 in the 5th stage of presale, which is more than 60% sold out. Investors buying in this stage will enjoy a 100% return of investment at the time of listing the token. More than $11.9 million has already been raised, and there is a number of over 12,800 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and this is 16.67% profit on any investment made during Phase 5. While PEPE brings meme coin momentum, Mutuum offers real utility, long-term vision, and strategic backing, a rare trifecta that could send it soaring past expectations. As FOMO builds and traders scour the market for the top cryptocurrencies heading into 2025, MUTM is quickly claiming its spot among the best cryptos to buy now. PEPE Coin Poised for Next Meme Rally in 2025? Pepe Coin is in the news once again following the meme coin trend with the anticipation by most market watchers on a bullish trend all the way to 2025. PEPE currently trades at a value of $0.00001, with the possibility of new accumulation emerging following price consolidation. Its cult fan base and presence on social media hype has left it in the speculative limelight, particularly in the minds of traders in search of other SHIB-type break-outs. Although PEPE is a volatile token, its action since the beginning of this cyclical period indicates that it is still capable of causing traders a shock. Mutuum Finance is also one that is picking up steam as an alternative investment.

Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/50-bitcoin-price-crash-60000/,"Despite the Bitcoin price holding up quite nicely above $100,000 and remaining very close to its all-time high levels, there continues to be expectations of a massive crash that would rock the market. Pseudonymous crypto analyst FriendlyRox points to a number of indicators for this, going from volume to momentum, all pointing to a possible price crash. What is the expected result of this? Losing the $100,000 psychological level and then falling to previous peaks. Bitcoin Price At Risk With Dwindling Volume And Momentum In the analysis, FriendlyRox highlighted the decline in major metrics such as momentum and volume as the major driver of the forecasted price crash. This comes amid bullish news dominating the headlines, such as institutions increasing their Bitcoin holdings and supply on exchanges falling toward new lows, meaning investors are choosing to hold for higher prices. Related Reading: Ethereum Ready For Explosive Breakout: $5,791 The Minimum Target–Analyst The decline in the volume has been apparent after the Bitcoin price had fallen below $100,000 before bouncing back up in June. So far, in the month of July, the Bitcoin trading volumes have trended lower, with data from Coinglass showing consistent daily volumes below $100 billion. At the same time, there has also been a decline in momentum, with the analyst pointing out a negative divergence in this metric. Furthermore, the Bitcoin price has also flashed a historical trend that has usually predated market tops. This is price reaching the 50 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) and then retracing. FriendlyRox revealed that in the past, whenever the price touched the 50 EMA and then extended back, it usually signalled a crash, and the Bitcoin price has done this now, extending even further. Other metrics that have also flashed bearishness include the RSI and the MACD, both of which are now showing a loss of momentum as they moved into the negative. All of these factors happening together at the same time have painted a pretty bleak picture for the leading cryptocurrency by market cap. BTC Bottom Targets With the lineup of bearish developments, the crypto analyst has predicted an approximately 50% from here. As volume continues to decrease and momentum slides into the negative, they expect that the Bitcoin price will be looking to retrace back to the 50 EMA. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Hold $106,000 And $98,000 To Avoid Breakdown The interesting fact here is that the 50 EMA falls below the previous Bitcoin price peak, putting it at $60,000. A crash of this magnitude would only be rivaled by the COVID crash in 2020 and the FTX-induced market crash back in 2022. But nevertheless, it would mean a wipeout for altcoins across the board. As for the timeframe for when this could happen, there is no definite timeline.

In June, the two sides arranged a trade pact resulting in a truce. However, this truce remained somewhat fragile. Many trade issues are still unresolved due to which investors and traders in both nations are keeping a close eye to see whether the trade arrangement will hold or quickly fall apart. On Monday, July 7, Trump started informing his trade partners that new U.S. import duties will kick in on 1st August, after postponing nearly all of his levies from April, which he held at just a 10% rate for most nations, to give countries more time to negotiate with the world’s largest economy. Among the countries hit hardest is China, where some goods faced levies above 100%. Beijing now has time until 12th August, 2025, to reach a deal with America. If it does not, the United States plans to bring back other curbs that were introduced during the back-and-forth hikes this past spring. China’s ruling party stresses the need for talks In a commentary published on Tuesday, the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling party, stressed the need for talks. “One conclusion is abundantly clear: dialogue and cooperation are the only correct path,” the piece commented regarding the latest round of trade friction between the two nations. The article carried the byline “Zhong Sheng,” meaning “Voice of China,” a name used by the paper for its foreign policy commentary. The newspaper also repeated Beijing’s view that the American duties are akin to “bullying.” It added, “Practice has proven that only by firmly upholding principled positions can one truly safeguard one’s legitimate rights and interests.” Those remarks signal that China could respond strongly if the United States follows through on what the paper called “a so-called ‘final deadline.’” Observers say this could lead to another round of tariff increases on both sides. According to data from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the average US tariff on exports from China is currently around 51.1%. In return, China’s average duty on American products stands at 32.6%. Both countries are covering the full range of their bilateral trade, across all categories of goods. The People’s Daily also took aim at smaller Asian economies that have sought their own tariff deals with Washington, potentially cutting out China from regional supply chains and markets. Vietnam also agreed to cut its U.S. import rate to 20%, down from 46%, under a deal that applies a 40% levy to “transshipped” goods via its ports but originally made in China last week. The editorial warned that China is against forming a trade agreement that harms the interests of China in return of concessions in tariffs. Under this situation, China won’t accept a trade deal and will continue to protect Chinese interests, the editorial further added. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Most altcoins are also in the red on a daily scale, including some larger-cap ones, such as HYPE, DOGE, and LINK. BTC Back to $108K The start of July was rather sluggish, but BTC went downhill on the second day of the month, tumbling from $108,000 to $105,000. However, the bulls stepped up at this point and didn’t allow another price drop. Instead, the cryptocurrency started to recover and quickly returned to $108,000. Moreover, it kept pumping and tapped a multi-week at $110,500 on the next day. These fluctuations, though, seem to be doomed from the start during this calm summer consolidation phase, and BTC went back down to $108,000 almost immediately. It spent the weekend there but started to gain traction once again on Monday morning when it jumped past $109,600. The scenario repeated once again, and bitcoin is now back to $108,000. Its market cap has slipped to $2.150 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is back to 63% on CoinGecko. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE Heads South While yesterday was a good day for major altcoins, the landscape has changed slightly today, and most are in the red. Ethereum has slipped by around 1% but has remained well above $2,500. Similar minor losses are evident from BNB, SOL, ADA, SUI, and LEO, while DOGE and LINK have dropped slightly more. HYPE has declined the most from the larger-cap alts, having lost almost 5% of value on a 24-hour scale. As a result, the popular altcoin is below $38 now. The biggest loser from the top 100 alts is FARTCOIN (-8%), followed by SPX (-7.7%) and TIA (-7%). In contrast, TKX has surged by 11% to over $15. The total crypto market cap has shed around $20 billion since yesterday and is down to $3.420 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Analyst CrediBULL Crypto highlighted the XRP/BTC pair's price action in his latest post on X. According to his analysis, XRP/BTC is now making its fifth attempt at a breakout at a level that has faced strong rejection multiple times in recent weeks.XRP's Fifth Attempt at 0.00002162 BTCNotably, the resistance zone is around 0.00002162 BTC. It has acted as a ceiling for XRP/BTC since early June. Each time the pair approached this level, it was rejected, resulting in four failed breakout attempts marked on the chart.The current move marks the fifth retest, and market watchers are speculating whether XRP can finally close above this stubborn level. XRP/BTC 4H chart by CrediBULL Rejection or Breakout?CrediBULL’s chart shows a horizontal barrier at the 100% Fibonacci level, which has capped every bullish rally for the past month. He suggested that a successful breakout and daily close above this zone could trigger a bullish continuation.In that scenario, the next major target for XRP is around 0.00002646 BTC, a level not seen since April.However, if history repeats itself, another rejection could pull XRP/BTC back toward the 0.00001938 BTC support level. This has served as the last line of defense for bulls. In particular, XRP has tested this support twice in recent weeks, rebounding shortly after each time.Broader Context: XRP Lagging Behind BTCWhile Bitcoin continues to maintain strong dominance, XRP has struggled to gain relative strength. The coin has found it difficult to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum in recent months. XRP’s price has remained largely around $2 for several weeks, while Bitcoin has been retesting its all-time high.However, the anticipated breakout from the current move could mark a turning point. Should XRP/BTC rally to 0.00002646 BTC, as CrediBULL's chart suggests, it would translate to a unit price of approximately $2.86. This puts XRP on track to challenge the $3 level.Overcoming the 0.00002646 BTC resistance would set XRP up to challenge the next barrier at 0.00003411 BTC, equivalent to around $3.70. This paints a promising path for XRP to potentially break its all-time high.XRP Could Still Reach $20–$30 Against BitcoinWhile these are short-term outlooks, CrediBULL has projected an even more promising future for XRP this cycle. Specifically, he believes XRP could reach new all-time highs against both BTC and ETH.Based on previous ATHs in the XRP/BTC and XRP/ETH pairings, he suggested that with Bitcoin at $100K, XRP could reach $22 or more. Similarly, with Ethereum at $5K, XRP could climb to $18.Interestingly, CrediBULL emphasized that these are conservative end-of-cycle targets, and BTC has already surpassed one of them. In parallel, he sees a $20–$30 XRP as a realistic and even conservative projection if XRP regains its prior strength relative to BTC or ETH.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-07-08 09:33:28

In a statement posted on X, Musk labeled fiat money “hopeless” and positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of the party’s fiscal vision ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. While critics dubbed the move “soundbite,” Musk’s companies, SpaceX and Tesla, already hold nearly 19,800 BTC, worth over $2.1 billion. His endorsement reinforces the asset’s credibility as a long-term hedge against inflation and centralized policy risk.

Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Support Holds On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is bouncing off the ascending trendline support, with the 50-SMA at $108,146 providing dynamic support. The $108,941 resistance remains the ceiling to break. The recent price structure features small-bodied candles and long wicks, indicating indecision rather than rejection. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview RSI sits neutral at 49.60, and no bearish divergence is present, suggesting momentum is steady but still searching for conviction. A breakout above $108,941 could drive BTC toward $109,727 and $110,561. Losing the trendline and 50-SMA could drag it to $107,323 or even $106,422. Trade Setup: Buy Entry: Above $108,950 on strong bullish candle Target 1: $109,727 Target 2: $110,561 Stop-Loss: Below $108,100 For now, Bitcoin’s technical structure remains intact. As long as the trendline holds and price stays above the 50-SMA, the bulls maintain short-term control.

Leaked API documents obtained as a result of technical research conducted in public domains show that the platform is working on an EVM-compatible network, orderbook, Stripe integration, subscription model and token launch features. Blockchain researchers have identified several endpoints still publicly available on the documents, accessible via the recently re-certified domain api.pump.fun, which belongs to PumpFun. These endpoints include features such as users, posts, messages, videos, Stripe webhooks, order management, and subscriptions. One particularly notable feature is the existence of schemes that allow users to set subscription prices and launch their own tokens on the platform, suggesting that PumpFun could expand its decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality. When the format of the “order” schemas is examined, there are hints that EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) based chains may be supported, and PumpFun may even launch its own EVM compatible chain. Terms such as “approvals” in the documentation are also often used for EVM based chains. In addition, the documentation mentions a previously unannounced “orderbook” feature. While the top of the API documentation states that this server manages an “orderbook,” it’s unclear how this will work or what it will be used for. The API documentation also includes integrations with Stripe and Privy, which Stripe acquired in 2023. Endpoints that support user-based content creation, videos, live broadcasts, and social interactions are also included in the documentation. These suggest that PumpFun is preparing to integrate social media-like features. Although no official statement has been made by PumpFun on the subject, the documents that have emerged show that the platform is preparing for a comprehensive expansion. However, all this information is still speculative and unclear. *This is not investment advice.

While the community buzzed with optimism due to Gate.io’s support of the sale, the latest action by the crypto exchange has left enthusiasts confused. Notably, Gate.io has removed the page detailing Pump.fun’s imminent PUMP launch. What’s more unsettling is that the page has disappeared without communication from the exchange, magnifying uncertainty.

Pump.fun’s upcoming PUMP launch The meme token creation platform is preparing to launch its native coin to the public on July 12. Pump.fun allows anyone to create digital assets freely and instantly. It has propelled Solana blockchain growth amid speculative undertakings linked to meme cryptocurrencies. The launchpad uses PUMP as its native token, which brings utility through promotional giveaways, exclusive rewards, and community incentives. While individuals can still use Pump.fun without holding PUMP, the native coin unlocks more features and enriches user engagement. Token sale details The public PUMP sale will offer 150 billion assets, accounting for 15% of the overall 1 trillion supply, at $0.004 per coin. The sale will begin on July 12 at 3:00 PM and run for three days, concluding on July 15 or earlier upon quick sellouts. Furthermore, it uses the first-come, first-served approach without purchase limits. Users could participate in the token sale through Pump.fun’s official website as Gate.io has removed support. Gate.io takes down Pump.fun’s token sale page Meanwhile, things have taken an unpredictable turn days before PUMP’s scheduled launch. Gate.io has quietly delisted the token sale page, leaving the community confused. The exchange’s decision has sparked debates on X. Gate.io previously confirmed the listing with all details, including price and sale cap, before removing the page without notice. Experts are watching closely, with some speculating about delayed launches. The exchange might have taken down Pump.fun’s pre-market sale page due to negotiations with the project’s team. That would reflect the increasing shifts away from over-the-counter (ITC) trading, especially when dealing with meme token projects. Enthusiasts are left guessing as uncertainty mounts The absence of communication from Gate.io and the Pump.fun team has left the community uneasy. With no official updates and the sale page gone, supporters are wondering whether PUMP’s scheduled launch will happen as planned or if there will be a last-minute shock. The confusion is significant considering the immense hype about the upcoming launch and broader optimistic sentiments about Solana’s meme coin ecosystem. The initial announcement sparked massive interest, with many ready to join a high-potential project that boasts community backing and exchange support. Moreover, this was the first collaboration between Gate.io and Pump.fun. Enthusiasts should follow the latest updates ahead of July 12 for comprehensive details about Pump.fun’s PUMP public launch.

For anyone tracking the pulse of technological progress, it’s clear that AI is not just a tool; it’s a catalyst forcing a dramatic reshaping of the data industry. This transformation, marked by significant data industry consolidation , is driven by an urgent need to empower the next generation of AI applications. The success of AI hinges entirely on access to high-quality, well-managed AI data , and companies are now racing to acquire the pieces they need to build a robust foundation. The Unstoppable Wave of Data Industry Consolidation The past few months have seen a flurry of high-profile acquisitions signaling a clear trend: the data industry is consolidating at an unprecedented pace. Giants like Databricks and Salesforce are making strategic moves, with Databricks acquiring Neon for $1 billion and Salesforce snapping up Informatica for a staggering $8 billion. These deals, varying in size and focus, share a common goal: to secure the necessary technology to drive enterprise AI adoption. The underlying belief is simple yet profound: AI’s value is directly proportional to the quality of its foundational data. Without superior data, AI applications struggle to deliver meaningful insights or create real value. Enterprise VCs echo this sentiment. A Bitcoin World survey from December 2024 highlighted that data quality is a critical differentiator for AI startups. Gaurav Dhillon, former CEO of Informatica and current chairman and CEO at SnapLogic, emphasized this shift in an interview with Bitcoin World: “There is a complete reset in how data is managed and flows around the enterprise. If people want to seize the AI imperative, they have to redo their data platforms in a very big way. And this is where I believe you’re seeing all these data acquisitions, because this is the foundation to have a sound AI strategy .” This push for consolidation isn’t just about growth; it’s about survival and relevance in an AI-first world. Companies are realizing that their existing data infrastructure, often built over decades, simply isn’t equipped for the demands of modern AI. Why Quality AI Data is the New Gold Standard The success of any artificial intelligence endeavor, from complex machine learning models to advanced AI agents, is intrinsically tied to the quality and accessibility of its underlying data. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; it’s a practical necessity. Imagine trying to train a sophisticated AI model on incomplete, inconsistent, or poorly structured data – the results would be unreliable, biased, and ultimately, useless. This fundamental truth is driving the current wave of acquisitions. For enterprises aiming to leverage AI for competitive advantage, investing in robust AI data pipelines and management systems is no longer optional. It’s the core differentiator. Companies are recognizing that fragmented data, residing in disparate silos, severely limits AI’s potential. The acquired technologies are seen as the missing puzzle pieces that can unify these data sources, clean them, and prepare them for AI consumption. This ensures that when AI applications are deployed, they are fed with the precise, high-fidelity data they need to perform optimally, delivering accurate insights and automating processes effectively. Navigating the Fragmented Data Management Solutions Landscape For the past decade, the data industry has evolved into a sprawling, often disjointed ecosystem. Over $300 billion was invested into data startups from 2020 to 2024 across more than 24,000 deals, according to PitchBook. This venture capital boom led to a proliferation of specialized startups, many focusing on niche areas or even single features within the broader data stack. While this fostered innovation, it also created a highly fragmented landscape. The problem arises when enterprises attempt to implement comprehensive AI solutions. The current industry standard, which often involves bundling together numerous disparate data management solutions , each with its own specific focus, proves inefficient and ineffective for AI. AI models require seamless access to vast quantities of interconnected data to crawl, analyze, and build applications. A patchwork of incompatible systems simply doesn’t cut it. A prime example illustrating this challenge is Fivetran’s recent acquisition of Census. Fivetran specializes in moving data into cloud databases, while Census facilitates moving data out. Prior to the acquisition, Fivetran customers needed a second company to achieve an end-to-end solution. As George Fraser, co-founder and CEO of Fivetran, explained to Bitcoin World, even though moving data in and out seems similar, the underlying technical challenges are distinct. This scenario highlights how customers are growing frustrated with a multitude of incompatible products, pushing for integrated solutions. Sanjeev Mohan, a former Gartner analyst, now running SanjMo, his data trend advisory firm, notes: “This consolidation is being driven by customers being fed up with a multitude of products that are incompatible. We live in a very interesting world where there are a lot of different data storage solutions… but the one area where we have failed is metadata. Dozens of these products are capturing some metadata but to do their job, it’s an overlap.” This fragmentation has made the industry ripe for consolidation, with AI serving as the ultimate catalyst. Strategic AI Adoption: Benefits for Startups and Enterprises While the focus is often on the acquiring giants, this wave of consolidation also brings significant benefits to the startups being acquired. In the current venture capital climate, marked by a quiet IPO market and slower funding rounds, an acquisition often represents a highly favorable exit strategy. As Derek Hernandez, a senior emerging tech analyst at PitchBook, told Bitcoin World: “The best solutions are being acquired currently. Even if you have an award-winning solution, I don’t know that the outlook for staying private ultimately wins over going to a larger [acquirer].” For startups struggling to raise capital, being acquired provides much-needed liquidity and, in many cases, allows founding teams to continue building their vision with the resources of a larger entity. This symbiotic relationship benefits both sides: For Startups: It offers a viable exit in a challenging market, validates their technology, and provides access to greater resources, distribution channels, and talent. For Acquirers: It allows them to quickly integrate missing features, fill existing gaps in their data stack, gain a competitive edge, and improve pricing leverage by offering more comprehensive solutions. This accelerated path to enhanced capabilities is crucial for achieving widespread enterprise AI adoption . The Informatica deal, even with a slight haircut from initial discussions, exemplifies this win-win scenario, proving to be the best solution for their board. The Future of AI Strategy: Merging Data and Intelligence Despite the current acquisition spree, a lingering question remains: will this strategy of acquiring companies built in a pre-ChatGPT era truly facilitate rapid enterprise AI adoption in today’s dynamic market? Gaurav Dhillon himself expressed doubts, noting that the current AI landscape is only about three years old. He suggests that larger companies aiming for truly transformative AI innovations, particularly for the ‘agentic enterprise,’ will require substantial retooling. This brings us to a critical juncture for future AI strategy . If the company with the best data ultimately wins the AI race, does it make sense for data management companies and AI development companies to remain separate entities? Derek Hernandez of PitchBook posits a compelling future: “I think a lot of the value is in merging the major AI players with the data management companies. I don’t know that a standalone data management company is particularly incentivized to remain so and, kind of like, play a third party between enterprises and AI solutions.” This suggests a future where the lines between data management and AI development blur, possibly leading to a more integrated approach where AI capabilities are deeply embedded within the data infrastructure itself. The current wave of consolidation might just be the first step towards a more unified ecosystem where data and intelligence are inseparable. Conclusion: Building the Foundation for an AI-Powered Tomorrow The ongoing data industry consolidation is a clear indicator of AI’s transformative power. It underscores the critical importance of high-quality AI data as the bedrock for any successful AI endeavor. While the strategy of acquiring existing data management solutions is a pragmatic response to the immediate need for better data infrastructure, the long-term success of enterprise AI adoption may depend on even deeper integration and retooling. As companies navigate this complex landscape, the focus will remain on building robust, unified data platforms that can truly unlock the full potential of artificial intelligence. The future of AI is not just about algorithms; it’s about the data that fuels them.

According to the official press release , the over-the-counter crypto platform plans to use the funds generated from the seed round financing to develop and expand its team to accommodate the rise in institutional demand for infrastructure that reduces exposure to exchanges. The company prides itself in serving as a bridge that connects investors to crypto, while eliminating the need to deposit funds on exchanges for prefunding needs. Additionally, it also offers a solution to credit and settlement risk through real-time messaging and by coordinating collateral management. The seed round was led by Abu Dhabi-based venture capital firm Further Ventures. The round was also backed by representatives from major venture capital and web3 -focused firms including Virtu, XBTO, Blockchain Founders Fund, Fun Fair Ventures, and Humla Ventures. CEO of BridgePort, Nirup Ramalingam, said the $3.2 million seed funding round marks a “major milestone” in the company’s journey towards providing a solution for capital inefficiencies and risks associated with prefunding, especially in the crypto space.

Managing Partner at Further Ventures, Mohamed Hamdy, explained why the venture capital firm decided to invest in the middleware crypto platform. He believes that BridgePort’s mission to solve the problems and risks posed by prefunding and credit fragmentation is going to be vital for the future of the crypto industry as it sees an increase in institutional interest. “We see BridgePort’s infrastructure becoming foundational to the next phase of crypto market structure evolution,” said Hamdy in his statement. Once regarded as a backdoor option for settling off-chain, OTC platforms like BridgePort have shifted into a solution for traditional finance institutions like banks and corporations that wish to dabble in crypto without needing to commit funds into centralized exchanges . Keeping money on exchanges is often seen as a risk by institutional investors looking to play it safe. Crypto exchange exploits like the Bybit hack, DMM Bitcoin ( BTC ) and WazirX demonstrated how real the risk was for investors keeping large amounts of funds on exchanges. In fact, after the Bybit hack, security analysts predicted that OTC services could see a large-scale freeze wave to prevent the movement of stolen funds off-chain.

This ambitious effort seeks to awaken $ADA’s dormant reserves, giving rise to an interesting debate among Cardano users. By incorporating $ADA, the Midnight token, and the top 50 Cardano native tokens, Hoskinson’s concept could establish a foundation for Cardano’s future in decentralized finance (DeFi). Backing $ADA and Native Tokens In a strategic X post, Hoskinson described a digital asset treasury to back Cardano’s ecosystem, departing from his prior contentious idea of maintaining a Bitcoin reserve. That concept had drawn skepticism, with detractors claiming it relied too much on a competing initiative. What do you guys think about a digital asset treasury for ada, the top 50 cardano native assets, and midnight? — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) July 7, 2025 At present, Hoskinson is dedicated to Cardano, working on a treasury reserve that supports $ADA, the privacy-focused Midnight token, as well as prominent native tokens like SNEK, World Mobile Token (WMTYX), Liquid Finance (LQ), Minswap (MIN), and Indigo Protocol (INDY), according to CoinGecko data. Cardano’s Treasury Plan: Top 50 Too Generous? The proposed treasury aims to boost Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and stimulate total value locked (TVL), firming its position in the competitive blockchain space. By enabling synergy among high-ranking native tokens, Hoskinson looks forward to a prosperous, interconnected Cardano network. Yet, the plan has mixed reactions from the crypto community. Some users have hailed the proposal, while others say the top 50 would be too generous. One user pointed out that the treasury should not be holding the native token. A Defining Moment for Cardano Hoskinson’s commitment to activate Cardano’s treasury highlights his devotion to a dynamic, ready-to-use ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Could a $70 bet on a frog-themed token turn into $7,000? With its Layer-2 backbone and viral momentum, Little Pepe might just be 2025’s next 100x memecoin breakout. Table of Contents Why Little Pepe is no ordinary memecoin How $70 could become $7,000 Timeline: When could the 100x happen? The presale opportunity (stage 4 almost filled) The $777k giveaway is still live Final thoughts Every few market cycles, a low-cap token quietly emerges from the shadows, priced at fractions of a cent, often ignored by major players, only to explode into one of the most talked-about assets in crypto. In 2021, it was Shiba Inu. In 2023, it was PEPE. And now, in 2025, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is primed to be that next big leap. Currently priced at just $0.0013, this Ethereum-based token is more than just a viral meme; it’s a fully fledged Layer 2 ecosystem designed for scalability, speed, and decentralization. With a clear roadmap and no tax evasion, LILPEPE is poised to transform micro-investments like $70 into potential $7,000 moonshots before the end of the year. Why Little Pepe is no ordinary memecoin At first glance, LILPEPE appears to be another frog-themed memecoin. But beneath the memes lies serious infrastructure: a new Layer-2 chain built to scale Ethereum without the bottlenecks. While most meme tokens rely solely on hype, Little Pepe backs up its virality with a blockchain tailor-made for meme culture, featuring zero gas wars, faster transactions, and native support for new meme tokens via its built-in Pump Pad launchpad. The project’s appeal rests on a few key pillars: Zero tax on buys and sells: Encourages trading and removes friction. Anti-sniper bot tech: Levels the playing field for all traders. Native staking and ecosystem rewards: Incentivize long-term holding. Dedicated launchpad for new meme tokens: Positions LILPEPE as the base layer for a new meme economy. This isn’t just speculation, it’s a vision to become the Solana of memes. How $70 could become $7,000 At the current Stage 4 presale price of $0.0013, a $70 buy-in would net approximately 53,846 LILPEPE tokens. Now, consider this: At $0.13 (a 100x increase), that $70 turns into $7,000. At $0.065 (a 50x run), the cost becomes $ 3,250. Even a 20x move to $0.026 results in $1,400. These projections are not just dreams. Tokens like SHIB , DOGE , PEPE , and FLOKI have made similar (and even crazier) gains when their market caps expanded during peak retail hype cycles. What sets LILPEPE apart is that it’s still early, with a market cap under $140 million, while offering actual Layer-2 functionality, a rarity in the meme sector. You might also like: From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle Timeline: When could the 100x happen? A realistic outline of how Little Pepe’s price trajectory could unfold: Q3 2025: 10x–20x range ($0.013–$0.026) With the completion of its presale, CEX listings, and Layer-2 mainnet launch during the “BIRTH” roadmap phase, the project could immediately draw explosive attention from influencers, TikTok creators, and Telegram groups. A 10x jump is considered conservative at this stage. Q4 2025: 50x–100x zone ($0.065–$0.13) Assuming successful onboarding of new meme projects on the Pump Pad and a wave of viral adoption, the Growth phase kicks in. This could push LILPEPE toward memecoin legend status. If the hype cycle aligns with Ethereum’s broader Layer-2 narrative, $0.13 is firmly on the table, turning every $70 invested today into $7,000+. The presale opportunity (stage 4 almost filled) As of now, Stage 4 is 77.72% filled, with over 2.9 billion tokens sold. Priced at $0.0013, this is still below the next presale stage of $0.0014, and miles below the projected listing price of $0.003. Once the presale ends, new buyers will only be able to access LILPEPE on exchanges, likely at a markup, especially if demand spikes during listing week. To participate: Visit the official site. Connect MetaMask or Trust Wallet (ERC-20) Buy using ETH, USDT, or fiat via on-ramp Tokens become claimable after the presale ends. The $777k giveaway is still live To sweeten the pot, LILPEPE is running a $777,000 giveaway where 10 winners will each receive $77,000 in tokens. Entry is simple: invest a minimum of $100 and complete basic social tasks via the website. Interested users can join the Telegram group. Final thoughts Everyone wants to find the next 100x gem, but few dare to look where the market isn’t fully paying attention. That’s where LILPEPE shines. With its presale price under $0.0015, a Layer 2 tech stack, meme-first branding, and strong tokenomics, this project offers one of the best risk-reward ratios in the cryptocurrency market currently.

The CEO, Michael Truell, acknowledged that their communication was not clear enough, leading to frustration and unexpected costs for many users. The core of the issue stemmed from a June 16 update that fundamentally altered the Pro plan’s value proposition. Previously, Pro users enjoyed 500 fast responses from advanced AI models like those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, followed by unlimited responses at a slower rate. The new model, however, shifted to a usage-based system: users now receive $20 worth of usage per month, billed at API rates. Once this $20 limit is reached, users must purchase additional credits to continue. This change, while seemingly straightforward, caught many off guard, particularly those who quickly consumed their allowance. Users took to social media to voice their complaints, reporting that their credits depleted rapidly, sometimes after just a few prompts, especially when utilizing popular and powerful models like Anthropic’s Claude. A significant point of contention was the unexpected additional charges incurred by users who were unaware they would be billed extra if they exceeded the $20 limit and had not set a spend cap. Anysphere has committed to refunding these unexpectedly charged users and aims for greater clarity in future pricing changes. Only Cursor’s “auto mode,” which intelligently routes requests to AI models based on capacity, continues to offer unlimited usage for Pro users. Why Are Generative AI Models Getting More Expensive? The changes implemented by Cursor AI are not arbitrary; they reflect a broader trend in the industry. Truell explained that the pricing adjustment was necessary because newer, more advanced AI models can consume significantly more tokens per request, especially for longer, more complex tasks. This means that while AI is becoming more powerful, the cutting edge of generative AI performance remains expensive, and in some cases, is even increasing in cost. Consider Anthropic’s recently launched Claude Opus 4 model, which costs $15 per million input tokens and $75 per million output tokens. To put this in perspective, one million input tokens are roughly equivalent to 750,000 words. These figures are even higher than Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which was considered its most expensive AI model at its April launch. OpenAI and Anthropic have also started charging enterprise customers for “priority” access to their AI models, adding another layer of premium cost for guaranteed reliable and high-speed performance. These escalating costs for foundational AI models are increasingly being passed down to the end-users of AI coding tools, impacting the overall AI pricing structure across the ecosystem. The Ripple Effect: AI Pricing Across Developer Tools Cursor is not an isolated case. The rising costs of underlying AI models are creating a ripple effect across the entire landscape of developer tools that integrate AI. Users of Replit, another widely used AI coding tool, also reported being caught off guard by recent pricing changes that made completing large AI-driven tasks more expensive. This indicates a growing industry-wide challenge: how to provide powerful AI capabilities without making them prohibitively expensive for individual developers and small teams. While the demand for AI-powered assistance in software development continues to surge, companies like Anysphere are grappling with the economics. They must balance offering state-of-the-art AI capabilities, which often come with high operational costs, against maintaining competitive and user-friendly subscription models. The tension between innovation and affordability is becoming a defining characteristic of the AI software market. Navigating the Dynamic AI Coding Landscape Despite these pricing hurdles, Cursor has achieved remarkable success, reportedly reaching over $500 million in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) primarily through its Pro plan subscriptions. However, its market position is now under intense pressure from the very AI providers it relies upon. For instance, Anthropic’s recently launched AI coding tool, Claude Code, has seen significant success with enterprises, boosting Anthropic’s ARR to $4 billion and likely attracting some users who might otherwise have chosen Cursor. In response, Cursor is actively working to maintain its competitive edge. Anysphere recently secured multi-year deals with major AI model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and xAI. This strategy underpins their new $200-a-month Cursor Ultra plan, which offers very high rate limits for users requiring extensive AI assistance. While collaborations are crucial, the underlying pressure between AI coding tool developers and their foundational AI model providers appears to be intensifying, shaping the future of how developers access and pay for advanced AI capabilities. The Path Forward for AI Coding Tools The Cursor AI incident highlights a critical challenge for the entire AI industry: the need for transparent communication regarding pricing and usage. As AI models become more powerful and costly, the companies integrating them into user-facing products must find sustainable business models that do not alienate their user base. For developers, it means being more vigilant about understanding the true costs associated with AI-powered tools and setting appropriate spend limits. The future of AI coding will likely involve a dynamic interplay of innovation, competition, and evolving pricing strategies. While the benefits of AI in development are undeniable, ensuring equitable and predictable access to these powerful tools remains a key challenge that companies like Cursor must continuously address to maintain user trust and market leadership.

Just as blockchain promises to revolutionize finance, AI is poised to transform education. Recent whispers from the digital frontier suggest that OpenAI’s flagship chatbot is quietly rolling out a fascinating new feature: “Study Together.” This enigmatic addition hints at a profound shift in how AI interacts with learning, potentially reshaping the very fabric of academic engagement and raising intriguing questions for the future of digital collaboration. What is ChatGPT’s ‘Study Together’ Feature and Why Does it Matter? The tech community is abuzz with reports from select ChatGPT users who have spotted an intriguing new option in their toolkit: “Study Together.” This feature, still shrouded in mystery and unconfirmed by OpenAI, appears to be a deliberate step towards transforming the AI chatbot into a more sophisticated and interactive educational companion. Unlike its traditional role of directly providing answers, early indications suggest that “Study Together” aims to foster a deeper, more participatory learning experience. Imagine a scenario where instead of simply being given the solution to a complex problem, ChatGPT engages you in a Socratic dialogue, probing your understanding with insightful questions and guiding you towards self-discovery. This approach marks a significant departure from the passive information retrieval that often characterizes AI interactions, moving towards an active, human-centric learning paradigm. Initial user observations point to a mode where the AI prompts the user for answers, much like a seasoned tutor. This could be OpenAI’s strategic response to initiatives like Google’s LearnLM, which also focuses on AI-driven educational interactions. The core idea seems to be to encourage critical thinking and knowledge retention rather than rote memorization or quick answers. Furthermore, there’s speculation about a collaborative aspect – could “Study Together” evolve into a multi-human chat environment, allowing groups of students to study together with AI facilitation? This would open up unprecedented avenues for peer-to-peer learning augmented by intelligent guidance, creating dynamic virtual study groups that transcend geographical barriers. How is AI in Education Being Revolutionized by This Feature? The integration of AI in education is not new, but it has certainly been a double-edged sword. On one hand, tools like ChatGPT have proven invaluable for educators, assisting with everything from drafting lesson plans and creating quizzes to generating personalized learning materials.

Recognizing the ethical dilemmas posed by AI in academic settings, ‘Study Together’ offers a potential solution by steering users towards productive and ethical engagement. It’s a proactive step to ensure AI serves as a tool for intellectual growth rather than a means to circumvent genuine learning. The long-term implications for skill development, lifelong learning, and professional training are immense. Imagine bespoke learning modules tailored precisely to an individual’s learning style and pace, guided by an AI that understands not just the content, but the learner’s cognitive process. This is the future OpenAI appears to be building, where AI becomes a ubiquitous and beneficial partner in human intellectual pursuits. What Broader Impact Will This Have on EdTech ? The emergence of features like ‘Study Together’ will undoubtedly send ripples through the entire EdTech industry. Companies currently offering AI-powered tutoring or learning platforms will need to innovate rapidly to keep pace with OpenAI’s advancements. This new mode could set a higher standard for interactive learning, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI in educational contexts. We might see a surge in platforms adopting similar Socratic or collaborative AI models, moving away from simple content delivery to more engaging, dialogue-based learning experiences. Furthermore, the success of ‘Study Together’ could influence how AI is perceived and utilized across various sectors. If AI can effectively facilitate deep learning and critical thinking, its applications could extend to corporate training, skill development, and even personal growth initiatives. It could democratize access to high-quality, personalized education, making advanced learning resources available to a much wider audience globally. The challenge for EdTech companies will be to integrate these advanced AI capabilities seamlessly and ethically, ensuring they complement human instruction rather than replace it. This evolution underscores a critical shift: AI is no longer just a tool for automation, but a dynamic partner in human development and knowledge acquisition. The quiet rollout of ChatGPT’s ‘Study Together’ feature marks a potentially transformative moment for artificial intelligence in education. By shifting the AI’s role from a simple answer engine to a proactive, question-asking facilitator, OpenAI is aiming to cultivate deeper understanding, critical thinking, and responsible academic engagement.

Trump’s Tariff Shock Sparks 4.5% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong start to the week, market sentiment took a sharp turn as traders adopted a more cautious tone. Early excitement around Pump.fun’s PUMP token cooled quickly after Gate.io mysteriously removed its presale announcement, which had briefly teased a $600 million target for July 12. Meanwhile, Bit Digital made waves by selling all its Bitcoin holdings and shifting its entire treasury to Ethereum, now holding over 100,000 ETH worth $254.8 million, making it one of the largest public ETH holders. But the real shock came, as the crypto market plunged 4.5% following President Trump’s unexpected tariff letters to 14 countries.

Just as AI is being explored for its potential in crypto analytics and smart contract auditing, its application in traditional sectors like sports is also facing scrutiny. This year, the iconic Wimbledon Championships introduced a new chapter in its storied history, replacing human line judges with advanced AI in sports technology. However, this bold leap into automation has not been without its challenges, sparking a surprising amount of controversy among players and fans alike. What’s the Fuss About Wimbledon AI ? For the first time, the prestigious Wimbledon tournament fully transitioned from human line judges to an Electronic Line Calling (ELC) system, relying entirely on AI to determine if a ball is in or out. This move aimed to enhance accuracy and efficiency, bringing the tournament in line with other modern sporting events that have embraced automation. However, as the tournament progressed, a wave of criticism emerged from some of the sport’s biggest names, raising questions about the reliability of the new Wimbledon AI system. Are AI Line Judges Really Failing? The transition to automated officiating has not been seamless, with several players voicing strong opinions about perceived inaccuracies. The complaints highlight the complexities of implementing cutting-edge technology in high-stakes environments: Incorrect Calls: British tennis star Emma Raducanu publicly criticized the technology after a ball her opponent hit appeared out on replay but was called in by the AI, forcing her to play the point as if it were valid. Similarly, British No. 1 Jack Draper expressed his doubts, stating he did not believe the AI was “100 percent accurate.” Environmental Factors: Player Ben Shelton encountered an unusual issue when told to speed up his match because the new AI line system was on the verge of stopping due to dimming sunlight. This incident revealed an unexpected vulnerability to environmental conditions. Accessibility Concerns: A deaf player reported significant challenges, noting that without the human hand signals from line judges, she was unable to discern when she had won a point, highlighting an overlooked accessibility aspect of the automated system. System Glitches: A notable blip occurred during a crucial match between British player Sonay Kartal and Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The technology failed to make a call on an out ball, forcing the umpire to intervene, stop the rally, and order a replay. Wimbledon later apologized, attributing it to a “human error” where the technology was accidentally shut off, leading to adjustments to prevent recurrence. These incidents are not isolated to Wimbledon. German player Alexander Zverev previously called out the same automated line judging technology in April, sharing a picture on Instagram that clearly showed a ball called in was significantly out. Such examples fuel the ongoing debate about the precision and reliability of AI line judges . The Broader Debate: AI in Sports vs. Human Expertise Despite the player complaints, Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, which hosts Wimbledon, defended the electronic system. She pointed out that historically, Wimbledon faced constant pressure to adopt electronic line calling due to its perceived accuracy over human linesmen. This reflects a broader trend in sports, where technology is increasingly seen as a way to minimize human error and enhance fairness. However, the critiques from players underscore a fundamental tension. While AI can offer consistency and process data at incredible speeds, it sometimes lacks the nuanced judgment, adaptability, and human connection that traditional officiating provides. The debate extends beyond just accuracy; it touches on the essence of the game and the human element that has always been a part of it. The incidents at Wimbledon serve as a compelling case study for the promises and pitfalls of fully automated systems in dynamic, unpredictable environments like professional sports. Navigating the Future of Tennis Technology The integration of advanced tennis technology like ELC systems brings both advantages and significant challenges. On the one hand, ELC can provide objective, instantaneous calls, potentially reducing disputes and speeding up gameplay. On the other hand, the incidents at Wimbledon highlight that even sophisticated AI systems are not infallible and can introduce new types of errors or accessibility issues. The future of tennis technology may not lie in a complete replacement of humans, but rather in a strategic blend that leverages the strengths of both AI and human oversight. Continuous calibration, robust backup systems, and thoughtful consideration for all stakeholders, including players with specific needs, will be crucial for successful adoption. Striking the Human-AI Collaboration Balance The experience at Wimbledon serves as a powerful reminder of the friction that can arise when completely replacing human roles with AI. The argument for why a balance is necessary becomes increasingly clear. While AI excels at repetitive tasks and data processing, human intuition, adaptability, and the ability to handle unforeseen circumstances remain invaluable. The recent decision by companies like Klarna to re-hire human workers after a push for automation further illustrates this point. Ultimately, the optimal path forward for many organizations, including sports, likely involves a robust human-AI collaboration model. AI can serve as a powerful tool to augment human capabilities, providing data-driven insights and handling routine tasks, while humans retain oversight for complex judgments, critical decision-making, and ensuring the system caters to all human elements involved. This synergy could lead to more resilient, equitable, and ultimately more effective outcomes. The Wimbledon experience offers a fascinating glimpse into the ongoing evolution of AI integration in traditional fields. While the promise of AI for enhanced accuracy and efficiency is undeniable, the challenges encountered by the new line-calling system highlight the critical importance of careful implementation, continuous refinement, and a thoughtful balance between technological advancement and human considerations. As more industries embrace AI, understanding these real-world implications will be key to successful and sustainable adoption.

47792557,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73606,1751968824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Crypto News: Dogecoin (DOGE) Dips Below $0.17 Despite Micro Futures Surge, Is This Where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Steals the Spotlight?",https://timestabloid.com/crypto-news-dogecoin-doge-dips-below-0-17-despite-micro/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 2.9% over the past week, trading at $0.16117 with a $23.9B market cap, despite a 70% surge in futures open interest to $1.65B and Robinhood’s launch of micro futures contracts boosting retail access. A bullish MACD crossover and 528% active address growth signal a potential 2.5x rally to $0.40, but bearish sentiment and a descending triangle pattern risk a drop to $0.13 if $0.16 support fails. As Dogecoin (DOGE) drifts under $0.17 following a brief futures-driven pump, serious investors are beginning to redirect attention toward platforms offering deeper functionality and actual earning mechanics. One name now generating serious traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a decentralized lending protocol that offers much more than memes and momentum. It delivers a real use case in decentralized finance, giving both casual users and long-term holders something to build with. With its fifth presale phase 58% complete and the price still at $0.03, the momentum is building at the ground level. Yield, Roadmap, and Token-Driven Rewards While DOGE holders rely largely on community energy, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces clear economic logic into its token model. Users will be able to stake their mtTokens into smart contracts and will expect MUTM dividends. A portion of protocol revenue is used to buyback the MUTM from the open market and distribute to mtToken stakers. To further accelerate platform expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch its own overcollateralized stablecoin—designed to serve as a treasury anchor and support future lending products. Combined with the upcoming Layer-2 integration for cheaper transactions and faster execution, this roadmap phase promises to elevate both protocol efficiency and token demand. Security-wise, the project is already under review via a formal audit process with CertiK, one of the most recognized smart contract evaluators in the space. A $50,000 bug bounty has been launched to reinforce platform resilience and attract security-focused developers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also announced a $100K giveaway to attract new holders, deepen user participation, and reward early community members during the presale stages. Lending That Accepts What Others Ignore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a DeFi framework that caters to an overlooked market: meme coin holders who still want utility. Through its peer-to-peer (P2P) lending engine, users will be able to create customized loan agreements using tokens like DOGE, SHIB, or even PEPE—assets often unsupported on most major platforms due to their volatility. With no shared liquidity pools, these loans will occur directly between lenders and borrowers, with personalized terms covering interest rate, duration, and even partial fills. This setup not only opens up new lending opportunities for underused tokens but also gives users the ability to negotiate value directly in a trustless environment. More conservative users looking for predictability will also benefit from peer-to-contract (P2C) lending. In this structure, lending pools will accept blue-chip assets and stablecoins—such as USDC, USDT, DAI, and others—providing more traditional DeFi functionality. These deposits will mint mtTokens, which automatically grow in value as interest accrues based on pool usage. For example, someone who deposits $12,000 worth of USDT into a P2C pool will receive 12,000 mtUSDT in return in 1:1. At an estimated average APY of 14%, that user stands to earn $1,680 annually in passive income, without lifting a finger after deposit. The platform also has mechanisms in place for borrowing with overcollateralization. Someone holding $2,000 worth of ETH will be able to lock it into the protocol and borrow up to 70% of that value (depending on LTV ratio)—keeping exposure to the underlying asset while gaining access to instant liquidity. If the collateral value drops below the safety threshold, Mutuum’s liquidation engine will step in, repaying debt at a discount to preserve systemic stability and protect the entire network. The Clock Is Ticking on Phase 5 With $11.9 million already raised and 12,850+ holders on record, investor confidence is clearly taking shape. On-chain activity shows multiple DOGE-heavy wallets reallocating capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with expectations of 3x to 10x returns by mid-to-late 2026. One wallet that previously held a large DOGE position has already moved $19,000 into MUTM, citing the token’s deeper functionality and treasury-backed design. Phase 5 of the presale is already 65% sold, and the price is set to rise from $0.03 to $0.035 once this stage concludes. With limited time and supply, this is the cheapest entry point left for new investors. Now is the moment to make the move—before the next wave of buyers pushes the price into a new bracket.

In a recent interview on the Shawn Ryan Show, Hoskinson detailed a chaotic week of discussions with President Nayib Bukele’s administration, claiming the proposed airdrop risked violating U.S. sanctions and drawing severe backlash from Washington. Chaotic Encounters Hoskinson painted a picture of disarray within the Salvadoran government during a 2021 visit to the country. He described meetings with eccentric officials, including a Minister of Energy who declared, “The power of magma will be the destiny of El Salvador,” as plans for a geothermal-powered Bitcoin mining hub were pitched. According to the blockchain innovator, the implementation strategies for the national adoption of BTC in El Salvador lacked structure, with officials allegedly using WhatsApp and Facebook speeches from President Bukele as informal policy guides. “We asked, what are the compliance guidelines for adopting cryptocurrency here? [They said] ‘We don’t have any,’” Hoskinson reminisced. “Where are you getting your business requirements? They said Facebook.” However, the pivotal issue emerged during U.S. consultations. Hoskinson claimed discussions revealed Bukele’s intent for a universal airdrop, which he argued would funnel cryptocurrency to MS-13, designated a Transnational Criminal Organization by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). “Bukele, for example, wanted to do an airdrop to everybody in El Salvador,” Hoskinson stated. “And we’re like, okay, but MS-13 is on an OFAC list. And so if we give Bitcoin to all these people, we’re facilitating a transfer of value to a terrorist organization. That’s no bueno.” He also added that coordination with U.S. authorities proved impossible, particularly under the Biden administration, which he claimed adopted a “regime change” stance towards Bukele. “We just couldn’t get there. So, we passed on the deal after a week,” he concluded. Despite the withdrawal, El Salvador pressed forward with Bitcoin, making it legal tender and launching the government-backed Chivo wallet. Hoskinson admitted that the move was historic, with the Central American nation currently holding 6,230 BTC worth about $679 million. “It was a very pivotal moment,” He said. “It actually made Bitcoin the official currency and it forced the IMF, and it forced all the transnational bodies to actually start recognizing Bitcoin.” Market Reaction The explosive claims elicited swift skepticism, with Bitcoin advocate Cory Bates questioning the narrative’s accuracy: “I have a feeling this is not quite how the story went.” Pseudonymous analyst The Bitcoin Therapist was more blunt, calling it the “dumbest sh*t I’ve ever heard.” Neither Bukele’s administration nor U.S. officials have publicly verified Hoskinson’s account. Meanwhile, Cardano’s native ADA token is showing modest resilience. At the time of this writing, it was trading at $0.5768, up 2.0% in the last seven days to slightly outperform the broader crypto market. However, it remains down 12.5% over the last month and significantly lags its September 2021 all-time high of $3.09.

Just as Bitcoin mining once demanded vast computational resources, the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence now drives an unprecedented race for data center capacity. The latest seismic shift in this landscape comes with the monumental announcement from CoreWeave: a staggering CoreWeave acquisition of data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock deal valued at $9 billion. CoreWeave Acquisition: The $9 Billion Bet on AI On Monday, July 7, 2025, CoreWeave, a specialized cloud provider for AI workloads, confirmed its intent to acquire Core Scientific , a prominent data center infrastructure provider. This isn’t just another corporate merger; it’s a strategic move that underscores the intense demand for compute power fueled by generative AI. The $9 billion all-stock transaction immediately grants CoreWeave access to an astonishing more than one gigawatt of data center capacity. To put that into perspective, one gigawatt is enough energy to power over 850,000 homes, now earmarked for the insatiable demands of AI training and inference workloads. This acquisition is a clear signal of CoreWeave’s aggressive expansion strategy, positioning itself at the forefront of the AI compute revolution. The deal significantly bolsters CoreWeave’s ability to provide the specialized GPU-accelerated cloud services essential for cutting-edge AI development. Core Scientific’s Evolution: From Bitcoin Mining to AI Data Centers Interestingly, Core Scientific has a history deeply rooted in the digital asset space, much like CoreWeave itself. Both companies previously offered Bitcoin mining services, a sector known for its substantial energy consumption. However, as the AI boom gained momentum, Core Scientific shrewdly pivoted its focus. Its existing infrastructure, originally designed for energy-intensive cryptocurrency operations, is now being repurposed and optimized to run and train generative AI models. This transition highlights a broader industry trend: the repurposing of high-capacity data centers from crypto mining to AI, leveraging existing power grids and physical infrastructure for new computational frontiers. This pivot by Core Scientific makes it an ideal target for CoreWeave, which specializes in high-performance computing for AI. The synergy allows CoreWeave to rapidly expand its footprint without the lengthy and capital-intensive process of building new facilities from scratch. Unlocking Tremendous Gigawatt Capacity for AI Workloads The immediate benefit of this CoreWeave acquisition is the substantial increase in its operational capacity. Gaining access to over a gigawatt capacity is a game-changer in the fiercely competitive AI landscape. This vast energy potential will be directly applied to facilitating AI training and inference workloads, which are the backbone of developing and deploying advanced AI models. These workloads require immense parallel processing power, typically provided by thousands of GPUs. Key advantages of this expanded capacity include: Accelerated AI Development: More available compute power means AI companies can train larger, more complex models faster, reducing development cycles. Scalability for Demand: CoreWeave can better meet the surging demand from AI startups and enterprises looking for specialized cloud infrastructure. Competitive Edge: This move solidifies CoreWeave’s position as a leading provider in a market where computational resources are the new gold. Operational Efficiency: Leveraging Core Scientific’s existing, optimized data centers allows for quicker deployment and potentially lower operational costs compared to greenfield developments. The Escalating Race for Cloud Infrastructure Dominance The CoreWeave acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a significant marker in the escalating global race among cloud infrastructure providers to expand their data center footprints. The computational demands of AI companies appear seemingly endless, driving an unprecedented demand for specialized hardware and the facilities to house it. Just last week, Bloomberg reported another colossal deal: OpenAI, a key player in the generative AI space, struck an agreement with Oracle to rent an additional 4.5 gigawatts worth of data center capacity. This expansion builds upon their already massive “Stargate” infrastructure deal, illustrating the scale of investment required to power the next generation of AI. This arms race for compute capacity is redefining the technology landscape, pushing companies to acquire, build, and partner at an unprecedented pace to secure the necessary resources for AI innovation. Navigating the Future of AI Compute and Industry Consolidation This CoreWeave acquisition of Core Scientific highlights a critical trend: the forced consolidation within the data industry driven by enterprise AI. As AI models grow in complexity and size, the infrastructure required to support them becomes increasingly specialized and expensive. This naturally leads to larger players acquiring smaller, but strategically valuable, assets. What does this mean for the future of AI compute? We can anticipate: Further Consolidation: Expect more mergers and acquisitions as companies vie for control over limited data center space and energy resources. Increased Specialization: Cloud providers will continue to differentiate themselves by offering highly specialized services tailored for AI, rather than general-purpose computing. Energy Demands: The energy requirements for AI will continue to soar, putting pressure on power grids and accelerating the search for sustainable energy solutions for AI data centers . Innovation in Hardware: The intense demand will spur further innovation in GPU and other AI-specific hardware development. The strategic importance of owning and operating vast data center capacity cannot be overstated in the age of AI. CoreWeave’s move is a bold statement, positioning it as a formidable force in providing the backbone for the AI revolution. A New Era for AI Infrastructure The acquisition of Core Scientific by CoreWeave for $9 billion marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of cloud infrastructure for artificial intelligence. By securing over a gigawatt capacity , CoreWeave is not just expanding its footprint; it’s strategically investing in the very foundation of future AI development. This deal, set against the backdrop of an industry-wide race for compute power, underscores the immense value placed on data center resources capable of handling intensive AI workloads. As companies like CoreWeave and Core Scientific adapt and innovate, they are shaping the future of generative AI and the digital economy, proving that in the age of AI, compute power is indeed the ultimate currency.

The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap and all top 10 coins saw their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen 3.8% to $3.42 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $87.3 billion. TLDR: After one day of upward movement, the crypto market turned downwards; BTC and ETH are slightly down but overall largely unchanged, trading at $108,322 and $2,558, respectively; While crypto market saw a mild drop, stocks fell sharply on the tariff news coming from the US, reigniting global trade war fears; US BTC and ETH ETFs have resumed positive flows yesterday; ’Bitcoin is taking its place at the forefront of the conversation’; ’The lines between traditional finance, the DeFi ecosystem, and Bitcoin are blurring faster than ever’; Underlying metrics still reflect mixed investor sentiment. Crypto Winners & Losers In contrast to yesterday, the prices of all the top 10 coins per market cap have dropped today. However, only two fell above 0.5%, meaning that the majority of the coins in this category are practically unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 0.4%, currently trading at $108,322. This is still largely unchanged over the past five days. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 0.3%, currently changing hands at $2,558. The only two coins with increases above 0.5% are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) , with a drop of 2.5% and 1.3% to the price of $0.1682 and $149, respectively. When it comes to the top 100 coins, about a dozen are up at the time of writing. Bonk (BONK) is the best performer today. It’s up 6.8% to $0.00002347. POL (POL) is up 1.7% to $0.1868, while the rest are up below 1% each. On the other hand, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and SPX6900 (SPX) fell the most in this category. They’re down 7.7% and 6.8% to the prices of $1.08 and $1.24, respectively. Financial markets in general reacted to US President Donald Trump’s letters to several countries, threatening tariffs of 25%-40% and reigniting global trade war fears.

Meanwhile, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has argued that the crypto community should turn to “copyleft” licensing . He says that the sector is drifting away from its open-source roots. “The crypto space in particular has become more competitive and mercenary,” Buterin wrote. “We are less able than before to count on people open-sourcing their work purely out of niceness. Copyleft can be viewed as a very broad-based and neutral way of incentivizing more diffusion.” ‘Broader Mix of Market Signals’ James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , commented that Bitcoin surged to a record June closing at $107,100 and experienced its strongest week above $109,200, but “the ‘neutral’ reading reflects a broader mix of market signals.” “While institutions have been piling in, a lot of money is quite tentative right now as the world appears to be on a knife’s edge both geopolitically and macro-economically.” The index factors include volatility, trading volume, options activity, social‑media sentiment, Bitcoin dominance, and search‑trend data, Toledano says. “Price momentum may be strong, but muted volume and rising volatility suggest caution.” “Meanwhile, high hedging activity or increased wary sentiment on social media and search trends could also dampen greed. In short, while prices rally, underlying metrics still reflect mixed investor sentiment,” he concluded. Moreover, following EthCC 2025 , Alexei Zamyatin, BOB Co-Founder and BitVM researcher, commented that the conference made “one thing clear: the lines between traditional finance, the DeFi ecosystem, and Bitcoin are blurring faster than ever.” He continued: “From Robinhood’s tokenized equities to modular rollups and decentralised AI, the event showcased the accelerating convergence of these once-distant worlds. The growing interest in Bitcoin DeFi was also unmistakable, a sign that even at Ethereum’s flagship event, Bitcoin is taking its place at the forefront of the conversation.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,322. The price first increased to the intraday high of $109,056 but then swiftly dropped to $107,591. It has slightly recovered to the current price since. Bitcoin Price Chart.

Key Takeaways: Remixpoint is now paying its CEO entirely in Bitcoin, a first for a Tokyo-listed firm. The company adopted Bitcoin over stock due to insider trading restrictions. This move strengthens its crypto-focused strategy and aligns leadership with shareholders. The move, announced Tuesday , is part of a broader strategy to align executive incentives with shareholder outcomes and reinforce commitment to the company’s financial performance. In its press release, Remixpoint said the initiative aims to ensure the leadership “shares the same economic fate as shareholders,” a response to previous shareholder requests that executives hold company stock. Remixpoint Executives Chose Bitcoin Over Company Stock Due to restrictions related to insider trading laws, however, holding equity was not a viable option for executives. Instead, the firm turned to Bitcoin, citing the cryptocurrency’s close price correlation with its own stock as a way to mirror the financial ups and downs of its investors. CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi described the decision as a “clear signal” of his commitment to corporate value and shareholder-focused governance. Remixpoint’s Bitcoin compensation policy builds on its crypto-forward strategy launched last year. In September last year, the company began investing in digital assets as a hedge against yen depreciation and to diversify currency exposure. Its crypto portfolio includes over 1,000 BTC, 900 ETH, nearly 14,000 SOL, 1.2 million XRP, and 2.8 million DOGE, according to its website. JUST IN: Japanese public company Remixpoint announces it bought 44.8 #Bitcoin worth $4.7 million pic.twitter.com/bpWejivMoz — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) June 6, 2025 Notably, the crypto-keen auto and electricity trading company is the former owner of the crypto exchange BITPoint, which it sold to the securities giant SBI in 2023 . Despite the BITPoint sale, Remixpoint has continued to pursue crypto-related business avenues. The firm began its crypto-buying strategy in 2024. Following the announcement, Remixpoint’s stock rose 0.71% on Tuesday. Japanese Firms Double Down on Bitcoin Strategy Japanese firms show no sign of slowing their Bitcoin-buying fervor. The famously Bitcoin-keen Metaplanet has been consistently boosting the size of its own BTC holdings . On Monday, Metaplanet expanded its Bitcoin treasury strategy with the purchase of 2,205 additional BTC . The latest acquisition brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, worth approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) at an average purchase price of 14.5 million yen per coin. The purchase, valued at 34.5 billion yen, comes amid Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation since designating Bitcoin treasury operations as an official business line in December 2024. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, a key metric tracking the percentage change in Bitcoin holdings per fully diluted share, rose 15.1% between July 1 and July 7, adding 2,017 BTC worth 31.7 billion yen in the quarter-to-date period. BTC Yield highlights the net Bitcoin growth relative to share dilution, which the firm views as a measure of shareholder accretion. Furthermore, Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed gaming firms like Enish and Gumi have also launched ambitious BTC-buying strategies.

As of now, the collective holdings have surged to 1,253,032 BTC , valued at over $136.3 billion , according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. BlackRock’s IBIT Controls Over 55% of Sector Holdings BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is the undisputed leader, holding more than 700,000 BTC , currently worth $75.9 billion . In just two trading sessions, IBIT added 1,388 BTC , highlighting strong institutional demand. At the start of 2024, IBIT held 551,917.9 BTC . As of now, its holdings have jumped 26.83% year-to-date , making it the largest ETF in the sector by a significant margin. Top 5 US Bitcoin Spot ETFs by Holdings Here’s a breakdown of BTC holdings in top ETFs: BlackRock’s IBIT : 700,000 BTC Fidelity’s FBTC : 203,508.5 BTC Grayscale’s GBTC : 184,226.9 BTC ARK 21Shares’ ARKB : 48,265 BTC Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust : 44,227.8 BTC These five ETFs dominate the U.S. Bitcoin ETF landscape, capturing the majority of institutional investment in Bitcoin. IBIT Outperforms Traditional ETFs With 82.67% Returns Since its launch in January 2024 , IBIT has delivered 82.67% returns , outperforming even BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF . For comparison: Bitcoin YTD Change (2025) : +16.5% S&P 500 YTD Change : +6.16% This performance reinforces the growing narrative that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset among institutional investors. Bitcoin Demand Surpasses Supply in 2025 Another key trend in 2025 is the Bitcoin supply and demand imbalance . So far this year: US Bitcoin ETFs bought : ~$28.22 billion worth of BTC Bitcoin mined globally : ~$7.85 billion worth This massive buying pressure led by BlackRock and others has significantly outpaced the newly mined supply, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price higher in the long term. ETF Approval Process May Soon Get Simpler Regulatory hurdles have long slowed down ETF approvals in the U.S., but that could soon change. Reports suggest that the SEC is considering streamlining the Bitcoin Spot ETF approval process , potentially requiring just Form S-1 with a 75-day waiting period . Currently, ETF issuers must submit both Form 19b-4 and S-1 , resulting in months of delays and regulatory back-and-forth. A simplified path could open doors for more ETF products shortly. The U.S. Bitcoin Spot ETF market is gaining momentum in 2025, with BlackRock’s IBIT at the center. With demand now far exceeding new supply and the SEC looking to simplify approvals, the sector may be on the verge of another growth wave.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-08 11:53:12

According to data from Arkham Intel , the transaction came from a wallet called “US Government: FBI,” which holds $100,000 worth of ETH originally seized from NFT scammer Chase Senecal, also known as Horror (HZ), in October 2022. In total, however, the U.S. Government currently holds 65,156 ETH, worth $166 million. US government crypto transfers. Source: Arkham Intel An institutional crypto selloff? The government has issued no official statement in regard to the recent deposits, but the timing and nature of the transaction point to possibly larger moves in the near future. Namely, given that Coinbase Prime is known as a platform designed for institutional transactions, the market suspects the deposit may signal the government’s desire to offload some of its seized Ethereum holdings. Moreover, large over-the-counter sales or direct market liquidations can weigh heavily on crypto prices, especially in a period when the US authorities are working increasingly harder on regulating digital assets.

After plunging to $0.000021124, BONK staged a dramatic recovery and closed at $0.000022868. As of the latest reading, the token trades at $0.0000228, slightly off highs but firmly within bullish territory. A consolidation zone formed between $0.000022848 and $0.000023033, with a breakout attempt at 10:25 GMT accompanied by a volume spike, underscoring building bullish pressure. Momentum is also soaring on the social front. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlight BONK’s milestone flip of TRUMP, making it the fourth largest memecoin by market cap . The community-powered bonk.fun platform, now commanding 54.7% market share , is credited for driving both user activity and on-chain buybacks. Users have also pointed to BONK’s vibrant meme ecosystem, anticipating that upcoming art-based campaigns and NFT-style projects could become new growth engines. Institutional and macro narratives are also aligned. Tuttle Capital’s rumored 2x leveraged BONK ETF has stirred speculation, while dovish Fed signals and global tariff extensions have broadened crypto risk appetite. With breakout volume, confirmed support, and a hyper-engaged community driving attention across meme culture and DeFi, BONK looks well-positioned for continued upside in the near term. Technical Analysis Highlights BONK traded in an 11.49% range, from $0.000021124 to $0.000023862, during the July 8 session. $0.000021124 was confirmed as key support with 2.60 trillion volume during the reversal. Final-hour price held between $0.000022848–$0.000023033, forming a bullish consolidation band. A 41.5 billion unit spike at 10:25 GMT signaled renewed buying pressure and potential breakout. Volume averaged 11.2 billion units per minute in the final hour, indicating sustained demand. BONK flipped TRUMP to become the fourth largest memecoin by market cap, backed by social momentum. Bonk.fun platform dominance and anticipated meme-art initiatives support long-term growth narrative.

The fund's C-corp structure enables staking yield payouts but introduces double taxation and a relatively high 1.4% expense ratio. Solana's staking yields remain robust, driven by transaction fees and stablecoin activity, supporting a positive outlook for SSK's income potential. I rate SSK a 'buy' as the best available Solana staking ETF until a superior structure emerges. For the first time in the United States market, there is an ETF product that provides investors exposure to Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) with staking rewards. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF ( SSK ) launched on July 2nd. In my view, this is a significant milestone for US-based digital asset ETFs. In this article, we'll look at how the fund is constructed and the staking rewards expectations for Solana, and I'll compare SSK to some other Solana-themed products/tickers currently available in the market. REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF Details Fund Assets $12,117,250 Shares Outstanding 475,000 Management Fee 1.40% Fund Inception 07/02/2025 Source: REX Shares, as of 7/3/25 Like most of the crypto closed-end funds offered by Grayscale, Osprey, and various other asset managers, SSK has a fairly simple objective: to mimic the returns of the chosen digital asset—in this case, Solana. The key difference for SSK is that it offers yields from staking the underlying asset. Until now, spot ETFs tracking digital assets in the United States have not paid out blockchain reward yields to shareholders. This is less of a problem for proof-of-work assets like Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) or Litecoin USD ( LTC-USD ), but the inability to stake ETF-held assets has generated an opportunity cost for proof-of-stake assets like Ethereum USD (ETH-USD) or Solana in the US market. Where I think the market may have expected a crypto staking ETF from a larger asset manager like BlackRock, Inc. ( BLK ) or Fidelity, REX Shares pulled off approval of such a product in a slightly roundabout way; SSK is structured as a C-corp rather than as a grantor trust. This means the fund is slightly more complex than a standard spot ETF, both from a taxation standpoint and from an asset holdings standpoint. For instance, one of the ways SSK has Solana staking exposure is through the Europe-based 21Shares Solana Staking ETP: SSK Holdings (REX Shares) Per REX Shares, management will invest at least 80% of fund assets into Solana and other assets that replicate the return of Solana through a subsidiary company. Despite this, perfect correlation isn't guaranteed. Although the Fund seeks returns that correspond to the returns of the Reference Asset, the Fund’s performance will not replicate the performance of the Reference Asset. The fund has a somewhat high expense ratio at 1.4% considering the C-corp structure could lead to double-taxation of the staking rewards. Though it has yet to happen since the fund is brand new at the time of article submission, REX Shares will pay out rewards from staking on a monthly basis. Since the fund is structured the way it is, the staking yield from the Solana blockchain will be initially subject to corporate taxes, and then the shareholder will again be taxed on the distribution. The benefit of the C-corp structure is that SSK did not require a 19b-4 filing with the SEC, which allowed for a less strict, faster approval process than would be expected from a spot ETF with staking embedded. So while it probably isn't the best way to do SOL Staking longer term through an ETF wrapper, SSK may benefit from being the first product to market. Where Does The Yield Come From? A standard question that should be asked of any risky asset is: What drives the yields? We know with the proliferation of covered call and option income strategy ETFs that those yields typically come from activity in the options market. My view has been that such funds should perhaps be less interesting to income investors since the yields aren't very predictable and reliant on options market volatility. However, staking assets on-chain should lead to yields that are a bit less volatile given the nature of the PoS network. Solana Staking Reward Source (Dune Analytics/21labs) That said, Solana has seen a growing share of staking rewards come from transaction fees in recent years. In July 2022, fees made up a little over 1% of validator staking rewards. That number grew to 5-6% in July 2024 and is closer to 8% today. Some of this is due to the dis-inflationary nature of Solana's issuance schedule, which sees new coins into circulation decline by 15% every year until new issuance is just 1.5%. But there is no question Solana's underlying usage has helped drive fees and, by extension, staking rewards: Monthly Fees By Chain (Artemis) There has certainly been volatility in the transaction fees paid by blockchain network users over the last several years, and Solana has not been an exception. After reaching an all-time high of $253 million in fees during the month of January, Solana's monthly fees have considerably normalized in 2025. June was actually the first month this year when Ethereum beat Solana in monthly fees. Regardless, current yields from staking remain consistent with longer-term averages: SOL Staking Revenue and APY (Dune Analytics/21labs) The 7-day average staking APY was close to 8% in June. This was very much in line with the 7-9% range that has been typical for Solana stakes going back to early 2023. You can see the large spike in the 7-day average APY during the large fee revenue months in November 2024 and January 2025. What this implies is that when fees grow from Solana usage, yields from staking will as well. Given the blockchain's speed and $10.7 billion stablecoin footprint, positioning in a stake-enabled Solana fund is a fine way to express a stablecoin growth thesis from where I sit. SSK vs. Alternatives Does SSK offer Solana bulls the best way to purchase SOL versus the growing list of alternatives in the market? US investors can now purchase SOL through CEF wrappers like the Grayscale Solana Trust (SOL) ( GSOL ) or the Osprey Solana Trust ( OTC:OSOL ). They can also get exposure to staked SOL through Solana Treasury companies like Upexi, Inc. ( UPXI ) and DeFi Development Corp. ( DFDV ). Here's a comparison to consider: Solana Exposure Expense Ratio Market Cap SOL Value Premium/Discount Yield? REX Shares-Osprey SOL 1.40% $12,117,250 $12,041,250 0.63% Yes Grayscale Solana Trust 2.50% $79,107,523 $80,248,727 -1.42% No Osprey Solana Trust 2.50% $25,298,226 $30,295,181 -16.49% No Upexi - $144,700,000 $110,900,000 30.48% No DeFi Development - $337,300,000 $96,164,620 250.75% No Sources: REX Shares, Osprey, Grayscale, Upexi, DeFi Development, author's calculations Right off the bat, the Solana Treasury Companies are noncompetitive from a mNAV standpoint. DFDV trades at nearly 4x the value of the Solana underlying the company's Solana strategy. Upexi, while much less egregiously priced than it was two months ago , is still pricing in four years of staking yields before taxes. At a 1.4% discount to NAV, GSOL figures to track mostly with Solana from here. But from where I sit, it's OSOL that actually looks quite interesting at a 16% discount to the underlying SOL managed by the fund. To be sure, OSOL doesn't pay out staking yields, but as an arbitrage play, I actually think it's more appealing than SSK currently. Closing Summary If nothing else, SSK is an important ETF as, to my knowledge, it is the first that offers crypto staking yields to US investors. If you envision a world where stablecoins are a meaningful part of global commerce and Solana plays an active role in that world, SSK is probably worth a look. As a Solana pure-play, SSK makes a lot of sense over a fund like GSOL or the Solana Treasury companies in the public markets. That could certainly change if Upexi and/or DeFi Development shares are priced more in line with mNAV. Today, I think OSOL is a better way for Solana's speculative capital given the NAV rate arbitrage currently being provided by the market. But I'm going to open SSK coverage with a 'buy' and will entertain buying the fund personally until there is a Solana Staking ETF in the US market that isn't structured as a C-corp.",SOL-USD|GSOL|OSOL|UPXI|DFDV|SSK,EN,0,0,SOL|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-08 12:00:00

Bitcoin is teasing another breakout. Ethereum is climbing on institutional optimism. Altcoins are riding the wave. But in the middle of this frenzy, one project isn’t just joining the hype. It’s flipping the entire playbook. While others ride the price wave, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is pulling a bold move. Instead of inflating, it’s deflating, for a moment. With its highly anticipated LBank debut approaching, the project has just announced a strategic Price Rollback. In a market where FOMO is sky-high, BTC-S is daring enough to offer early adopters a better deal. LBank Listing Meets a Different Kind of Hype LBank, one of the largest crypto exchanges in Asia, is no stranger to token launches. It brings deep liquidity, strong Asian investor traction, and a reputation for boosting exposure. For many new projects, an LBank listing is a milestone. For Bitcoin Solaris , it’s just one of several major gears in motion. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Engine with Real Power Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another L1 with big promises. It’s a fully-fledged wealth ecosystem engineered for scalability, accessibility, and profitability. Built on a dual-consensus model that merges Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake, BTC-S offers both uncompromising security and lightning-fast performance. It runs on a two-layer architecture designed to handle over 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality. For users, this means near-instant, cost-efficient transactions at scale. For developers, it means a future-proof environment for DeFi, enterprise tools, and global apps. More importantly, it’s mobile-first. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, users can mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones. The app will support: Smart dashboards with live metrics Adaptive, energy-efficient mining algorithms Gamified features like team mining and leaderboards The app is expected to redefine how everyday users participate in the crypto economy, no expensive rigs required. This Rollback Is for You BTC-S Drops to $5 to Thank Early Supporters Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense Forget vague allocations. BTC-S follows a clear, structured model designed for long-term value: 66.66% reserved for mining 20% allocated for the presale 5% for liquidity 2% for community growth 2% for marketing 2% for staking rewards 2% for ecosystem development 0.33% for team and advisors The full model can be explored here , and it’s one of the reasons so many serious investors are treating BTC-S as more than just a trend. The Presale Storm: Now with a Twist The presale is already a breakout event. With over $6.6 million raised and more than 14,150+ users onboard, it’s shaping up to be one of the fastest-growing token offerings of the year. But now, Bitcoin Solaris is adding a plot twist: the Price Rollback. For a short time, the current $11 price is dropping to $5. This rollback isn’t a discount or promotion. It’s a thank-you window. A calculated move to reward early confidence before the price rockets toward its launch value of $20. Only around 3 weeks remain before the launch One of the shortest presales in crypto history Wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch For anyone still on the sidelines, this rollback might just be the final nudge they needed. Audits, Influencers, and the Buzz That Won’t Stop Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just making waves among investors. It’s catching fire in the crypto influencer scene. Detailed reviews from top names like Crypto Vlog , Crypto Show , and Token Galaxy have praised the tech, the strategy, and the long-term potential. Security-wise, the project has also completed smart contract audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , adding another layer of confidence for presale participants. And the community is exploding. Telegram discussions are nonstop, and engagement on X continues to rise as more users discover the project’s depth. The Road Ahead Bitcoin Solaris isn’t slowing down. The roadmap includes some of the most ambitious expansions in the space: A mining marketplace Layer-2 scaling Quantum-resistant upgrades Partnerships with major enterprises With the upcoming LBank debut and full mainnet launch in sight, BTC-S is not just a coin. It’s an ecosystem in the making. Final Verdict As prices across the market continue to rise, most investors are chasing after already inflated tokens.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-tail-is-wagging-the-crypto-dog-heres-the-significance/,"In a striking post on X, renowned crypto analyst Vincent Van Code ignited widespread discussion by claiming, “the XRP tail is wagging the crypto dog.” His remark, though metaphorical, reflects a growing concern in the digital asset space: XRP’s price movements appear to be driving the broader crypto market, not the other way around. According to Van Code, XRP often surges ahead of other tokens, triggering a chain reaction driven not by organic investor sentiment but by arbitrage bots and high-frequency traders. “XRP pumps, then the arbitrage bots and HF traders kick in to find slip oops across correlated pairs, thus sending all tokens tumbling,” he noted. This ripple effect highlights the market’s interconnectedness and fragility, where a single asset’s price movement can trigger broad volatility. The Problem with Centralized Exchanges Van Code and others argue that centralized exchanges (CEXs) are exacerbating this issue. Binance , in particular, is once again under scrutiny. Despite founder Changpeng Zhao stepping down in late 2023 following criminal charges and a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. regulators, critics say the exchange still operates with unchecked influence. The XRP tail is wagging the crypto dog. That's my analysis. XRP pumps, then the arbitrage bots and HF traders kick in to find slip oops across correlated pairs, thus sending all tokens tumbling. It's seriously out of hand, to make crypto great again, we need to regulate… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) July 7, 2025 John K, another X user joining the conversation, remarked, “XRP would be a lot higher than where it is now without this manipulation. There needs to be serious oversight of the large exchanges like Binance. CZ still has not cleaned house.” These allegations include insider trading, unfair API access for VIP clients, and opaque liquidity practices that skew the market. A Push Toward Decentralization In response to the problem, users are calling for a shift toward decentralized exchanges (DEXs). EskoO, reacting to Van Code’s post, wrote, “I mean if everyone would get off the CEXs and stick with DEXs, we’d be cool.” Van Code agreed, urging traders to use the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange, stating, “People should trade in and out of XRP/RLUSD on the XRPL. Not only are the order books REAL, but you’re also helping to move liquidity on the DEX rather than the red Binance pockets.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The XRPL DEX is gaining traction for its transparency and native trading pairs. It offers an alternative to centralized platforms where market manipulation is harder to conceal and liquidity flows are verifiable on-chain. By moving liquidity to the XRPL, traders can support a fairer and more stable trading environment for XRP and RLUSD, Ripple’s native stablecoin. Time for Oversight The broader crypto community echoes a clear sentiment: regulation is long overdue. As user GrimmReaper put it, “Let’s hope that will be part of the regulations. It’s completely ridiculous to watch the majority of cryptos have the same chart most days.” The market’s synchronized movements, despite vastly different underlying fundamentals, suggest manipulation by centralized forces rather than natural free-market dynamics. As XRP continues to assert itself as a major market mover, the call for decentralization and regulatory reform is becoming more urgent. Real change will require a two-pronged approach: companies migrating to transparent platforms and robust regulations that promote fairness and equality. Vincent Van Code’s message is clear: the crypto market is being led by forces it can no longer afford to ignore.

Analysts from the Wall Street bank said they are targeting 6.4K, 6.6K, and 6.9K index levels, respectively. According to Goldman analysts, the Fed easing is forecasted to start in September, and the likelihood of a higher-than-expected performance by large-cap companies in the tech sector was the key driver of their revised outlook. The analysts also claimed that recent corporate surveys and inflation figures suggested a less-than-expected tariff-driven impact on consumers. However, they cautioned that the effects of Trump’s tariffs could be gradual, even as large caps stocked up their inventories in anticipation of the increasing impact of tariff rates. Goldman maintained its +7% earnings-per-share growth projection for the S&P 500 in 2025 and 2026 but said it would reassess the estimates after considering Q2 earnings. It also added that there was an upside and downside risk despite the predicted slowdown in PCE inflation to 2.3% and the probable decrease of a U.S. recession to 35%. The broker emphasized that higher corporate earnings, eased trade tensions, and the effects of short-term rate cuts could be key drivers of this upward trajectory in the stock market. The analysts’ report published on Monday noted that Fed cuts of 25 basis points were also expected in the next three consecutive meetings. Goldman analysts imply a 6.9K S&P 500 index level peak The analysts raised the targeted 12-month S&P 500 index level from 6.5K to 6.9K, claiming that lower bond yields than previously projected and the willingness of investors to look through the weakness of short-term earnings were the core reasons behind this revision. The expected year-end level for the six-month index level also increased from 6.1K to 6.6K, while the three-month level rose from 5.9K to 6.4K. However, the analysts pointed out that they expected “near-term rotations” to the estimates “below the surface of the index” following what they referred to as a “narrow breadth rally.” The bank’s analysts also mentioned that the “median constituent” remained over 10% below its 52-week ATH, adding that they believed in a likelihood of a “catch up” rather than a “catch down.” The market is expected to grow in the next couple of months as the analysts recommended investments at the beginning of the second half of the year. Particularly, they suggested a balanced allocation in several sectors, citing potential gains in Software & Services, Real Estate, Utilities, Materials, Media & Entertainment, and Alternative Asset Managers. The forecasted “forward price-to-earnings ratio” for the S&P 500 also jumped to 22, up from 20.4. Anticipated multiple 12-month P/E projections. Source: Goldman Sachs Goldman strategists previously lifted the three-month index level target to 5.9K in May, saying that relaxing trade tensions between the U.S. and China favored the projection despite looming uncertainties. The upgrade, just like the recent one, followed a rally on Wall Street as U.S.-China negotiators agreed to a temporary tariff “ceasefire.” Kostin’s team saw less than a 1% gain from levels at that time, implying that the advance on Wall Street is likely to stagnate. Kostin says Fed rates are more crucial for stocks In June, the U.S. equity strategist said that bond yield levels are not as critical for stocks as the factors affecting the Fed’s interest rates. The rise in interest rates affects stocks by reducing the earnings of companies and limiting the potential growth scope for stock valuations. However, they added that the vulnerability of stocks to increasing Fed rates also depends on some reasons for rising yields. The team also pointed out that declining recession risk, U.S. government debt concerns, and high lending costs increased yields for U.S. bonds. The increase in yields on U.S. bonds was previously driven by reduced recession risk and declining tensions in international trade. “Equities typically appreciate alongside rising bond yields when the market is raising its expectations for economic growth, but struggle when yields rise due to other drivers, like fiscal concerns.” – David Kostin , Chief Strategist at Goldman Sachs Goldman’s strategists expected bond yields to remain unchanged in 2025, and the Fed to complete its cycle of rate cuts in June next year, with its policy rates ranging between 3.5% and 3.7%. Kostin’s team claimed that although many investors are still not fully convinced, they pointed out that 5% nominal yields could be the tipping point for U.S. stocks.

DigitalX, an Australian-based pioneer in digital asset management, has successfully closed a substantial funding round, raising approximately A$20.7 million, equivalent to a remarkable $13.48 million USD. This strategic injection of capital is earmarked for a clear and impactful purpose: to bolster DigitalX’s Bitcoin purchases. This move not only underscores a strong vote of confidence from prominent investors but also signals a broader trend of increasing institutional engagement within the cryptocurrency space. DigitalX Funding: A Strategic Boost for Digital Asset Management The recent DigitalX funding round is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver designed to significantly enhance the company’s capabilities and market position. Announced via X (formerly Twitter), this capital raise highlights DigitalX’s commitment to expanding its portfolio of digital assets, with a primary focus on Bitcoin. But who are the key players backing this ambitious venture? Animoca Brands: A leading name in blockchain gaming and metaverse development, their participation signals a growing convergence between different facets of the digital economy. UTXO Management: As specialists in the Bitcoin ecosystem, their involvement provides strategic alignment and deep expertise. ParaFi Capital: A prominent blockchain-focused investment firm, their backing further validates DigitalX’s vision and operational strength. And More: The participation of additional unnamed investors suggests a broad-based confidence in DigitalX’s strategy and the long-term prospects of Bitcoin. This diverse group of investors brings not just capital, but also invaluable industry insights and networks, positioning DigitalX for accelerated growth in the competitive digital asset management landscape. Fueling Bitcoin Investment: DigitalX’s Forward-Looking Strategy At the core of this significant funding round lies a clear objective: to fund Bitcoin investment . DigitalX’s decision to allocate a substantial portion of this capital to BTC purchases is a testament to its belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition as a store of value and a foundational digital asset. In a market often characterized by volatility, Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated resilience and growth potential, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Why Bitcoin, specifically? DigitalX likely views BTC as a cornerstone asset for several reasons: Scarcity and Demand: Bitcoin’s fixed supply creates inherent scarcity, which, combined with increasing demand, often leads to appreciation. Market Dominance: As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin offers liquidity and established infrastructure. Inflation Hedge: Many investors see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against traditional fiat currency inflation. Institutional Acceptance: With the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increasing regulatory clarity, institutional comfort with BTC as an asset class is growing. This strategic focus on Bitcoin not only aligns with current market sentiment but also positions DigitalX to capitalize on the continued maturation of the cryptocurrency market. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption: A Game Changer? The participation of high-profile investors like Animoca Brands, UTXO Management, and ParaFi Capital in DigitalX’s funding round is a powerful indicator of the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . For years, the cryptocurrency market was primarily driven by retail investors. However, in recent times, we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift, with major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds entering the fray. What’s driving this institutional interest? Maturing Infrastructure: Improved custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and derivative products have made it safer and easier for institutions to engage with crypto. Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions, providing a framework for institutional participation. Performance Potential: The potential for significant returns, even amidst volatility, continues to attract capital seeking diversification and alpha. Technological Advancement: A deeper understanding of blockchain technology’s transformative potential across various industries. This influx of institutional capital not only provides liquidity and stability to the market but also lends credibility, paving the way for broader mainstream acceptance of digital assets. DigitalX’s success is a microcosm of this larger, transformative shift. Navigating Digital Asset Management in a Dynamic Market For a firm like DigitalX, specializing in digital asset management , navigating the dynamic and often unpredictable cryptocurrency market requires expertise, foresight, and robust risk management strategies. The significant capital raise empowers DigitalX to enhance its operational capabilities, expand its team, and potentially explore new investment products beyond direct Bitcoin purchases. Key aspects of effective digital asset management include: Security: Protecting client assets from hacks and cyber threats is paramount. Compliance: Adhering to evolving regulatory frameworks across different jurisdictions. Market Analysis: Employing sophisticated tools and expertise to identify opportunities and manage risks in a 24/7 market. Product Innovation: Developing new investment vehicles that cater to diverse investor needs, from active trading to long-term holding strategies. DigitalX’s ability to attract such significant funding speaks volumes about its established track record and its strategic approach to managing digital assets in a way that instills confidence among sophisticated investors. Crypto Market Trends: What This Means for Investors The news of DigitalX’s successful funding round and its focus on Bitcoin purchases is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a strong signal reflecting broader crypto market trends . For individual and institutional investors alike, this development offers several actionable insights: Continued Institutional Interest: Expect more traditional financial players and large investment firms to allocate capital to digital assets. This trend is likely to drive further market maturation. Bitcoin as a Core Holding: The emphasis on Bitcoin reinforces its position as a primary digital asset for long-term investment strategies. Innovation in Digital Asset Services: As more capital flows into the space, expect to see increased innovation in products and services offered by digital asset managers. Potential for Market Volatility: While institutional adoption brings stability, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. This development suggests a positive outlook for the crypto market, driven by increasing legitimacy and capital inflow from established players. A Bright Future for Digital Assets DigitalX’s impressive $13.48 million funding round, backed by industry giants like Animoca Brands, UTXO Management, and ParaFi Capital, marks a pivotal moment for the company and the broader digital asset landscape. By strategically channeling this capital into Bitcoin purchases, DigitalX is not only strengthening its own portfolio but also reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a crucial component of modern investment strategies. This event powerfully underscores the accelerating pace of institutional crypto adoption and the growing sophistication within digital asset management. As crypto market trends continue to evolve, developments like these are instrumental in shaping a more mature, robust, and accessible digital economy for everyone.

There’s a clear tug-of-war between buyers and sellers, with neither side gaining much ground just yet. While the recent moves haven’t been dramatic, ETH is showing some strength by staying above key levels. It appears like the market is gearing up for something bigger, with traders watching closely for signs of a breakout as Ethereum continues to hover in this calm zone. What’s Impacting the Ethereum Price in July? Over the past few days, Ethereum has remained network-heavy despite a slight pullback in daily transactions and moderate gas usage. Meanwhile, large holders are withdrawing from exchanges, and institutional inflows are accelerating. Here are the top fundamental & on-chain updates that have been strongly impacting the ETH price lately. In the first few days of the month, Ethereum recorded about 1.23 million transactions, representing a nearly 3.7% drop from 1.28 million. However, the levels have remained higher, 8% year-over-year, reflecting sustained network usage The Ethereum gas usage sat at ~50.66% on July 06, largely unchanged from the previous day and slightly above last year’s ~50.5% but below typical longer-term averages of around 56.9%. Over the past few weeks, a large whale withdrew ~7000 ETH from Binance, including ~1900 ETH recently, suggesting a declining exchange reserve, which is nearly 18.96 million ETH. Ethereum-focused investment products witnessed a $226 million inflow last week, which is double the rate of Bitcoin and marked the 11th straight week of positive inflows. This signals a strong institutional sentiment. Will the ETH Price Reach $3000 This Month? As the ETH price consolidates in a narrow range, it appears the token is preparing for a massive price action in the long term. The short-term price action may appear uncertain, but the weekly chart hints towards a potential breakout. The weekly Ichimoku cloud is about to undergo a bullish crossover, which suggests the indicator is about to undergo a bullish crossover. On the other hand, the weekly DMI levels have converged, suggesting a huge volatility incoming that may change the direction of the persisting trend. After a strong recovery, the ETH price has reached the threshold, and hence, a breakout from this range could elevate the levels above $3000. With this, the Ethereum price may begin a fresh bullish spell and reach out to levels never seen before.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-08 12:01:29

With Tesla’s stock slipping and Bitcoin under pressure, the fallout is raising serious concerns for both traditional investors and the crypto crowd. Where will this feud end up? Tesla Stock Tanks After Political Showdown Since Musk publicly criticized Trump’s $5 trillion spending bill in June and launched his new political group, the America Party , Tesla shares have dropped 14%. On July 7 alone, they fell another 6.8%, wiping out $79 billion in value. The bigger worry is what comes next. With Republicans now holding power across all three branches of the U.S. government, investors fear Tesla could lose its favorable treatment – especially government support for electric vehicles. SpaceX, which relies on $22 billion in federal contracts, could also face serious disruption. Tesla’s Bitcoin Holdings Now a Market Risk Tesla owns 11,509 BTC, originally valued at $1.2 billion. But with Bitcoin down 12%, that stash is now worth around $951 million. If Tesla’s stock keeps falling, Musk may be forced to sell some of the company’s Bitcoin to raise cash. That could trigger a chain reaction in the crypto market. Investor sentiment is already shaky, and a major sell-off by Tesla would only deepen the uncertainty, potentially dragging Bitcoin prices down even further. How Tesla Could Move the Bitcoin Market Thanks to new FASB accounting rules in 2025, Tesla now has to report quarterly valuations of its Bitcoin holdings. Earlier this year, when Bitcoin dropped to $93,000, Tesla took a hit. But back in Q4 2024, when Bitcoin spiked to $106,000, the company saw a $600 million boost in profits. Now, with markets on edge and Tesla’s stock in decline, investors are wondering what Musk will do. Selling could crash prices. But holding firm would send a message of strength and help stabilize the crypto market. What Experts Say Crypto analyst Nic Puckrin said the Musk-Trump feud was predictable, but their media dominance is unsettling markets, and rising tensions could make things worse. Anthony Pompliano said Musk could use Tesla’s Bitcoin to offset Trump’s EV subsidy cuts. He views Musk’s America Party as pro-Bitcoin and expects Tesla to hold or grow its BTC holdings for financial stability amid a feud with Trump.

Tesla’s Future Hangs in the Balance While Musk battles it out in politics, Tesla is rolling out its new robotaxi service in Austin and facing fierce competition from Chinese EV giant BYD. Many investors feel this is where Musk should be focusing his attention, not on founding a political party. SpaceX’s Mars mission and Musk’s AI venture xAI aren’t exposed to public market swings like Tesla is. But Tesla’s board, though supportive so far, may push for Musk to refocus on business and settle tensions with the Trump administration. Here’s the Bottom Line Musk’s next move matters. If he holds Tesla’s Bitcoin, it could stabilize the crypto market. But if he’s forced to sell, it could spark another wave of volatility. As Tesla’s fate becomes more tied to Musk’s politics, the entire crypto space is watching closely.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-08 12:04:21

The changes took effect at the end of trading on July 3.

Read on for our Q3 updates 🧵 pic.twitter.com/dESsVwpq1j — Grayscale (@Grayscale) July 7, 2025 As part of the update, the DeFi Fund added Ondo ( ONDO ) to its portfolio, funding the purchase by trimming small portions of its existing assets. ONDO now accounts for 18.22% of the fund. Uniswap ( UNI ) and Aave ( AAVE ) remain the largest holdings at 34.01% and 30.74%, with the rest allocated to MakerDAO, Curve, and Lido. In the Smart Contract Fund, which includes major blockchain platforms that support decentralized applications, Polkadot ( DOT ) was removed and replaced with Hedera ( HBAR ). Similar to the DeFi Fund, Grayscale sold some of the existing assets and used the cash to buy HBAR and re-balance the other holdings. After the change, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) remained the top two assets, with weights of just over 30% each. Other tokens in the updated basket include Cardano ( ADA ), Sui ( SUI ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ). The Decentralized AI Fund didn’t add or remove any tokens this quarter, but Grayscale adjusted the size of each holding to keep the portfolio in line with its strategy. Bittensor ( TAO ) and NEAR Protocol ( NEAR ) now make up the largest share of the fund, followed by Render ( RENDER ), Filecoin ( FIL ), and The Graph ( GRT ).

By holding shares in these funds, investors can track the overall performance of sectors like DeFi, smart contract platforms, or decentralized AI. The funds are periodically adjusted to stay up to date with market changes, but since they don’t earn interest or dividends, Grayscale covers its operating costs by occasionally selling small amounts of the fund’s assets, which gradually reduces the number of tokens behind each share. Meanwhile, Grayscale is also advancing efforts to launch new investment products, including its much-anticipated Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF, which includes the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap, namely Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). The GDLC ETF was initially approved and then delayed when the SEC announced a review of the decision on July 1, putting the ETF’s listing on hold indefinitely as the commission examines the approval and works to establish clearer guidelines for similar crypto investment products.

At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $108,494, slightly down 0.3% over the past 24 hours. The price has ranged between $105,430 and $110,307 in the past week and remains just 3% below its all-time high of $111,814, set in late May. Technical analyst Axel Adler highlighted a key development on a July 8 post on X. The Bollinger Bands on Bitcoin’s daily chart have contracted sharply, with the distance between the upper and lower bands now just 7.7%. This is among the narrowest ranges seen throughout the current bull cycle.

This implies that Bitcoin may still be cheap in relation to earlier bull market peaks and is not overbought by historical standards. In essence, the market appears to be well-positioned for further gains, with valuation metrics offering support. Market activity has also picked up. Bitcoin’s 24-hour trading volume stands at over $26 billion, up more than 34% from the previous day. In times of tight price consolidation, rising volume is frequently seen as a sign of increased investor interest before a possible move. On the technical side, the daily chart shows BTC trading comfortably above its 20-day simple moving average, with Bollinger Bands beginning to squeeze tightly. Bitcoin may still rise before reaching overbought territory, according to the RSI, which is currently neutral at 55. While momentum has been flat, the recent uptick in volume and historical context of similar patterns suggest a bullish bias. Bitcoin price analysis.

If the 20-day moving average around $106,600 is not maintained, a deeper retracement toward $102,000 may be possible. For now, market structure and tightening volatility favor the bulls.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds over 700,000 BTC ( BTC ), accounting for roughly 55% of the total Bitcoin held across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Valued at over $80 billion at current prices, the milestone follows its latest purchase of 1,388 BTC as part of its ongoing aggressive accumulation, according to ApolloSats co-founder Thomas Fahrer. IBIT has recorded immense success since launched, amassing $76 billion in assets under management (AUM) and accounting for 96% of net inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs to date. The fund has constantly reinforced its position as a top performer among the investment products that debuted in January 2024, now generating more annual revenue than BlackRock’s long-standing S&P 500 ETF, IVV.

With its portfolio milestone, BlackRock ranks among the largest Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing even top corporate holders like Strategy, Tesla, and Coinbase. Several industry figures have called the milestone remarkable. ETF Store president Nate Geraci reacted to the news on X, noting that the 700,000 BTC milestone in just 18 months is “ridiculous.” BlackRock also led the latest wave of Bitcoin ETF inflows on July 7, pulling about $165 million of the total $217 million recorded, according to SoSoValue data . IBIT’s rapid rise has started to attract global attention. Recently, Bloomberg reported that Italy’s UniCredit SpA plans to launch a five-year, dollar-denominated investment certificate tied to IBIT for professional investors. The product will offer exposure to digital assets without requiring direct crypto custody or wallets. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF is also gaining momentum, posting steady inflows and nearing $5 billion in AUM.

A recent filing showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has accepted the application for a Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund. Truth Social first lodged its S-1 form with the SEC for the crypto ETF that holds both Bitcoin and Ethereum on June 16. According to the filing, the ETF is meant to offer investors exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investors will be able to gain exposure through NYSE Arca shares backed by the two crypto assets. The filing proposes that the ETF will have a 75% portion allocated to Bitcoin and 25% linked to Ether. The custodian for the fund will be Crypto.com , also known as Foris DAX Trust Company. Meanwhile, the fund’s sponsor will be asset management firm Yorkville America Digital.

However, Trump Media also notes that this is subject to change, based on the fund sponsor’s judgement which requires “sole discretion.” Earlier today, the SEC reportedly asked asset managers applying for spot Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded funds to re-submit Forms S-1 before the end of July. Analysts such as Bloomberg’s James Seyffart have long doubted the possibility of the SEC approving another SOL ETF. Earlier this year, the SEC gave the green light for the listing and trading of the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF.

According to on-chain data , the wallet address 1J3B2ucUpWjWPPpejUCoLN93Gwz3q65CTd originally acquired these Bitcoin holdings on July 25, 2019, when the cryptocurrency was trading at $9,796 per coin. The initial investment totaled $58.77 million, which has now appreciated to $649 million, representing a remarkable 1,004% return over the holding period. Bitcoin wallet address moves 6,000 BTC. Source: BitInfoCharts The entire wallet balance was transferred in a single transaction executed earlier today on July 8. Despite the size of the transaction, Bitcoin’s price has remained stable following the move, suggesting the funds may have been moved to another wallet or through over-the-counter channels rather than on public exchanges. Satoshi-era wallet moves $1 billion of BTC The $600 million transaction comes just days after an even more remarkable on-chain movement tied to Bitcoin’s early history. Specifically, on July, 4 a long-dormant wallet from 2011 transferred Bitcoin valued at approximately $1.09 billion . The wallet originally received these coins on April 3, 2011, when Bitcoin was trading at just $0.78 per coin, representing a total investment of only $7,805 that grew to over $1 billion after 14 years of inactivity. While the identity of the wallet’s owner remains unknown, transactions of this age frequently stir speculation about Satoshi Nakamoto , although blockchain analysts have confirmed that this address is not among those linked to the elusive Bitcoin creator. The whale transactions coincide with a remarkable surge in Bitcoin wealth distribution. Over 26,000 new addresses holding $1 million or more in BTC were added in the first half of 2025 alone, demonstrating how Bitcoin continues to create new millionaires while rewarding early believers with extraordinary returns.

After the sharp crash from its May peak of $1.67, Pi Network ( PI ) price has been gradually bleeding lower, caught in a persistent downtrend marked by lower highs and lower lows. The token has lost over 70% of its value in the past two months, recently stabilizing around the $0.45 level. However, PI price is now showing early signs of a potential trend shift after printing a bullish RSI divergence on the daily chart. Despite the price action having made fresh lows in late June and early July, the RSI has begun printing higher lows, signaling waning bearish momentum. This classic divergence setup often precedes trend reversals or short-term relief rallies.

If bullish momentum picks up, PI price could target a relief rally towards $0.65, aligning with the spike on June 25. However, it’s important to note that Pi Network still faces significant token unlock pressure this month. According to PiScan , a total of about 219 million PI will be unlocked throughout July, with the day-one unlock on July 4 already releasing 19.2 million PI into circulation.

The statement was made by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Tuesday morning during a closed-door meeting with cabinet ministers, just hours after Trump posted the actual tariff letters to his Truth Social page. The updated directive sets a 25% levy on Japanese goods, effective August 1, replacing the 24% rate floated in April. According to reporting from local Japanese media, Ishiba confirmed the country will remain in talks with Washington and hinted the US might revise the decision depending on how Japan responds in the coming weeks. “Depending on Japan’s response, the content of the letter could be revised,” he said at the meeting. But until something changes, the new rate is in place, and Japan joins a growing list of US trade partners that have voiced anger or confusion over the White House’s strategy. South Korea pushes for exemptions during DC visit The White House released screenshots of more than a dozen tariff letters on Monday, with each country getting its own updated rate. These posts confirmed that negotiations will continue until August 1, but also made clear that only serious offers would prompt a revision. The documents said that “the US could consider adjusting the new tariff levels” depending on each country’s proposed terms. While Japan is bracing for impact, South Korea is trying to prevent its own situation from getting worse. The 20% tariff on South Korean imports, which Trump also announced in April, hasn’t changed. But it hasn’t gone away either. According to Yonhap News, South Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy issued a statement saying the government would “swiftly resolve trade uncertainties” through new talks. Trade Minister Yeo Han-Koo traveled to Washington this week and met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, asking for lower tariffs on steel, automobiles, and other goods. No new announcements followed that meeting though. Other countries react with frustration, zero progress Outside of Japan and South Korea, other Asian economies are facing similar pressure. Thailand’s Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira said he was “a little shocked” by the latest rate, which stayed at 36%, one of the highest ever. He added that he believed it might still fall before the deadline if talks continue. But for now, no adjustments have been made. Malaysia is also caught in this round of duties. Its tariff rate went up to 25% from 24%, and the government confirmed it’s not walking away from negotiations. A statement from the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry said, “Malaysia is committed to continuing engagement with the US towards a balanced, mutually beneficial, and comprehensive trade agreement.” In Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa criticized the 30% tariff levied by Trump, saying it didn’t reflect actual trade conditions. In a post on X, Ramaphosa wrote that “77% of US goods entered the country with zero tariff,” and called for a fair and balanced trade relationship. He confirmed South Africa will continue diplomatic efforts to challenge the number. Trade analysts are skeptical that these efforts will result in much change. Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, said, “ASEAN members that worked hard to develop packages received almost all the same treatment as countries that either did not fly to DC or were not invited to meet.” She added that Trump might still be targeting Asian countries because of concerns over regional supply chains linked to China.

Recent developments in Asia’s currency markets offer a compelling case study of resilience and unexpected shifts. As investors navigate the complexities of digital assets, insights from the broader economic sphere can provide valuable context. This article delves into the forces driving the recent strength in Asian currencies and the surprising jump of the Australian Dollar, offering a comprehensive look at the underlying economic currents. Understanding the Asia FX Gains Post-Trump Tariffs Impact The recent resurgence of Asia FX gains marks a significant shift from a turbulent period dominated by the Trump tariffs impact . For years, trade tensions, particularly between the U.S. and China, cast a long shadow over Asian economies. Former President Trump’s aggressive tariff policies created a wave of uncertainty, leading to a notable selloff in various Asian currencies as investors feared disrupted supply chains and reduced trade volumes. During that era, the sentiment was largely negative, with capital often flowing out of emerging Asian markets into perceived safe-haven assets. However, the current landscape tells a different story. Several factors have contributed to the recent upturn in Asian currencies: Easing Trade Tensions: While not entirely resolved, the intensity of trade disputes has subsided, providing a more stable environment for regional trade and investment. Robust Economic Recovery: Many Asian economies have shown strong signs of recovery post-pandemic, driven by domestic demand and a rebound in global trade. This fundamental strength attracts foreign investment. Stable Monetary Policies: Compared to some Western counterparts, several Asian central banks have maintained relatively stable monetary policies, offering predictability that appeals to investors. Diversification: As global investors seek to diversify portfolios, the improving economic outlook and attractive valuations in Asia make its currencies appealing. These combined elements have created a fertile ground for the current positive momentum, leading to broad-based Asia FX gains across the region. The Australian Dollar’s Astounding Surge: What Drove the AUD Rebound? Amidst these broader movements, the Australian Dollar experienced an astounding surge, making headlines with its sharp AUD rebound . This particular jump was not merely a ripple effect of general Asian currency strength but was triggered by a specific, unexpected event: the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) recent monetary policy decision. Leading up to the RBA’s announcement, market analysts and investors widely anticipated a rate cut or at least a dovish signal, given concerns about inflation and economic growth. However, the RBA delivered a surprising RBA interest rate hold , choosing to keep its cash rate unchanged. This decision immediately defied market expectations, leading to an instant re-evaluation of the Australian Dollar’s prospects. Why did this ‘surprise hold’ cause such a significant jump in the Australian Dollar ? Unwinding Short Positions: Many traders had bet against the AUD, anticipating a rate cut. When the RBA held steady, these ‘short’ positions had to be quickly covered, pushing the currency higher. Signaling Confidence: The RBA’s decision was interpreted as a sign of confidence in the Australian economy’s resilience, suggesting that the central bank believes the economy can withstand current conditions without further monetary stimulus. Yield Appeal: A higher-than-expected interest rate (or one that isn’t cut) makes a currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking better returns on their investments, increasing demand for the AUD. This unexpected move by the RBA showcased the powerful impact central bank decisions can have on currency valuations, demonstrating how quickly market sentiment can shift when expectations are defied, leading to a dramatic AUD rebound . Navigating the Global Forex Market: Key Insights for Investors For those tracking the broader global forex market , these developments underscore the intricate dance between central bank actions, geopolitical shifts, and investor sentiment. The recent performance of Asia FX and the Australian Dollar provides crucial insights into the current dynamics. What does this mean for your investment strategy, particularly if you are accustomed to the volatility of crypto markets? Understanding these traditional market movements can offer a broader perspective on risk and opportunity. Here are some key insights: Central Bank Influence: Central bank decisions remain paramount. Unexpected policy moves, like the RBA interest rate hold , can trigger significant currency swings. Staying informed about central bank calendars and analyst expectations is vital. Geopolitical Impact: While the direct Trump tariffs impact may have softened, geopolitical events continue to shape currency flows. Trade relations, political stability, and international conflicts can all influence investor confidence and capital movement. Economic Fundamentals: Strong economic indicators, such as GDP growth, employment figures, and inflation data, provide the bedrock for currency strength. Currencies of economies demonstrating robust fundamentals tend to attract investment. Diversification Benefits: The performance of traditional currencies can offer diversification benefits, especially in times when digital asset markets experience high volatility. A balanced portfolio might consider exposure to stable, fundamentally strong currencies. In the interconnected global forex market , events in one region can have ripple effects worldwide. Being aware of these macro trends allows investors to make more informed decisions across all asset classes. Challenges and Opportunities in the Current Currency Landscape While the recent Asia FX gains and the Australian Dollar surge paint a positive picture, the currency landscape is never without its challenges. Investors must remain vigilant about potential headwinds that could temper future performance: Persistent Inflationary Pressures: Global inflation remains a concern, potentially leading to further aggressive monetary tightening by central banks, which could introduce new volatility. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing conflicts and evolving international relations can quickly shift investor sentiment away from riskier assets and emerging markets. Commodity Price Volatility: Currencies of commodity-exporting nations, like the Australian Dollar , are sensitive to fluctuations in global commodity prices, which can be unpredictable. Renewed Trade Tensions: Although the immediate Trump tariffs impact has waned, the underlying issues of trade imbalances and protectionism could resurface under different political administrations, posing a renewed threat to global trade and currency stability. Despite these challenges, opportunities abound. The resilience shown by Asian economies and the potential for continued growth offer avenues for strategic investment. For those interested in the broader financial ecosystem, understanding these traditional market dynamics provides a crucial backdrop against which to evaluate the performance and future of digital assets. The recent strength in Asia FX and the notable Australian Dollar surge driven by the RBA interest rate hold serve as powerful reminders of the dynamic forces at play in the global forex market . While the shadow of past events like the Trump tariffs impact still lingers, the current landscape offers a mix of resilience and new opportunities for informed investors. As the global economy continues to evolve, staying attuned to these fundamental shifts in currency markets will be key to navigating both traditional and digital financial landscapes effectively.

From whale buying and rising open interest to Ripple’s new banking license plan and the steady rise of its RLUSD stablecoin, many small clues hint that XRP could soon break past key resistance levels. Could this be the start of a 15% rally? 5 Key Signs Traders Should Watch Here are 5 Signs that should not be ignored! Open Interest Rises as Big Hearing Nears One of the key signs is XRP’s growing open interest. It’s jumped from $3.5 billion to nearly $5 billion in less than two weeks. Many traders are betting on higher prices, and some think the upcoming testimony of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse before the U.S. Senate could push XRP higher if it brings positive news for crypto rules. XRP ETF Approval Odds Surge A new point of excitement is the growing speculation around an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) approval. According to prediction markets like Polymarket, there is now a 90% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved by the end of 2025. This optimism is fueled by recent regulatory wins for Ripple and the broader acceptance of crypto ETFs in the U.S. Whales Are Accumulating XRP Large whales are also making moves. Wallets holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP have increased their holdings by nearly a billion coins recently. Smaller whales, with 100,000 to 1 million XRP, have bought another 30 million coins in two weeks. Ripple’s Push For Banking License Ripple’s push to get a banking license is also giving investors hope. If approved, it could boost trust in Ripple’s plans and lift XRP’s price. Many believe this fresh growth could flow back to XRP. Triangle Pattern Hints at Breakout Lastly, traders are hopeful is the ascending triangle pattern forming on XRP’s chart. This shape often appears before a strong upward move. If XRP can break and hold above the $2.29 resistance line and turn it into support, the next stop could be around $2.60, a jump of about 15%.

While the biometric identity project keeps grabbing headlines, it’s the volatility that’s raising eyebrows. But what if you could step off the price rollercoaster and onto something a little more… stable, yet way more rewarding? That’s exactly what Bitcoin Solaris is offering: a clear-cut path with less turbulence and more potential upside. The presale is moving fast, user growth is exploding, and unlike the unpredictable swings of Worldcoin, BTC-S is focused on real technological delivery. A Look at Worldcoin: Big Idea, Bumpy Ride Worldcoin’s grand ambition to create a global digital identity system is ambitious and futuristic. It leverages iris scans, biometric hardware, and novel economic models to onboard users across the globe. There’s no doubt the vision is bold, but the execution has come with concerns. • Regulatory pressure is mounting • Price has fluctuated wildly over short periods • Concerns about privacy and decentralization persist Worldcoin might be one of the most talked-about projects, but many investors are now eyeing alternatives that offer both excitement and direction. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in. What Makes Bitcoin Solaris Different? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) was built to do one thing extremely well: deliver true financial empowerment through next-gen tech and community-first design. While Bitcoin proved what decentralized money can do, Solaris expands that vision into real-time performance, green infrastructure, and a fully featured ecosystem. Some standout elements include: • 10,000+ transactions per second • 2-second finality • 99.95% energy efficiency improvement over traditional PoW • Dual-layer consensus with Delegated Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work integration • Real smart contracts • Cross-chain compatibility The Path Is Set: What the Roadmap Promises Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t rely on hype alone. Its roadmap is packed with real, scheduled milestones from now through 2028. • Q2–Q4 2025: Core dev, whitepaper updates, presale launch • Q1 2026: Wallet release, testnet, Solana integration, full audits • Q2 2026: Exchange listings, marketing ramp-up • Q3 2026: Mainnet goes live, Solaris Nova App launches • Q4 2026: DApp accelerator, hardware wallet compatibility • 2027: Layer-2 scaling, quantum resistance, institutional solutions • 2028+: Global education, AI-driven network optimization, public sector integration This isn’t just a token. It’s a structured platform with enterprise-grade goals. Mini-Games, Real Bitcoin: Blockchain Gaming with Token Holder Rewards Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just about speed and security. The platform also brings the fun. Token holders get access to Blockchain Gaming features where participants can win up to 0.5 BTC through daily and tiered reward systems. It works like this: • One free daily spin for every user • Higher tiers unlock more spins with larger reward potential • Spend $250+ for a shot at 5% bonus tokens • Spend $500+ or $1000+ to unlock up to 13% • Spend $2500+ to access the grand prize: up to 0.5 BTC This structure brings casual fun into serious crypto holding. And since these are chance-based and limited to verified purchases, they also support a balanced token distribution model. It’s a blend of entertainment and reward built directly into the Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem. Presale Momentum: One of the Fastest Rises in 2025 Right now, Bitcoin Solaris is in Phase 11 of its presale. • Current price: $11 • Launch price: $20 • Potential return: 150% But here’s the twist: for a very short time, the team has announced a rollback event, dropping the price back to $5 temporarily. That’s right. A $20 launch with a $5 entry means a staggering 185% gain for those who move now. With over $6.3 million raised and 13,900+ users already onboard, this presale has become one of the most explosive early-stage offerings of the year. And with less than 4 weeks to go, the window to get in before the launch is shrinking fast. The presale isn’t just fast. It’s user-friendly. And to ensure seamless token delivery, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended to receive your BTC-S on launch day. This simple step makes sure your tokens are secure and ready when the market opens. Final Verdict: Why the Shift from Worldcoin to Bitcoin Solaris Is Growing Investors want vision, but they also want results. Worldcoin might have the flash, but Bitcoin Solaris brings the firepower, plus the roadmap, the speed, the staking, and the rewards to back it up. With a community-driven model, clean tech, and clever rewards baked into its ecosystem, Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a presale. It’s a chance to rebuild wealth with precision. And yes, for the first time ever, a Blockchain Gaming system might just make your wallet heavier in the most entertaining way possible.

As CoinMarketCap boasts over 880 million page views per month and serves media giants like Forbes and Bloomberg , the integration will help promote Apertum as an ecosystem that emphasizes transparency, performance, and decentralization. 🌐 @Apertum_io $APTM a community-driven, EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain with high-performance infrastructure is now officially integrated with #CoinMarketCap ! Also Live: Apertum DEX — the decentralized exchange enabling secure non-custodial trading across the Apertum… pic.twitter.com/D7nBdFHZT8 — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) July 8, 2025 Thanks to the integration, developers, analysts, and investors can now also access live data on Apertum’s trading volumes, token activity, and ecosystem health. Moreover, liquidity providers can also earn rewards from every trade on the Apertum DEX, which offers verified liquidity analytics and real-time metrics. Apertum features Launched in Q1 2025, Apertum was originally designed to support scalable, high-speed decentralized applications with full Ethereum ( ETH ) Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. Its mainnet supports up to 4,500 transactions per second, with finality speeds ranging between 0.15 and 1.5 seconds. As such has use cases in decentralized finance ( DeFi ), non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Apertum’s infrastructure also facilitates smart contract deployment via the Apertum Wizard and features a deflationary token model, with up to half of transaction fees being burned to support long-term sustainability. Prioritizing community governance Apertum launched without venture capital backing or institutional capital, being built around tenets such as community governance, decentralization, infrastructure quality, and accessibility. Fully indexed and discoverable on CoinMarketCap, all tokens and protocols built within the Apertum ecosystem can now benefit from global analytical visibility, which is expected to accelerate adoption. The integration is thus more than just a technical listing. Indeed, increased adoption will in turn deepen developer engagement and strengthen the blockchain’s position in the Web3 market. About Apertum Apertum is a leading L1 blockchain within the Avalanche ecosystem. It offers a high-performance, scalable, and fully decentralized infrastructure, supported by its native token , $APTM. Burning up to 50% of transaction fees, Apertum promotes trust and long-term value for $APTM holders, while its DAO-driven architecture prioritizes real-world applicability, secure high-yield products, and active community participation.

Network daily active addresses spike to 14.63M, signaling rising user interest and platform usage. Solana ETF Coming Earlier? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is moving faster than expected on spot Solana (SOL) ETF applications. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the SEC asked fund issuers to submit updated S-1 filings before the end of July. These updates must include details on staking and in-kind transactions. Although the Commission has until October 10 to make a final decision, it may act before that date. This shift in pace appears connected to the recent approval of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF (SSK). That fund launched under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which allowed it to start trading without a formal approval unless the SEC intervened. SSK Launch Raises Urgency for Other Filings SSK’s launch gives it a key advantage over other proposed ETFs still under review. It became the first Solana staking fund available to U.S. investors. The SEC has previously tried to avoid giving early access to one fund by approving similar products at the same time. This was the case with spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. One person familiar with the matter said the existence of an active Solana ETF could increase pressure on the SEC to approve additional filings without delay. The Commission’s request for issuers to update their paperwork suggests the process may now move faster than originally planned. Strong Trading Start for First Solana ETF As CryptoPotato reported , SSK began trading last week and drew $12 million in inflows on its first day. It also recorded $33 million in volume, based on data from Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. These early numbers reflect growing interest in Solana-related investment products. Notably, on-chain data shows a sharp increase in the network’s usage. According to Santiment data, daily active addresses reached 14.63 million on July 7. Just days earlier, activity had remained below 5 million. Source: X Meanwhile, the rise in user activity comes at a time when Solana’s market price has stayed steady. SOL was trading at $150.06 at press time, down 1.48% over the past 24 hours. Over the last week, the price has gained 0.61%. Trading volume sits above $4.28 billion. If activity on the network continues to grow, it may support long-term interest from investors and fund managers.

V reakcii na otázku jedného zo svojich sledovateľov na sociálnej sieti X (bývalý Twitter) uviedol, že jeho strana bude podporovať Bitcoin . Podľa jeho slov „fiat mena je beznádejná“ , čím mieri na dlhodobý pokles ceny amerického dolára a potenciál BTC v dnešnej globálnej ekonomike. Preskúmať nový meme coin s potenciálom Tesla drží Bitcoin v hodnote 1,26 miliardy dolárov Elon Musk má k najväčšej kryptomene dlhodobý vzťah. Spoločnosť Tesla patrila medzi prvých korporátnych investorov do tejto kryptomeny. V roku 2021 Tesla nakúpila Bitcoin v hodnote 1,5 miliardy dolárov , čím sa stala jednou z prvých verejne obchodovaných spoločností, ktoré zahrnuli BTC do svojich rezerv. Podľa údajov platformy Bitbo Tesla aktuálne drží 11 509 BTC v hodnote približne 1,26 miliardy dolárov , čím sa radí na 9-te miesto medzi verejne obchodovanými spoločnosťami s najväčšími bitcoinovými rezervami . Zakladateľ spoločnosti Jan3, Samson Mow , sa vyjadril, že prijatie BTC by mohlo dať Muskovi výhodu v jeho prebiehajúcom konflikte s Donaldom Trumpom . Mow tiež uviedol, že Tesla by mala opäť začať akceptovať Bitcoin ako platobný prostriedok . Zároveň navrhol, aby Muskova spoločnosť SpaceX ponúkala klientom zľavy za platbu v BTC . . @elonmusk it’s time to go all in on #Bitcoin . @Tesla can take BTC for payments again and implement a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. @SpaceX can give a discount on launches paid in Bitcoin. Force a hard money standard on the money printers. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) June 5, 2025 Musk však nebol vždy naklonený Bitcoinu. Ešte v roku 2021 vyhlásil, že „cena Bitcoinu je príliš vysoká“, čo spôsobilo, že cena BTC sa vtedy krátkodobo prepadla. V čase písania sa BTC obchoduje za 108 913 $ . Bitcoin ako platobný nástroj sa spomínal aj v súvislosti s rozšírením platobných možností vo vesmíre. V roku 2024 Musk najprv odmietol myšlienku využívania BTC siete na platby v rámci jeho projektu Mars. Avšak neskôr pripustil, že by tento problém mohol vyriešiť lokalizovaný Lightning Network , ktorý by eliminoval pomalé transakcie. Zdroj: coinmarketcap.com Konflikt medzi Elonom Muskom a Donaldom Trumpom Vzťah medzi Muskom a bývalým prezidentom Donaldom Trumpom sa zhoršil po zverejnení Trumpovho návrhu zákona s názvom One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) . Elon Musk ho označil za „deštruktívny“ a upozornil, že by mohol spôsobiť stratu miliónov pracovných miest a obrovské strategické škody pre USA. Zákon je podľa odhadov spojený s nárastom amerického štátneho dlhu o 3,3 bilióna dolárov v nasledujúcej dekáde. Musk spochybnil logiku, prečo Trump vytvára iniciatívu s názvom DOGE zameranú na znižovanie štátneho dlhu, ak pritom plánuje zadlžiť krajinu o ďalšie bilióny. Musk následne naznačil, že Spojené štáty potrebujú novú politickú stranu , ktorá bude „skutočne stáť pri ľuďoch“ . Založenie strany America Party Následne v nedeľu Elon Musk oznámil založenie politickej strany America Party po tom, čo sa viac ako 1,24 milióna ľudí zúčastnilo hlasovania na sociálnej sieti X. Takmer dve tretiny hlasujúcich vyjadrili podporu vzniku novej strany. Donald Trump reagoval kriticky , pričom varoval, že Muskova nová strana by mohla rozdeliť republikánskych voličov počas volieb do kongresu v roku 2026. The America Party is the solution https://t.co/KryqdEcqIU — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 6, 2025 Téma sa dotýka kryptomenovej adopcie v politike , napätých vzťahov medzi technologickými lídrami a tradičnými politikmi, ako aj dlhodobej úlohy Bitcoinu v globálnej ekonomike. Zároveň signalizuje rast politiky orientovanej na technológie, kde digitálne meny a decentralizované financie zohrávajú čoraz väčšiu úlohu. Tu sa objavuje otázka, či je Bitcoin pripravený adaptovať sa na požiadavky dnešnej doby . Ako najstaršia sieť, Bitcoin blockchain nebol pôvodne navrhnutý na rýchle transakcie. Navyše náklady spojené s prevádzkou siete sú značne vyššie, ako u iných sietí. Ak chce Bitcoinový ekosystém udržať krok s dobou, potrebuje nové škálovacie riešenie s energeticky nižším zaťažením . Nové škálovacie riešenie Bitcoin Hyper zásadne mení spôsob, akým môžeme využívať BTC Na tento problém upozornil vývojársky tím Bitcoin Hyper , ktorý pripravuje prvé škálovacie riešenie L2 postavené na overenej architektúre Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) s podporou smart kontraktov. Kým Bitcoin sieť aktuálne spracuje len 7 transakcií za sekundu, SVM umožní realizáciu niekoľko tisíc transakcií za rovnaký čas. Naviac s použitím tzv. kanonického mosta (Canonical Bridge) je presun BTC medzi pôvodnou sieťou a novou vrstvou nielen rýchly, ale spĺňa najvyššie štandardy bezpečnosti bitcoinového blockchainu. Zdroj: bitcoinhyper.com Vďaka projektu Bitcoin Hyper môžu používatelia jednoducho používať BTC v rámci DeFi , stakingu alebo decentralizovaných aplikácií s takmer nulovými poplatkami a okamžitým spracovaním . Navyše nová architektúra má oveľa nižšiu energetickú spotrebu ako pôvodná Bitcoin sieť. Celý ekosystém poháňa natívny token HYPER . Ten plní nielen funkciu platidla za tzv. gas fee, ale je tiež zdrojom pasívnych príjmov pre dlhodobých držiteľov. Token totiž aktuálne v štádiu predpredaja ponúka APY odmeny za staking vo výške až 387 % . Okrem toho ho držitelia využijú aj ako nástroj hlasovania v rámci rozhodovania a budúcom vývoji ekosystému. V čase písania je predpredajná cena kryptomeny HYPER 0,012175 $. Podľa doterajšieho investičného záujmu a predikcií kritikov, sa token HYPER zaradil medzi top kryptomeny na nákup 2025 . Preskúmať Bitcoin Hyper Zapojte sa do sociálneho experimentu s potenciálom vysokého rastu Ak však hľadáte token, ktorý originálnym spôsobom preveruje limity dnešného kryptotrhu , pozrite sa na Token6900 (T6900) . Tento sebavedomý meme coin zámerne odmieta trend prehnanej utility a technických sľubov, ktorými sa mnohé projekty snažia osloviť investorov. Namiesto toho stavia na základoch úspechu SPX6900 a posúva celý koncept do roviny virálneho sociálneho experimentu s vizuálnym prevedením z éry internetu roku 2000. Zdroj: token6900.com Zámerom je dokázať, že aj bez náročnej funkcionality môže kryptomena uspieť, ak ponúkne 100 % transparentnosť , silný komunitný základ a kultúrny rozmer, ktorý rezonuje . Token6900 tak testuje, či čistá sila internetu, meme kultúry a participácie dokáže generovať vysoký rast bez prísľubov technologických prevratov. Vďaka tomu sa T6900 stáva nie len tokenom, ale aj zrkadlom toho, čo dnes v kryptosvete skutočne funguje – autenticita, energia a otvorená komunita. Token6900 ponúka predpredaj s limitom 5 miliónov dolárov , pričom aktuálna cena tokenu T6900 je 0,0065 $ . Nákup môžete zrealizovať na oficiálnej stránke predpredaja pripojením svojej Best Wallet, alebo inej kompatibilnej kryptopeňaženky . Záujemci o staking majú k dispozícii APY odmeny 195 % s možnosťou zapojenia sa do hlasovaní v rámci aktívnej DAO organizácie. Objem tokenov je pevne stanovený, pričom 80 % z celkovej ponuky je sprístupnených priamo v predpredaji.

Semler, which spent over 15 years focused on chronic disease detection, adopted bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in May last year. The move made it only the second U.S.-listed firm, after Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), to adopt bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Since then, the company has acquired roughly 4,636 BTC for $430 million, with an average cost basis of $92,753 per bitcoin, the report said. Palmer noted that the stock rallied 178% in the six and a half months following its Bitcoin Standard announcement, peaking at $81.56 in December 2024. However, the analyst argued that Semler still trades at a steep discount compared to bitcoin treasury peers. Its multiple of net asset value (mNAV) sits at 1.25, compared to 4.29 for Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) and 6.45 for France’s Blockchain Group (ALTBG), the analyst noted. Benchmark believes this gap could close. Management recently appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy and outlined bold BTC accumulation targets: 10,000 BTC by end of 2025, 42,000 by end of 2026, and 105,000 by end of 2027. The report notes that resolving legal and regulatory headwinds from Semler’s legacy healthcare business, including a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation and Medicare reimbursement uncertainties, could help lift its valuation further. Benchmark’s $101 price target is based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that assumes bitcoin will hit $225,000 by year-end 2026.

The rare movement comes as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publishes a new blog post outlining his support for more restrictive “copyleft” software licenses, urging the crypto community to adopt legal tools that ensure public access to derivative works. Dormant Since Genesis: Two Early Ethereum Wallets Reactivate After Nearly a Decade On Monday, blockchain sleuths observed two Ethereum wallets—first activated on July 30, 2015—spring to life after nearly a decade of dormancy. The wallets, labeled “ 0x27 ” and “ 0x7f ,” transferred a combined total of 1,140 Ether (ETH), now valued at close to $2.9 million. 900 ETH moved after nearly a decade of dormancy (Source: Whale Alert ) Both addresses received their ETH allocations during Ethereum’s genesis block, the very beginning of the network’s operational life. Their initial funding is marked “GENESIS” on Etherscan, underscoring their historic roots in the Ethereum “Frontier” era—the experimental phase that kicked off the world’s leading smart contract platform. Ethereum was worth mere cents when these wallets were funded in 2015. According to TradingView data , the price of ETH has risen by an eye-watering 89,450% since then, fueled by the network’s growing dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, DAOs, and a broad range of Web3 applications. ETH-USD price change over time (Source: TradingView ) The wallets’ silent holdings have since matured into multimillion-dollar assets—highlighting the immense gains long-term holders, or “hodlers,” have seen since Ethereum's inception. Part of a Larger Trend: Dormant Crypto Wallets Reawaken These Ethereum movements are part of a broader pattern that has gained momentum in 2024 and 2025. Last Friday, three dormant Bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era—inactive for 14 years—moved billions of dollars worth of BTC. In total, reactivated wallets from that era transferred around $44 million in assets. Such events typically stir excitement and speculation in the crypto community, especially as the motivations behind these reactivations remain unknown. They raise questions about whether early adopters are simply securing their funds, preparing to sell, or re-engaging with the evolving crypto landscape. The reactivated wallets also serve as a living snapshot of how much Ethereum has changed since 2015. Originally launched as a proof-of-work (PoW) network, Ethereum has since undergone one of the most important transitions in blockchain history. In September 2022, Ethereum completed The Merge, moving from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus to improve energy efficiency and scalability. This transition set the stage for additional upgrades aimed at making Ethereum faster, more secure, and easier to use. Vitalik Buterin Advocates for “Copyleft” Licensing Shift to Protect Open Source in Competitive Crypto Landscape Meanwhile, in a newly published blog post on Monday, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin unveiled a major pivot in his perspective on software publishing. While he has historically supported permissive open-source licenses—which allow anyone to use, modify, and redistribute code freely—Buterin now endorses ”copyleft” licenses, which impose conditions on how modified code can be reused. “If you create and distribute a derivative work by modifying it or combining it with other work, the new work must also be released under the same license,” Buterin wrote, referencing widely used copyleft licenses such as Creative Commons BY-SA (ShareAlike) and the GNU General Public License (GPL). Buterin emphasized that he remains largely skeptical of copyright in principle. However, his evolving stance is driven by a strategic shift: to use copyright as a tool to keep open-source ecosystems alive and robust in the face of growing privatization and commercial control. Buterin’s change in viewpoint doesn’t emerge in a vacuum. He cites several converging factors as influencing this philosophical recalibration, notably the mainstream adoption of open-source code by large corporations and the evolving nature of the crypto sector itself. “The crypto space in particular has become more competitive and mercenary,” Buterin wrote. “We are less able than before to count on people open-sourcing their work purely out of niceness.” This observation reflects a maturing crypto ecosystem where major players—including venture-backed startups and tech giants—are increasingly leveraging open-source infrastructure for proprietary gain. In such an environment, relying on goodwill and voluntary collaboration may no longer be enough, Buterin warns. He argues that copyleft licenses can serve as a kind of ”hard power”, compelling developers who benefit from public codebases to contribute back to the ecosystem. It’s a system of mutual accountability designed to ensure the recursive openness that has historically defined projects like Linux, Wikipedia, and Ethereum itself. From Cypherpunks to Corporations: A Strained Ideal The roots of the cryptocurrency movement are deeply embedded in the cypherpunk ethos, which champions privacy, decentralization, and radical transparency through open-source software. In the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum, many developers chose to license their code under MIT, Apache, or BSD licenses—minimalist legal structures that impose few, if any, restrictions on downstream use. But as billions of dollars have flowed into Web3, decentralized finance (DeFi), and blockchain gaming, the crypto world has witnessed a clash between altruism and opportunism. Some developers still publish their source code freely, while others—particularly in the NFT and Web3 art sectors—seek stronger protections to maintain control over intellectual property. “The argument for open source cannot just rely on ‘please,’” Buterin said. “It must also be accompanied by the hard power of giving access to some code only to those who open up theirs.” The copyleft model, originally championed by Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation, mandates that any modified or derivative work must be distributed under the same license. While this ensures that improvements to a project remain free and accessible, it can also discourage corporate adoption and create licensing incompatibilities. Critics argue that such restrictions may hinder collaboration or make open-source software less appealing for commercial projects. Permissive licenses, in contrast, are easier for companies to adopt and integrate—at the cost of potentially locking up public code in private repositories. Buterin’s call for a hybrid approach—where some projects use copyleft strategically while others remain permissive—offers a middle ground that may better reflect today’s hybrid crypto ecosystem, where innovation and profit often intersect. Impact on Ethereum and the Broader Ecosystem Buterin did not directly indicate whether Ethereum’s core codebase would adopt new licensing standards, but his public endorsement of copyleft licensing is likely to spark broader debates among Web3 developers, founders, and community stewards. Ethereum itself has always straddled the line between public infrastructure and competitive advantage. While most of its client implementations and tools are open source, the platform is now home to thousands of projects—some openly licensed, others tightly guarded. In the long run, Buterin’s advocacy may influence emerging standards for Layer 2 rollups, smart contract tooling, decentralized applications, and even DAOs, especially those that wish to maintain community alignment and forkability. Buterin’s mention of Creative Commons licenses is especially significant in the context of NFTs and digital art. The NFT sector has been a battleground for competing ideologies: some creators push for strong copyright protections, while others release their work under public domain or ShareAlike terms. The Future of Open Source in Crypto Vitalik Buterin’s latest stance is more than a personal musing—it’s a reflection of the changing pressures and politics of open source in a rapidly evolving digital economy. In many ways, it echoes the concerns of early internet visionaries who feared the commodification of public goods. Whether his words spark a shift in licensing practices across the Ethereum community or remain an intellectual contribution to the debate, one thing is clear: the next chapter of open source in crypto may require a stronger legal backbone to uphold the ideals of transparency, collaboration, and decentralization.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|ZRX|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-08 12:17:43

For companies like OpenAI, which are at the forefront of this revolution, protecting their core assets is paramount. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI has undertaken a significant overhaul of its security operations, a decisive move to safeguard its valuable AI intellectual property against external threats and internal vulnerabilities. This isn’t just about keeping secrets; it’s about preserving the future of AI innovation . Why is OpenAI Bolstering Its Security? The decision to tighten security wasn’t made in a vacuum. The competitive intensity in the AI sector is unprecedented, with companies vying for every advantage. A key trigger for OpenAI’s accelerated security clampdown was the emergence of a competing model from Chinese startup DeepSeek in January. OpenAI alleged that DeepSeek improperly copied its models using ‘distillation’ techniques, a sophisticated method of extracting knowledge from a larger model. This incident underscored the urgent need for more robust defenses against corporate espionage . Beyond direct copying, the threat landscape for AI companies includes: Nation-state actors: Governments are increasingly interested in acquiring advanced AI capabilities for strategic advantages. Competitor reverse-engineering: Rivals attempting to deconstruct models or algorithms to replicate functionalities. Insider threats: Disgruntled employees or those tempted by lucrative offers from competitors. Supply chain vulnerabilities: Exploits in third-party software or hardware used in development. For OpenAI, protecting its groundbreaking models and research is not just a business imperative; it’s crucial for maintaining its leadership position in the global AI race. How is OpenAI Enhancing its Data Protection? OpenAI’s revamped OpenAI security measures are comprehensive, addressing multiple layers of protection from digital to physical. These strategies aim to create a formidable barrier around its most sensitive assets. Here’s a closer look at the key initiatives: Information Tenting: Limiting Access to Sensitive Algorithms One of the core changes is the implementation of ‘information tenting’ policies. This involves strictly limiting staff access to sensitive algorithms and new products. For instance, during the development of OpenAI’s o1 model, only a select group of verified team members, who had been ‘read into the project,’ were permitted to discuss it in shared office spaces. This compartmentalization ensures that only those with a direct need-to-know can access or discuss critical project details, significantly reducing the surface area for leaks or inadvertent disclosures. Offline Systems and Biometric Controls: Fortifying Physical and Digital Perimeters OpenAI is taking significant steps to isolate its most proprietary technology. This includes: Isolation in Offline Computer Systems: Critical proprietary technology is now stored and processed in offline computer systems, disconnected from external networks. This ‘air-gapping’ strategy is a highly effective way to prevent remote cyberattacks and unauthorized digital access. Biometric Access Controls: For physical office areas containing sensitive information, OpenAI has implemented biometric access controls, such as fingerprint scanning for employees. This adds an extra layer of physical security, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter restricted zones. ‘Deny-by-Default’ Internet Policy: A Proactive Cybersecurity Stance In a bold move to enhance cybersecurity, OpenAI has adopted a ‘deny-by-default’ internet policy. This means that all external connections require explicit approval. Unlike traditional security models that allow access unless specifically denied, this policy takes a proactive stance, minimizing potential vectors for data exfiltration or unauthorized external access. It’s a testament to a zero-trust approach, where every connection is viewed with suspicion until verified. Increased Physical Security and Cybersecurity Personnel: The Human and Material Layers Beyond digital and access controls, OpenAI is also reinforcing its foundational security elements: Enhanced Physical Security at Data Centers: Recognizing that data centers are the physical repositories of their most valuable assets, OpenAI has increased physical security measures at these locations. This could include more guards, advanced surveillance systems, and stricter entry protocols. Expanded Cybersecurity Personnel: The company is growing its team of cybersecurity experts. A larger, more specialized team can better monitor for threats, respond to incidents, and proactively identify vulnerabilities, ensuring continuous vigilance against evolving cyber threats. The Broader Implications for AI Innovation and Corporate Espionage OpenAI’s intensified security measures reflect a growing awareness across the tech industry about the immense value of intellectual property and the sophisticated methods employed in corporate espionage . While the primary concern might be foreign adversaries attempting to steal IP, these changes also implicitly address internal security issues, especially given the ongoing ‘poaching wars’ among American AI companies and past leaks concerning CEO Sam Altman’s activities. This trend highlights a critical challenge: balancing the need for open collaboration and rapid development, which often characterizes the AI research community, with the imperative for stringent data protection . For other companies in the AI space, OpenAI’s actions serve as a blueprint and a warning. The era of loose security in AI development is over. Companies must invest heavily in comprehensive security frameworks to protect their innovations, which are increasingly becoming national assets. What Can Other Companies Learn from OpenAI’s Proactive Security? OpenAI’s comprehensive approach offers valuable lessons for any organization dealing with sensitive data or high-value intellectual property. Here are some actionable insights: Implement ‘Need-to-Know’ Principles: Restrict access to sensitive information to only those who absolutely require it for their work. Embrace Zero-Trust Architectures: Assume no user or device is trustworthy by default, requiring verification for every access attempt. Layered Security: Combine physical, digital, and procedural security measures for a robust defense. Regular Security Audits: Continuously assess and update security protocols to adapt to new threats. Employee Training: Educate staff on security best practices and the importance of IP protection. By adopting similar proactive stances, companies can significantly mitigate risks and foster a more secure environment for their innovations. Conclusion: Securing the Future of AI OpenAI’s aggressive pivot towards enhanced security is more than just a defensive maneuver; it’s a strategic imperative in the high-stakes game of artificial intelligence. By fortifying its defenses against corporate espionage and internal vulnerabilities, OpenAI is not only protecting its own considerable investment but also setting a new standard for security in the AI industry. As the lines between technological advancement and national security blur, robust OpenAI security measures will become the bedrock upon which the future of AI innovation is built, ensuring that the fruits of labor remain with those who cultivated them. The battle for technological supremacy is increasingly fought on the cybersecurity front, and OpenAI is clearly ready for the challenge, emphasizing that robust data protection is non-negotiable for leadership in the AI era.

XRP short-term price prediction XRP coin price prediction: short-term outlook XRP price factors for July 2025 Currently ranked in the 4th position with a market cap of $135.1 billion, XRP ( XRP ) has depreciated around 41% in price since reaching an all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. The token has seen a lot of range, and is currently holding the $2-3 range, with long-term investors still hopeful on a big breakout and a move to a new ATH for this token. XRP 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the XRP price prediction by giving you its short-term and long-term price forecasts, and specifically focus on XRP price prediction in July 2025. What is XRP? The cryptocurrency XRP is a native token of the open-source blockchain XRP Ledger. The purpose of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is to facilitate international money transactions and currency exchange. Additionally, investors use it to profit from market changes and store value. On its payment platform, blockchain services provider Ripple also uses XRP and the XRP Ledger to let enterprises, organizations, and financial institutions conduct transactions. The holders of XRP maintain that the token has a lot of upside in the coming years, and due to its large fan base, it is ranked among the top 5 cryptocurrencies in the world. Now let’s discuss XRP price prediction in July 2025, both from a technical point of view and also look into some fundamental factors that could affect the price as well.

What is it ?? #Bitcoin #crypto #altcoins pic.twitter.com/cpqRmj6Cok — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) July 8, 2025 XRP price factors for July 2025 As XRP is consolidating under a tightening technical triangle in July 2025 so far, it has stayed range-bound between about $2.20 and $2.60, signals indicating an impending breakout. The Teucrium 2× Long Daily XRP ETF’s exceeding of $158 million in assets under management, which represents consistent weekly inflows since April and a recent $33 million jump, is what spurred this move. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has remained well below its May peak of about $112K, ranging between $108,500 and $109,000. The robust Bitcoin foundation is indicative of the overall robustness of cryptocurrencies driven by growing institutional adoption: A layer of political support has been provided by President Trump’s executive order creating a strategic bitcoin reserve (including XRP), the U.S. GENIUS Act, and spot BTC ETF inflows exceeding $14 billion in H1 2025. There are still conflicting macroeconomic indicators. Expectations of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year are being factored into market prices, which might spark major cryptocurrency rallies again. However, as evidenced by the July 7 declines in the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Bitcoin, Trump’s trade tariff threats have rattled stocks and could cause some volatility. Given the robust ETF performance, encouraging macrotrends, and advantageous U.S. crypto policy, XRP appears to be well-positioned for a breakout, as evidenced by recent tight consolidation. Either a flood of new ETF inflows or Bitcoin breaking through the ~$110K barrier zone will probably be the major catalyst. The path toward $3.00‑$3.50 could be opened with a strong advance through ~$2.60–$2.70. However, cautious traders are keeping a close eye on XRP because of its past failures, which have been dictated by historical prudence. If macro and on-chain trends combine, July appears to be the likely turning point. You might also like: XRP price nears breakout as top Ripple ETF hits $158m milestone Is XRP a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including XRP, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a price point that was once considered a very strong support or resistance may become invalid in a very short time. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the price action before having any price expectations for the future of the XRP token. Will XRP go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the XRP token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for XRP price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low XRP can go. Should I invest in XRP? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any XRP price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the XRP token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Built in collaboration with Peersyst Technology and Ripple, the EVM sidechain bridges Ethereum’s developer tools—like Solidity, MetaMask, and Hardhat—with the XRP Ledger’s high throughput, low fees, and 3.4-second block times. It reportedly supports up to 1,000 transactions per second, making it an option for decentralized applications. In a social media post , Peersyst said , “The need for smart contracts on XRP is crystal clear. Almost 1.4k smart contracts deployed on Mainnet in only 1 week.” Ripple pushes for cross-chain growth The longer-term vision for XRPL is becoming clearer as the EVM sidechain provides a new capability dimension. The sidechain is designed to facilitate cross-chain action, helping to ensure that dApps can leverage and operate on the Ethereum and XRPL environments. This allows for possibilities in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenizing real-world assets, financial services (such as lending), and rapid global payments at low cost. The schedule for the sidechain release also coincides with the recent release of XRPL version 2.5.0, which ushered in several updates to the ledger’s core components. Together, these updates demonstrate Ripple’s mission to evolve XRPL into a complete blockchain operating system, not just a payment network. Proving that it is on the path of cross-chain integration, Ripple announced that it has brought in Wormhole, a top-of-the-range multi-chain messaging replication protocol. Wormhole enables cross-blockchain communication among dozens of applications. As such, developers can now create apps that interact with several networks and build on the XRPL. Ripple says such cross-chain infrastructure is necessary to realize the next generation of Web3 applications, particularly in the financial space, where assets must be moved across different blockchains. Developers could, for instance, build applications where users borrow tokens denominated in Ethereum but use XRP to close the loan and make the repayment. Validators and partners back XRP’s EVM sidechain The EVM sidechain not only lured developers but also received a surge in support from validators and network partners. At launch, 25 independent firms had already spun validator nodes to support the network. Further, the ecosystem is seeing the addition of some of its most valuable integrations yet. Its bridge to the Axelar Network, a cross-chain giant, is already yielding dividends. A cross-chain daily volume of over $100 million has flowed across XRPL-enabled corridors, according to Axelar. Increased liquidity allows XRP to compete with more established smart contract ecosystems such as Ethereum and now Solana and Avalanche. As the XRPL ecosystem grows, that EVM sidechain might become an on-ramp for thousands of developers seeking lower fees, faster speeds, and more access. XRP, which used to be known only for payments, could evolve into a multi-use blockchain that can support a wide variety of decentralized applications.

Trump’s Trade Deadline With 50% Tariffs Could Kill Bitcoin Rally Despite robust flows, short-term catalysts could create pressure for BTC. Notably, President Trump’s July 9 trade deadline postponment presents a significant risk factor. Should the EU, Japan, or China fail to finalize trade agreements, tariffs of up to 50% could be implemented, potentially reigniting concerns about inflation and reducing expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The June U.S. jobs report also exceeded expectations, with payrolls increasing by 147,000 versus the consensus estimate of 110,000. Rate Cut Dreams on Life Support The June U.S. Jobs Report just crushed hopes for near-term easing. The economy’s running hot and the Fed now has every reason to wait.

Bitcoin Technical Analysis and Price Action BTC gained 0.13% on July 8, standing at $108,876, reversing the previous day’s 1.52% decline. The next resistance level sits at the $111,917 all-time high, with potential targets at $115,000 if momentum continues. Key support lies at $105,000, with downside risk extending toward $100,000 if macroeconomic pressures outweigh the momentum of ETF flows. Technical analysis of the BTC/USDT 4-hour chart on Bybit suggests a bullish formation developing around a potential liquidity sweep and fair value gap (FVG) zone. #Bitcoin Short-Term Update #BTC is still holding above the trendline, supported by the Fair Value Gap (FVG) and the Tenkan . All eyes now on the Lagging Span : a breakout above the trendline would ignite the next rally. pic.twitter.com/wmtFkRHltz — Titan of Crypto (@Washigorira) July 8, 2025 With the price currently trading at $108,813, charts indicate a rejection of a descending trendline, although technical indicators suggest a possible drop below recent lows into the FVG zone, between $105,500 and $106,500. Source: TradingView This area aligns with the 0.65 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels, creating a high-probability demand zone for potential re-entry. The scenario envisions a liquidity grab below local lows, triggering buy-side interest and filling the imbalance before a strong bullish continuation. If this sweep and bounce materialize, projections indicate an aggressive move toward all-time highs, potentially around $110,000–$112,000, where substantial liquidity has been identified. The technical setup favors a short-term dip into key support levels followed by a rally toward higher highs, contingent on a successful reaction from the 0.786 Fibonacci zone.

At the same time, big players in finance are turning their eyes toward XYZVerse, drawn by its blend of sports themes and memes. This shift raises questions about market trends. What is driving this change, and what might it mean for the future? XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Ondo Finance: Bridging Traditional Finance with Blockchain Innovation Ondo Finance is revolutionizing the financial world by combining the reliability of traditional assets with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It does this by tokenizing stable, income-generating real-world assets like U.S. Treasuries. This approach makes high-grade financial products accessible to more people around the globe. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products and a technology arm that builds decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. By working with trusted partners like BlackRock and using Coinbase for secure asset custody, Ondo emphasizes trust, security, and transparency. One of its standout offerings, USDY, is backed by U.S. Treasuries and bank deposits, providing stability and a steady yield for non-U.S. investors. The potential of Ondo lies in its unique blend of traditional finance and cutting-edge technology. By bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain, it enhances accessibility and transparency in the financial market. In a time when the cryptocurrency market is often volatile, Ondo's focus on regulated, stable assets sets it apart from many other coins. Current market trends show a growing interest in asset-backed tokens and platforms that offer real-world utility through DeFi solutions. Compared to other cryptocurrencies that might fluctuate wildly, Ondo presents a different kind of opportunity by anchoring its value in tangible assets. This positioning could make it an intriguing option for those interested in both the stability of traditional finance and the innovation of blockchain technology. Conclusion Despite ONDO's milestone amid its 3% dip, attention shifts to XYZVerse (XYZ), the pioneering sports-memecoin aiming for massive growth and uniting fans across multiple sports.

Now, it’s ready to put it to work. The Tokyo-listed company, once known for running hotels, has taken a sharp turn in recent years, becoming one of the world’s most aggressive corporate Bitcoin holders. And now, it’s entering what CEO Simon Gerovich calls “phase two” of its strategy: using Bitcoin as collateral to finance acquisitions of profitable businesses. From Holding to Building Metaplanet added 2,205 BTC this week, bringing its total to 15,555 BTC, currently worth around $1.7 billion. That makes it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder outside of North America. But Gerovich wants to turn Bitcoin into a financial engine. “Then we have phase two… when bitcoin, like securities or government bonds, can be deposited with banks and then they’ll provide very attractive financing against that asset,” he told the Financial Times. With that financing, Metaplanet plans to buy cash-flowing businesses and grow beyond just being a BTC-heavy balance sheet. The Bigger Target: 210,000 BTC by 2027 Yes, you read that right. Metaplanet has set its sights on 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can… to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up,” Gerovich said. Phase one is all about accumulation. Phase two is about turning that position into real-world power and scale. Bitcoin as Collateral? Still Uncommon, But That’s the Point While crypto-backed lending is common in crypto circles, it’s still rare in traditional finance. But that’s exactly where Metaplanet sees the opportunity. By using BTC like bonds or stocks, the company believes it can unlock capital that others can’t. It has already raised funds through bond sales and stock rights, and now it wants to move faster than the competition while Bitcoin is still available in meaningful volumes. Gerovich expects phase one to last four to six more years, but once availability tightens, it could get harder for others to catch up.

According to data shared by Token Terminal on X, the total value of tokenized assets on Ethereum now tops $6 billion. That figure covers products from asset managers, fund houses and blockchain firms. It proves institutions are treating on‑chain finance as more than a tech demo.

Adoption started slowly around mid‑2023. It rose further in early 2024. Then by January 2025, the line on the stacked chart shot straight up. That jump comes as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pour in fresh tokens. Faster trades and fewer middlemen are big draws. Trades that once took days can now settle in minutes or seconds. That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money. Ethereum still faces questions about scaling. If gas fees jump again, trading costs could rise sharply.

XYZVerse’s value has soared, exceeding $14 million amid growing speculation. This unexpected surge is capturing attention, prompting curiosity about the factors fueling this momentum and what implications it may have moving forward. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Pi Network (PI) Source: TradingView Pi Network (PI) has faced notable price declines recently. Over the past week, the price dropped by 12.47%, settling within a range of $0.43 to $0.52. In the last month, it decreased by 25.58%, and over six months, it fell by 33.43%. These trends highlight challenges for PI in the current market. Despite the downturn, there is potential for a rebound. The nearest support level is at $0.39, which may prevent further drops. If the price holds above this level, it could rise toward the nearest resistance at $0.57—a possible increase of about 15%. Breaking this resistance might lead PI to the second resistance level at $0.66, representing a gain of roughly 26% from current prices. Technical indicators offer some optimism. The Relative Strength Index is at 54.16, indicating a neutral market stance. Both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $0.47, showing price stabilization. A stochastic value of 24.92 may suggest that the coin is oversold, hinting at an upcoming upward movement. If positive momentum builds, PI could surpass resistance levels and achieve significant gains. Conclusion PI shows strength, but XYZVerse stands out with its sports-meme fusion and aims for 20,000% growth in the current bull run.
