BONK developers announced in a statement that the token burn amount was set at 1 trillion tokens. This corresponds to approximately $22 million at the time of writing. BONK's market value is currently around $1.8 billion. Although the developers did not give a clear date or time, they announced a few minutes ago that they were about to reach 1 million token holders. One million holders soon Then one trillion $BONK burned — BONK!!!

It should not be forgotten that memecoins are particularly high-risk assets. In such developments, especially in the cryptocurrency market and memecoins, the expected impact may sometimes not come or may have been priced in in advance. It should also be kept in mind that the burn level is low compared to the total market value. *This is not investment advice.

The regulator has opened a new public comment window, which stalls decision-making. The latest revision mandates that responses be filed within 21 days and rebuttals within 35 days of publication in the Federal Register of the filing. The companies also had S-1 registrations with Fidelity, placing it with a Solana ETF on June 13, followed by 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary. The SEC review process has now officially reached a critical evaluation phase, with the agency seeking comments on matters touching on the products’ structure, market integrity, and investor protection systems. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said this was a largely expected delay. More recently, he cited the gradual manner in which the SEC has treated altcoin-secured or tied ETFs, citing regulatory uncertainty as a factor that has chilled broader adoption. MORE delays. @Fidelity 's Solana ETF filing was just delayed as expected. We're still waiting for some sort of movement from the SEC on a generalized digital asset ETP framework. pic.twitter.com/8m2DSdHJYV — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 7, 2025 Push for revised applications hints at progress Even after the most recent hold, the SEC seems to be gearing up toward reviewing more formally. The agency has directed the issuers to revise and refile the Solana ETF applications no later than the end of July. The revisions will also need to contain more current language related to in-kind redemption and staking, which will align with the SEC, which changed its guidance. The demand for amended filings is an indication of a more proactive regulatory approach to altcoin ETFs. According to sources, the SEC plans to rush through at least one SOL-based product before its October 10 deadline to issue a final ruling. There is some internal speculation that reviews will be completed long before that date. In June, the SEC released its initial official guidance regarding exchange-traded products that track digital assets. In parallel, there is a second regulatory document under development. It would potentially cut the ETF listing process timeline in half, bringing down the average timeframe of 200 days to approximately 75. In case of adoption, the change will represent a significant step that will be hailed by crypto ETF applicants, aiming to enter the market faster. Firms turn to workarounds amid delays Some asset managers are diverting to different alternatives as spot ETF authorizations have stalled. Recently, the REX-Osprey Sol + Staking ETF was launched between REX Financial and Osprey Funds. Although not a direct Solana ETF , the product provides exposure to SOL-linked assets and staking-related yields. The ETF shall not directly own Solana, but aims to track its economic profile by applying structured exposure to assets of the Solana ecosystem. Despite their lack of SEC regulation, this launch underscores the growing demand for Solana-related offerings. Other altcoin ETFs , such as those connected to XRP and meme-based tokens, have also been filed, but regulatory decision-making is still pending.

Donald Trump Unleashes on Elon Musk Trump had some choice words for Musk after he announced the creation of the “America Party” in a Saturday, July 5 X post. By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom. https://t.co/9K8AD04QQN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025 “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump stated in part in the July 6 social media post. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States…” Trump also took a swipe at his Democratic political opponents – who have spoken out against his latest crypto ventures in recent months – by stating that they had “lost their confidence and their minds!” “The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump added. Elon Musk Criticizes Trump’s Big Beautiful Big Trump’s commentary comes amid a growing divide between Musk and the sitting U.S. president just months after the X CEO stepped away from his White House role. Musk has openly expressed criticism of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” in recent weeks, arguing that the budget legislation would negatively impact America’s economy. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” he wrote. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Trump indicated in Sunday’s Truth Social post that the long term crypto investor was unhappy with the bill’s lack of an electric vehicle mandate. “I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate – It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had,” Trump said. “He said he had no problems with that – I was very surprised!” It remains to be seen what stance the America Party will have toward digital assets once fully fleshed out.

TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , “TON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community’s interest and enthusiasm, it’s necessary to provide clarity.” According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,” the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE’s joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country’s ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: 🇦🇪 TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. – STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS – 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA – SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED – $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION 🚀 pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, “We fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.” This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk’s xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven’t always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country’s Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a “gold card” program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project.

Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi — ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls “fairer deals.” By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House’s trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. “President Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,” Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz — CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , “Any decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.” Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on “the quality of deals, not the quantity,” but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin’s volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin’s trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC’s 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of “equal lows,” an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. “If buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,” one analyst warned. Still, there’s room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it’s the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump’s economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

This insight is powered by Outset PR , a data-driven crypto communications agency that helps digital assets gain attention through a combination of media intelligence, strategic narrative timing, and performance-driven outreach. The Market Impact This marks the first time XRP has been included in a U.S.-regulated spot ETF, following its long-running legal battles with the SEC. The inclusion legitimizes XRP in the eyes of institutional investors, reinforcing its status as a core asset in the crypto space. Through GDLC’s ETF wrapper, institutional and retail investors can now gain indirect exposure to XRP without needing to hold or custody the token themselves. This lowers the barrier to entry and may drive new capital into XRP markets. With XRP under regulatory scrutiny since 2020 due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its inclusion in a spot ETF signals a turning tide in regulatory perception. This move could influence the approval of other XRP-related financial products in the future. XRP Price Analysis and Prediction Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35. It has been on a positive trend lately. In the past week, its price saw a rise of about 5.7%. Over the past month, it climbed by nearly 7.9%. If XRP can break through the nearest resistance level of $2.43, it might aim for the $2.60 mark, which would mean a potential growth of more than ten percent from its current range. Overall, XRP appears to have a promising outlook, with support levels not too far below, suggesting a strong market interest. The recent price increase and current momentum indicate a healthy interest from investors.

You might wonder which coins truly offer potential and not just empty promises. That’s where this guide helps. We’ve looked into BlockDAG, Toncoin, Hedera, and Litecoin, four names that are grabbing attention for good reasons. Each of these is making waves because of their growth, real use cases, or strong plans for the future. Whether you’re interested in new tech, solid systems, or coins that have stood the test of time, these picks cover it all. And yes, these are some of the fastest growing cryptos worth watching right now. Keep reading to see why they are in focus today. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Growth Numbers with Key Features Already in Place BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing cryptos this year. The project is now in Batch 29, with a current price of $0.0276. But thanks to BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release promo, buyers can grab coins at a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. This brings back one more chance to jump in with a low price. So far, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $332 million and sold 23.5 billion coins. The launch price is set at $0.05, which means early buyers have already seen a 2,660% gain compared to the first batch price. What’s pushing BlockDAG ahead is not just its price. The project has over 2 million users on its mobile mining app. The X30 and X100 mining rigs will ship by July 7, with the X10 rigs coming in August. The team has also passed checks from top security firms like CertiK and Halborn. Big exchange listings are lined up, including MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. BlockDAG shows how a project can build trust while being one of the fastest growing cryptos today. 2. Toncoin: Gaining Momentum with Telegram’s Support Toncoin continues to draw attention as one of the fastest growing cryptos because of its strong link to Telegram. This popular messaging app helps Toncoin reach millions of users easily. The coin is making crypto use simple inside chats, whether for payments or bot functions. This makes its role more than just hype; Toncoin offers a real-world solution people can use now. Toncoin’s price recently touched around $7. Even with the ups and downs of the market, it has held its ground well. More upgrades and tools are coming, so Toncoin still offers a fresh chance for those looking at coins with actual use. It’s not just early excitement, it’s about growth that’s tied to real demand. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Tech Focused and Ready for Business Hedera has carved out a spot among the fastest growing cryptos by offering something different. It runs on Hashgraph, not a traditional blockchain. This tech lets it process transactions faster and with lower fees. Big names like IBM and Google support Hedera as part of its council, adding to its strength. HBAR is trading at around $0.075. Its steady price moves and real-world uses make it stand out. You won’t see sudden price spikes like with meme coins. But Hedera’s true power is in its steady progress. It’s used in areas like identity and supply chains, showing its value beyond just trading. This mix of tech and trusted partnerships keeps Hedera on lists of top coins to check out. 4. Litecoin: Longtime Player Still in the Game Litecoin proves that older coins can still be part of the fastest growing cryptos list. It’s often called digital silver and is known for faster, cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin. People still use it for payments, and it’s accepted widely across exchanges and by merchants. Right now, Litecoin is priced near $73. It’s showing strength again after earlier dips this year. Events like halvings keep Litecoin in the news, but what really keeps it going is trust. Even with newer projects on the scene, Litecoin holds a spot as a solid choice for those who want reliability. Wrap Up! When you look at the fastest growing cryptos, these four projects offer a good mix of what’s working today. BlockDAG offers big growth potential with a rare low entry price during its promo window. Toncoin and Hedera show how crypto can blend with daily tools and business systems. Litecoin proves that being around for years doesn’t mean a coin can’t still deliver. If you’re thinking about getting into crypto or adding to your list, these fastest growing cryptos give you options that are trending for good reasons. Focus on what’s growing for the right reasons and not just hype. BlockDAG’s current low price, Toncoin’s app ties, Hedera’s smart tech, and Litecoin’s steady path are all worth keeping an eye on right now.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining momentum. This scenario raises an intriguing question: which cryptocurrency will make the next big move? Readers will find an in-depth analysis of the current market trends and potential breakout opportunities for both BTC and ETH in this article. This spotlight analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , the leading crypto-native agency that blends media intelligence, strategic timing, and results-driven outreach to help web3 projects break through the noise and capture market attention at the moments that count. Bitcoin Eyes Upward Movement with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price hovers between a bit over $106K and $111K. Since last month, the value has increased by nearly 4%, showing signs of positive momentum. Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin testing the resistance level just under $114K, with further potential to reach nearly $119K if this barrier is crossed. This would mean a possible increase of around 12% from the lower price range. The coin's recent six-month gain of over 11% hints at long-term strength. Support levels at around $103K and $97K help cushion any downside. With such dynamic moves, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a growth opportunity. Ethereum on a Steady Climb: Will It Break New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently moving between two thousand four hundred and nineteen dollars to slightly over two thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. It's been on a gentle rise over the past week with a near two percent increase. Analysts see it challenging the next resistance level at two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars. If it manages to surge past this, the next target to watch is around the three thousand fifty-dollar mark. If achieved, this could mean an increase of about fourteen to twenty-four percent from its current range. As the crypto scene buzzes with anticipation, investors maintain a watchful eye on these key levels.

We don’t want an emperor”. Lula rejected any suggestion of U.S. economic dominance, Reuters reported. The comment came as the BRICS summit wrapped up in Rio de Janeiro on Monday, where leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa pushed back against President Donald Trump’s threat of extra tariffs on their countries. They made clear that emerging economies intend to chart their own course in global trade. Trump’s warning arrived late on Sunday, just as his administration was finalizing a series of trade deals ahead of a July 9 deadline for imposing so-called “retaliatory tariffs.” U.S. officials have said these measures could target any nation whose policies are judged hostile to American interests. A source from the U.S. told Reuters that Washington does not aim to immediately impose a further 10% levy on BRICS imports. Instead, the option would only be used if a country implements what the administration labels measures viewed as unfriendly to U.S. interests. Lula said the BRICS bloc comprises countries pursuing a different approach to the global economic order. He suggested that the desire for change is what unsettles traditional powers. “This is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from the economic perspective” he explained to journalists. In February, Trump escalated the rhetoric by warning of “full-scale duties” if BRICS moved to weaken the U.S. dollar’s role in global markets. In response, Brazil’s BRICS presidency dropped earlier talks on a shared currency, an idea some members had floated the previous year. Brazilian President calls for a slow shift from the dollar in trade On Monday, Lula again called for reducing dependence on the dollar in trade settlements. “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through the dollar,” he said. He added that any change must be gradual and coordinated through discussions among central banks until new arrangements are solidified. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, said that the bloc does not want to single out one power. He was confident that there could still be a trade agreement between the U.S. and South Africa. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that tariffs “should not be used as a tool for coercion and pressuring”. She stressed that the BRICS framework promotes mutually beneficial collaboration and is not aimed at any particular nation. A Kremlin spokesperson echoed that view, saying Russia’s cooperation with BRICS is based on a shared global outlook and “will never be directed against third countries.” India stayed silent towards Trump’s threat. Indonesia’s coordinating minister for economic affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, who attended the summit in Rio, was scheduled to fly to Washington on Monday to lead discussions on U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, which joined as a partner after its 24 % tariffs were removed, said it maintains independent economic policies and does not align itself on ideological grounds. With forums such as the G7 and G20 hampered by divisions and Washington’s “America First” approach, BRICS has positioned itself as a forum for multilateral diplomacy amid rising trade conflicts and regional tensions. In a combined statement on Sunday, summit leaders condemned the recent bombing of Iran and warned that growing tariff barriers threaten the stability of world trade, a veiled critique of U.S. policy. BRICS first came together in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India and China. South Africa joined in 2010, and last year the group expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has accepted an invitation to full membership but is attending this summit only as a partner. More than 30 nations have expressed interest in joining BRICS as either full members or partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The latest blow came just two days after Elon announced plans to create a new political party, a decision that’s now rattling Wall Street and hammering Tesla’s valuation again for a second consecutive session. Elon said Saturday the party’s goal would be to flip “2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” claiming that would give him enough leverage to decide which laws pass. “Enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” Elon wrote. Traders didn’t seem to share his optimism. Shares of Tesla plunged immediately after markets opened Monday, dragging the Nasdaq deeper into red as investors digested the consequences of their CEO turning into a full-time political actor. Elon Musk stands by his decision as Tesla sinks Elon’s renewed focus on politics comes as US equities take broader hits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 400 points Monday, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9%. The entire stock market took a hit after Trump announced new tariffs that will go into effect August 1. The penalties target 14 countries, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia, across a wide range of imports. Trump’s administration said the new tariffs would be just the first batch. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that more announcements are coming this week. She added that Trump will sign an executive order extending the tariff implementation deadline to August 1, replacing his original, earlier date. Dow futures dropped 87 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.16% and 0.15%, respectively, just hours before the cash markets opened Monday. With all that background noise, Elon’s latest headline-grabbing play couldn’t have landed at a worse time. Danny Ives, who leads global tech research at Wedbush Securities, said in a client note that the decision is only making things worse. “Very simply Elon diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Danny wrote Sunday. He added that while Elon’s loyalists will back him no matter what, “there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Elon keeps heading down the political track.” On Sunday, Trump told reporters that Elon’s plan to launch a party was “ridiculous” and said the Tesla CEO had gone “completely off the rails.” Market strategists still think the sell-off may be temporary. Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, told CNBC’s Closing Bell that confusion is playing a big role. “If you go through the details, I don’t even know if anybody understands the difference between what was announced today, what was there previously, and if it will actually be implemented, and which companies it actually impacts,” Parker said Monday. He added that it could just be a breather before earnings season. “So, I think it’s just a little bit of selling as we got the highs, and kind of recalibrating before July earnings season,” he said. “But I don’t think this is the sign of a new regime at all.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It has already launched a cryptoasset named Polaris Share (POLA), which it operates via its subsidiary Polaris Share Tech. Polaris Share (POLA) prices in KRW over the past 12 months.

The media outlet quoted a Polaris Office spokesperson as saying: “Stablecoins are the starting point of the web3 transition. They are part of a digital infrastructure that connects data, payments, and contracts. In the future, we will create a range of new markets, as well as a knowledge-sharing platform centered around POLAKRW.” More South Korean Banks Eye Stablecoin Launches Busan Ilbo , meanwhile, reported that the BNK Financial Group has also applied for 25 stablecoin trademarks.

Contrary to assumptions that he received tokens as compensation for his foundational role in the project, Schwartz confirmed that he acquired his XRP holdings independently from the open market. Early Purchase Confirmed at $0.006 In a recent interaction with the XRP community, Schwartz disclosed that he bought XRP for $0.006 per token. His comments came in response to a post from Stedas , a well-known community figure, who suggested that XRP veterans, often referred to as “OGs”, entered the market when the token was trading around $0.50. Schwartz’s response underlined that his entry was at a significantly earlier and lower valuation. $0.006 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 5, 2025 This clarification also aligns with statements Schwartz has made in the past. In earlier interviews, he explained that he did not receive XRP as part of Ripple’s initial token distribution. Instead, he opted to take Ripple stock, a decision he has publicly reflected on given XRP’s superior liquidity. Schwartz also mentioned that during the early days of Ripple, he was offered the choice to receive his salary in XRP but chose to take payments in cash for immediate financial needs. He emphasized that acquiring XRP from exchanges was always an option available to him. XRP’s Long-Term Price Action and Market Behavior Between 2022 and late 2025, XRP traded near the $0.50 mark for extended periods, providing several windows of opportunity for accumulation at that price level. However, the token eventually broke out above that range during a significant market rally in November 2025, which coincided with a broader uptick across the crypto space. Following this breakout, XRP surpassed both the $0.50 and $1 levels and has more recently maintained a price of around $2.28. During this price surge, many new investors entered the market. Still, long-term holders who purchased during its extended consolidation phase have seen significantly larger gains. Schwartz’s early acquisition at $0.006 places him among the earliest adopters with one of the lowest known entry points. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP at $10 In April, Schwartz revealed that at one point, his XRP balance peaked at 26 million tokens. Although the exact timing of these purchases is unclear, if he acquired the entire amount at his reported entry price of $0.006, the total investment would have amounted to just $156,000. At the current trading price of $2.28 , those 26 million tokens would be valued at approximately $58.5 million. This represents an unrealized gain of over $58 million, assuming the holdings were maintained in full. However, Schwartz has previously stated that he has not sold significant amounts of his XRP, though his current holdings are not publicly known. If XRP were to reach $10, as forecasted by analysts such as EGRAG based on technical indicators, the value of Schwartz’s peak holdings could climb to $260 million, assuming he still holds the full 26 million XRP. While projections vary, Schwartz’s early investment provides a compelling case study of long-term value appreciation in the cryptocurrency sector.

47755541,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=761999,1751931021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47755541.jpeg,Chinese exporters crushed under the weight of rare earth export controls,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-exporters-losers-china-rare-earth/,"China’s dominance in the rare earth supply chain has historically given it leverage over global markets. Its recent export restrictions, however, are having a lasting negative effect on the sector. Chinese magnet producers are now facing piling inventories while also dealing with a failing economy and weakened EV demand. China’s rare earth export restrictions , which were implemented in April as a retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have dealt a heavy blow to the country’s domestic magnet manufacturers, many of whom were already contending with a weak economy and declining demand for electric vehicle (EV) makers. Rare earth magnets are essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and a host of other high-tech applications, and China produces around 90% of the world’s supply. Chinese exporters crushed under the weight of rare earth export controls Public filings from the 11 largest listed Chinese magnet producers show that exports accounted for 18% to 50% of their 2024 revenues, which shows the sector’s reliance on international customers. The short-term fallout has been severe on the industry. Magnet exports have dropped by 75% within two months of the restrictions, and some global automakers were also forced to pause production. In the meantime, inventory was piling up in domestic warehouses as producers waited on export licenses, according to Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange, a state-backed trading platform. “Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends—disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” Ellie Saklatvala, the head of metal pricing at Argus, said. Some small and mid-sized producers responded by cutting production by 15% in April and May, according to industry insiders. But for many, this was not enough to stave off what the Baotou exchange described as a “crisis” for local magnet makers. Long-term uncertainty despite rare earth control easing Even though the U.S. and China announced a deal on June 27 to reverse the export restrictions , the damage has already been done. The Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange warned that any resumption of normal export activity would take time, stating that inventory levels remain high and licensing requirements continue to delay shipments. “Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals—such as antimony—it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” Argus’ Saklatvala said. Export curbs on germanium and antimony imposed in 2023 and 2024 still haven’t fully recovered. Europe is still receiving only a fraction of the antimony volumes seen before the controls. This has already impacted lead-acid battery production, particularly in the automotive sector. In the case of rare earths, the challenge is compounded by the specialized nature of magnet products. Many of them are tailor-made for specific clients and cannot be easily resold within China, forcing companies to store finished goods while they await the necessary licenses. Four industry sources told Reuters that the licensing process was both opaque and burdensome, further complicating the recovery efforts. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said. “The large amounts of information now required by licensing authorities represent a permanent change for the industry and will add delays and costs for producers.” Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co. noted in its April annual report that deteriorating international conditions could cut into export revenue. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had obtained export licenses and that production remained normal, but refrained from making detailed comments until its upcoming financial filings. Industry analysts and insiders speculate that the increased pressure could spur consolidation among the hundreds of manufacturers that populate China’s rare earth sector , which may not be a bad outcome for Beijing. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” said Abraham. Two rare earth magnet manufacturers told Reuters anonymously that they expect significant revenue declines this year, although they didn’t offer exact forecasts. “The impact on our export business will be huge, although it’s hard to tell exactly how much loss we will suffer,” said one of the producers. In April, share prices of listed magnet producers fell sharply following the export restrictions, but they have recovered somewhat in recent months. According to Cory Combs, the head of critical mineral research at consultancy Trivium China, the rebound is not based on any tangible improvement in the business outlook. “I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” Combs said. And because many magnet makers are privately held, public share prices only reveal part of the story. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-heating-up-nvt-golden-cross-hints-at-potential-local-top/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently – on June 16 – it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn’t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don’t rush to exit – historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC’s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action ​​The NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing? For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a “deceptive setup,” warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode forecasts BTC’s short-term peak at $117,000. At press time, BTC trades at $108,204, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The sale will be done on both Gate.com and on the site itself, Pump.fun, with 150 billion tokens sold at $0.004 each. This is 15 percent of the total supply, amounting to up to 4 billion in the project. According to a page on Gate crypto exchange, which appeared to have been deleted after mass social media commentary, the sale will be on a first-come, first-served basis. It will be held over 72 hours or until the allocation is exhausted. The buyer will not face any purchase limit, but must also hit a minimum. Separate announcements on the details of distribution and trading will be made on official channels. 🚨 @pumpdotfun Public Token Sale: All You Need to Know – Token: $PUMP – Total Supply: 1 trillion – Date: July 12 – July 15 (3 days) – Tokens for Sale: 150 billion – Sale Price: $0.004 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $4 billion pic.twitter.com/8jijGWgVBp — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 7, 2025 “For individual subscriptions, as long as the quota is sufficient, only a minimum purchase amount is required and there is no upper limit,” the FAQ page noted. The PUMP token is the utility token of the expanding Pump.fun ecosystem. Pumpfun has established itself as a frictionless market that lists tokens on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to mint and trade freely without any costs or programming skills. Every newly minted token entails a standard fair launch model. Pumpfun offers zero pre-mines and zero team distribution, combined with zero trading taxes, making it attractive to traders and memecoin developers alike. Revenue falls 92% from January peak as user interest declines In spite of its scheduled token launch, Pump.fun has suffered a significant drop in its protocol income and fee earnings. According to on-chain metrics provided by DeFi Llama, daily revenue dropped to $533,410 on July 6. Fees generated were less than $922,890- a daily low since March 2025. The platform generated a high of $7.07 million in revenue and fees on January 23. This is a 92% drop in revenue and 86% in fees. Despite the temporary surge in late March that saw fees rebound to $6.6 million, revenue did not pass $2.05 million across the same interval. This trend of weakness can also be found in monthly data. Pump.fun recorded a combined fee and revenue of $137.12 million in January. In June, the fee totals fell to $64.47 million, or only about half the high mark. June revenues were only $39.08 million, or less than 30% of the January high. According to Dune Analytics, as of July, less than 0.01 percent of addresses had generated more than $1 million in profits on the platform, with more than 60% of users registering losses. Recently, Pump.fun has received renewed competition in the form of BONKs meme coin launchpad, LetsBonk, backflipping Pump.fun in tokens created for the first time on Monday. Notable meme tokens such as Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) were generated on Pump.fun, and other previously popular tokens are generated through the platform, such as Moo Deng and Chill Guy.

FCA Exposes London Crypto Scheme Between February 2017 and June 2019, Bedi and Mavanga defrauded at least 65 investors out of a total of £1,541,799, nearly equivalent to $2,100,000 USD. According to a November 2024 press release , Bedi and Mavanga cold-called consumers to direct them to a website offering crypto investment opportunities. In reality, the site and its supposed high return cryptocurrency offerings were a sham for their own financial gain. Bedi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and money laundering offences at a May 2023 hearing. Meanwhile, Mavanga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and possession of false identification documents with an improper intention in June 2023. ‘Bedi and Mavanga lured investors with promises of high returns on crypto investments, but their schemes were nothing but a callous scam,” Smart said in a statement at the time. “If you’re contacted out of the blue about an investment opportunity that sounds too good to be true, then it probably is,” he continued. “If you’re in any doubt – don’t invest.” The post London Duo Jailed for $2 Million Crypto Scheme appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|FCA|UK|UK Crypto,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-07 23:47:38
47756651,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762008,1751932207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47756651.jpeg,China’s central bank is quietly surveying financial institutions about the U.S. dollar’s weakness,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-pboc-poking-about-dollar-weakness/,"The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has reportedly reached out to financial institutions in recent days to assess market sentiment surrounding the ongoing weakness of the U.S. dollar. According to people familiar with the matter cited by Reuters, the PBOC sent out an informal survey last week, probing for opinions on why the dollar has been slipping, how long the trend might last, and what it could mean for the Chinese yuan. The act signals that Beijing may be growing uneasy about the yuan’s recent gains against the faltering dollar and the potential knock-on effects on Chinese exports. The yuan has steadied while the dollar slumps The U.S. dollar has had a bruising 2025. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, has fallen 11% so far this year, its worst start since 1973. Since early April when President Donald Trump announced a broad freeze on tariffs, the dollar has tumbled 6.6% as markets began pricing in looser U.S. trade and fiscal policies. In contrast, China’s yuan has held relatively steady, gaining about 1.3% over the same period. That’s good news for consumers and importers, but not so much for Chinese exporters who suddenly find their goods more expensive on the global market, just when they need every edge in a slowing economy. The dollar’s decline has now put the PBOC in a delicate spot . On the one hand, a stronger yuan helps reduce imported inflation and reinforces Beijing’s image as a steady hand in global finance. On the other, it could squeeze manufacturers and exporters, especially as the country tries to revive growth after a bumpy few years. The PBOC has long preferred stability over sharp moves, and its governor, Pan Gongsheng said earlier this year that keeping the yuan “reasonably stable” is essential for both domestic and global confidence. The survey could be a precursor to policy action The survey alone doesn’t signal immediate policy change, but it could be a first step. In similar situations in the past, the PBOC has used subtle levers to manage the yuan’s value without direct intervention. In April , the central bank reportedly nudged state-owned banks to curb dollar buying, a move many saw as a quiet way of putting a floor under the yuan. Most analysts believe the PBOC is unlikely to intervene unless the yuan strengthens dramatically. But the timing of this latest outreach has raised eyebrows. It comes just days before the expiration of Trump’s 90-day global tariff pause, set to end on Wednesday, July 10, and just a month ahead of the expiration of separate U.S. tariffs on Chinese tech imports.

The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins. According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we’re breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024. Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC . “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we’ll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. “The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it’s going to be providing a big move. Given that we’ve hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we’ll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor ( TAO ). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target. “TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

If Bitcoin continues to double in value each year until 2030, it could drive substantial gains across the crypto sector, including for XRP. This projection, though ambitious, aligns with some market forecasts and long-term bullish expectations. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $108,000 . Should it sustain a doubling pattern annually, it would reach $216,000 in 2026, $432,000 in 2027, and by 2029, surpass $1.7 million. By 2030, its value could climb to roughly $3.45 million, representing a cumulative increase of around 3,100%. This outlook corresponds with previous predictions, such as one from Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer, who suggested Bitcoin could hit $3.5 million by the decade’s end. If XRP mirrors this percentage growth, the implications could be significant. With XRP currently valued at $2.28, a 3,100% increase would place its price at approximately $70.72 per token. While this is a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the potential upside should market dynamics remain favorable. XRP’s Correlation With Bitcoin and Market Behavior Although XRP and Bitcoin are different in utility and structure, their market prices often move in tandem. Over the past month, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has generally followed Bitcoin’s market direction. There was a brief exception from June 25 to June 28, when XRP experienced a sharp drop while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. However, since then, both assets have resumed similar movement patterns. This price correlation has both advantages and risks. When Bitcoin experiences upward momentum, XRP often benefits . Conversely, Bitcoin downturns tend to weigh on XRP’s value as well. In recent months, despite periods of divergence, XRP has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s trend, particularly during consolidation phases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs in the past five months, altcoins have remained mostly stagnant. This divergence has contributed to an increase in Bitcoin market dominance. However, some analysts anticipate a shift in this trend soon, as altcoins are expected to regain traction during what is commonly referred to as “altcoin season.” Outlook for XRP Amid a Possible Altcoin Recovery XRP, being one of the top altcoins by market capitalization, is well-positioned to benefit from any broader altcoin recovery. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins tend to follow, though often with a delay. If such a recovery materializes, XRP could see renewed momentum and price growth. If Bitcoin’s value increases dramatically over the next five years and XRP continues to follow its market trajectory, a substantial rise in XRP’s price is conceivable. Although market predictions are inherently speculative, the long-term potential remains compelling, especially for investors seeking exposure to top-tier altcoins influenced by Bitcoin’s performance.

Mark Zuckerberg’s mobile-based Threads, launched as a simpler alternative to Musk’s X, reached 115.1 million active users regularly on phones last month, according to Similarweb data reported by TechCrunch . That figure places it just behind 32 million daily users on X mobile in the same timeframe. Even more striking, Threads has climbed 127.8 percent compared with June last year, while X’s daily mobile count has dropped by 15.2 percent over those twelve months. Yet the story shifts when desktop visits are taken into account. X still leads on web browsers, with almost 145.8 million daily desktop visits in June, TechCrunch notes. By contrast, Threads managed only 6.9 million desktop views. This split likely reflects user habits: long-time Twitter fans often log in on computers, whereas Instagram users, and now Threads users, tend to open the app briefly on their phones, scroll through a few posts, and then close it. Bluesky still remains a tiny competitor to Threads and X For those curious about Bluesky, the smaller newcomer also saw a spike but remains tiny in comparison. TechCrunch reports that Bluesky’s daily active user count rose by 372.5 percent year after year, reaching around 4.1 million. In total, about 37 million people have registered on the platform so far. Despite its rapid percentage growth, Bluesky is still a minor player next to the giants. However, it does have potential in the long term. And that is less related with new surges of users who appear on the platform only to protest about the policies of another network, and more related to Bluesky’s push towards becoming a more open ecosystem. On the other hand, picking sides between Musk’s X and Zuckerberg’s Threads can feel like a lose-lose decision. While Zuckerberg hasn’t stoked as much controversy as Musk, he did indirectly back and support Musk’s push on X at one point. In the meantime, Threads’ rapid growth shows that Zuckerberg can compete by offering a cleaner, mobile-focused space, even if it doesn’t yet match X’s desktop stronghold. At the end of the day, many users may keep both apps on their phones, dipping into Threads for quick updates and relying on X when they want live-breaking news and constant conversation. The competition is far from over, but for now, Threads is showing that it can at least run alongside X in the race for daily attention.

This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-another-460-run-rare-fiat-signal-returned/,"The Global Money Supply has just hit a rare yearly growth rate of 9%. Here’s what followed for Bitcoin the last few times this signal appeared. Global Money Supply Is Currently Sharply Going Up In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about the latest trend in the Global Money Supply. The “Global Money Supply” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Supply Most Centralized Among Top Coins—62% Held By Just 10 Whales Below is the chart shared by Edwards that shows the data for the year-on-year growth in the metric: As displayed in the graph, the metric’s value has recently been witnessing an increase, indicating that fiat supply is going up. “Central banks are flooding the market with fiat money,” notes the analyst. Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. “This is extreme and rare,” says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking. Related Reading: Bitcoin Latest Rally Backed By Stronger Purchasing Power: Report Interestingly, the Apparent Demand indicator has remained positive for Bitcoin even after these transactions, as Edwards has explained in another X post. This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). “Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand is still bullish,” says the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,400, up 0.7% over the last week.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Fund manager Jeff Dyment of Saphira Group wants you to zoom out and stop sweating the short-term charts. His thesis: Data points that suggest institutional bitcoin (BTC) buying is losing steam miss the bigger picture. In a note shared with CoinDesk, Dyment argues that fears of fading institutional demand for bitcoin are overblown, rooted in narrow snapshots of the market. Yes, ETF and corporate purchases have cooled recently – Michael Saylor's Strategy bought just 16,000 BTC last month, down sharply from December’s 171,000 BTC haul. But this, Dyment insists, is not a sign of decline. It’s a natural ebb in what he calls a “cyclical wave” of adoption. “Institutional flows often come in waves rather than a steady linear increase,” Dyment wrote. “Short-term demand fluctuations in the spot market are minor ripples on what is, in fact, a rising tide of institutional engagement.” Dyment points to the addition of 51 new corporate BTC treasuries in the first half of 2025 alone, equal to the total from 2018 to 2022 combined, and a 375% year-over-year increase in corporate BTC buying. Public companies now hold 848,902 BTC, or approximately 4% of the total supply, with Q2 2025 alone seeing 131,000 BTC added to their balance sheets. He also highlights the explosive growth of Bitcoin ETFs as further evidence of deepening institutional participation. BlackRock’s IBIT fund, now the largest in the world, holds 699,000 BTC, more than 3.3% of total supply, after becoming the fastest-growing ETF in history. U.S. spot ETFs have collectively captured approximately 1.25 million BTC , or roughly 6% of the total supply, in just 18 months since their launch, he points out in the note. Dyment's thesis is finding echoes in the options market. In QCP Capital's recent note, the Singapore-based fund pointed to whales that are continuing to build exposure to upside risk, snapping up September $130K BTC calls and holding $115K/$140K call spreads. “Vols remain pinned near historical lows, but a decisive breach of the $110K resistance could spark a renewed volatility bid,” QCP wrote in a Monday note. So while bears may point to stagnant spot flows and the nearly empty mempool as signs of fatigue , Dyment argues those are just surface-level ripples. Underneath, the tide is rising, and Wall Street, with its trillions upon trillions of regulated capital, is hungry for crypto. It's just not going to come all at once. BTQ Pushes Quantum-Safe Framework for Stablecoins BTQ Technologies has introduced the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN), a framework designed to help banks, payment firms, and digital asset platforms future-proof stablecoin issuance against threats from quantum computing. In a press release , BTQ detailed how the system could support quantum-secure versions of popular stablecoin models, including JPMorgan’s proposed USD deposit token (JPMD), by upgrading privileged actions like minting and burning with dual cryptographic signatures (ECDSA and Falcon-512), while preserving compatibility with existing token standards, workflows, and wallets. The launch comes as the stablecoin market surpasses $225 billion and lawmakers push for regulation with an eye on cybersecurity. The GENIUS Act, currently advancing in the U.S. Congress, would formalize federal standards for fiat-backed stablecoins and encourage quantum-safe architecture. BTQ, which has worked with NIST for over a decade, aims to shape those standards and position QSSN as critical infrastructure. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin fell 1.02% from July 6 at 22:00 to July 7 at 21:00, testing key support at $107,519.64 amid heavy selling, before staging a V-shaped recovery off $107,800 as on-chain data showed strong support clusters at $106,738 and $98,566 held by 1.68 million addresses, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis bot. ETH: ETH rose 1.67% amid volatile trading, swinging nearly 3% between $2,529 and $2,604 as support at $2,530 held firm, institutional inflows topped $1.1 billion, and above-average volume marked both the surge and subsequent sell-off. Gold: Gold dipped on a stronger dollar but rebounded on tariff-driven safe-haven demand, with central bank buying and de-dollarization fueling forecasts of a rally toward $4,000. S&P 500: Stocks fell Monday as Trump announced new tariffs on imports from seven countries, sending the S&P 500 down 0.79% to 6,229.98. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose despite Trump announcing steep U.S. tariffs on 14 trading partners, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.36% as duties of up to 40% were outlined for countries including South Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand.

The project is fast-gaining attention amongst investors and analysts alike as it powers through its presale. The only close match to the expected returns of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is Bitcoin (BTC). From less than $1 over a decade ago, Bitcoin (BTC) has emerged as a major force in the crypto sector and is now valued at over $107k. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a unique opportunity in the crypto market today to rekindle the massive returns that early BTC investors experienced. One of the main factors that is working in its favor is that it is built on the solid foundation of utility. In the crypto market of 2025, the push towards utility continues to gain momentum as hype-based meme coins lose out. Let us take a close look at MUTM tokens and why they could deliver the life-changing returns you have been looking for. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a DeFi lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit their assets into the protocol’s liquidity pools to receive interest. Interests are calculated based on an annual percentage yield (APY). MUTM Presale Powers Past $11.8 Million The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a massive success so far. It has raised over $11.8 million from around 12,800 unique buyers. These figures are expected to continue rising geometrically as word of the success of the presale spreads. Tokens in the current phase 5 of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the next phase of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. This price increase is something you do not want to be caught up in. The reason for this is that the token price increase will wipe out the massive 50% discount currently available to buyers in the current phase 5. So far, many investors have rushed to capitalize on this massive discount, with over 65% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 already sold out. The pace has been blazing, with the tokens selling out barely a month after they launched. At the current pace, analysts rightly assess that the tokens will have sold out by the end of July. That means you need to act fast and direct capital into the presale in anticipation of the expected returns. MUTM Tokens Could Rise By 53x According to the latest estimates by analysts, the price of MUTM tokens could rise by 53x when they go live. That means if you purchase $1400 worth of tokens in the current phase, you could see your investment grow to over $74,000. It is worth noting that there is no upper cap on how much you can invest in the presale. Consequently, you could make some truly life-changing returns with the MUTM token presale. One reason why there is so much optimism for MUTM tokens is the expected crypto market rally. The crypto market is currently going through a consolidation phase, which is expected to pass quickly. Already, Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of retracing its most recent all-time high, which signals a massive breakout is on the way. The best way to capitalize on these expected returns is to hold MUTM tokens at the current low price and await this massive wave to come and take you to the top. Another reason for the optimism for the MUTM token price is that the team plans to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. Unlike other projects like Pi Network, where the team made the community wait for years, the Mutuum Finance developer team will hit the ground running. This launch is expected to stir up excitement in the crypto community and provide a great opportunity for feedback from future users. One of the direct effects of the beta launch is that it will push doubters to act and get their MUTM tokens. This fresh inflow of capital could push the price to new highs. By joining the presale now while there is still a massive 50% discount, you ensure that you get the full benefits of this expected surge. CertiK Partnership Mutuum Finance has recently announced that they are partnering with CertiK on a massive $50,000 USDT bug bounty program. This program will reward security experts who help identify vulnerabilities in the protocol and the overall ecosystem. To ensure rewards are distributed fairly, the program is split into four tiers of critical, major, minor, and low. Those who identify the most pressing issues on the protocol will receive the biggest rewards. Whales in the crypto market, who are known for their due diligence, an ability to spot massive gains early, have already secured their token in the MUTM token presale. With tokens available at a 50% discount, this represents your best opportunity to copy the whales. However, the window is fast closing, and over 65% of the tokens available at the discount have already sold out. If you fail to act fast enough, you will have to contend with a massive increase in price in the next phase.

The fund's investment strategy and asset origination is led by Qatar National Bank while DMZ Finance provides the technology underpinning its digital architecture, the companies said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. The regulatory approval serves as evidence of Dubai and the Middle East's growing role as a hub for compliant digital asset finance, particularly in the tokenization market. According to a joint report by Ripple and BCG, the global market for tokenized RWAs is projected to surge to $18.9 trillion by 2033, with jurisdictions like Dubai and Doha emerging as early leaders of this transformation. ""As the Middle East rapidly emerges as a global hub for financial innovation, the successful deployment of QCDT further consolidates QNB's leadership in the regional financial ecosystem and reflects our long-term vision to shape the next generation of financial infrastructure,"" Silas Lee, CEO of QNB Singapore, said in the statement. The fund, launched to bring traditional assets, such as U.S. Treasuries, on-chain, aims to serve a broad spectrum of institutional applications, including bank-eligible collateral, stablecoin backing, exchange reserves and Web3 payment infrastructure. With its regulatory compliance, yield stability and on-chain transparency, the backers say they expect it to catalyze adoption across both financial and crypto-native institutions. “Tokenization of real-world assets is no longer experimental — it is foundational,"" said Nathan Ma, co-founder and chairman of DMZ Finance. ""Our goal at DMZ is to provide the connective tissue between traditional markets and the digital asset ecosystem, particularly in regions ready for innovation.” DMZ Finance is a real-world asset tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure platform.

DMZ. has established a strategic partnership with Qatar National Bank, the largest bank in the Middle East and Africa to jointly advance the integration of asset tokenization into the regional financial system.

The price is trading below $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $108,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $106,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $108,500 resistance. BTC cleared many hurdles near $109,000 to start a decent increase but it failed to clear $110,000. A high was formed at $109,700 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a move below the $109,200 and $108,500 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $108,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.

It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,674 low. The first key resistance is near the $108,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,674 low.

According to several analysts, the cryptocurrency is set to re-test previous highs as it completes a key bullish price pattern. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $20-$30 — Elliott Wave Theory Holds The Key At the time of writing, the XRP price trades at $2.33.

Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview XRP Price Poised For Further Gains Analyst Ali Martinez has been following the XRP price performance. As seen on the chart below, the cryptocurrency is close to completing an inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the cryptocurrency successfully completes this pattern, the analyst believes that it can achieve a breakout to the $2.6 area. In that sense, traders should closely monitor any bullish price action close to the $2.35 area, and an hourly close above this level as potential confirmation. XRP Price close to completing an inverted head and shoulders pattern hinting at further gains. Source: Ali Martinez via X Last week, Martinez pointed at a similar breakout as the XRP price trended around the $2.2 level. However, at that time, the cryptocurrency failed to achieve the $2.35 breakout and continued trading in a tight channel between this level and $2.13. A separate analyst believes that XRP is close to a rally and placed the target above Martinez’s claiming that the cryptocurrency could hit $2.69 on short timeframes. For this analyst, a breakout above $2.4 holds the key to future gains. The analyst stated: $XRP strength is telling. Something is brewing What’s Behind the Momentum? The XRP price positive performance could be attributed to the massive inflow of capital coming into its ecosystem. A report from CoinShares claims that the total Asset under Management for cryptocurrencies hit a high of $188 billion, and $1 billion just over the past week. XRP has seen $335 million in year-to-date inflows, and a $10.6 million inflow over the past week. Several analysts believe these inflows represent bullish expectations for the cryptocurrency as Ripple is close to securing a banking license from the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

Bitcoin slipped to the $107,500 region on Monday but has now recovered and currently trades above $108k. Institutional demand continues to be Bitcoin’s primary driver and could empower it to rally higher over the coming days and weeks. Bitcoin stays above $108k despite renewed tariff talks It’s the start of the new week, and tariff talks are back. On Monday, President Trump announced that the United States has set a 25% tariff against South Korea and Japan starting August 1. The president also revealed a 25% levy against Kazakhstan and Malaysia, 30% against South Africa, and 40% for Myanmar and Laos. Furthermore, Trump threatened additional tariffs on countries aligning with the policies of the BRICS. The announcement saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $108k, but the leading cryptocurrency has since bounced back and could rally higher soon. Bitcoin’s resilience can be attributed to increasing institutional demand. On Monday, Japanese firm Metaplanet added over 2k bitcoins to its balance sheet for $239 million. Furthermore, recent data by SoSoValue revealed that US-listed spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded over $769 million in inflows last week. These figures suggest that institutional investors continue to demand Bitcoin, and this could be a catalyst for a price surge in the medium to long term. Bitcoin price forecast; technical strength hints at new highs The BTC/USD 4-hour chart remains bullish as buyers remain in control. The pair is also efficient, suggesting that liquidity on the downside has been swept and Bitcoin could be preparing for another leg up. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $108,040, down by less than 1% in the last 24 hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 52 indicates that Bitcoin could experience buying pressure soon, while the MACD lines are still within the positive territory. BTC seems to be currently consolidating tightly around $110,000, just beneath overhead resistance. A decisive move above the all-time high price of $111k in the short term could see Bitcoin target $120k, setting a new all-time high in the process. Analysts still expect Bitcoin to touch $150k in this cycle, and this could be possible if BTC breaks out and hits $120k. However, failure to break out from this consolidation area could see Bitcoin retest the support and Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) level at $105,328. This level could serve as a springboard for Bitcoin to rally higher. However, if the bulls fail to take advantage of this, BTC could drop to the next major support level at $98k. Bitcoin’s short-term performance depends on institutional demand for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the renewed tariff talks could play a significant role in how the broader crypto market performs over the next few weeks.

Ruoming Pang, a distinguished engineer and head of Apple’s foundation models team, is leaving the company to join Meta’s newly formed superintelligence group , according to sources familiar with the matter. Pang, who joined Apple in 2021 from Alphabet, had been overseeing a team of roughly 100 engineers responsible for its large language models that underpin “Apple Intelligence” features across its devices. Meta lures Apple’s AI chief with multimillion-dollar offer amid talent war To secure Pang, Meta reportedly offered a compensation package worth tens of millions of dollars annually. The move adds to a growing list of high-profile AI talent Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has poached recently, including Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang, entrepreneur Daniel Gross, and ex-GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. On Monday, Meta also brought on Yuanzhi Li, formerly of OpenAI, and Anton Bakhtin from the Claude developer Anthropic, continuing a hiring spree that has seen AI talent from leading labs snap up. While Meta declined to comment, Apple, Pang, OpenAI, and Anthropic have not responded to requests for comment. Meta has declared AI its top priority , with Zuckerberg deeply involved in building out the company’s AI unit. He’s known to personally recruit engineers, hosting them at his homes in Silicon Valley and Lake Tahoe. The company recently reorganized its AI division to concentrate on “superintelligence” — AI systems capable of matching or surpassing human-level cognitive tasks — and has committed tens of billions of dollars this year toward AI infrastructure, including chips and data centers. Apple’s AI division faces internal struggles as morale dips and departures mount Pang’s departure comes at a time of internal friction at Apple. Although his team’s foundation models are used in Apple Intelligence features such as Genmoji, email summarization, and the revamped Siri , the company has been exploring third-party AI solutions. Apple has held talks with both OpenAI and Anthropic to power future Siri iterations, reportedly impacting morale within Pang’s team. Apple is leaning heavily on external partners despite publicly touting its in-house AI efforts. At its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, only a few AI features were presented as native innovations, with several reliant on partnerships, including call translation and text analysis powered by OpenAI and Google. Apple’s updated Xcode tool taps into third-party models like Claude and ChatGPT for code completion. The departure of Pang — considered the most critical AI exit since Apple began developing Apple Intelligence — signals broader turbulence in Cupertino’s AI division. Sources say that Pang’s deputy, Tom Gunter, exited last month, and several engineers within the foundation models team, internally known as AFM, are also planning to leave for Meta or other companies. The AFM group, once under Pang’s direct leadership, will now be led by Zhifeng Chen, with a new hierarchical structure involving multiple managers such as Chong Wang, Zirui Wang, Chung-Cheng Chiu, and Guoli Yin. Apple’s AI strategy is steered by software head Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell; the engineering lead behind the Vision Pro and now Siri. Meanwhile, AI research remains under John Giannandrea, who was recently stripped of direct oversight of key AI consumer products amid delays and criticism of Apple’s AI rollout. As the talent war in AI intensifies, Pang’s high-profile defection underscores Apple’s challenges in retaining top minds — and the pressure it’s under to stay competitive against faster-moving rivals like Meta, OpenAI, and Google.

The price is trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it remains supported above the $2,520 zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Revisits Support Ethereum price started a fresh increase above the $2,550 zone, like Bitcoin . ETH price gained pace for a move above the $2,565 resistance zone and entered a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. However, the bears remained active near the $2,600 resistance zone and protected more gains. The price faced rejection near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,636 swing high to the $2,475 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . ETH is now testing the $2,520 support. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,530 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,550 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,580 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. A clear move above the $2,600 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,580 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,520 level. The first major support sits near the $2,500 zone. A clear move below the $2,500 support might push the price toward the $2,450 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,320.

The South Korean technology giant announced an operating profit of 4.6 trillion won , or about $3.3 billion, which was short of market expectations. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected a less severe drop of roughly 41%. Revenue for the quarter was 74 trillion won. Several factors contributed to the earnings slump. The tech firm blamed one-time inventory costs and delays in completing shipments of its most advanced memory chips. These problems weighed on the performance of its semiconductor division, a crucial profit center for the company. The company’s chip-making business has also been struggling for much of the past year, but the company said that operating losses are expected to be lower in the second half of the year. The increase is also anchored to a longer-term, gradual rebounding of global demand for semiconductors, including those for AI and high-performance computing. The firm intends to publish a comprehensive full earnings report later this month, with all net income figures accompanied by detailed breakdowns by business division. Samsung falls behind in AI chip race Samsung’s hardest task at the moment is its underperforming business in the thriving artificial intelligence chip market. The company has been playing catch-up with its biggest domestic competitor, SK Hynix , which has a big lead over Samsung in producing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. These are very important chips for AI hardware systems, especially for companies like Nvidia, which control so much of the AI training and inference chips market. Samsung had expected to win major contracts from Nvidia for its latest chip — the 12-layer HBM3E — but hasn’t yet received final quality certification. By contrast, SK Hynix announced a few days ago that it has begun the early shipping of 1.8V 12-Layer HBM4 samples to clients. This coup has elevated SK Hynix to Nvidia’s supplier of choice, giving it a massive head start in the competitive AI memory space. US vendor Micron Technology has also made inroads, sending out HBM samples in June. Analysts say that postponing that date could have long-term repercussions. The Samsung note from Bernstein and analyst Mark Li cut Samsung’s projected HBM market share. Now, they expect SK Hynix to have approximately 57% of the HBM market in 2025, while Samsung has 27% and Micron 16%. Samsung prepares to rebound in second half Still, Samsung is hopeful. The company started shipping better HBM3E samples, nicknamed Superman, out to key customers, including Nvidia, hoping that production would finally commence if the final stages of certification were passed. The tech firm also said it plans to start mass production of HBM4 chips, the next generation of high-bandwidth memory, in the second half of 2025. At its annual shareholders’ meeting in March, Samsung’s president of semiconductor business, Jun Young-hyun, admitted that the company failed to secure an early lead in the HBM market. He promised this would not happen with HBM4, which will feature prominently in Nvidia’s next-gen Rubin GPU architecture. Although certification delays remain a concern, analysts have expressed optimism that Samsung could catch up. In a June report, Daishin Securities analyst Ryu Hyung-keun said that while Samsung’s 12-layer HBM3E certification process has taken longer than expected, the company appears to be on track for a strong HBM4 rollout in the third quarter of 2025. Samsung is betting large on this upturn. The company’s long-term strategy is to lessen dependence on consumer electronics and smartphones for sales and place greater emphasis on advanced memory chips, AI infrastructure, and foundry services. If it can overcome its challenges now and execute its HBM4 roadmap, it could be competitive again in the cutthroat contest for leadership in the AI chip market. But for now, SK Hynix is unquestionably in the lead — a position Samsung is waging a fierce battle to take back.

The figure marks twelve straight weeks of positive momentum, logging total inflows at $18 billion. Price increases during the week lifted total assets under management to a record $188 billion. Meanwhile, trading volumes hit $16.3 billion, which aligned with the average weekly volume observed in the year so far. Ethereum Dominates Proportional Inflows The latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report revealed Bitcoin investment products attracted $790 million in inflows last week, a slowdown from the previous three-week average of $1.5 billion. The asset manager explained that this deceleration hints at growing caution among investors as Bitcoin nears its record highs. This sentiment is further validated by a minor $0.4 million in inflows to short-bitcoin products in a turnaround from the previous week’s direction. Meanwhile, Ethereum saw its 11th straight week of inflows as it added $226 million and pushed the total for this period to $2.85 billion. On a relative basis, Ethereum’s weekly inflows have averaged 1.6% of its assets under management, which is notably higher than Bitcoin’s 0.8%, which points to a change in sentiment toward Ethereum. Next up was Solana with inflows of $21.6 million, followed by XRP with $10.6 million, and Sui at $1.6 million during the same period. Chainlink and Cardano also saw modest but steady inflows, as each attracted $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, over the week. On the other hand, the multi-asset product was the only category that flashed red across the leaderboard as it witnessed $12.4 million in outflows. Regional Divide The United States topped regional inflows last week with $1 billion, followed by Germany at $38.5 million and Switzerland at $33.7 million over the past week. Australia also saw a smaller inflow of $4.1 million. Contrastingly, Canada and Sweden experienced weaker sentiment, recording outflows of $29.3 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Brazil and Hong Kong also saw capital leaving, as they saw outflows of $9.7 million and $3 million.

The tech behemoth urged the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse a 2023 US International Trade Commission (ITC) determination that Apple had infringed on patents of medical device producer Masimo. Due to their use of pulse oximetry technology, the ruling could effectively ban imports of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, two of Apple’s latest models. Apple attorney Joseph Mueller of WilmerHale said the ITC ruling had a devastating impact on Apple Watch users. He said millions of Apple Watch users were blocked from a popular health feature. Mueller also contended that Masimo’s product was still in the prototype stage when the lawsuit was filed in 2021. The clash concerns the blood-oxygen sensor Apple rolled out with its Series 6 watches in 2020. Masimo said that Apple copied this technology after it had been informed about it during discussions ahead of past collaboration. Masimo defends its patent victory Masimo, a California-based medical technology company, has accused Apple of using unfair practices to gain an edge in the emerging market for health-related wearable devices for years. Apple was in talks with Masimo in 2013 to collaborate on health monitoring features. Still, instead of coming to terms with it, Apple reportedly snapped up some of Masimo’s staff and brought Masimo’s pulse oximetry technology in-house, Masimo says. Masimo introduced its smartwatch, the W1, in 2022 after Apple introduced its models with blood-oxygen tracking. However, Masimo insists that its intellectual property was violated months before the W1 was released. Two years later, the ITC sided with Masimo in a decision that Apple violated its patents. In late December 2023, the ruling resulted in a brief cessation of Apple’s ability to sell its most current watch series in the US. Apple promptly requested a temporary block on the ban, allowing it to continue sales. However, the court reinstated the ban in January 2024, prompting Apple to strip the blood-oxygen-sensor feature from the models in question in the US. Masimo’s attorney, Joseph Re of Knobbe Martens Olson & Bear, said the ITC ruling was justified. He argued that Apple was trying to rewrite the law by claiming that a final, market-ready product must exist to enforce a patent violation. He added that this was not how patent protection works. Judges scrutinize fairness of the ITC ruling At an appeals court, a three-judge panel indicated a strong interest in the timing of events. At the heart of the preliminary investigation was whether Masimo had a product with adequate standing to trigger the ITC’s trade-related enforcement capabilities in 2021. Apple had argued the ban was unjustified because Masimo possessed only prototypes at that point. Apple argues that the ITC’s trade protection rules are intended to stop unfair competition with real products, not ideas that aren’t real yet. Masimo pushed back, contending that its domestically produced rival was sufficiently advanced that there wasn’t even close to what the statute calls an “end product” and that the agency doesn’t need a finished product for it to act. The judges did not rule immediately, but they hammered both sides with rapid-fire questions about product readiness, patent rights, and how to balance protecting innovation and encouraging consumer access. The court’s ultimate decision could create an important precedent for resolving patent disputes when emerging technologies coincide. Should the court rule in Apple’s favor, it could hamper the ability of companies like Masimo to wield the ITC to block imports of partially developed devices. If the ban is upheld, tech companies may have to reconsider how they strike partnerships and leverage the innovation of third parties.

The asset recorded a seven-day high of $110,307, but it has since cooled, with current trading levels around $108,311, representing a slight 0.3% drop over the last 24 hours. While the broader market maintains cautious optimism, several indicators suggest that market participants remain split on where Bitcoin is headed next. Related Reading: Are Bitcoin Retail Traders Back In The Market? On-Chain Data Suggests So Bitcoin Shorts Increase on Binance Despite Price Climb Despite the price strength seen in recent days, certain signals hint at increasing friction between bullish price action and bearish positioning from traders. According to a recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest, Bitcoin’s rise is being met with a counterintuitive decline in funding rates on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume. This trend could play a crucial role in shaping short-term market behavior. BorisVest noted that as Bitcoin consolidates within the $100,000 to $110,000 range, funding rates on Binance have gradually declined. This suggests that a significant number of traders are taking short positions—essentially betting that Bitcoin’s rally will soon reverse. The analyst explained that this behavior indicates skepticism about the sustainability of the recent price gains, particularly among retail and leverage-focused traders. “The declining funding rates show that users on Binance are increasingly shorting Bitcoin,” he explained. “This dynamic often creates forced exits as short positions come under pressure, leading to liquidations or forced margin increases. These events can further propel upward price movement as positions get closed out automatically.” Given Binance’s dominance in trading volume, BorisVest emphasized that its funding rate trend serves as a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. If current positioning continues, the market may see a short squeeze, which could accelerate Bitcoin’s momentum toward new highs. On-Chain Metric Flags Caution as NVT Golden Cross Edges Higher While futures market dynamics are drawing attention, on-chain data is also showing signs worth monitoring. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, highlighted the movement of Bitcoin’s NVT Golden Cross metric, a tool used to assess market value in relation to on-chain transaction volume. This metric has historically signaled local tops when it moves above specific thresholds. In his analysis, Kesmeci pointed out that the NVT Golden Cross successfully identified three prior short-term peaks in 2025, each followed by corrections ranging from 9% to over 20%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Continue To Rise: Investor Confidence At An All-Time High? The metric currently sits at 1.98, below the 2.2 threshold that has often indicated overheated market conditions, but is trending upward. “While the current level isn’t yet in the danger zone,” Kesmeci wrote, “its upward trajectory could be an early warning that price momentum is beginning to overextend.” However, the analyst cautioned against interpreting the signal as immediately bearish. In previous cases, the NVT Golden Cross remained elevated for several days before a correction followed. This behavior may instead point to continued strength among bulls, at least in the medium term, even if a near-term pullback remains possible.

Garlinghouse shared his excitement on social media, saying he’s honored to speak before the Senate Banking Committee about the need for clear crypto market rules. He thanked Senators Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Ruben Gallego for their leadership in supporting digital assets. The timing is important, as lawmakers are also reviewing other crypto-related bills, including one for stablecoins and another focused on market structure for digital assets. If approved, these bills could provide much-needed clarity for the U.S. crypto industry. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next? Meanwhile, XRP’s price has been showing some bullish signs. On the 12-hour chart, XRP recently found support at around $2.20 and is now eyeing a key resistance zone between $2.31 and $2.35. However, the price has struggled to break above it several times in the past. If XRP manages to close above $2.36 on the daily chart, it could open the door for a move toward $2.44 in the short term, with a stronger resistance waiting between $2.60 and $2.65, a range last seen in mid-May. However, analyst Josh of Crypto World also warns that XRP might be forming a rising wedge pattern, which statistically tends to break to the downside. If this happens, XRP could drop back toward $2.20 or even $2.16-$2.17. The broader crypto market is still in an accumulation phase, with large investors quietly buying XRP while prices remain stable.

A clear move above the $2.2880 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance or even $2.3650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.40. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.2880 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.240 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.205 swing low to the $2.353 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.240 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.

33767162,[object Object],1751950831,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Summer Lull Here? Trading Volume Plummets to Yearly Lows,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-summer-lull-volume-plummets-yearly-lows/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Spot and Future Volumes have dropped to new lows, despite the price holding near $110,000. Bitcoin Trading Volumes Are Drying Up According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode , the Bitcoin Trading Volume related to both the spot and futures markets has recently witnessed a decline. The Trading Volume here refers to a metric that keeps track of the total amount of the asset that’s becoming involved in trading activities on the major centralized exchanges. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the metric separately for the spot and futures sectors over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Spot and Futures Volumes both registered a large spike when the rally beyond $100,000 took place late last year. This suggests that investors ramped up trading activity on both fronts. Generally, traders find sharp price action to be exciting, so they tend to make more moves during such periods. As such, this sharp increase in the Spot and Futures Volumes wasn’t anything too unexpected. Activity around the cryptocurrency naturally calmed down when the coin went through its bearish phase earlier in the year, but interestingly, low activity has persisted despite BTC pushing back above $100,000 during the last couple of months. The Futures Volume did observe a spike alongside the run, but as Bitcoin started consolidating, it fell off again. Recently, despite the coin holding near $110,000, investors have actively been losing interest as both types of Trading Volumes have been plummeting. The Spot Volume is down to $5 billion, and the Futures Volume is down to $31.2 billion. “Both are at their lowest in over a year – and still trending down,” explains the analytics firm. The volume metrics aren’t the only ones hinting at a Summer slowdown. As Glassnode has pointed out in another X post , the Options market is echoing a similar trend. The above chart shows the data for the Bitcoin Options At-The-Money (ATM) Implied Volatility . In short, what this metric shows is the future volatility expectations of the Options traders who have a strike price close to the current spot price. From the graph, it’s visible that the indicator has recently declined on all major expiry timeframes, implying the investors are expecting lower volatility in the near future. “We’re now pricing some of the lowest vol levels since mid-2023, despite price hovering near ATHs,” notes Glassnode. BTC Price The Bitcoin price has again gone cold in the last couple of weeks as its value is still floating around the $108,400 level.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Summer Lull|Bitcoin trading volume|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-08 05:00:31

He also signed an executive order extending the reciprocal tariff deadline to August 1 from July 9, allowing more time for negotiations. On Monday, President Trump released letters announcing new 25% tariffs set for goods imported to the US from Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Tunisia. The letters stated that the US may “perhaps” reconsider tariff levels, “depending on our relationship with your Country.” Countries affected include South Africa (30%), Indonesia (32%), Thailand (36%), Malaysia (25%), Myanmar (40%), Laos (40%), and Kazakhstan (25%). Bangladesh and Serbia will face a 35% tariff, effective next month. Gold dropped to around $3,330 per ounce on Tuesday amid hopes for potential trade deals that could reduce demand for the safe-haven metal. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.22% to surpass 39,700, while the broader Topix Index added 0.1% to 2,815 on Tuesday, recouping some losses from the previous session after US President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff on Japanese goods, set to take effect on August 1. While lower than the previously threatened 35%, the tariff remains well above the baseline 10% levied on most countries, adding pressure on Tokyo to reach a trade deal with Washington. The Japanese yen weakened past 146 per dollar on Tuesday, hitting a two-week low. On the economic front, Japan’s current account surplus for May came in above expectations, offering a positive signal for external balances. Bank lending in Japan rose by 2.8% year-on-year in June 2025, up from a 2.4% increase in May and surpassing market expectations of 2.3%. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.58% to around 3,480 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.8% to 10,520 on Tuesday, recouping losses from the previous session, and the offshore yuan stabilized to around 7.17 per dollar on Tuesday, supported by a retreat in the US dollar after President Trump announced an updated round of tariffs targeting fourteen countries that have yet to finalize trade deals with Washington. While China was not on the latest tariff list, Trump also warned of an additional 10% levy on countries aligning with the “Anti-American policies of BRICS,” as the bloc convened for a summit in Brazil. In a bid to further open financial markets, China is reportedly weighing a plan to increase the Southbound Bond Connect quota to CNY 1 trillion. Regulators are also discussing a new, dedicated CNY 500 billion annual allocation specifically for non-bank financial institutions, such as mutual funds and insurers, which are currently unable to participate. Markets now await June CPI, which is expected to remain soft, along with PPI and trade data. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.74% to 24,051 in Tuesday morning’s session, snapping a three-day losing streak. In local data, Hong Kong’s forex reserves rose for the second straight month in June, hitting the highest level in nearly 2-1/2 years. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.06% Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.19% to 8,567 on Tuesday, extending losses from the previous session. The Australian dollar rose to around $0.651 on Tuesday, rebounding from sharp losses in the previous session. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Tuesday that he will visit China starting this Saturday, with stops in Shanghai, Beijing, and Chengdu, as Beijing seeks to deepen cooperation on AI, green energy, and the digital economy. Australia’s NAB Business Confidence Index jumped to 5 in June 2025 from 2 in May, improving for the third straight month and marking the highest print since January. “The survey is encouraging that sluggish momentum in early 2025 will improve into the second half,” said NAB’s Gareth Spence. In Australia, investors now await the latest monetary policy decision due later today. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended fell sharply as President Trump reignited trade tensions by unveiling a wave of new tariffs and extending the deadline for their implementation to August 1. Investors are now awaiting the release of the June FOMC meeting minutes, scheduled for Wednesday, for further insights into the Fed’s policy outlook. U.S. stock futures edged lower on Tuesday after President Donald Trump unveiled revised tariff rates on 14 countries: Dow -0.07% ; S&P 500 +0.04% ; Nasdaq +0.19% .

Next Leg Incoming?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/08/xrp-builds-strength-above-226-with-238-in-sight-next-leg-incoming,"XRP posted a 4.5% surge between July 7 and 8, peaking at $2.35 before stabilizing near $2.26. The rally was driven by higher-than-usual trading volume, with over 182 million XRP changing hands during peak hours. Despite broader market hesitation, the token is showing signs of sustained strength, forming solid support zones that suggest continuation potential if key resistance levels are broken. News Background As global trade disputes escalate and geopolitical risks rattle markets, cryptocurrency remains caught between risk-off sentiment and institutional tailwinds. Amid the turbulence, XRP is emerging as a standout, bolstered by strong on-chain activity and renewed institutional attention. Grayscale recently added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund for the first time since regulatory restrictions were lifted, and ten XRP spot ETF applications are currently pending before U.S. regulators, with decisions expected as early as October. The anticipation of regulatory clarity — combined with Ripple’s ongoing pursuit of a U.S. bank charter — has given the asset a bullish narrative. Analysts view XRP as one of the most technically promising large-cap tokens, with a clean break above $2.38 likely to open upside targets toward the $3.40 zone. Technical Analysis According to CoinDesk's Analytics, XRP surged from $2.25 to a high of $2.35 over the 24-hour period from 7 July 05:00 to 8 July 04:00, marking a 4.5% increase on the day. The 13:00–16:00 trading window was the most active, with volume spiking to 144M–182M, pushing the price to its session high before profit-taking set in. Initial resistance formed at $2.32 before sellers took control; the price retraced to stabilize at $2.26. The $2.25–$2.26 range has emerged as a key support zone, repeatedly absorbing sell pressure during late-session volatility. In the final hour, XRP experienced 2.0% volatility, rallying from a session low of $2.25 at 04:22 to $2.30 by 04:33. The sharp recovery was driven by a volume burst approaching 1 million units at 04:29, pushing price to a post-session high before consolidating around $2.26.",Markets|AI Market Insights|XRP|News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-08 05:06:19

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $620 support zone. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $655 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $620 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $645 and $650 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . The price even surged above the $660 level. A high was formed at $666 before there was a downside correction. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The price is now trading above $655 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $662 level. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance at $662 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $665 level. A clear move above the $665 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $672. A close above the $672 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $662 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $655 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $650 swing low to the $666 swing high. The next major support is near the $650 level. The main support sits at $644. If there is a downside break below the $644 support, the price could drop toward the $632 support.

Experts Weigh In on the Latest Developments",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-struggles-to-surpass-110000-but-why-experts-weigh-in-on-the-latest-developments/,"Despite topping $111,000 in May, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain higher levels in recent weeks. The slowdown could be due to long-term investors taking profits, according to Tom Lee, director of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “We have clients who bought Bitcoin at $100. Even if Bitcoin goes to $1 million, they’ll probably sell at $100,000,” Lee said on CNBC’s “ETF Edge.” While the Bitcoin price is stuck at psychological resistance levels, other areas of the cryptocurrency market continue to rise. While digital asset infrastructure providers stand out in this process, Coinbase shares in particular experienced their best month since November 2023, rising 40% in June. Coinbase also became the only stock to double its value in the S&P 500 index in the second quarter of 2025, closing its first three-month rise since 2023. Related News: BREAKING: Date and Price Set for One of This Year's Most Anticipated Altcoins to Hit the Market Factors that contributed to this rise include the Genius Act passed by the US Senate, Circle’s successful IPO, and the growing optimism towards stablecoins. For crypto assets such as Ethereum and Solana, which have seen limited price increases throughout the year, investors are turning to alternative methods such as “staking” to make a profit. According to independent ETF expert Dave Nadig, thanks to staking, investors can make significant returns not only from price increases but also by contributing to blockchain networks. “These returns can often be several percentage points higher than classic fixed-income instruments,” he said. Financial giants like BlackRock believe in the growth potential of staking. Speaking to CNBC, Johann Kerbrat, head of Robinhood’s crypto division, said the proliferation of Ethereum and Solana staking services is a significant step towards “mass adoption.” Another notable trend is the preference for ETFs that provide the same exposure, rather than buying crypto assets directly. Nadig comments on this situation as follows: “Let's be realistic, it's much easier and cheaper to buy ETFs.” Nadig added: “Bitcoin has moved from one wallet to another; this new wallet is now ETFs.” *This is not investment advice.

Meme coin platform Pump.fun has announced that its PUMP token will launch on Gate.io starting July 12, offering 15% of its total supply in a 72-hour sale. The announcement comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) signals an accelerated timeline for spot Solana ETFs, requesting amended filings from issuers before the end of July. Pump.fun to Launch PUMP Token With $6B Ambitions as Solana Meme Coin Craze Evolves In a highly anticipated step, Solana -based meme coin protocol Pump.fun is gearing up for the official launch of its native token, PUMP, with a public sale scheduled to begin on July 12, according to a countdown posted on the cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io. The token sale will last 72 hours and operate on a first-come, first-served basis, with 150 billion PUMP tokens to be made available at $0.04 USDT each, totaling a raise of up to $6 billion if fully subscribed. The PUMP token offering will account for 15% of the total 1 trillion supply, though specific allocation details beyond the public sale have yet to be disclosed. Gate.io’s FAQ notes that there will be no upper purchase limit, only a minimum threshold to qualify — a decision that could set the stage for high-demand volatility when the sale goes live. While the listing has not been formally announced by the Pump.fun team, a representative reportedly declined to comment when contacted, leaving much of the speculation up to the broader crypto community. The listing was first reported by X user @zoomerfied, who posted screenshots of the sale page prior to Gate’s official announcement. Valuation and Tokenomics Under the Spotlight Pump.fun is targeting a $4 billion valuation for the project, with the team internally discussing whether to include a revenue-sharing mechanism for token holders — an increasingly popular model among emerging protocols looking to reward long-term supporters. Given the platform's massive earnings potential and role as the hub for meme coin experimentation on Solana, investor interest in the PUMP token could be significant. With $700 million in cumulative revenue since its inception and peak daily revenues of over $7 million as recently as January 2025, the launch of the token may mark a transition from a niche builder tool to a formal DeFi powerhouse. Pump.fun was launched in early 2024 and quickly rose to dominance by providing a frictionless way for anyone — even non-developers — to create, launch, and trade meme coins on the Solana blockchain. Its simplicity and virality helped the platform go mainstream within the Solana ecosystem, contributing heavily to Solana’s meme coin surge in the first half of 2025. Even as its daily revenue has tapered to around $1 million, the project remains one of the top-performing decentralized applications in the entire crypto space, offering evidence of sustained market interest in community-driven tokens and speculative trading tools. A co-founder of Pump.fun first hinted at a token launch back in October 2024, fueling months of anticipation. With the announcement now confirmed through Gate.io’s listing page, attention is rapidly shifting to how the token will integrate into the existing Pump.fun ecosystem — and whether holders of PUMP will gain access to protocol governance, fee-sharing, or early access to new meme coin launches. Market Readiness and Risk Appetite Despite its popularity, Pump.fun’s token launch is not without risk. Critics have raised concerns about sustainability, fair launch mechanisms, and the highly speculative nature of meme coins in general. Given the lack of formal disclosures and a first-come, first-served structure, the token launch may favor whales and bots over small retail investors. Still, for the growing cult of crypto traders who see meme coins as a new frontier for decentralized innovation — and meme culture as a new form of economic power — the PUMP token represents a chance to own a piece of one of the most viral platforms in DeFi. As the launch draws near, all eyes will be on Gate.io and Pump.fun to see whether this token sale can live up to the hype, or if the project risks becoming a victim of its own meme-fueled success. Spot Solana ETF Approval Could Come Early as SEC Accelerates Review Process In related news, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may fast-track the approval process for a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF), potentially paving the way for it to hit the market far earlier than anticipated. According to sources familiar with the matter, the SEC has requested that ETF issuers submit amended S-1 filings by the end of July, hinting at a regulatory effort to accelerate the launch timeline. While the SEC’s technical deadline for ruling on these filings is Oct. 10, multiple signs now point to a potential approval well ahead of schedule. The sudden urgency appears linked to the unexpected approval and launch of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF (SSK), which began trading last week. This fund, structured under the Investment Company Act of 1940, effectively bypassed the more stringent vetting process associated with the Securities Act of 1933. Due to its classification, the SEC had no choice but to allow the fund to launch, unless it had taken active steps to block it within a specific review window — which it didn’t. The result: SSK became the first Solana -related staking fund to hit US markets, giving it a first-mover advantage over the pending Solana spot ETF applications still waiting for approval under the Securities Act. Historically, the SEC has worked to avoid giving any one issuer a head start — as seen when it simultaneously approved multiple spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier in 2024. The First Official Communications on Solana ETFs The SEC’s recent communication with potential issuers marks a significant milestone in the approval process for spot Solana ETFs, which would become the third category of spot crypto ETFs in the US after Bitcoin and Ethereum. In June, the SEC requested that issuers revise their S-1 filings to include language around in-kind creations and redemptions, as well as clarity on staking mechanisms — the first formal signal that the agency is engaging directly with Solana-based product proposals. This request suggests that the SEC is actively preparing for approval and wants to ensure that the filings are technically and legally sound ahead of a potential green light. The accelerated review may also be driven by market dynamics. The launch of the REX-Osprey SSK ETF caught many market participants off guard, highlighting how less conventional regulatory pathways can give certain products an edge. The SEC's desire to restore competitive balance may explain the sudden push to expedite spot Solana ETF approvals across the board. If approved, Solana ETFs would not only provide traditional investors with exposure to SOL, but also help cement the token's place as one of the top-tier assets in US crypto markets. The token has already seen surging institutional interest due to its performance, speed, and cost-efficiency relative to Ethereum. Meanwhile, other applications for spot crypto ETFs — including those tracking XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) — remain pending, but have not shown the same signs of accelerated review from the SEC. A Turning Point in Crypto ETF Policy? The SEC’s evolving posture around Solana could mark a turning point in how it handles crypto-based ETFs more broadly. Its historical caution around altcoin-related products, often citing concerns about market manipulation and liquidity, may be softening — particularly in the wake of legal clarity, competitive pressures, and precedent-setting product launches like the SSK ETF. While no official approval has yet been granted for any of the spot Solana ETFs, the current signs suggest it may not be long before multiple issuers join the SSK ETF on the public market, giving US investors a broader set of tools to gain exposure to the Solana ecosystem.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|REGULATION|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-08 05:15:25

From AI compute to enterprise supply chain tokenization, the right cryptocurrencies are already outperforming the market and drawing institutional attention. This list explores the best crypto coins to invest in now, each uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging trends.One name making waves is Qubetics ($TICS), which has catapulted into the CoinMarketCap top 10 following a historic launch. With unmatched transaction finality, a non-custodial multi-chain wallet, and governance-first architecture, Qubetics is capturing demand that older Layer 1s failed to meet. In contrast to hype-driven assets, it delivers functionality grounded in real-world use cases. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Next-Gen Blockchain With a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and Scalable Governance Qubetics features a built-in non-custodial multi-chain wallet designed for global users demanding privacy, speed, and cross-chain compatibility. Unlike wallets limited to a single ecosystem, Qubetics’ wallet allows seamless management of assets across Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and its native Qubetics chain. A freelance developer can use the wallet to handle payments in multiple tokens from clients worldwide. An NFT collector can store digital assets without relying on browser extensions prone to phishing. A startup in Dubai can use it to move stablecoins across chains to optimize treasury flows. All of this is secured via private keys stored locally on the user’s device, not a third-party server. The wallet is deeply embedded into the Qubetics dApp layer, enabling in-wallet token swaps, staking, asset tracking, and one-click interaction with DeFi protocols. For businesses, it offers enterprise-grade multi-signature features to protect internal treasury movements. Exchange Debut and Market Momentum On June 30, Qubetics launched on MEXC and LBank at a starting price of $0.40. Within 60 minutes, it surged 950% to reach $4.20. MEXC alone recorded over $700,000 in trade volume on the first day. Currently, the token is seeing strong support around the $2 mark, signaling long-term interest from early buyers and larger market participants. Qubetics is also available on SWFT Bridge, allowing easy movement across blockchains without traditional wrapping or custodial solutions. The listing is now fueling broader access and higher token velocity as Qubetics climbs the ranks of CoinMarketCap’s trending charts. The Qubetics presale began at $0.01 and concluded at $0.3370 in its 37th stage. This structured ramp-up allowed organic community growth and gave early buyers a fair path to build positions. Analysts are projecting a trading range of $5 to $10 in the current cycle, with a mainnet-driven target of $10 to $15 by Q4 2025. This debut is more than a simple liquidity event.

While established tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain in the spotlight, a rising competitor, Pepeto , is capturing attention with its unique approach. Unlike many meme coins built mainly on internet buzz, Pepeto blends advanced technology with a solid token strategy. Rather than aiming only for viral growth, it’s positioning itself as a project built on real use cases and a framework for sustainable performance. DOGE and SHIB still thrive on active communities and hype cycles, but Pepeto sets out to redefine what memecoins can be. DOGE and SHIB Hold Gains But Stay Volatile Dogecoin saw a fresh rally, climbing to $0.1689 after a 3.91% gain in a day. An attempt to break $0.175 resistance was rejected, but DOGE maintains support near $0.1650 . Source: CoinMarketCap Volume soared 82.68% , a strong signal that traders are watching closely. If interest continues, the next target could be $0.180 , a major psychological barrier. Source: CoinMarketCap Shiba Inu has also climbed higher, gaining 3.53% in 24 hours to reach $0.00001177 . The token surged past consolidation levels and briefly touched $0.00001190 before easing back. Key support sits around $0.00001150 , with strong volume suggesting more upside potential. Though both coins are moving up, their reliance on speculative sentiment stands in sharp contrast to Pepeto’s utility-focused foundation. Pepeto: A New Standard in Meme Coins With a presale launch price of $0.000000139 , Pepeto has secured over $5.52 million from early supporters. Rather than relying on hype alone, the project has put real utility at the forefront. Central to the platform is a generous 270% APY staking reward , encouraging holders to lock up their tokens and support long-term stability. Beyond staking, Pepeto is developing its own memecoin-focused exchange and cross-chain bridge, giving traders an integrated environment to swap tokens easily. A first sneak peek into the $Pepeto Exchange is finally here. Live trading charts, swap and bridge features, and over 850 high-quality tokens already approved for listing once $Pepeto secures its Tier 1 exchange. While markets remain uncertain, the team behind the God of Frogs… pic.twitter.com/ndk5gYs6y4 — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) June 23, 2025 Why Pepeto’s Strategy Could Outperform in Q3 Pepeto has outlined a detailed plan, moving through four development phases covering contract audits, staking rollouts, live AMAs, and top exchange listings. Phase three will introduce the exchange and bridge, enabling live swaps and liquidity migration. The final phase will launch full staking operations and a worldwide marketing campaign. Compared to DOGE and SHIB, which often depend on momentum alone, Pepeto’s strategy shows greater depth. The allocation model 30% for staking, 30% for presale, and reserves for liquidity and marketing demonstrates forward-thinking design. With over 31 trillion $PEPETO tokens staked, confidence among early investors is clear. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a next-generation memecoin that mixes the energy of viral tokens with the strength of a real product ecosystem. It offers a zero-fee exchange, cross-chain bridge, and staking incentives to help shape the future of meme coins.

By Tuesday, the asset was holding steady just under $108,000 after a brief sell-off on Monday night. Major crypto assets saw a bout of profit-taking. Solana (SOL) lost 2.3% to $149, while dogecoin (DOGE) fell 4.1% to lead slides. Ether (ETH) hovered near $2,530, and XRP held steady around $2.26. In broader markets, Asian equities wobbled but avoided a selloff after President Donald Trump signaled openness to resume trade talks, postponing fresh tariffs until at least Aug. 1. The MSCI Asia-Pacific index traded flat despite Korea and Japan facing new levies. Risk appetite crept back as the yen softened and the won rallied, while the euro gained on reports of a potential EU deal. “Markets are hovering around record highs again,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus. “Earnings season kicks off this week, and sentiment is being driven by the hope that CEOs guide positively, especially after being blindsided last quarter by sudden tariff headlines,” Fan said. Crypto continues to track equities tightly, with BTC-SPX correlation near local highs. Fan noted that unless volatility picks up, we’re likely in for “a hot but quiet summer,” albeit one where breakouts can still come from thin air. Meanwhile, at least one trader eyed a break of bitcoin’s $112,000 record highs in the coming weeks. “Bitcoin is well-positioned to break its previous high in July, with upside potential toward $120,000 by month-end. Institutional demand and consistent ETF inflows continue to reinforce bullish momentum,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, said in a message to CoinDesk. “Ethereum is also gaining strength, supported by sustained whale accumulation and renewed optimism under a crypto-friendly U.S. administration. ETH could test $3,000 by the end of July, though market volatility remains a factor,” Lee said, adding that the anticipated Fed rate cut in September may serve as a further catalyst.

This pivotal decision, reached through a joint agreement with the influential advocacy group Coin Center, sees the case dismissed, marking a significant moment for digital asset privacy and regulatory oversight. What does this mean for the future of crypto, and why is this outcome considered a historic turning point? Tornado Cash: Unpacking the Historic Legal Retreat For those new to the space, Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based decentralized protocol designed to enhance transaction privacy by breaking the on-chain link between source and destination addresses. It functions as a crypto mixer , pooling together various transactions to obscure their origins, a feature highly valued by privacy advocates but also criticized for its potential misuse in illicit activities. In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took the unprecedented step of sanctioning Tornado Cash, including its smart contract addresses, alleging its use by malicious actors like the North Korean-backed Lazarus Group for money laundering. This move sparked immediate controversy and a robust legal challenge. Critics argued that sanctioning an immutable, open-source software protocol was an overreach, potentially violating constitutional rights and setting a dangerous precedent for censorship in decentralized finance (DeFi). The legal dispute centered on whether code could be considered an entity subject to sanctions and if such actions infringed upon privacy and free speech rights. Why Did the U.S. Treasury Drop the Appeal? The recent dismissal of the appeal by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals was not a sudden turn but the culmination of several factors. A key precursor was OFAC’s decision in March to lift sanctions on certain addresses associated with Tornado Cash . While this didn’t fully de-list the protocol, it signaled a potential shift in the government’s stance or at least an acknowledgment of the complexities involved. According to Coin Center, the government chose not to defend its sanctions authority in court. This suggests that facing the legal arguments presented by Coin Center, the U.S. Treasury might have recognized the difficulties in prevailing or the broader implications of a potentially unfavorable ruling. Rather than risking a precedent-setting loss, a dismissal by joint agreement allowed both parties to conclude the dispute without a definitive court ruling on the legality of sanctioning decentralized software. This strategic retreat by the government highlights the intricate balance between national security interests and the fundamental principles of open-source software and digital privacy. The Broader Ramifications of OFAC Sanctions on Digital Assets The initial OFAC sanctions on Tornado Cash sent a chilling effect throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Developers, users, and even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) found themselves grappling with questions of compliance and potential liability. The incident raised profound questions about: The Definition of a Sanctionable Entity: Can immutable code, without a central controlling party, be considered an entity subject to sanctions? This case challenged the traditional understanding of how sanctions apply in a decentralized world. Censorship and Decentralization: The sanctions led to some centralized entities blocking interactions with sanctioned addresses, raising concerns about censorship resistance, a core tenet of blockchain technology. Developer Liability: Would developers creating open-source privacy tools be held liable for their misuse by bad actors? This uncertainty threatened to stifle innovation in the privacy-enhancing technology (PET) space. Due Process Concerns: Critics argued that sanctioning a protocol without a clear mechanism for individuals to contest their inclusion on a sanctions list raised significant due process issues. The dismissal of the appeal provides some much-needed clarity, suggesting that sanctioning decentralized, unhosted software presents significant legal hurdles for regulators. While it doesn’t preclude future actions, it certainly makes such actions more difficult. Coin Center’s Relentless Advocacy: A Win for Crypto Privacy? At the heart of this legal challenge was Coin Center , a non-profit advocacy group dedicated to promoting public policy that protects the open, permissionless nature of cryptocurrency and blockchain networks. Their lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury was a bold move, arguing that OFAC’s actions were unconstitutional and exceeded its statutory authority. Coin Center’s arguments centered on several key points: First Amendment Rights: They argued that open-source code is a form of speech, protected under the First Amendment, and sanctioning it amounted to censorship. Due Process: They contended that the sanctions deprived users of their property without due process, as there was no clear way for innocent users whose funds might have passed through Tornado Cash to challenge their inclusion. Lack of Control: Coin Center highlighted that the developers no longer controlled the protocol after deployment, making it impossible for them to enforce sanctions. The government’s decision not to defend its position in court against these arguments can be seen as a significant victory for Coin Center and the broader crypto privacy movement. It underscores the power of persistent advocacy in shaping regulatory outcomes and defending fundamental rights in the digital age. This outcome offers a beacon of hope for other privacy-enhancing technologies facing similar regulatory scrutiny. What’s Next for Crypto Mixers and Decentralized Privacy Tools ? The dismissal of the Tornado Cash appeal is undoubtedly a positive development for the development and use of crypto mixers and other decentralized privacy tools . However, it does not mean a free pass for illicit activity or an end to regulatory scrutiny. Here are some key takeaways and what to expect: Increased Legal Clarity: The outcome suggests that simply sanctioning immutable, decentralized software protocols will be legally challenging for regulators. This could encourage further innovation in the privacy tech space. Continued Scrutiny: While the legal battle is over, regulators will likely continue to monitor the use of privacy tools for illicit finance. The focus might shift from sanctioning the protocol itself to targeting the individuals or entities who knowingly use them for illegal purposes. Responsible Innovation: The crypto community is encouraged to develop and utilize privacy tools responsibly, emphasizing compliance features where possible and educating users on their lawful applications. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: This case highlights the dynamic nature of crypto regulation. As technology evolves, so too will the approaches taken by governments to balance innovation with financial security. The resolution of the Tornado Cash case provides a crucial precedent, indicating a growing recognition of the unique challenges posed by decentralized technologies to traditional regulatory frameworks. It’s a testament to the power of legal advocacy and a reminder that the conversation around privacy, innovation, and regulation in the crypto space is far from over. This historic decision by the U.S. Treasury to drop its appeal against Tornado Cash marks a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. It represents a hard-won battle for digital privacy advocates like Coin Center and offers a glimmer of hope for the future of decentralized crypto mixer and privacy tools . While regulatory challenges persist, this outcome underscores the importance of legal challenges in shaping a balanced and equitable regulatory environment for the evolving world of digital assets. It’s a powerful reminder that the fight for freedom and innovation in the decentralized space continues, one legal victory at a time.

This move coincided with a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity offering that is aimed at funding future BTC purchases. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet continued to ramp up its Bitcoin reserves by acquiring another 2,204 BTC and solidifying its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder. CleanSpark also saw major growth when it boosted its mining output by over 50% year-over-year and raised its hashrate to 50 EH/s. However, its stock dipped nearly 8% despite the operational progress. Strategy Tops $14B Gains Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, reported $14.05 billion in unrealized gains on its digital asset holdings for the second quarter of 2025. Alongside this impressive figure, the company disclosed a deferred tax expense of $4.04 billion, according to its latest filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As of June 30, the carrying value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings reached $64.36 billion, while the related deferred tax liability stood at $6.31 billion. Despite the very impressive gains, Strategy paused its consistent Bitcoin accumulation last week. The firm’s total holdings stayed unchanged at 597,325 BTC after its most recent acquisition of 4,980 BTC. This break in weekly purchases was the first since April 2025 and came as Bitcoin’s price briefly dropped to $105,400 before rebounding above $110,000. The company previously halted purchases when Bitcoin fell below $87,000 earlier in the year. After that pause, Strategy resumed buying with a 3,459 BTC purchase on April 14, just two weeks after its massive 22,048 BTC acquisition on March 31. The newly reported unrealized gains slightly exceeded Bloomberg’s earlier projections, which estimated Strategy would post at least $13 billion in such gains for the quarter. In conjunction with the earnings announcement, Strategy also unveiled a new $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering for its 10% Series A perpetual Stride (STRD) preferred stock, priced at $0.001 per share. This latest ATM program is part of the company’s equity-raising strategy that is designed to fund future Bitcoin purchases. According to an investor presentation , Strategy already issued $477 million under the STRK ATM and $163 million under the STRF ATM. The firm reported a total remaining ATM capacity of $44.8 billion across its various programs, which includes $18.1 billion for MSTR, $4.2 billion for STRD, $20.5 billion for STRK, and $1.9 billion for STRF. These strategic funding mechanisms are part of Strategy’s continued effort to maintain its dominant position in the Bitcoin market while navigating short-term volatility and tax considerations. Metaplanet Buys More BTC It does not seem like Metaplanet plans to slow down its Bitcoin buys at all. Japan’s leading corporate Bitcoin holder expanded its holdings with the acquisition of 2,204 BTC for $237 million, according to a filing on Monday. The purchase was made at an average price of 15.64 million yen per Bitcoin, or roughly $107,700. This latest acquisition brings the company’s total holdings to 15,555 BTC, with an average purchase price of approximately $99,985 per coin. With this addition, Metaplanet solidified its position as the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . The company surpassed Tesla in late June when it added 1,234 BTC to its reserves, raising its total to 12,345 BTC while Tesla stayed at 11,509 BTC. It then outpaced Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark's holdings of 12,502 BTC with another strategic buy of 1,005 BTC valued at $108 million, which was disclosed on June 30. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The news comes during a surge in activity among corporate Bitcoin treasuries. ProCap , the investment firm led by Anthony Pompliano, made its first entry into the Bitcoin space with a 3,724 BTC purchase totaling $386 million. Semler Scientific also announced plans to dramatically increase its Bitcoin holdings from 3,808 BTC to 105,000 BTC. Despite the growing trend, some analysts are a bit more cautious. James Check , lead analyst at Glassnode, recently warned that the Bitcoin treasury strategy may already be losing its luster for new entrants. He suggested that the biggest gains may have already been captured by early adopters and pointed out that latecomers could struggle to stand out, saying “nobody wants the 50th Treasury company.” A report by venture firm Breed also warned that only a few firms will manage to avoid a potential “death spiral” in the Bitcoin treasury space, due to the risks that come with chasing a strategy already embraced by many. CleanSpark BTC Output Jumps In other Bitcoin-related news, CleanSpark reported a big surge in its Bitcoin mining output, with production rising over 50% year-over-year despite the increasingly challenging post-halving environment for miners. In June, the company achieved an operational hashrate of 50 EH/s, up from 20.4 EH/s a year ago, which was a 145.1% increase in mining capacity. This boosted output to 685 BTC mined last month, valued at approximately $74.2 million based on current market prices, compared to 445 BTC mined in June of 2024. (Source: CleanSpark ) CEO and president Zach Bradford credited the achievement to the efforts of the operations and technology teams, and pointed out that more than 10 EH/s of capacity was added across four US states, representing a 9.6% month-over-month growth. CleanSpark sold 578 BTC in June, most of its production for the month, and now holds 12,608 BTC—up slightly from 12,502 in May. This places CleanSpark seventh among publicly traded Bitcoin-holding companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . Only MARA Holdings and Riot Platforms hold more BTC among miners, with MARA holding 50,000 BTC and Riot holding 19,225 BTC. Bradford noticed the growing adoption of Bitcoin by global corporations, and mentioned that corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have outpaced ETF net inflows for three straight quarters. CleanSpark stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the operational gains, CleanSpark’s stoc k saw an almost 8% drop on Monday after the update. This decline took place amid broader market softness, with the Nasdaq index falling over 1% thanks to U.S. trade policy discussions that weighed on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining difficulty continued to rise, and reached an all-time high of 126.9 trillion on May 31, compounding the economic pressures on miners from reduced block rewards and rising energy costs. Since February of 2024, CleanSpark greatly expanded its US operations by establishing facilities in Georgia, Mississippi, Wyoming, and Tennessee. In August 2024, the company also purchased 26,000 Bitmain immersion mining rigs in a $168 million deal.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MINING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-08 05:30:00

Dogecoin URPD Shows These Price Levels Stand Out In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared DOGE levels that could be important resistance boundaries. The levels in question correspond to major supply walls on the Dogecoin UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD). The URPD is an on-chain indicator from the analytics firm Glassnode that tells us about the total amount of the memecoin’s supply that was last purchased at the different price levels that it has visited over history. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned Now, here is the chart posted by Martinez that shows how the URPD looks for Dogecoin right now: As displayed in the above graph, the level closest to the latest Dogecoin spot price that stands out in terms of the URPD is $0.18. The investors last purchased around 8.94% of the asset’s supply around this mark. Naturally, as the level is above the spot price, all of these holders would be in the red at the moment. Generally, investors in loss look forward to retests of their break-even mark so that they can get their money ‘back.’ Often, these holders push for the exit as soon as this happens, fearing that the price would go back down again in the near future. As such, whenever the price retests the cost basis of a notable part of the supply from below, a significant selling reaction can sometimes appear in the market. This can provide resistance to the cryptocurrency. Considering that the $0.18 level is particularly large, it can act as a point of notable resistance. Similarly, the analyst has also flagged two other levels: $0.21 (7.24% of supply) and $0.36 (3.82% of supply). Interestingly, between these two, there aren’t any significant supply walls, meaning that if Dogecoin can get into this zone, it may, at least in theory, have an easier time climbing up. In the scenario that DOGE gets rejected at the resistance, however, it may have to find support at the in-profit supply zones. Holders belonging to these levels can react to declines to their cost basis by buying more, as they may believe the drawdown to be just a dip-buying opportunity.

It hosts the acquisition mark of 20.03% of the memecoin’s supply, which means that it’s massive in size, and so, could be a strong support center. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.168, up 1.6% in the last seven days.

Recently, the White House delivered a significant update that has ripple effects across various sectors, including potentially influencing the broader sentiment in global markets. Get ready to dive into the details of a pivotal decision concerning the tariff deadline and what it means for businesses, consumers, and investors worldwide. Understanding the Extended Tariff Deadline: What’s Changing? In a move that provides a brief reprieve and perhaps an opportunity for further negotiations, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order (EO) today. This order will extend the existing tariff deadline from its original July schedule to August 1. The news, initially reported by the reliable Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, has immediately become a focal point for economic analysts and market participants. But what does this extension truly signify? At its core, it means a few more weeks of certainty – or perhaps, continued anticipation – for industries heavily reliant on international trade. For businesses that import or export goods subject to these tariffs, an extended deadline offers: Additional Planning Time: Companies can adjust supply chains, re-evaluate sourcing strategies, and prepare for potential future changes with a slightly longer runway. Reduced Immediate Pressure: The immediate crunch to meet the July deadline is alleviated, preventing hasty decisions that could lead to inefficiencies or losses. Opportunity for Dialogue: It could signal an ongoing willingness for trade discussions and negotiations to continue, rather than an immediate imposition of new or increased tariffs. While a few weeks might not seem like a monumental shift, in the fast-paced world of global commerce, every day counts. It’s a pause, a moment to breathe, and potentially a sign of strategic maneuvering on the international stage. The Significance of a White House EO in Trade Policy When we talk about the White House EO , it’s important to understand the power and implications behind such an executive order. An Executive Order is a directive issued by the President of the United States that manages operations of the federal government. While not legislation passed by Congress, EOs carry the full force of law and are often used to implement or interpret statutes, constitutional provisions, or treaties. In the context of trade, a presidential executive order can swiftly alter policy, bypass lengthy legislative processes, and send clear signals to both domestic and international stakeholders. This particular EO regarding the tariff extension highlights the executive branch’s direct authority in shaping the nation’s trade posture. It demonstrates a presidential prerogative to manage economic pressures and diplomatic relations in real-time. Historically, presidents have used EOs to address various economic and trade matters. This specific action is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a broader approach to trade management that prioritizes flexibility and direct intervention when deemed necessary. The immediate impact of this White House EO is to delay the imposition of certain tariffs, offering a temporary reprieve and perhaps setting the stage for future negotiations or policy shifts. Recalling the Era of Donald Trump Tariffs: A Brief History The concept of tariffs gained significant prominence during Donald Trump’s previous presidential term. The administration frequently employed tariffs as a key tool in its trade arsenal, aiming to reshape global trade relationships and protect domestic industries. The overarching philosophy behind these Donald Trump tariffs was often centered on reducing trade deficits, bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., and compelling trading partners to adhere to what the administration viewed as fairer trade practices. Key tariff actions during that period included: Steel and Aluminum Tariffs: Imposed broadly on imports from many countries, citing national security concerns. Tariffs on Chinese Goods: A wide range of products from China faced tariffs, leading to a prolonged trade war between the two economic giants. The stated goal was to address intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. Threats of Tariffs on European Automobiles: Though largely not implemented, these threats aimed to pressure the European Union on various trade issues. These actions led to significant debate among economists and policymakers. Supporters argued they leveled the playing field for American businesses, while critics pointed to increased costs for consumers, retaliatory tariffs from other countries, and disruptions to global supply chains. The current extension of the tariff deadline is a direct echo of this past policy, indicating that trade tools remain a significant part of the current administration’s economic strategy. Navigating Complex Trade Policy in a Dynamic World The decision to extend the trade policy deadline underscores the intricate and often delicate nature of international commerce. Modern trade policy is far more than just setting tariffs; it involves a complex web of agreements, diplomatic relations, and economic strategies designed to balance national interests with global economic stability. This extension could be interpreted in several ways: A Strategic Pause: It might provide more time for the U.S. to negotiate with specific countries or blocs, aiming for more favorable terms before making a definitive move on tariffs. Economic Data Review: The administration might be waiting for more economic data to assess the potential impact of new tariffs on inflation, consumer spending, or specific industries. Domestic Political Considerations: In an election year, every economic decision is scrutinized. Delaying a potentially disruptive tariff imposition could be a politically calculated move. The challenges in modern trade policy are numerous. Supply chains are increasingly globalized, meaning tariffs in one area can have unforeseen ripple effects across multiple industries and countries. Furthermore, retaliatory tariffs from affected nations can harm American exporters, creating a tit-for-tat scenario that ultimately hurts global growth. Here’s a simplified look at the potential challenges and benefits: Aspect Potential Challenges Potential Benefits (of Extension) Businesses Ongoing uncertainty, difficulty in long-term planning, potential cost increases. More time to adjust supply chains, reduced immediate financial burden, opportunity for lobbying. Consumers Potential for higher prices if tariffs are eventually imposed, reduced product variety. Delay in potential price increases, continued access to current product ranges. Global Relations Risk of retaliatory measures, strained diplomatic ties. Opportunity for continued negotiation, potential for de-escalation of trade tensions. Analyzing the Ripple Effects on Global Markets Any significant announcement concerning trade, especially from a major economic power like the United States, inevitably sends ripples through global markets . Investors, traders, and businesses worldwide pay close attention to such developments, as they can influence everything from stock prices and commodity values to currency exchange rates. The extension of the tariff deadline could evoke a mixed reaction in markets: Initial Relief: For sectors heavily exposed to tariffs, such as manufacturing, automotive, and technology, the delay might be met with a sigh of relief, potentially leading to a short-term positive sentiment in related stock indices. Continued Uncertainty: While the immediate threat is postponed, the underlying issue of tariffs remains unresolved. This prolonged uncertainty can prevent significant long-term investment decisions and keep market volatility elevated. Currency Fluctuations: The U.S. dollar’s strength or weakness can be influenced by trade policy. An extension might lead to minor adjustments as traders reassess the likelihood of future trade agreements or disputes. Commodity Prices: Tariffs on raw materials or agricultural products can directly impact their global prices. A delay might stabilize prices in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains tied to the August 1 decision. For those interested in cryptocurrencies, while not directly impacted by tariffs, the broader sentiment in global markets can subtly influence digital asset prices. When traditional markets experience uncertainty or instability due to macroeconomic factors like trade wars, some investors might seek safe havens, which can sometimes include cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Conversely, a stable and predictable economic environment might reduce the perceived urgency of alternative investments. Thus, understanding these macro-level shifts is crucial for any market participant. What Happens Next? The Road to August 1 and Beyond The period leading up to August 1 will be critical. It’s a window for diplomacy, negotiation, and economic assessment. While the specific reasons for choosing August 1 are not explicitly stated, it provides a defined endpoint for this temporary extension. What could unfold in the coming weeks? Intensified Negotiations: We might see a flurry of diplomatic activity as the U.S. engages with key trading partners to resolve outstanding issues. Economic Data Analysis: The administration will likely be closely monitoring inflation rates, employment figures, and manufacturing data to gauge the health of the U.S. economy and the potential impact of future tariff actions. Public and Industry Input: Businesses and industry groups will likely continue to lobby the White House, presenting their cases for or against the imposition of tariffs. Beyond August 1, several scenarios are possible: Tariffs Imposed: The tariffs could be fully implemented as initially planned. Further Extension: Another extension could be granted if progress is being made in negotiations or if economic conditions warrant it. Tariffs Modified: The tariffs could be adjusted in scope, rate, or target, reflecting partial agreements or new strategies. Tariffs Withdrawn: In the event of a comprehensive agreement, some or all of the tariffs could be withdrawn. The uncertainty inherent in these possibilities means that businesses and investors must remain agile and informed, preparing for various outcomes. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors Given the ongoing fluidity of trade policy, what steps can individuals and organizations take? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official White House announcements, economic news, and analyses from reputable sources. Reliable information is your best defense against market volatility. Assess Your Exposure: Businesses should conduct thorough assessments of their supply chains and customer bases to understand their direct and indirect exposure to tariffs. Diversification of suppliers and markets can mitigate risks. Scenario Planning: Develop contingency plans for different outcomes post-August 1. What if tariffs are imposed? What if they’re extended again? Having a plan for each scenario can save time and resources. Engage with Industry Groups: Participate in industry associations that lobby policymakers. Collective voices can have a greater impact on trade decisions. Review Investment Portfolios: Investors should consider the potential impact of trade policy on different asset classes. While direct links to crypto are nuanced, overall market stability affects sentiment across the board. Conclusion: A Critical Watch on Trade Developments The White House’s decision to extend the tariff deadline to August 1 is a significant development that offers a temporary pause in the ongoing saga of global trade relations. While it provides a brief respite for industries and markets, it also underscores the continued uncertainty surrounding international commerce. The legacy of Donald Trump tariffs and the broader complexities of trade policy continue to shape the outlook for global markets . All eyes will now be on the developments leading up to the new deadline, as stakeholders await clarity on the future of these crucial economic levers. Staying informed and adaptable will be key for navigating these dynamic times.

Key Takeaways: Dubai has approved its first tokenized money market fund, led by QNB and DMZ Finance. The fund brings traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries on-chain for use in Web3 and institutional finance. The move highlights the Middle East’s growing leadership in real-world asset tokenization. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) granted approval to the QCD Money Market Fund (QCDT), jointly launched by Qatar National Bank (QNB) and DMZ Finance, according to a recent announcement . The fund will be domiciled in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), with QNB handling asset origination and investment strategy, while DMZ Finance powers the underlying blockchain infrastructure. Tokenized Fund Brings U.S. Treasuries On-Chain According to both firms, the product is designed to bring traditional instruments like U.S. Treasuries on-chain, enabling use cases such as stablecoin reserves, Web3 payment systems, exchange collateral, and institutional liquidity tools. The approval reflects the Middle East’s rising profile in the global race to digitize real-world assets (RWAs). “The tokenization of real-world assets is becoming a fundamental bridge between traditional capital markets and the digital asset economy,” Nathan Ma, Co-Founder and Chairman of DMZ Finance, said. A recent joint study by Ripple and BCG projects the RWA tokenization market could reach $18.9 trillion by 2033, with jurisdictions like Dubai and Doha emerging as early leaders. QNB, the region’s largest bank, is leveraging its deep institutional reach, while DMZ Finance, part of Qatar’s Digital Lab cohort, is working to embed tokenization into local financial infrastructure.

UAE Continues to Attract Crypto Firms The move comes as the UAE continues to position itself as a regional hub for blockchain innovation and crypto finance, with regulatory clarity attracting major global players. As reported, a state-backed investment firm in Abu Dhabi is set to make a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange Binance using USD1, a stablecoin developed by World Liberty Financial — a crypto venture closely tied to the Trump family. Experts claim the UAE is poised to become a key destination for crypto and stablecoin ventures seeking refuge from the European Union’s (EU) newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The regulatory framework, which took full effect on December 30, is creating significant challenges for crypto firms within the 27-member bloc, prompting many to consider relocating, according to industry experts. Among its stringent requirements, small stablecoin issuers must hold 30% of their reserves in low-risk EU-based commercial banks, while major players like Tether face a mandate to maintain 60% or more in similar institutions.

Hong Kong is pushing through a variety of pro-crypto legislation through its local assembly, known as LegCo. The city had its own stablecoin legislation before the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act . Trump, speaking earlier this year at Consensus Toronto , praised bitcoin’s liquidity, calling it superior to real estate, and referred to it as “digital gold.” He also expressed sympathy for the crypto community, claiming that the same group that targeted it under the Biden administration had also attacked his father, former President Donald Trump.

The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at the heart of this transformation lies the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrencies. For years, investors have eagerly awaited regulated, accessible pathways into this volatile yet potentially lucrative market. The latest news has sent ripples through the industry: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged receipt of applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) products from an unexpected player – Truth Social. This development marks a potentially pivotal moment for digital asset investment , signaling a new chapter in the ongoing integration of digital currencies into mainstream finance. What Exactly Happened? The SEC and Truth Social’s Bold Move In a move that caught many by surprise, the SEC , the primary regulator for the U.S. securities markets, confirmed it had received formal applications from Truth Social for both a spot Bitcoin ETF and a spot Ether ETF. For those unfamiliar, Truth Social is a social media platform launched by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG). While the company’s primary focus has been on social media and media services, its foray into the cryptocurrency ETF space through these applications signifies a bold and intriguing diversification strategy. This acknowledgment by the SEC is a procedural step, indicating that the applications have been received and the formal review process will now commence. It does not imply approval, but it certainly puts these applications on the regulatory radar. Understanding the Landscape: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Why Does it Matter? To fully grasp the significance of Truth Social’s applications, it’s crucial to understand what a Spot Bitcoin ETF entails and how it differs from other crypto investment vehicles. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot Bitcoin ETF directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This means that if you invest in a spot Bitcoin ETF, you are essentially gaining exposure to the actual price movements of Bitcoin without having to buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency yourself. This contrasts sharply with futures Bitcoin ETFs, which invest in Bitcoin futures contracts rather than the actual cryptocurrency. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Spot Bitcoin ETF Futures Bitcoin ETF Underlying Asset Directly holds actual Bitcoin Holds Bitcoin futures contracts Price Tracking Aims to track Bitcoin’s real-time market price closely Tracks the price of futures contracts, which can deviate from spot price Custody Fund manager handles secure custody of Bitcoin No direct Bitcoin custody needed by the fund Investor Experience More direct exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price Indirect exposure, subject to futures market dynamics The significance of a spot Bitcoin ETF lies in its ability to democratize access to Bitcoin. It removes technical barriers for traditional investors, offering a familiar, regulated investment product that can be bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts. This dramatically expands the pool of potential investors beyond crypto-native individuals. The Journey to Acceptance: A Look at Past SEC Deliberations The path to a Spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. has been long and arduous, marked by numerous rejections from the SEC over several years. The commission’s primary concerns consistently revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, a landmark shift occurred in January 2024 when the SEC finally approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs, following a court ruling that challenged the basis of their previous rejections. This approval was a monumental victory for the crypto industry, opening the floodgates for institutional capital and mainstream adoption. The precedent set by these approvals is crucial for understanding the current landscape and the potential trajectory of new applications, including those from Truth Social. Ether ETF Applications: Following in Bitcoin’s Footsteps? With the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, attention has now firmly shifted to Ether ETF applications . Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, boasts a robust ecosystem supporting decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Proponents argue that Ether, like Bitcoin, is mature enough for a spot ETF, citing its increasing institutional adoption and the evolution of its underlying blockchain. Several major financial institutions have already filed for spot Ether ETFs, and the SEC’s acknowledgment of Truth Social’s application adds another interesting dimension to this developing narrative. While the regulatory hurdles for Ether may differ slightly due to its smart contract functionality and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the general sentiment in the market is optimistic, anticipating similar approvals down the line. Truth Social’s Play: A New Frontier for Digital Asset Investment? Why is Truth Social , primarily known as a social media platform, venturing into the complex world of cryptocurrency ETFs? This move could be interpreted in several ways. Firstly, it might be an attempt to diversify revenue streams and capitalize on the growing interest in digital asset investment . By offering regulated crypto investment products, Truth Social could potentially attract a new user base interested in both their social platform and financial offerings. Secondly, it aligns with a broader trend of technology companies exploring Web3 and blockchain technologies. For a platform that champions free speech and aims to disrupt traditional media, embracing decentralized finance could be seen as a natural extension of its ethos. It also presents a unique marketing angle, potentially appealing to a demographic that values both alternative media and alternative investments. The question remains how the SEC will view an application from a non-traditional financial entity like Truth Social, given their strict scrutiny of financial products. Benefits of Spot Crypto ETFs: Unlocking New Avenues for Investors The introduction of spot crypto ETFs, including the potential ones from Truth Social, offers several compelling benefits for investors and the broader market: Enhanced Accessibility: These ETFs make investing in Bitcoin and Ether as straightforward as buying a stock, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, exchanges, or understanding complex blockchain technology. Increased Liquidity: Being traded on major stock exchanges, ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, providing a layer of investor protection and transparency that may be perceived as lacking in direct crypto purchases on unregulated exchanges. This is a key focus for the SEC . Diversification Opportunities: For traditional investors, spot crypto ETFs offer a simple way to diversify their portfolios with exposure to a new asset class, potentially enhancing returns. Lower Entry Barriers: Investors can gain exposure with smaller capital amounts compared to directly buying whole units of Bitcoin or Ether. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Risks for Crypto ETFs Despite the excitement, the path for crypto ETFs is not without its challenges and risks. The SEC ‘s historical reluctance stems from legitimate concerns that still persist to some degree: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price fluctuations, which can lead to significant gains but also substantial losses for investors. ETFs do not mitigate this inherent volatility. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the U.S. has seen some clarity with spot Bitcoin ETFs, the broader regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving. Future policy changes could impact these products. Custody Risks: While the ETF provider handles custody, the underlying risks associated with securing large amounts of digital assets (e.g., hacks, loss of private keys) remain, albeit managed by professional custodians. Market Manipulation Concerns: Despite improvements, the crypto market is still susceptible to manipulation due to its relative immaturity and concentration of ownership. The SEC remains vigilant on this front. Operational Risks: The infrastructure supporting these ETFs, including the underlying exchanges and custodians, must be robust and secure to prevent operational failures. The Road Ahead: What to Expect from the SEC’s Review Process The SEC ‘s review process for ETF applications is rigorous and follows a specific timeline, typically involving several stages. After acknowledgment, the applications enter a period of public comment, followed by a series of deadlines for the SEC to make a decision, which can be extended. For Truth Social’s Ether ETF applications and their spot Bitcoin ETF, the process will involve: Initial Review: The SEC staff examines the application for completeness and compliance with securities laws. Public Comment Period: The public, including industry experts and investors, can submit comments on the proposed ETF. Potential Amendments: Based on feedback and SEC inquiries, the applicant may need to amend their filing multiple times. Decision Deadlines: The SEC has specific deadlines (e.g., 45 days, extendable to 90, then 180, and potentially 240 days) to approve, deny, or delay a decision. Given the precedent set by previous spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, and the ongoing discussions around Ether ETFs, the market will be closely watching each stage of Truth Social’s applications. The SEC’s ultimate decision will hinge on whether the proposed ETFs meet the necessary investor protection and market integrity standards. Broader Market Implications: How Could Approvals Reshape Digital Asset Investment? If Truth Social’s applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and Ether ETF applications are eventually approved, the implications for digital asset investment could be profound. Firstly, it would further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. The entry of a high-profile, non-traditional applicant like Truth Social could signal a broader acceptance of crypto across diverse sectors. Secondly, it would likely drive increased institutional capital into both Bitcoin and Ethereum, potentially leading to greater price stability and market depth. Thirdly, it could spur more innovation in crypto-related financial products, as other companies seek to follow suit. Finally, it might encourage a more favorable regulatory environment globally, as other jurisdictions observe the success and impact of regulated crypto products in the U.S. Actionable Insights for Investors: What Should You Consider? For investors considering exposure to the crypto market through ETFs, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Due Diligence: Even with SEC-regulated products, understand the underlying asset (Bitcoin or Ether), its volatility, and the specific ETF’s structure and fees. Understand the Risks: Recognize that while ETFs offer convenience, they do not eliminate the inherent market risks associated with cryptocurrencies. Only invest what you are prepared to lose. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on the SEC ‘s decisions regarding Truth Social’s applications and other pending crypto ETF filings. Regulatory changes can significantly impact the market. Diversify Your Portfolio: Crypto ETFs can be a valuable addition, but they should be part of a well-diversified investment strategy, not the sole focus. Consult a Financial Advisor: For personalized advice, especially if you are new to crypto or complex financial products, seek guidance from a qualified financial professional. Conclusion The acknowledgment by the SEC of Truth Social’s applications for spot Bitcoin and Ether ETF applications marks a fascinating and potentially transformative moment for the world of digital asset investment . While it’s merely a procedural step and not an approval, it underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and demand for regulated crypto investment products. Truth Social’s unexpected entry into this space adds a unique dimension, blending social media with financial innovation. As the regulatory review process unfolds, the industry will be watching closely, anticipating how these developments could further shape the future of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. The journey towards fully integrated crypto finance continues, promising both opportunities and challenges for investors worldwide.

According to a monthly chart shared by crypto analyst Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow), breaking above the 0.886 logarithmic Fibonacci retracement level, positioned at approximately $2.258, could kickstart a major rally. The chart starts from 2017 to the present, and highlights XRP’s long consolidation phase between 2021 and early 2025, during which the price remained largely suppressed despite broader market fluctuations. This stagnation was followed by a breakout surge that pushed XRP beyond the significant 0.786 ($1.61) and 0.707 ($1.23) levels. $XRP monthly chart Break 0.886 log fib, making all time highs https://t.co/Whs31W09HF pic.twitter.com/AOVoFy2vrY — Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) July 5, 2025 Multiple analysts have predicted an impending breakout , and a monthly close above $2.258 would draw attention to the full Fibonacci extension target near $3.32 and speculative higher targets extending to $8.29 (1.272) and $13.38 (1.414), should momentum persist. Historical Importance of this Resistance Level The 0.886 Fibonacci level is often viewed as the last meaningful resistance before an asset revisits its prior highs. For XRP, this level has held firm since its all-time high in January 2018. While other large-cap assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum reached new all-time highs in subsequent years, XRP has remained below its former peak, constrained by legal uncertainties and shifting investor sentiment. The digital asset closed above this level in January, when it recorded its highest monthly close ever , but market pressure held it down in subsequent months. Now, with momentum building , the digital asset could retest this level again. While XRP has not yet surpassed its historic peak, breaking this barrier would signal an end to its extended accumulation and position the asset in a stronger technical stance than at any point in recent years, setting the stage for a push toward a new all-time high.

According to prediction platform Polymarket, by the end of July the probability of approval for an XRP spot ETF had dropped to just 7%, down from 50% in April and 32% at the beginning of July. The SEC is currently working on guidelines that would streamline the approval process for crypto spot ETFs, according to Reuters, but the regulatory pipeline suggests that any ETF approvals are unlikely to come soon. The SEC’s initial 12-page guidance document, published earlier this month, outlined standards for what ETFs must disclose. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan called the existence of the guidance “an indication of the process of crypto ETFs integrating into the traditional financial system.” Related News: Unexpected Developments in Solana Spot ETFs - Dates for Potential SEC Approval Begin to Clarify However, the main development that the markets are eagerly waiting for is hidden in the second directive, which has not yet been published. This document is expected to include new listing standards that will replace the current 19b-4 application process. It is said that negotiations within the SEC are ongoing and this second document may be completed in the fall. Therefore, market expectations for a new crypto ETF approval have also been postponed to these dates. In this context, there were some expectations that a Solana (SOL)-based ETF could be the first product to be approved. The staking-based Solana ETF, which was launched in the past period, was considered the beginning of the “crypto ETF summer.” However, the SEC’s current approach seems to have weakened these hopes for now. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, global cryptocurrency research firm Populus made a significant declaration that has reverberated across the industry: KRW stablecoin issuance should fundamentally be anchored on the Ethereum network. This isn’t just a casual recommendation; it’s a strategic assertion rooted in Ethereum’s proven track record and unparalleled advantages. But why is Populus so adamant about Ethereum being the definitive home for a Korean Won-backed stablecoin? Why Ethereum Stands Out: A Deep Dive into Populus’s Arguments Populus, in its compelling report titled “KRW Stablecoin Must Be Issued on Ethereum,” laid out a clear rationale for its stance. The firm meticulously detailed several core strengths that position Ethereum as the optimal choice for such a critical financial instrument. These aren’t merely theoretical benefits but are observable realities that have shaped the blockchain landscape: Overwhelming Liquidity: Ethereum boasts the largest and most vibrant decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, translating into immense liquidity. This means a KRW stablecoin on Ethereum would immediately benefit from deep trading pools, easy convertibility, and widespread usability across countless applications. A Proven System: Having operated for years without significant security breaches at its core protocol level, Ethereum has demonstrated remarkable resilience and reliability. Its battle-tested infrastructure provides a robust foundation of trust essential for any national currency-backed stablecoin. Powerful Network Effects: Ethereum’s vast developer community, extensive user base, and interconnected dApps create powerful network effects. A KRW stablecoin issued here would instantly gain access to a broad audience and integrate seamlessly into existing financial primitives. High Security Scale: The sheer scale of Ethereum’s decentralized network, supported by thousands of nodes globally, contributes to its formidable security. The cost and complexity of attacking such a network are prohibitively high, offering a secure environment for valuable assets. Excellent Decentralization: Ethereum’s commitment to decentralization minimizes single points of failure and reduces the risk of censorship or manipulation. This is crucial for a stablecoin, as it ensures transparency and integrity, building confidence among users and regulators alike. The Vision for KRW Stablecoins: Paving the Way for Korean Digital Finance The concept of a KRW stablecoin is not just about digital currency; it’s about bridging traditional finance with the efficiency and innovation of blockchain technology. Such a stablecoin could revolutionize cross-border payments, facilitate instant settlements, and open up new avenues for financial services within Korea and internationally. For a stablecoin to achieve widespread adoption and truly serve as a reliable medium of exchange, its underlying platform must instill absolute confidence. Populus emphasizes that while other networks might offer certain technical efficiencies, none currently match Ethereum’s holistic package of security, liquidity, and decentralization that is critical for a national currency-backed asset. Imagine a future where transferring Korean Won across borders is as simple and instantaneous as sending an email, with minimal fees and complete transparency. This is the promise of a well-executed KRW stablecoin, and Populus argues that Ethereum provides the most fertile ground for this vision to flourish securely and effectively. Navigating Stablecoin Issuance: Ethereum’s Strategic Advantage Populus acknowledges that the landscape of blockchain technology is diverse and constantly evolving. They state that “native issuance support can be provided on networks other than Ethereum.” This is a crucial nuance. While various blockchains offer smart contract capabilities and can theoretically host stablecoins, the initial launch and primary operational base for a significant asset like a Korean Won-backed stablecoin should, according to Populus, be centered on the Ethereum network. This strategic choice is not about exclusivity but about leveraging a platform that has already proven its mettle in high-stakes environments. The process of stablecoin issuance involves not just technical deployment but also significant considerations around regulatory compliance, market acceptance, and long-term stability. Ethereum’s established ecosystem provides a framework where these complex factors can be addressed with greater certainty and less risk. Its robust tooling, well-understood smart contract standards (like ERC-20), and extensive auditing capabilities make it the preferred environment for launching a new, high-stakes financial instrument. Unlocking Unprecedented Blockchain Liquidity with Ethereum One of Ethereum’s most compelling attributes, particularly relevant for a stablecoin, is its unparalleled blockchain liquidity . The network is home to the vast majority of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and other DeFi applications. This means that a KRW stablecoin issued on Ethereum would immediately become accessible to a global network of traders, investors, and users. Consider the following implications: Deep Trading Pools: Instant access to billions of dollars in daily trading volume across various decentralized exchanges, ensuring seamless conversion between the KRW stablecoin and other cryptocurrencies or fiat. DeFi Integration: The ability to easily integrate into existing DeFi protocols for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and other financial services, significantly increasing its utility and reach. Global Reach: While a KRW stablecoin would primarily serve the Korean market, its presence on Ethereum would grant it global accessibility, facilitating international trade and remittances. This inherent liquidity reduces slippage, improves price discovery, and makes the stablecoin a more reliable and efficient medium of exchange for all participants. Fortifying the Future: Ethereum’s Unwavering Blockchain Security For any stablecoin to gain public trust and widespread adoption, its underlying platform’s security is non-negotiable. Populus highlights Ethereum’s high blockchain security as a cornerstone of its recommendation. Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism (after the Merge) and its vast network of validators make it incredibly resilient against attacks. The economic incentives for validators to act honestly, coupled with severe penalties for malicious behavior, create a highly secure environment. Furthermore, the transparency inherent in Ethereum’s public ledger means that all transactions are auditable and verifiable, building a foundation of trust that is critical for a currency-backed asset. The decentralized nature of its governance and operation also minimizes the risk of single points of failure, ensuring that the stablecoin’s integrity is maintained even under adverse conditions. This level of security is paramount for a financial instrument that aims to mirror the stability and reliability of a national currency. Challenges and the Path Forward While Ethereum offers compelling advantages, it’s also important to acknowledge common discussions around its challenges, such as network congestion and gas fees. However, with ongoing developments like Ethereum 2.0 (now the execution layer and consensus layer upgrades) and Layer 2 scaling solutions (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync), these concerns are being actively addressed. These advancements promise to significantly enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs, making Ethereum an even more attractive platform for high-volume financial applications like stablecoins in the future. A Compelling Case for the Future of KRW Stablecoins Populus’s report presents a powerful and well-reasoned argument for establishing the KRW stablecoin on Ethereum. The combination of overwhelming liquidity, a proven and secure system, robust network effects, and unparalleled decentralization creates an environment where a national currency-backed digital asset can thrive. As the world moves further into digital finance, the choice of foundational technology becomes critical. Populus’s insights underscore that for a stablecoin as vital as the KRW, opting for a network that offers stability, security, and expansive reach is not just an advantage—it’s a necessity.

However, beneath the hype lies a lack of clarity. With a documentation rating of just 48%, the project is missing critical details like its purpose, roadmap, or development team, raising serious questions about its legitimacy. Despite clear disclaimers on platforms like CoinMarketCap denying any official link between Elon Musk and the America Party token, traders have latched onto the timing and branding to fuel speculation. It’s a classic memecoin play, capitalizing on real-world buzz for fast, short-lived gains. Others join the party Key gainers include FLOKI , which soared 14.23% after its Valhalla mainnet launch, and BONK, up 6.37% on strong ecosystem growth and a $50M grant program. PEPE rose 5.25% due to whale accumulation, while Dogecoin and Shiba Inu gained 6.3% and 3.43% respectively, fueled by Elon Musk’s pro-crypto stance and massive SHIB burns. Political Drama Adds More Fire Coming back to Elon Musk, his political ambitions haven’t gone unnoticed by rivals. President Donald Trump criticized Musk’s plan, calling it a “ridiculous” third-party agenda that only adds confusion. Interestingly, Musk was previously offered a role heading the Department of Government Efficiency , named D.O.G.E., echoing the Dogecoin meme. This kind of crossover between pop culture, crypto, and politics is what keeps fueling these meme tokens. [post_titles_links postid=”479809″] Polls conducted by Quantus Insights reveal that 40% of Americans would consider supporting Musk if he were to launch a legitimate third party. While 14% said they were “very likely” to back it, 26% were “somewhat likely,” showing a notable appetite for political disruption. Just Hype, No Substance? The American Party crypto seems to be riding the wave of political buzz rather than offering real utility. With no official ties to Elon Musk and limited project transparency, it stands as yet another speculative memecoin fueled by hype, not fundamentals. Analysts are urging caution, comparing it to the TRUMP token pump-and-dump cycle seen just before Trump’s inauguration, suggesting AP could follow a similar path.

It’s a question on many investors’ minds, especially with the recent news of major U.S. stock indices closing lower. While the world of digital assets often prides itself on decentralization and independence, the reality is that traditional market movements can and often do ripple through the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the volatile waters of both financial worlds. Understanding the Recent US Stock Market Downturn The past trading session saw significant declines across the board for the three major U.S. stock markets, signaling a cautious, if not outright bearish, sentiment among investors. Let’s break down the numbers: S&P500: Dropped by -0.79% Nasdaq: Also saw a decline of -0.79% Dow: Led the losses with a more pronounced dip of -0.94% These figures represent more than just percentages; they reflect a collective decision by millions of investors to pull back, re-evaluate, or de-risk their portfolios. Such a broad-based market downturn often stems from underlying economic concerns, and its implications extend far beyond just traditional equities. Table: Major U.S. Stock Market Closures Index Percentage Change S&P500 -0.79% Nasdaq -0.79% Dow -0.94% What Drove the Market Downturn? While a single day’s movement doesn’t tell the whole story, several factors typically contribute to such a broad market downturn . These can include: Inflation Concerns: Persistent high inflation often prompts central banks to consider or implement stricter monetary policies, like interest rate hikes, which can dampen economic growth and corporate earnings. Interest Rate Hikes: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing down economic activity and making bonds more attractive relative to stocks. Geopolitical Tensions: Global conflicts or political instability can create uncertainty, leading investors to seek safer assets or reduce exposure to riskier ones. Corporate Earnings Reports: Disappointing earnings or cautious outlooks from major companies can trigger sell-offs, especially if they signal broader economic weakness. Recession Fears: Growing concerns about a potential economic recession can lead to widespread selling as investors anticipate reduced consumer spending and business activity. These macroeconomic headwinds create a challenging environment for all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Crypto Market Correlation For a long time, cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, were touted as uncorrelated assets – digital gold that would act as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, recent years have shown a growing crypto market correlation with the traditional stock market, particularly with tech-heavy indices like the Nasdaq. Why this increasing correlation? As institutional money flows into crypto, and as more traditional investors enter the space, crypto assets are increasingly treated like other risk assets. When there’s a broader ‘risk-off’ sentiment in the market – meaning investors are pulling money out of riskier assets – both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies tend to suffer. Conversely, during ‘risk-on’ periods, when investors are willing to take on more risk, both tend to perform well. Bitcoin, often seen as the bellwether for the crypto market, has frequently mirrored the movements of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq during periods of significant macroeconomic shifts. This doesn’t mean they move in lockstep every day, but the directional trend often aligns, especially during major market events. This growing correlation means that paying attention to the US stock market is no longer just for traditional investors; it’s crucial for anyone in crypto too. Analyzing Nasdaq Performance and Its Wider Implications The Nasdaq performance is particularly relevant for the crypto space. The Nasdaq Composite Index is heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, many of which are speculative and sensitive to interest rate changes. Cryptocurrencies, too, are often viewed as growth assets, representing the cutting edge of financial technology. When the Nasdaq takes a hit, it often reflects a broader investor sentiment shift away from high-growth, high-risk assets towards more stable, value-oriented investments. This sentiment directly impacts crypto for several reasons: Investor Demographics: Many crypto investors also hold tech stocks, and a downturn in one can lead to liquidity needs or rebalancing in the other. Risk Appetite: A decline in tech stocks signals a reduced appetite for risk, which directly affects speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies. Valuation Metrics: While crypto doesn’t have traditional earnings, the general economic environment that depresses tech valuations can also lead to a reassessment of crypto’s perceived value and future potential. Therefore, understanding the nuances of Nasdaq performance provides valuable clues about the potential trajectory of the crypto market. Navigating the S&P 500 Decline: Strategies for Crypto Investors The S&P 500 decline , representing 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is a broad indicator of the health of the American economy. Its downturn suggests a widespread pullback in investor confidence. For crypto investors, this isn’t just a signal to panic, but an opportunity to refine strategies and think long-term. So, what actionable insights can crypto investors glean from this? Diversification Beyond Crypto: While you might be bullish on crypto, consider diversifying some of your portfolio into less correlated assets, or even traditional safe havens, if your risk tolerance dictates. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consistently investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals can smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average purchase price during a downturn. Focus on Fundamentals: In times of market uncertainty, solid projects with strong use cases, active development, and robust communities tend to weather the storm better than speculative tokens. Do your research! Manage Emotions: Fear and greed are powerful drivers in financial markets. A market downturn can trigger panic selling. Stick to your investment plan and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Stay Informed: Keep an eye not just on crypto news, but also on global economic indicators, central bank policies, and traditional market trends, as they increasingly influence the crypto market correlation . Challenges and Opportunities Amidst Market Volatility A broad market downturn , as seen with the recent declines in the US stock market , presents both significant challenges and unique opportunities for investors. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Downturns often lead to heightened price swings, making it difficult to predict short-term movements. Emotional Stress: Seeing portfolio values drop can be psychologically taxing, leading to fear and potentially irrational decisions like selling at a loss. Uncertainty: It’s hard to know how long a downturn will last or how deep it will go, which adds to investor anxiety. Opportunities: Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, market corrections can offer a chance to acquire assets at lower prices, potentially leading to significant gains when the market recovers. Portfolio Rebalancing: Downturns are a good time to re-evaluate your portfolio, shed underperforming assets, and reallocate to those with stronger long-term potential. Innovation Continues: Bear markets often weed out weaker projects, allowing truly innovative and resilient ones to shine and build for the future. The key is to approach these periods with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective, rather than reacting to every daily fluctuation. In conclusion, the recent dips in the US stock market indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones serve as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global financial markets. While cryptocurrencies strive for independence, their growing maturity and institutional adoption mean they are increasingly susceptible to broader economic trends and investor sentiment that impact traditional assets. Understanding the crypto market correlation with traditional markets, especially the Nasdaq performance and S&P 500 decline , is no longer optional but essential for informed decision-making. By staying vigilant, employing sound investment strategies like dollar-cost averaging, and focusing on the long-term fundamentals of projects, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and potentially emerge stronger.

According to an analyst, with Bitcoin holding steady near $108,000, several altcoins are showing signs of bouncing back. Altcoin 1: Solana Solana (SOL) remains one of the top tokens to stack right now. Price recently bounced around the $150 support zone, and as long as it stays above $146, SOL could aim for $160-$165 in the short term. Solana continues to attract developers and is often seen as a high-potential layer-1 token for the next alt season. Altcoin 2: Ethereum Ethereum (ETH) is another solid bet, holding near its key $2,490 support. This zone marks ETH’s 200-day moving average and a crucial bullish level. If the market turns around, ETH could be one of the first majors to push higher, especially with activity on its network staying strong. Altcoin 3: XRP XRP’s latest chart action has traders watching closely as it approaches a critical resistance level, the 200-day moving average (MA). Historically, this level has acted as both strong support and resistance for XRP, and it’s currently blocking the token’s upward movement. For short-term, support levels to watch are around $2.31 and $2.295. These are possible dip-buy zones where a quick bounce might occur if the price drops. Other Altcoin Plays Lastly, meme coins like Bonk (BONK) and Popcat (POPCAT) are on analysts’ radars for high-risk, high-reward plays. Bonk has been seeing fresh interest from smart money, while Popcat is testing key support around $0.285, with expectations of a short-term bounce from these oversold levels. Virtuals is also hitting a big demand area near $1.47. With multiple indicators like trend lines and moving averages lining up, the analyst expects a bounce of 5-8% soon. It might not be a trend reversal yet, but it’s a spot where short-term upside could play out. SUI is approaching its first major support at $2.78. If the dip continues, a stronger demand zone sits at $2.60.

In a recent post on X, Cobb responded to criticism of the cryptocurrency by predicting that its value could reach $15 by the end of 2025, a move that would represent a dramatic increase from its current market price. The forecast was prompted by an X user who dismissed XRP and criticized community sentiment surrounding the asset. Cobb countered with the view that such negativity could quickly shift if XRP experiences a significant rally over the next few months. Price Target Signals Renewed Optimism The $15 target reflects a roughly 560% increase from XRP’s current value of $2.27. Achieving this level would mark a new all-time high, far surpassing its 2018 peak of $3.84. According to Cobb, this outcome could lead some of the project’s harshest critics to regret their earlier dismissals, especially if they miss out on potential gains. For holders of the token, the implications of a price jump are significant. A position worth $2,270 today would grow to $15,000 if Cobb’s projection is realized, and many community members and analysts have expressed confidence that XRP can hit targets around this level. Drivers Behind Bullish Outlook Cobb’s bullish stance is not isolated. Several analysts have identified technical and structural factors that could support a price move toward $15. Crypto researcher Rob Cunningham has predicted that XRP can reach this level . Chart analyst Ali Martinez has also noted that XRP recently broke out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern, a development often interpreted as a prelude to upward momentum. This technical signal has further reinforced expectations of a sustained rally targeting $15 . In addition, earlier this year, community commentator Zach Rector suggested that XRP’s price could benefit from the approval and adoption of spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which may bring new capital inflows into the asset.

Though his message was cryptic, it sparked conversation among long-time supporters. Cobb was among those who responded, posting an image and comment referencing XRP’s long-standing presence in the crypto ecosystem. However, the response drew backlash from some observers, including a critic who dismissed Cobb’s post as unserious and harmful to XRP’s reputation. Critics have not deterred him as he is confident the asset can reach $15 target this year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This isn’t a fantasy; it’s precisely what happened in the world of cryptocurrency, specifically with an Ethereum wallet that recently stirred from a nearly decade-long slumber. This extraordinary event highlights the incredible potential and long-term value appreciation within the crypto space, captivating investors and enthusiasts alike. The Awakening of a Decade-Old Dormant Wallet The cryptocurrency community was abuzz recently with news of a significant transaction originating from an Ethereum wallet that had been inactive for an astonishing 9.9 years. This isn’t just any old wallet; it’s a pre-mine address, meaning its contents were acquired during Ethereum’s earliest distribution phase. The wallet, which held 900 ETH, was reactivated, leading to the movement of these long-held assets. This kind of activity from a dormant wallet often sparks curiosity and speculation within the market, as it can sometimes signal shifts in long-term holder sentiment or simply a forgotten fortune being rediscovered. Let’s break down the remarkable numbers behind this reawakening: Initial Acquisition: 900 ETH Acquisition Price (ICO Era): Approximately $0.31 per ETH Total Initial Investment: Around $279 Current Valuation: Over $2.27 million Value Multiplier: A staggering 8,100 times increase! This dramatic surge in value underscores the volatile yet potentially highly rewarding nature of early cryptocurrency investments, particularly for those who held through multiple market cycles. A Glimpse into the ICO Era: When ETH Was Pennies To truly appreciate the magnitude of this gain, we need to transport ourselves back to the ICO era . The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for Ethereum took place in 2014. During this period, participants could acquire ETH for a fraction of a dollar. For many, it was a speculative investment in a nascent technology with an uncertain future. Ethereum, then just a whitepaper vision, promised to be a decentralized world computer, a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Few could have predicted the profound impact it would have on the global financial and technological landscape. The individual behind this particular dormant wallet was one of those early believers, or perhaps someone who simply bought a small amount and forgot about it. Their initial outlay of just $279 for 900 ETH seems almost unbelievable today, especially when considering the millions it’s now worth. This serves as a powerful reminder of the ‘pioneer’ advantage in emerging technologies – getting in early can yield exponential returns, but it also comes with significant risk and uncertainty. Understanding the ETH Price Trajectory: A Decade of Growth The journey of the ETH price from its humble beginnings to its current multi-thousand-dollar valuation is a saga of innovation, adoption, and market cycles. After the ICO, ETH saw gradual growth, followed by the massive bull run of 2017, where it first breached significant price points. Then came the crypto winter of 2018, testing the conviction of many holders. However, Ethereum continued to build, evolve, and attract developers, leading to another parabolic rise in 2021 and maintaining a strong position in the market ever since. Here’s a simplified timeline of ETH price milestones (approximate): Year Key Event/Price Action Significance 2014 Ethereum ICO (approx. $0.31) Foundation of the network; early investor entry point. 2017 Breaks $100, then $700+ First major bull run; widespread awareness. 2018 Crypto Winter (price decline) Market correction; testing investor conviction. 2021 All-time high (over $4,800) Fueled by DeFi, NFTs, and institutional interest. 2022-2023 Merge Upgrade, Market Consolidation Transition to Proof-of-Stake; continued ecosystem growth. 2024 Current Price (over $2,500) Resilient market performance; sustained utility. This wallet’s activation after such a long period perfectly encapsulates the ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) philosophy, demonstrating that patience can indeed be a virtue in the volatile crypto markets. Implications for the Broader Crypto Market When a significant dormant wallet moves its assets, it often draws attention from analysts and investors. While 900 ETH is a substantial amount for an individual, its impact on the overall crypto market is generally minimal. Ethereum’s daily trading volume runs into billions of dollars, so a $2.2 million transaction is a drop in the ocean. However, these movements are often seen as indicators or points of interest for several reasons: Long-Term Holder Sentiment: Does it signal that early investors are starting to take profits, or is it merely a rebalancing? Security Concerns: Is the wallet holder still alive? Did they lose their keys and just find them? Or was it a security breach (less likely if funds are just moved to another address)? Market Narrative: These stories reinforce the narrative of crypto as a generational wealth-building opportunity, attracting new interest. Such events serve as powerful case studies, reminding everyone of the transformational potential that has defined the crypto market since its inception. They highlight that while volatility is inherent, the long-term trend for foundational assets like Ethereum has been overwhelmingly positive. Lessons from the Long-Term Holder: What Can We Learn? The saga of this Ethereum wallet offers several invaluable lessons for anyone navigating the complex world of cryptocurrency investments: 1. The Power of Patience (HODL) This is perhaps the most obvious takeaway. While day trading can be lucrative for some, the most significant gains in crypto have historically gone to those with the conviction to hold through market highs and lows. This wallet’s journey from $279 to over $2.2 million is a testament to extreme patience. 2. The Importance of Security Whether this investor simply forgot about their ETH or deliberately held it, the fact that they maintained access to their private keys for a decade is remarkable. Securely storing your seed phrase or private keys offline (in a hardware wallet, for example) is paramount. Losing access to your crypto is equivalent to burning your money. 3. Early Adoption Rewards Being an early adopter in a revolutionary technology carries immense upside potential. However, it also means investing in unproven concepts with high failure rates. For every Ethereum, there are countless ICOs that failed. Due diligence and risk assessment are crucial. 4. Understanding Market Cycles The crypto market operates in distinct cycles of bull runs and bear markets. Long-term holders understand that dips are often temporary and that innovation continues regardless of price action. This allows them to avoid panic selling and position themselves for the next upward trend. 5. Diversification vs. Conviction While diversification is generally advised in traditional investing, crypto sometimes rewards strong conviction in a few foundational assets. This wallet holder had a singular focus on ETH. The challenge lies in identifying which assets have true long-term potential. What’s Next for Ethereum? The reawakening of an old wallet doesn’t change Ethereum’s fundamentals, but it does shine a spotlight on its enduring value. Ethereum continues to be a cornerstone of the decentralized web, with ongoing developments like the transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism (The Merge), scalability solutions (Layer 2s), and future upgrades aimed at enhancing its efficiency and reducing transaction costs. The network’s robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and various dApps, ensures its continued relevance and growth in the evolving crypto market . As the crypto space matures, stories like these will become more common, serving as powerful reminders of the early days and the incredible wealth creation that has occurred. They also highlight the increasing importance of secure asset management and a clear long-term investment strategy. Conclusion: A Fortune Rediscovered, A Future Reaffirmed The movement of 900 ETH from a wallet dormant for nearly a decade is more than just a transaction; it’s a compelling narrative of foresight, patience, or perhaps sheer luck, culminating in an unbelievable fortune. This single event encapsulates the transformative power of cryptocurrency and the unprecedented opportunities it has presented to early investors. It serves as a powerful reminder of Ethereum’s journey from a nascent project in the ICO era to a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, solidifying its position as a digital asset with enduring value. For anyone in the crypto space, this story is a beacon of hope and a testament to the potential rewards of a long-term vision in this dynamic market.
