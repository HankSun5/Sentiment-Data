BONK developers announced in a statement that the token burn amount was set at 1 trillion tokens. This corresponds to approximately $22 million at the time of writing. BONK's market value is currently around $1.8 billion. Although the developers did not give a clear date or time, they announced a few minutes ago that they were about to reach 1 million token holders. One million holders soon Then one trillion $BONK burned — BONK!!!

It should not be forgotten that memecoins are particularly high-risk assets. In such developments, especially in the cryptocurrency market and memecoins, the expected impact may sometimes not come or may have been priced in in advance. It should also be kept in mind that the burn level is low compared to the total market value. *This is not investment advice.

The regulator has opened a new public comment window, which stalls decision-making. The latest revision mandates that responses be filed within 21 days and rebuttals within 35 days of publication in the Federal Register of the filing. The companies also had S-1 registrations with Fidelity, placing it with a Solana ETF on June 13, followed by 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary. The SEC review process has now officially reached a critical evaluation phase, with the agency seeking comments on matters touching on the products’ structure, market integrity, and investor protection systems. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said this was a largely expected delay. More recently, he cited the gradual manner in which the SEC has treated altcoin-secured or tied ETFs, citing regulatory uncertainty as a factor that has chilled broader adoption. MORE delays. @Fidelity 's Solana ETF filing was just delayed as expected. We're still waiting for some sort of movement from the SEC on a generalized digital asset ETP framework. pic.twitter.com/8m2DSdHJYV — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) July 7, 2025 Push for revised applications hints at progress Even after the most recent hold, the SEC seems to be gearing up toward reviewing more formally. The agency has directed the issuers to revise and refile the Solana ETF applications no later than the end of July. The revisions will also need to contain more current language related to in-kind redemption and staking, which will align with the SEC, which changed its guidance. The demand for amended filings is an indication of a more proactive regulatory approach to altcoin ETFs. According to sources, the SEC plans to rush through at least one SOL-based product before its October 10 deadline to issue a final ruling. There is some internal speculation that reviews will be completed long before that date. In June, the SEC released its initial official guidance regarding exchange-traded products that track digital assets. In parallel, there is a second regulatory document under development. It would potentially cut the ETF listing process timeline in half, bringing down the average timeframe of 200 days to approximately 75. In case of adoption, the change will represent a significant step that will be hailed by crypto ETF applicants, aiming to enter the market faster. Firms turn to workarounds amid delays Some asset managers are diverting to different alternatives as spot ETF authorizations have stalled. Recently, the REX-Osprey Sol + Staking ETF was launched between REX Financial and Osprey Funds. Although not a direct Solana ETF , the product provides exposure to SOL-linked assets and staking-related yields. The ETF shall not directly own Solana, but aims to track its economic profile by applying structured exposure to assets of the Solana ecosystem. Despite their lack of SEC regulation, this launch underscores the growing demand for Solana-related offerings. Other altcoin ETFs , such as those connected to XRP and meme-based tokens, have also been filed, but regulatory decision-making is still pending.

Donald Trump Unleashes on Elon Musk Trump had some choice words for Musk after he announced the creation of the “America Party” in a Saturday, July 5 X post. By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it! When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy. Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom. https://t.co/9K8AD04QQN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 5, 2025 “I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely ‘off the rails,’ essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,” Trump stated in part in the July 6 social media post. “He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States…” Trump also took a swipe at his Democratic political opponents – who have spoken out against his latest crypto ventures in recent months – by stating that they had “lost their confidence and their minds!” “The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats,” Trump added. Elon Musk Criticizes Trump’s Big Beautiful Big Trump’s commentary comes amid a growing divide between Musk and the sitting U.S. president just months after the X CEO stepped away from his White House role. Musk has openly expressed criticism of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” in recent weeks, arguing that the budget legislation would negatively impact America’s economy. “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore,” he wrote. “This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination.” Trump indicated in Sunday’s Truth Social post that the long term crypto investor was unhappy with the bill’s lack of an electric vehicle mandate. “I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate – It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had,” Trump said. “He said he had no problems with that – I was very surprised!” It remains to be seen what stance the America Party will have toward digital assets once fully fleshed out.

TON says the move is an independent initiative with no official backing from the UAE government. In a blog, the foundation said , “TON Foundation is aware of the premature announcement that circulated on X regarding a UAE Golden Visa initiative offered by TON. While we understand the community’s interest and enthusiasm, it’s necessary to provide clarity.” According to the TON Foundation, it is still in the early stages of development with an approved partner to look into making a UAE Golden Visa. The group also said that any authority for the program rested entirely with the UAE government entities and was subject to applicable laws and regulations. “To clarify, no official Golden Visa program has launched in partnership with the government of the United Arab Emirates, nor has any governmental endorsement been granted to TON,” the official statement reads. TON Foundation supports the UAE’s joint statement Initially, TON announced on the Toncoin website, claiming that holders could apply for the country’s ten-year Golden Visa by staking at least $100,000 worth of the cryptocurrency for three years and paying a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The story also got traction after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov retweeted an X post with details of the program. BREAKING: 🇦🇪 TON HAS JUST PARTNERED WITH UAE TO OFFER 10 YEAR GOLDEN VISA TO TON STAKERS. – STAKE $100,000 $TON FOR 3 YEARS – 10 YEARS DUBAI GOLDEN VISA – SPOUSE / FAMILY INCLUDED – $35,000 GOVT FEES MASSIVE FOR CRYPTO ADOPTION 🚀 pic.twitter.com/UC7ywfV5HF — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 6, 2025 The announcement prompted a quick response from the UAE’s Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. They published a joint statement saying that the visas were not being issued to digital asset holders. TON has reacted to the UAE response saying, “We fully support the joint statement issued by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), which confirms that no digital residency or investment visa initiatives have been formally approved or launched in partnership with the UAE government.” This is the second time that Pavel Durov has announced a project prematurely. In May, the Telegram founder said that Telegram had partnered with Elon Musk’s xAI. Soon after, Musk clarified that the deal had not yet been signed. Golden visa eligibility The UAE government created the golden visa in 2019 as a long-term stay visa to bring skilled people to the area. According to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security, foreigners can live, work, and study in the UAE without needing a national sponsor. The visas last for five to ten years. Users must meet strict requirements, such as having certain skills, like being a doctor, scientist, or researcher. Also, entrepreneurs and investors who own a tech-based startup that has been listed and is recognized by the UAE government can also apply. Meanwhile, there is no word on whether the TON Foundation will work with the UAE government in the future. Its offer of a golden visa for $100,000 in signed Toncoin could be a lot cheaper than the usual ways to get one through official channels, which usually require a minimum investment of $540,000 in illiquid assets. Other countries have made it possible to become a resident by making big investments, but these investments haven’t always been tied to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In Portugal, investors holding more than $500,000 in crypto could obtain citizenship through the country’s Golden Residence Permit Program, a five-year residence-by-investment program for non-EU nationals. President Donald Trump of the United States announced a “gold card” program in February. This program would give investors who pay at least $5 million permanent residency in the United States. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that as of June 17, about 70,000 people had signed up for the project.

Bitcoin, which had shown signs of renewed bullish momentum in recent weeks, fell below $108,000 after Trump issued tariff threats against multiple U.S. trading partners, reviving concerns that have long haunted investors since his return to office in January. Shortly after noon, Trump released letters addressed to Japan and South Korea warning of new 25% duties, echoing the dramatic tone of his “Liberation Day” speech on April 2. Trump announces tariffs on Japan and South Korea. 25% each. This is the reward they get for being loyal vassals. pic.twitter.com/udpdduQZHi — ADAM (@AdameMedia) July 7, 2025 He accused both countries of unfair trade practices and transshipping goods from other nations to dodge tariffs. The proposed levies are set to take effect August 1, unless renegotiations yield what Trump calls “fairer deals.” By late afternoon, the list of targeted countries had grown. Trump announced intentions to slap tariffs of up to 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, 30% on South Africa, and 25% on Malaysia and Kazakhstan. The tariffs would be implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a move still subject to ongoing court review. Bitcoin Falls to $107K as Investors Flee Risk on Trump Tariff Delay The market response was swift. U.S. stocks fell sharply , with the S&P 500 dropping nearly 1%, its worst single-day decline in three weeks. Japanese automakers were hit particularly hard, with shares of Toyota and Honda down 4.1% and 3.8%, respectively. The dollar surged against the yen and won, as investors sought safer ground. Bitcoin was not spared. After flirting with an all-time high of $111,814 last week, BTC slid 0.74% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at $107,936.08. Source: CoinGecko While the dip may appear modest, analysts say the timing, coming just as equities began tumbling, suggests Bitcoin is increasingly being treated as a risk asset during geopolitical uncertainty. The crash comes amid rising confusion over the White House’s trade strategy. For weeks, investors had been eyeing July 9 as a critical tariff deadline, set by Trump himself after a chaotic string of announcements in early spring. But on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the president would sign an executive order delaying that deadline to August 1. “President Trump is determined to bring reciprocal balance to trade, and the new timeline ensures our partners have every opportunity to reach fair agreements,” Leavitt told reporters. . @PressSec Karoline Leavitt on tariff deadline: ""The president will also sign an executive order today, delaying the July 9th deadline to August 1st"" pic.twitter.com/jMXn8cCalz — CSPAN (@cspan) July 7, 2025 The delay, however, may only be stoking more uncertainty. Trump has a history of reversing course on trade policy with little notice, making it difficult for investors and foreign governments alike to plan. As White House spokesman Kush Desai put it bluntly , “Any decisions around trade will come directly from the president himself.” Trump also added a fresh layer of pressure on Sunday, threatening a 10% additional tariff on any country aligning with BRICS policies, a clear swipe at Brazil, Russia, India, and China, whose leaders were meeting in Rio de Janeiro. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent sought to calm markets Monday, noting that Trump is focused on “the quality of deals, not the quantity,” but stopped short of naming any countries nearing agreement. Crypto investors, long accustomed to Bitcoin’s volatility, now find themselves navigating new macro headwinds. Bitcoin’s trading volume rose slightly, up 2.04% to $26.9 billion, as traders responded to the latest geopolitical flare-up. But with the August 1 tariff deadline looming and trade policy in flux, the path forward remains uncertain. Bitcoin Futures Rebound, but Price Action Signals Caution Bitcoin futures markets are showing signs of renewed optimism, with aggregated open interest climbing 7% over the past month, the first sustained increase since BTC’s 12% decline between May and June. The rise in open interest suggests growing trader confidence, as more capital flows into long positions. Aggregated Open Interest in Bitcoin Futures. Source: Axel Adler Jr However, the price action tells a more cautious story. After briefly touching $109,500, Bitcoin has slipped back to around $108,000, forming a double top pattern on lower timeframes, a potential warning sign of hesitation among bulls. At the same time, net long exposure in Bitcoin futures stands at $27.4 million, remaining in positive territory for over 24 hours. But price remains stuck in a tight range, and analysts are watching key technical levels closely. Notably, BTC continues to trade above short-term support at the 200-day EMA on the one-hour chart. However, multiple bounces from the $107,300 zone have created a cluster of “equal lows,” an area often targeted for liquidity sweeps. Bitcoin one-hour chart. Source: TradingView A break below that level could trigger a stop-loss cascade, potentially dragging the price into a fair value gap between $107,000 and $106,300. “If buyers fail to step in strongly below $107K, we could see deeper losses toward $105,000,” one analyst warned. Still, there’s room for upside. A strong recovery from below $107,000 could reignite momentum, especially if buy-side pressure lifts BTC back above $108,000. More decisively, a clean break above $109,500 would invalidate the downside scenario and open the door for a push toward the $112,000 range. For now, all eyes are on August 1. Whether it’s the start of another full-blown trade war or just the latest bluff in Trump’s economic playbook, the crypto market, like Wall Street, is bracing for impact.

This insight is powered by Outset PR , a data-driven crypto communications agency that helps digital assets gain attention through a combination of media intelligence, strategic narrative timing, and performance-driven outreach. The Market Impact This marks the first time XRP has been included in a U.S.-regulated spot ETF, following its long-running legal battles with the SEC. The inclusion legitimizes XRP in the eyes of institutional investors, reinforcing its status as a core asset in the crypto space. Through GDLC’s ETF wrapper, institutional and retail investors can now gain indirect exposure to XRP without needing to hold or custody the token themselves. This lowers the barrier to entry and may drive new capital into XRP markets. With XRP under regulatory scrutiny since 2020 due to the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs, its inclusion in a spot ETF signals a turning tide in regulatory perception. This move could influence the approval of other XRP-related financial products in the future. XRP Price Analysis and Prediction Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35. It has been on a positive trend lately. In the past week, its price saw a rise of about 5.7%. Over the past month, it climbed by nearly 7.9%. If XRP can break through the nearest resistance level of $2.43, it might aim for the $2.60 mark, which would mean a potential growth of more than ten percent from its current range. Overall, XRP appears to have a promising outlook, with support levels not too far below, suggesting a strong market interest. The recent price increase and current momentum indicate a healthy interest from investors.

You might wonder which coins truly offer potential and not just empty promises. That’s where this guide helps. We’ve looked into BlockDAG, Toncoin, Hedera, and Litecoin, four names that are grabbing attention for good reasons. Each of these is making waves because of their growth, real use cases, or strong plans for the future. Whether you’re interested in new tech, solid systems, or coins that have stood the test of time, these picks cover it all. And yes, these are some of the fastest growing cryptos worth watching right now. Keep reading to see why they are in focus today. 1. BlockDAG: Strong Growth Numbers with Key Features Already in Place BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the fastest-growing cryptos this year. The project is now in Batch 29, with a current price of $0.0276. But thanks to BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release promo, buyers can grab coins at a special price of $0.0016 until August 11. This brings back one more chance to jump in with a low price. So far, BlockDAG (BDAG) has raised $332 million and sold 23.5 billion coins. The launch price is set at $0.05, which means early buyers have already seen a 2,660% gain compared to the first batch price. What’s pushing BlockDAG ahead is not just its price. The project has over 2 million users on its mobile mining app. The X30 and X100 mining rigs will ship by July 7, with the X10 rigs coming in August. The team has also passed checks from top security firms like CertiK and Halborn. Big exchange listings are lined up, including MEXC, LBANK, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. BlockDAG shows how a project can build trust while being one of the fastest growing cryptos today. 2. Toncoin: Gaining Momentum with Telegram’s Support Toncoin continues to draw attention as one of the fastest growing cryptos because of its strong link to Telegram. This popular messaging app helps Toncoin reach millions of users easily. The coin is making crypto use simple inside chats, whether for payments or bot functions. This makes its role more than just hype; Toncoin offers a real-world solution people can use now. Toncoin’s price recently touched around $7. Even with the ups and downs of the market, it has held its ground well. More upgrades and tools are coming, so Toncoin still offers a fresh chance for those looking at coins with actual use. It’s not just early excitement, it’s about growth that’s tied to real demand. 3. Hedera (HBAR): Tech Focused and Ready for Business Hedera has carved out a spot among the fastest growing cryptos by offering something different. It runs on Hashgraph, not a traditional blockchain. This tech lets it process transactions faster and with lower fees. Big names like IBM and Google support Hedera as part of its council, adding to its strength. HBAR is trading at around $0.075. Its steady price moves and real-world uses make it stand out. You won’t see sudden price spikes like with meme coins. But Hedera’s true power is in its steady progress. It’s used in areas like identity and supply chains, showing its value beyond just trading. This mix of tech and trusted partnerships keeps Hedera on lists of top coins to check out. 4. Litecoin: Longtime Player Still in the Game Litecoin proves that older coins can still be part of the fastest growing cryptos list. It’s often called digital silver and is known for faster, cheaper transactions compared to Bitcoin. People still use it for payments, and it’s accepted widely across exchanges and by merchants. Right now, Litecoin is priced near $73. It’s showing strength again after earlier dips this year. Events like halvings keep Litecoin in the news, but what really keeps it going is trust. Even with newer projects on the scene, Litecoin holds a spot as a solid choice for those who want reliability. Wrap Up! When you look at the fastest growing cryptos, these four projects offer a good mix of what’s working today. BlockDAG offers big growth potential with a rare low entry price during its promo window. Toncoin and Hedera show how crypto can blend with daily tools and business systems. Litecoin proves that being around for years doesn’t mean a coin can’t still deliver. If you’re thinking about getting into crypto or adding to your list, these fastest growing cryptos give you options that are trending for good reasons. Focus on what’s growing for the right reasons and not just hype. BlockDAG’s current low price, Toncoin’s app ties, Hedera’s smart tech, and Litecoin’s steady path are all worth keeping an eye on right now.

Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining momentum. This scenario raises an intriguing question: which cryptocurrency will make the next big move? Readers will find an in-depth analysis of the current market trends and potential breakout opportunities for both BTC and ETH in this article. This spotlight analysis is brought to you by Outset PR , the leading crypto-native agency that blends media intelligence, strategic timing, and results-driven outreach to help web3 projects break through the noise and capture market attention at the moments that count. Bitcoin Eyes Upward Movement with Potential for Growth Source: tradingview Bitcoin's current price hovers between a bit over $106K and $111K. Since last month, the value has increased by nearly 4%, showing signs of positive momentum. Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin testing the resistance level just under $114K, with further potential to reach nearly $119K if this barrier is crossed. This would mean a possible increase of around 12% from the lower price range. The coin's recent six-month gain of over 11% hints at long-term strength. Support levels at around $103K and $97K help cushion any downside. With such dynamic moves, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a growth opportunity. Ethereum on a Steady Climb: Will It Break New Heights Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price is currently moving between two thousand four hundred and nineteen dollars to slightly over two thousand six hundred and eighty dollars. It's been on a gentle rise over the past week with a near two percent increase. Analysts see it challenging the next resistance level at two thousand seven hundred eighty-nine dollars. If it manages to surge past this, the next target to watch is around the three thousand fifty-dollar mark. If achieved, this could mean an increase of about fourteen to twenty-four percent from its current range. As the crypto scene buzzes with anticipation, investors maintain a watchful eye on these key levels.

We don’t want an emperor”. Lula rejected any suggestion of U.S. economic dominance, Reuters reported. The comment came as the BRICS summit wrapped up in Rio de Janeiro on Monday, where leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa pushed back against President Donald Trump’s threat of extra tariffs on their countries. They made clear that emerging economies intend to chart their own course in global trade. Trump’s warning arrived late on Sunday, just as his administration was finalizing a series of trade deals ahead of a July 9 deadline for imposing so-called “retaliatory tariffs.” U.S. officials have said these measures could target any nation whose policies are judged hostile to American interests. A source from the U.S. told Reuters that Washington does not aim to immediately impose a further 10% levy on BRICS imports. Instead, the option would only be used if a country implements what the administration labels measures viewed as unfriendly to U.S. interests. Lula said the BRICS bloc comprises countries pursuing a different approach to the global economic order. He suggested that the desire for change is what unsettles traditional powers. “This is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organizing the world from the economic perspective” he explained to journalists. In February, Trump escalated the rhetoric by warning of “full-scale duties” if BRICS moved to weaken the U.S. dollar’s role in global markets. In response, Brazil’s BRICS presidency dropped earlier talks on a shared currency, an idea some members had floated the previous year. Brazilian President calls for a slow shift from the dollar in trade On Monday, Lula again called for reducing dependence on the dollar in trade settlements. “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don’t have to pass through the dollar,” he said. He added that any change must be gradual and coordinated through discussions among central banks until new arrangements are solidified. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of South Africa, said that the bloc does not want to single out one power. He was confident that there could still be a trade agreement between the U.S. and South Africa. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that tariffs “should not be used as a tool for coercion and pressuring”. She stressed that the BRICS framework promotes mutually beneficial collaboration and is not aimed at any particular nation. A Kremlin spokesperson echoed that view, saying Russia’s cooperation with BRICS is based on a shared global outlook and “will never be directed against third countries.” India stayed silent towards Trump’s threat. Indonesia’s coordinating minister for economic affairs, Airlangga Hartarto, who attended the summit in Rio, was scheduled to fly to Washington on Monday to lead discussions on U.S. tariffs. Malaysia, which joined as a partner after its 24 % tariffs were removed, said it maintains independent economic policies and does not align itself on ideological grounds. With forums such as the G7 and G20 hampered by divisions and Washington’s “America First” approach, BRICS has positioned itself as a forum for multilateral diplomacy amid rising trade conflicts and regional tensions. In a combined statement on Sunday, summit leaders condemned the recent bombing of Iran and warned that growing tariff barriers threaten the stability of world trade, a veiled critique of U.S. policy. BRICS first came together in 2009 with Brazil, Russia, India and China. South Africa joined in 2010, and last year the group expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has accepted an invitation to full membership but is attending this summit only as a partner. More than 30 nations have expressed interest in joining BRICS as either full members or partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The latest blow came just two days after Elon announced plans to create a new political party, a decision that’s now rattling Wall Street and hammering Tesla’s valuation again for a second consecutive session. Elon said Saturday the party’s goal would be to flip “2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” claiming that would give him enough leverage to decide which laws pass. “Enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring that they serve the true will of the people,” Elon wrote. Traders didn’t seem to share his optimism. Shares of Tesla plunged immediately after markets opened Monday, dragging the Nasdaq deeper into red as investors digested the consequences of their CEO turning into a full-time political actor. Elon Musk stands by his decision as Tesla sinks Elon’s renewed focus on politics comes as US equities take broader hits. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 400 points Monday, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.9%. The entire stock market took a hit after Trump announced new tariffs that will go into effect August 1. The penalties target 14 countries, Bangladesh, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, and Tunisia, across a wide range of imports. Trump’s administration said the new tariffs would be just the first batch. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Monday that more announcements are coming this week. She added that Trump will sign an executive order extending the tariff implementation deadline to August 1, replacing his original, earlier date. Dow futures dropped 87 points, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures slid 0.16% and 0.15%, respectively, just hours before the cash markets opened Monday. With all that background noise, Elon’s latest headline-grabbing play couldn’t have landed at a worse time. Danny Ives, who leads global tech research at Wedbush Securities, said in a client note that the decision is only making things worse. “Very simply Elon diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Danny wrote Sunday. He added that while Elon’s loyalists will back him no matter what, “there is broader sense of exhaustion from many Tesla investors that Elon keeps heading down the political track.” On Sunday, Trump told reporters that Elon’s plan to launch a party was “ridiculous” and said the Tesla CEO had gone “completely off the rails.” Market strategists still think the sell-off may be temporary. Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, told CNBC’s Closing Bell that confusion is playing a big role. “If you go through the details, I don’t even know if anybody understands the difference between what was announced today, what was there previously, and if it will actually be implemented, and which companies it actually impacts,” Parker said Monday. He added that it could just be a breather before earnings season. “So, I think it’s just a little bit of selling as we got the highs, and kind of recalibrating before July earnings season,” he said. “But I don’t think this is the sign of a new regime at all.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

It has already launched a cryptoasset named Polaris Share (POLA), which it operates via its subsidiary Polaris Share Tech. Polaris Share (POLA) prices in KRW over the past 12 months.

The media outlet quoted a Polaris Office spokesperson as saying: “Stablecoins are the starting point of the web3 transition. They are part of a digital infrastructure that connects data, payments, and contracts. In the future, we will create a range of new markets, as well as a knowledge-sharing platform centered around POLAKRW.” More South Korean Banks Eye Stablecoin Launches Busan Ilbo , meanwhile, reported that the BNK Financial Group has also applied for 25 stablecoin trademarks.

Contrary to assumptions that he received tokens as compensation for his foundational role in the project, Schwartz confirmed that he acquired his XRP holdings independently from the open market. Early Purchase Confirmed at $0.006 In a recent interaction with the XRP community, Schwartz disclosed that he bought XRP for $0.006 per token. His comments came in response to a post from Stedas , a well-known community figure, who suggested that XRP veterans, often referred to as “OGs”, entered the market when the token was trading around $0.50. Schwartz’s response underlined that his entry was at a significantly earlier and lower valuation. $0.006 — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 5, 2025 This clarification also aligns with statements Schwartz has made in the past. In earlier interviews, he explained that he did not receive XRP as part of Ripple’s initial token distribution. Instead, he opted to take Ripple stock, a decision he has publicly reflected on given XRP’s superior liquidity. Schwartz also mentioned that during the early days of Ripple, he was offered the choice to receive his salary in XRP but chose to take payments in cash for immediate financial needs. He emphasized that acquiring XRP from exchanges was always an option available to him. XRP’s Long-Term Price Action and Market Behavior Between 2022 and late 2025, XRP traded near the $0.50 mark for extended periods, providing several windows of opportunity for accumulation at that price level. However, the token eventually broke out above that range during a significant market rally in November 2025, which coincided with a broader uptick across the crypto space. Following this breakout, XRP surpassed both the $0.50 and $1 levels and has more recently maintained a price of around $2.28. During this price surge, many new investors entered the market. Still, long-term holders who purchased during its extended consolidation phase have seen significantly larger gains. Schwartz’s early acquisition at $0.006 places him among the earliest adopters with one of the lowest known entry points. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP at $10 In April, Schwartz revealed that at one point, his XRP balance peaked at 26 million tokens. Although the exact timing of these purchases is unclear, if he acquired the entire amount at his reported entry price of $0.006, the total investment would have amounted to just $156,000. At the current trading price of $2.28 , those 26 million tokens would be valued at approximately $58.5 million. This represents an unrealized gain of over $58 million, assuming the holdings were maintained in full. However, Schwartz has previously stated that he has not sold significant amounts of his XRP, though his current holdings are not publicly known. If XRP were to reach $10, as forecasted by analysts such as EGRAG based on technical indicators, the value of Schwartz’s peak holdings could climb to $260 million, assuming he still holds the full 26 million XRP. While projections vary, Schwartz’s early investment provides a compelling case study of long-term value appreciation in the cryptocurrency sector.

47755541,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=761999,1751931021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47755541.jpeg,Chinese exporters crushed under the weight of rare earth export controls,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinese-exporters-losers-china-rare-earth/,"China’s dominance in the rare earth supply chain has historically given it leverage over global markets. Its recent export restrictions, however, are having a lasting negative effect on the sector. Chinese magnet producers are now facing piling inventories while also dealing with a failing economy and weakened EV demand. China’s rare earth export restrictions , which were implemented in April as a retaliation against U.S. tariffs, have dealt a heavy blow to the country’s domestic magnet manufacturers, many of whom were already contending with a weak economy and declining demand for electric vehicle (EV) makers. Rare earth magnets are essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and a host of other high-tech applications, and China produces around 90% of the world’s supply. Chinese exporters crushed under the weight of rare earth export controls Public filings from the 11 largest listed Chinese magnet producers show that exports accounted for 18% to 50% of their 2024 revenues, which shows the sector’s reliance on international customers. The short-term fallout has been severe on the industry. Magnet exports have dropped by 75% within two months of the restrictions, and some global automakers were also forced to pause production. In the meantime, inventory was piling up in domestic warehouses as producers waited on export licenses, according to Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange, a state-backed trading platform. “Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends—disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” Ellie Saklatvala, the head of metal pricing at Argus, said. Some small and mid-sized producers responded by cutting production by 15% in April and May, according to industry insiders. But for many, this was not enough to stave off what the Baotou exchange described as a “crisis” for local magnet makers. Long-term uncertainty despite rare earth control easing Even though the U.S. and China announced a deal on June 27 to reverse the export restrictions , the damage has already been done. The Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange warned that any resumption of normal export activity would take time, stating that inventory levels remain high and licensing requirements continue to delay shipments. “Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals—such as antimony—it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” Argus’ Saklatvala said. Export curbs on germanium and antimony imposed in 2023 and 2024 still haven’t fully recovered. Europe is still receiving only a fraction of the antimony volumes seen before the controls. This has already impacted lead-acid battery production, particularly in the automotive sector. In the case of rare earths, the challenge is compounded by the specialized nature of magnet products. Many of them are tailor-made for specific clients and cannot be easily resold within China, forcing companies to store finished goods while they await the necessary licenses. Four industry sources told Reuters that the licensing process was both opaque and burdensome, further complicating the recovery efforts. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said. “The large amounts of information now required by licensing authorities represent a permanent change for the industry and will add delays and costs for producers.” Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co. noted in its April annual report that deteriorating international conditions could cut into export revenue. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had obtained export licenses and that production remained normal, but refrained from making detailed comments until its upcoming financial filings. Industry analysts and insiders speculate that the increased pressure could spur consolidation among the hundreds of manufacturers that populate China’s rare earth sector , which may not be a bad outcome for Beijing. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” said Abraham. Two rare earth magnet manufacturers told Reuters anonymously that they expect significant revenue declines this year, although they didn’t offer exact forecasts. “The impact on our export business will be huge, although it’s hard to tell exactly how much loss we will suffer,” said one of the producers. In April, share prices of listed magnet producers fell sharply following the export restrictions, but they have recovered somewhat in recent months. According to Cory Combs, the head of critical mineral research at consultancy Trivium China, the rebound is not based on any tangible improvement in the business outlook. “I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” Combs said. And because many magnet makers are privately held, public share prices only reveal part of the story. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-heating-up-nvt-golden-cross-hints-at-potential-local-top/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is up 7% over the last two weeks, showing signs of strength despite expectations that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. However, some indicators suggest that the market may be entering overheating territory. Bitcoin Market Entering Overheating Territory? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkesmeci, the Bitcoin Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Golden Cross is on the rise. Importantly, this upward movement is beginning to signal signs of market overheating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is a technical indicator that compares short-term and long-term moving averages of the NVT ratio to identify potential market tops or bottoms. When the short-term NVT crosses above the long-term average, it often signals that Bitcoin is becoming overvalued and may face a short-term correction. Notably, this indicator has successfully predicted three local tops so far in 2025. The first occurred on February 5, when the NVT Golden Cross hit 2.68 while BTC traded at $97,600, followed by a 23.65% correction. On March 24, the indicator peaked at 2.87 with BTC around $87,500, leading to a subsequent correction of 16.06%. Most recently – on June 16 – it rose to 2.21 with BTC trading at $106,800, which was followed by a 9.87% price dip. Currently, the NVT Golden Cross stands at 1.98. Although it hasn’t crossed the key 2.2 threshold yet, its upward trajectory suggests that market overheating could be brewing. The CryptoQuant analyst explained: Breaking its previous high is moderately bullish and shows momentum is building. If the metric crosses 2.2 again, it may hint at a local top. But don’t rush to exit – historically, the metric has stayed above 2.2 for several days. In conclusion, burakkesmeci noted that while crossing the 2.2 level might suggest Bitcoin is heating up in the short-term, it could also signal a return of bullish momentum in the medium-term. That said, the opinion on BTC’s short-term price trajectory is largely divided. Analysts Split Over BTC Price Action ​​The NVT Golden Cross suggests that BTC may still have room to rally before hitting a potential local top. However, some analysts foresee a short-term pullback before Bitcoin reaches new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Volume Echoes Mid-2021 ‘Stable Equilibrium’ – Is A Big Move Brewing? For instance, noted crypto analyst Chistian Chifoi described the current BTC price action as a “deceptive setup,” warning it may trap bulls before a possible surge toward a new all-time high (ATH) of $160,000. Meanwhile, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode forecasts BTC’s short-term peak at $117,000. At press time, BTC trades at $108,204, down 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The sale will be done on both Gate.com and on the site itself, Pump.fun, with 150 billion tokens sold at $0.004 each. This is 15 percent of the total supply, amounting to up to 4 billion in the project. According to a page on Gate crypto exchange, which appeared to have been deleted after mass social media commentary, the sale will be on a first-come, first-served basis. It will be held over 72 hours or until the allocation is exhausted. The buyer will not face any purchase limit, but must also hit a minimum. Separate announcements on the details of distribution and trading will be made on official channels. 🚨 @pumpdotfun Public Token Sale: All You Need to Know – Token: $PUMP – Total Supply: 1 trillion – Date: July 12 – July 15 (3 days) – Tokens for Sale: 150 billion – Sale Price: $0.004 – Fully Diluted Valuation: $4 billion pic.twitter.com/8jijGWgVBp — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) July 7, 2025 “For individual subscriptions, as long as the quota is sufficient, only a minimum purchase amount is required and there is no upper limit,” the FAQ page noted. The PUMP token is the utility token of the expanding Pump.fun ecosystem. Pumpfun has established itself as a frictionless market that lists tokens on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to mint and trade freely without any costs or programming skills. Every newly minted token entails a standard fair launch model. Pumpfun offers zero pre-mines and zero team distribution, combined with zero trading taxes, making it attractive to traders and memecoin developers alike. Revenue falls 92% from January peak as user interest declines In spite of its scheduled token launch, Pump.fun has suffered a significant drop in its protocol income and fee earnings. According to on-chain metrics provided by DeFi Llama, daily revenue dropped to $533,410 on July 6. Fees generated were less than $922,890- a daily low since March 2025. The platform generated a high of $7.07 million in revenue and fees on January 23. This is a 92% drop in revenue and 86% in fees. Despite the temporary surge in late March that saw fees rebound to $6.6 million, revenue did not pass $2.05 million across the same interval. This trend of weakness can also be found in monthly data. Pump.fun recorded a combined fee and revenue of $137.12 million in January. In June, the fee totals fell to $64.47 million, or only about half the high mark. June revenues were only $39.08 million, or less than 30% of the January high. According to Dune Analytics, as of July, less than 0.01 percent of addresses had generated more than $1 million in profits on the platform, with more than 60% of users registering losses. Recently, Pump.fun has received renewed competition in the form of BONKs meme coin launchpad, LetsBonk, backflipping Pump.fun in tokens created for the first time on Monday. Notable meme tokens such as Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) were generated on Pump.fun, and other previously popular tokens are generated through the platform, such as Moo Deng and Chill Guy.

FCA Exposes London Crypto Scheme Between February 2017 and June 2019, Bedi and Mavanga defrauded at least 65 investors out of a total of £1,541,799, nearly equivalent to $2,100,000 USD. According to a November 2024 press release , Bedi and Mavanga cold-called consumers to direct them to a website offering crypto investment opportunities. In reality, the site and its supposed high return cryptocurrency offerings were a sham for their own financial gain. Bedi pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and money laundering offences at a May 2023 hearing. Meanwhile, Mavanga pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and possession of false identification documents with an improper intention in June 2023. ‘Bedi and Mavanga lured investors with promises of high returns on crypto investments, but their schemes were nothing but a callous scam,” Smart said in a statement at the time. “If you’re contacted out of the blue about an investment opportunity that sounds too good to be true, then it probably is,” he continued. “If you’re in any doubt – don’t invest.” The post London Duo Jailed for $2 Million Crypto Scheme appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|FCA|UK|UK Crypto,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-07 23:47:38
47756651,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762008,1751932207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47756651.jpeg,China’s central bank is quietly surveying financial institutions about the U.S. dollar’s weakness,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-pboc-poking-about-dollar-weakness/,"The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has reportedly reached out to financial institutions in recent days to assess market sentiment surrounding the ongoing weakness of the U.S. dollar. According to people familiar with the matter cited by Reuters, the PBOC sent out an informal survey last week, probing for opinions on why the dollar has been slipping, how long the trend might last, and what it could mean for the Chinese yuan. The act signals that Beijing may be growing uneasy about the yuan’s recent gains against the faltering dollar and the potential knock-on effects on Chinese exports. The yuan has steadied while the dollar slumps The U.S. dollar has had a bruising 2025. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, has fallen 11% so far this year, its worst start since 1973. Since early April when President Donald Trump announced a broad freeze on tariffs, the dollar has tumbled 6.6% as markets began pricing in looser U.S. trade and fiscal policies. In contrast, China’s yuan has held relatively steady, gaining about 1.3% over the same period. That’s good news for consumers and importers, but not so much for Chinese exporters who suddenly find their goods more expensive on the global market, just when they need every edge in a slowing economy. The dollar’s decline has now put the PBOC in a delicate spot . On the one hand, a stronger yuan helps reduce imported inflation and reinforces Beijing’s image as a steady hand in global finance. On the other, it could squeeze manufacturers and exporters, especially as the country tries to revive growth after a bumpy few years. The PBOC has long preferred stability over sharp moves, and its governor, Pan Gongsheng said earlier this year that keeping the yuan “reasonably stable” is essential for both domestic and global confidence. The survey could be a precursor to policy action The survey alone doesn’t signal immediate policy change, but it could be a first step. In similar situations in the past, the PBOC has used subtle levers to manage the yuan’s value without direct intervention. In April , the central bank reportedly nudged state-owned banks to curb dollar buying, a move many saw as a quiet way of putting a floor under the yuan. Most analysts believe the PBOC is unlikely to intervene unless the yuan strengthens dramatically. But the timing of this latest outreach has raised eyebrows. It comes just days before the expiration of Trump’s 90-day global tariff pause, set to end on Wednesday, July 10, and just a month ahead of the expiration of separate U.S. tariffs on Chinese tech imports.

The analyst tells his 794,400 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding stablecoins. According to Van de Poppe, TOTAL is gearing up for a massive breakout after printing a series of higher lows since the start of 2024. “A constant move upwards for the entire crypto market capitalization. Matter of time until we’re breaking upwards to a new all-time high.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.323 trillion, down about 11% from its all-time high of $3.738 trillion, which it hit in December of 2024. Turning to Bitcoin, Van de Poppe thinks that new all-time highs are in sight for BTC . “This can still be classified as the build-up phase for Bitcoin. I assume we’ll be starting to run up significantly in the coming weeks.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,100. As for Ethereum, Van de Poppe believes that ETH could spark a huge upside burst if it takes out resistance at $2,800. “The moment it breaks out (whichever side), it’s going to be providing a big move. Given that we’ve hit the low at $1,700 and sentiment is on the bottom, I assume we’ll break upwards, resulting in the start of the bull market.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,570. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused crypto project Bittensor ( TAO ). Van de Poppe thinks TAO needs to breach its resistance at around $350 to trigger a surge to his price target. “TAO is on the edge of breaking back in the range, which would then fuel a move towards the other side of the range ($470).” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, TAO is worth $328.

47757034,https://timestabloid.com/?p=73677,1751932827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected XRP Price if Bitcoin Hits $3.45 Million By 2030,https://timestabloid.com/projected-xrp-price-if-bitcoin-hits-3-45-million-by-2030/,"Bitcoin’s performance has historically influenced the broader cryptocurrency market, often setting the pace for altcoins. If Bitcoin continues to double in value each year until 2030, it could drive substantial gains across the crypto sector, including for XRP. This projection, though ambitious, aligns with some market forecasts and long-term bullish expectations. As of now, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $108,000 . Should it sustain a doubling pattern annually, it would reach $216,000 in 2026, $432,000 in 2027, and by 2029, surpass $1.7 million. By 2030, its value could climb to roughly $3.45 million, representing a cumulative increase of around 3,100%. This outlook corresponds with previous predictions, such as one from Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer, who suggested Bitcoin could hit $3.5 million by the decade’s end. If XRP mirrors this percentage growth, the implications could be significant. With XRP currently valued at $2.28, a 3,100% increase would place its price at approximately $70.72 per token. While this is a hypothetical scenario, it illustrates the potential upside should market dynamics remain favorable. XRP’s Correlation With Bitcoin and Market Behavior Although XRP and Bitcoin are different in utility and structure, their market prices often move in tandem. Over the past month, data from CoinMarketCap shows that XRP has generally followed Bitcoin’s market direction. There was a brief exception from June 25 to June 28, when XRP experienced a sharp drop while Bitcoin remained relatively stable. However, since then, both assets have resumed similar movement patterns. This price correlation has both advantages and risks. When Bitcoin experiences upward momentum, XRP often benefits . Conversely, Bitcoin downturns tend to weigh on XRP’s value as well. In recent months, despite periods of divergence, XRP has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s trend, particularly during consolidation phases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs in the past five months, altcoins have remained mostly stagnant. This divergence has contributed to an increase in Bitcoin market dominance. However, some analysts anticipate a shift in this trend soon, as altcoins are expected to regain traction during what is commonly referred to as “altcoin season.” Outlook for XRP Amid a Possible Altcoin Recovery XRP, being one of the top altcoins by market capitalization, is well-positioned to benefit from any broader altcoin recovery. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, altcoins tend to follow, though often with a delay. If such a recovery materializes, XRP could see renewed momentum and price growth. If Bitcoin’s value increases dramatically over the next five years and XRP continues to follow its market trajectory, a substantial rise in XRP’s price is conceivable. Although market predictions are inherently speculative, the long-term potential remains compelling, especially for investors seeking exposure to top-tier altcoins influenced by Bitcoin’s performance.

Mark Zuckerberg’s mobile-based Threads, launched as a simpler alternative to Musk’s X, reached 115.1 million active users regularly on phones last month, according to Similarweb data reported by TechCrunch . That figure places it just behind 32 million daily users on X mobile in the same timeframe. Even more striking, Threads has climbed 127.8 percent compared with June last year, while X’s daily mobile count has dropped by 15.2 percent over those twelve months. Yet the story shifts when desktop visits are taken into account. X still leads on web browsers, with almost 145.8 million daily desktop visits in June, TechCrunch notes. By contrast, Threads managed only 6.9 million desktop views. This split likely reflects user habits: long-time Twitter fans often log in on computers, whereas Instagram users, and now Threads users, tend to open the app briefly on their phones, scroll through a few posts, and then close it. Bluesky still remains a tiny competitor to Threads and X For those curious about Bluesky, the smaller newcomer also saw a spike but remains tiny in comparison. TechCrunch reports that Bluesky’s daily active user count rose by 372.5 percent year after year, reaching around 4.1 million. In total, about 37 million people have registered on the platform so far. Despite its rapid percentage growth, Bluesky is still a minor player next to the giants. However, it does have potential in the long term. And that is less related with new surges of users who appear on the platform only to protest about the policies of another network, and more related to Bluesky’s push towards becoming a more open ecosystem. On the other hand, picking sides between Musk’s X and Zuckerberg’s Threads can feel like a lose-lose decision. While Zuckerberg hasn’t stoked as much controversy as Musk, he did indirectly back and support Musk’s push on X at one point. In the meantime, Threads’ rapid growth shows that Zuckerberg can compete by offering a cleaner, mobile-focused space, even if it doesn’t yet match X’s desktop stronghold. At the end of the day, many users may keep both apps on their phones, dipping into Threads for quick updates and relying on X when they want live-breaking news and constant conversation. The competition is far from over, but for now, Threads is showing that it can at least run alongside X in the race for daily attention.

At 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday, July 9, the panel will convene in Dirksen 538 for a hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets.” The session will be webcast live and—crucially for XRP holders—will feature Ripple Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse alongside Blockchain Association chief executive (and former CFTC commissioner) Summer Mersinger, Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin, and Paradigm general partner Dan Robinson. Committee staff have indicated that the discussion will focus on whether certain tokens should be treated as “digital commodities”—a category that would place primary oversight with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission. Why July 9 Critical For XRP? Garlinghouse enters the hearing with the wind at his back. On June 27 he announced that Ripple would withdraw its cross-appeal in the company’s long-running enforcement fight with the SEC, adding on X, “We’re closing this chapter once and for all.” The SEC is widely expected to drop its own appeal of Judge Analisa Torres’s July 2023 ruling, which held that XRP traded on secondary exchanges does not constitute an unregistered security—although the judge left a $125 million civil penalty in place for earlier institutional sales. The procedural détente has removed an immediate litigation cloud but left the larger statutory question—what is XRP?—squarely in Congress’s hands. That question sits at the heart of several bills now threading their way through Capitol Hill. The House last year passed the bipartisan FIT21 Act, while the Digital Asset Market CLARITY Act of 2025 would expressly define tokens that achieve “functional decentralization” as commodities. In the Senate, Banking Chairman Tim Scott has set a self-imposed deadline to mark up a comprehensive market-structure bill by September 30. As he put it in a June 27 fireside chat, “I’ve been very clear that I believe the President’s mandate of moving the GENIUS Act immediately to his desk is in the best interest of the American people, and making sure that there is a timeline for market structure to be completed by September 30th.” Wednesday’s testimony will feed directly into that legislative drafting effort. Industry witnesses are expected to deliver sharply contrasting perspectives. In a preview on X, Mersinger wrote that “The United States urgently needs clear, comprehensive, and carefully designed rules for digital assets,” signaling that she will press lawmakers to codify CFTC jurisdiction over spot markets. Paradigm’s Robinson is expected to warn against rules that “lock in” incumbent custodians—concerns he has raised in prior testimony. Markets will have one eye on the policy debate and the other on XRP’s price tape. The token broke above $2.28 overnight after news of Ripple’s pursuit of a US bank charter , extending a two-week rally that options desks say is crowded with $3 strike calls. A formal Senate signal that XRP is more commodity than security could strengthen the (already very strong) odds for a spot ETF . For now, the only certainty is that Wednesday’s hearing will generate the most authoritative public record yet on how Congress plans to draw the line between securities and commodities in Web3—and whether XRP ultimately stands on the same side of that line as wheat, gold, and Bitcoin.

This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-another-460-run-rare-fiat-signal-returned/,"The Global Money Supply has just hit a rare yearly growth rate of 9%. Here’s what followed for Bitcoin the last few times this signal appeared. Global Money Supply Is Currently Sharply Going Up In a new post on X, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has talked about the latest trend in the Global Money Supply. The “Global Money Supply” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of fiat supply (priced in US Dollars) issued by the top countries around the world.

Currently, the indicator stands at around 9%, which corresponds to the Global Money Supply undergoing a 9% jump over the last twelve months. “This is extreme and rare,” says Edwards. In the same chart, the Capriole Investments founder has also attached the historical data of the daily Bitcoin price. Interestingly, past surges of the metric to this level all preceded significant bull rallies for the cryptocurrency over the next twelve months. More specifically, the August 2017 signal led to a 663% surge, the November 2017 one to a 136% increase, and the June 2020 one to a 580% rally. This comes to an average gain of 460%. Thus, it would appear that money printers being busy around the world is something that tends to be bullish for Bitcoin. Considering that the Global Money Supply is once again rising at an appreciable rate, it only remains to be seen whether BTC will once again feel a positive effect over the coming year. In some other news, the Bitcoin network recently saw its largest ever movement of coins older than ten years, as CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno has pointed out in an X post. In total, this latest spike of transactions involving ancient coins saw the movement of around 81,000 BTC, worth a whopping $8.8 billion. Generally, old coins move when they are being sold, so these transfers could correspond to profit-taking.

This metric gauges the demand for Bitcoin by comparing its production (mining issuance) against its inventory (supply inactive over 1 year). “Despite 80,000 BTC moving, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand is still bullish,” says the analyst. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $108,400, up 0.7% over the last week.
