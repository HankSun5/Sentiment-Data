Here’s why this move favors a bullish Solana price prediction . Forward Industries is, by far, the most influential treasury company in the world for Solana, with total holdings of 6.8 million tokens worth approximately $1 billion at the time of writing. Breaking news from our team The Forward Industries Board authorized, on November 3, 2025, a share repurchase program permitting Forward Industries to repurchase up to $1 billion of its common stock. Get the full press release below pic.twitter.com/rqsDDRGp54 — Forward Industries $FORD (@FWDind) November 4, 2025 Earlier, the firm announced a $1 billion buyback program for its stock that will be progressively executed through at-the-market offerings and block trades. Since Forward Industries has made its Solana investments its core mission, this move increases shareholders’ value as it ramps up the number of tokens that each share represents. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Is On a Downtrend But Has Hit a Key Support Already In the past 30 days, SOL has lost 31.8% of its value as market sentiment soured following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff increase on Chinese imported goods. The daily chart shows that Solana has been on a downtrend since late September, making a series of lower highs and lower lows along the way to form a descending price channel. However, the token just hit the channel’s lower bound, favoring an upcoming bounce. The token also broke below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory. For SOL to recover, it would have to break out of this price channel. Ideally, it would have to move above $180 first to confirm a trend reversal. If that happens, Solana could rise to $200 soon and possibly beyond as institutional interest remains strong. Forward Industries’ recent moves highlight how Wall Street is waking up to the potential of altcoins like Solana and the tech powering them. One early-stage project capitalizing on this shift is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a new crypto presale building the first high-speed Bitcoin Layer-2 on Solana. By using Solana’s lightning-fast network, HYPER aims to fix Bitcoin’s biggest limitations – slow speeds, high fees, and lack of programmability – while unlocking access to trading, staking, and DeFi. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $26M to Kickstart a New Era for Bitcoin BTC holders have been unable to earn yield on their investment for years, as the network’s design can’t cope with the speed that DeFi applications need. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) solves this by launching the first true Bitcoin L2 with the help of the Solana blockchain to allow developers to launch yield-farming, staking, payments, and other decentralized apps. The Hyper Bridge was created to receive BTC tokens safely on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2. Once in there, investors can use any of these dApps without having to leave the Bitcoin ecosystem. Analysts believe that, once the solution becomes widely adopted by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for $HYPER should skyrocket. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up your favorite wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

Analyst Gives Date,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/when-will-bitcoin-btc-price-recover-analyst-gives-date/,"As the pullback in Bitcoin (BTC) price creates a cautious atmosphere in the market, cryptocurrency analyst Colin Talks Crypto has assessed multiple indicators that he argues point to a possible bullish reversal towards mid-November. According to the analyst, a potential recovery in Bitcoin is supported by several technical and macro factors, saying: Colin Talks Crypto predicts the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 200-day SMA will cross around mid-November. He noted that in past cycles, this crossover has often signaled local bottoms, suggesting this technical signal carries a strong possibility of a reversal. Related News: Three Top-Level FED Officials Made Critical Statements About the US Economy According to the analyst, gold's price action is a leading indicator for Bitcoin. He stated that the upward trend in gold could create similar upward momentum for BTC. Colin Talks Crypto argued that even as Bitcoin surged to $126,000, classic cyclical indicators showed no signs of “overheating” or overly optimistic market sentiment, suggesting the bullish cycle may not have peaked yet. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's announcement that the balance sheet contraction program (QT) will end on December 1st strengthens the possibility of a new period of liquidity, according to analysts.

The potential US government shutdown resolution could significantly impact digital asset markets that have been struggling with volatility. How Does Market Uncertainty Affect Crypto Investments? Market uncertainty creates hesitation among both institutional and retail investors. When political deadlocks occur, trading volumes typically decrease as participants wait for clearer signals. Glassnode’s experts note that this particular period of market uncertainty has been especially challenging for cryptocurrency recovery. The connection between traditional finance and crypto markets means political stability matters more than many realize. As Negentropic, the shared account of Glassnode co-founders, emphasized on X: markets thrive on clarity . This fundamental truth explains why reducing market uncertainty becomes crucial for sustainable growth. What’s Driving the Shutdown Resolution Efforts? Senator John Thune’s push for a vote signals serious progress toward ending the political standoff. Key developments include: Senate Republicans preparing to work through the weekend Bipartisan negotiations gaining momentum Growing recognition of economic consequences This determined approach suggests lawmakers understand how market uncertainty affects broader economic conditions. The resolution timing becomes particularly important for cryptocurrency markets approaching critical technical levels. Why Should Crypto Traders Monitor Political Developments? Political decisions directly influence investor sentiment and capital flows. The current market uncertainty stems from not knowing how government operations might affect: Regulatory clarity for digital assets Institutional investment decisions Macroeconomic policy directions Glassnode’s tracking of on-chain data shows how periods of market uncertainty correlate with reduced network activity and trading volumes. Resolving the shutdown could reverse these trends quickly. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? Reduced market uncertainty typically benefits risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Historical patterns suggest that when political clarity emerges, we often see: Increased institutional positioning Retail investor confidence returning Improved liquidity conditions The current situation reminds us that market uncertainty, while challenging, often creates opportunities for prepared investors. Monitoring Glassnode’s analysis and on-chain metrics can help navigate these transitions effectively. Conclusion: Clarity Brings Opportunity The potential resolution of the US government shutdown represents more than just political progress—it signals reducing market uncertainty that has constrained cryptocurrency markets. As Glassnode’s analysis highlights, markets function best with clear operating environments. For crypto investors, this development could mark the beginning of a more favorable period for digital asset appreciation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions How does a government shutdown affect cryptocurrency markets? Government shutdowns create market uncertainty that reduces investor confidence across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This typically leads to lower trading volumes and increased volatility. Why is Glassnode’s analysis important for crypto investors? Glassnode provides crucial on-chain data and market insights that help investors understand underlying market conditions beyond price movements alone. What happens to crypto markets when political uncertainty decreases? Reduced political uncertainty generally leads to improved market sentiment, increased trading activity, and often higher prices for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. How quickly might markets react to a shutdown resolution? Cryptocurrency markets typically react quickly to political developments, with price movements often occurring within hours of significant announcements. Should investors change their strategy during periods of market uncertainty? While every investor’s situation differs, many experts recommend maintaining long-term strategies while potentially using volatility to accumulate positions at favorable prices. What other factors should crypto investors watch alongside political developments? Investors should monitor regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data, technological developments, and on-chain metrics alongside political news. Found this analysis helpful?

Wednesday trading saw the meme coin log just 94 billion tokens in exchange flows, roughly $850,000 worth of activity for a token boasting a $5.3 billion market cap. SHIB Exchange Netflow. Source: CryptoQuant . This flatline in wallet-to-exchange transfers signals a deep market hesitation. Stagnation like this has historically been associated with one of two outcomes: a gradual decline as interest fades, or a quiet accumulation phase that sets up for a rebound. The muted flow data reflects a lack of conviction on both sides of the market, likely tied to FUD surrounding the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and renewed fears of slowing economic growth. For any decisive Shiba Inu price action beyond the current multi-month bleed, traders will need to watch for major catalysts like ecosystem updates or broader shifts in risk sentiment. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: What’s Next for SHIB? Shiba Inu’s prolonged consolidation phase continues, with the meme coin locked within a six-month descending channel now retesting its lower boundary as support. This creates a decisive moment for the wider Shiba Inu price direction; the slow bleed could escalate into a free fall. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView. A recent RSI bounce from the 30 oversold threshold has already stalled, reflecting a lack of buying conviction, while the MACD histogram widens below the signal line, confirming persistent sell-side dominance. All eyes remain on the $0.0000085 level, the final structural barrier before a potential channel breakdown. Should this level fail, a retest of the $0.0000067 demand zone 25% lower looks likely. Still, a rebound in momentum could spark a reversal. Regaining the $0.000012 zone would position SHIB for a potential breakout move, targeting $0.000024, a 170% rally if broader sentiment improves. Maxi Doge: The Token That Could Step Up as SHIB Struggles Meme coin rotations are as consistent as they are powerful. When one market leader hits a ceiling, capital naturally flows to the next high-upside contender. That dynamic is now playing out between Shiba Inu and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an early Doge-themed token gaining traction just as SHIB grapples with liquidity issues. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised nearly $4 million, while early backers are earning up to 78% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed out on the Doge wave before, MaxiDoge could be the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

Data shows that whales have been accumulating vast amounts of ETH within a short window. The accumulation coincides with Ethereum recording a new network throughput milestone, which adds further strength to the argument that the cryptocurrency is still solid even during the price weakness. Whales Scoop Up $1.12 Billion Worth Of ETH In 48 Hours Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain shows that some Ethereum whale addresses have accumulated a combined 323,523 ETH, valued at approximately $1.12 billion, within the past 48-hour period. One of the biggest purchases came from a whale who bought 257,543 ETH, worth about $896 million, at an average price of $3,480 per ETH. Another cluster of addresses, referred to as the “seven siblings” by Lookonchain, collectively added 37,971 ETH worth $133 million at an average price of $3,515. The data also revealed participation from a whale known for swing trading Ethereum through over-the-counter deals, who acquired 14,004 ETH for about $45.5 million. This address bought these ETH at an average price of $3,247, which was exactly around the recent price low. Two newly created wallets also bought 10,000 ETH and 4,005 ETH, respectively, totaling more than $47 million combined. In total, whales accumulated 323,523 ETH at an average price of $3,469, showing how most of them are capitalizing on the price break below $3,400. Price Weakness Might Be Setting Stage For Breakout Although Ethereum’s drop might have unsettled some traders, the whale accumulation might be pointing to optimistic days ahead. The large-scale accumulation below $3,400 has contributed to the successful defense of $3,200. This follows the trend of accumulation leading to maintenance of support levels. If ETH maintains stability above $3,200 support and on-chain activity continues to climb, then the price could rebound above $4,000 before the end of the month. The first step, however, in this is for Ethereum to reclaim $3,800 and register a strong weekly close above the level. Interestingly, Ethereum’s network performance has maintained its level of robustness despite the market’s correction. The blockchain ecosystem recently achieved a new record throughput of 24,192 transactions per second (TPS), setting a new benchmark for activity across the network.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Whales|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Lookonchain|tps|Transactions Per Second,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 23:00:21

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst According to Crypto Onchain, Bitcoin hit an intraday low of $98,900 before buyers pushed the price back above $101,000 and later to $103,400 at the time of writing. The top coin’s year-to-date gain sits at close to 10% after peaking at an all-time high of $126,300 in October. Bears Break $107,000 Fortress Based on analysis from Crypto Onchain and on-chain data provider CryptoQuant, Bitcoin lost the $107,000 support after roughly 130 days of trading in a band between that level and $123,000. The move sparked heavy liquidations in the futures market. About $640 million in long positions were wiped out over a 24-hour stretch. That figure, market watchers say, is the second-largest daily long liquidation event since June 2021. The October 10 event remains the largest on record for comparison. The $101,000 level has taken on extra meaning. Traders point out that bulls stepped in near $98,000 and pushed the market back toward the lower trendline of a long-term ascending channel that has held since October 2023. Reports have disclosed that defending this channel bottom would be read as a bullish sign, while a close below it could signal deeper losses and a break in the market structure that has supported the rally. CME Gap Could Pull Price Lower A nearby gap on the CME futures chart sits between $92,000 and $93,000, roughly 10% from current prices, and some analysts are watching that area closely. Historically, Bitcoin has often filled such gaps before resuming its next leg up, and the gap is now a possible target if bearish pressure continues. At the same time, strong buying interest around the $101,000 zone could halt any slide and force prices back up. Liquidations And Market Mood The cascade of liquidations amplified selling pressure, particularly among highly leveraged traders. Futures positions were forcefully closed, and this intensified the intraday drop. Yet buyers were quick to take advantage of the lower levels, and the rebound to $103,000 level showed a degree of demand at current prices. Volume and near-term momentum will be key in determining whether that demand is durable.

Broader moves in US equities and large trader activity are also being monitored, since they helped trigger the recent pullback.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ended its five‑year lawsuit against Ripple back in August, clearing a major weight off the company. Then this Wednesday in San Francisco, investors tied to Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities put $500 million into Ripple, valuing the company at $40 billion, according to Bloomberg. The timing was almost rude. The new valuation plus a roughly 9% rise in XRP this year pushed Chris into billionaire territory with a net worth of $15.3 billion, placing him among the world’s richest for the first time. Most of that wealth comes from his 18% stake in Ripple and his 2.7 billion XRP tokens worth about $6.3 billion as of Wednesday. He also holds $1.8 billion in real estate and assorted investments. That breakdown was confirmed directly to Bloomberg. Born in San Francisco and raised in Cupertino, Chris is 64, and has been building companies since the 1990s, long before crypto existed. He went to San Jose State at first to study aeronautics. Chris switched to business, transferred to San Francisco State, and graduated with accounting and business administration degrees in 1984. He then worked as an auditor at Chevron before earning an MBA from Stanford. Building companies and building wealth The first time Chris made real noise was in 1996 when he co‑founded E‑Loan, the first platform to show consumer credit scores online. He sold it nine years later to Popular Inc. for $300 million. After that, he created Prosper Marketplace, a group‑lending platform partly inspired by his wife’s background in Cambodia. He stepped away from Prosper in 2012. A few months later, he co‑founded OpenCoin, which became Ripple. The company focused on cross‑border payments using XRP. Chris led it as CEO until 2016, then moved into the chairman role. His work now also stretches into local issues. With his wife, Lyna Lam, he supports Cambodian community projects, climate efforts, food access, and San Francisco’s neighborhood revival. The pair founded the A Khmer Buddhist Foundation and are helping fund a new temple in San Jose. Locally, Chris has been politically active for years. He funded a private camera network in San Francisco to combat property crime and recently gave $9.4 million to help the city build a real‑time police operations center. Ripple, meanwhile, is not going public anytime soon, as was reported by Cryptopolitan. When asked Wednesday, Ripple President Monica Long said, “No plan, no timeline.” Crypto markets shake while fortunes shift While Chris climbs the billionaire rankings, crypto trading is showing the opposite energy. On Hyperliquid, one wallet opened two heavy short positions against Bitcoin and XRP totaling $140 million. That trader is now up $3.1 million in about nine hours. The wallet was funded with $7 million USDC routed through an Arbitrum wallet that redeemed from a zero address, making the source hard to trace. Observers are already speculating insider knowledge. This reminds traders of the alleged “Trump insider whale” who reportedly made almost $200 million by shorting before the $19 billion liquidation crash on October 10. Someone linked to that wallet denied having inside info, even though the shorts lined up exactly before former President Trump’s tariff threat tanked markets. Bitcoin has been sliding. It dropped 7.4% on Tuesday in New York to $96,794, its first fall below $100,000 since June. That puts it more than 20% below last month’s record high. Ether dropped up to 15%, and several altcoins lost 50% this year. Many traders stayed sidelined after the October liquidation wave. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is still low. Even though funding rates look favorable, few are stepping back in. Bitcoin is up less than 10% this year, trailing stocks and failing to hedge portfolios.

A PwC and AIMA survey shows 55% of global hedge funds now hold crypto, while Spain’s ITER plans to sell $10M in Bitcoin bought for $10K. Meanwhile, Robinhood considers adding BTC to its treasury, signaling rising corporate adoption even as technical charts hint at a $100K support retest. Hedge Funds Expand Crypto Exposure as Institutional Interest Deepens A growing share of hedge funds is now venturing into digital assets. According to a joint report by PwC and the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), 55% of global hedge funds currently hold cryptocurrency-related investments, up from 47% a year ago. The survey of 122 funds found that while participation is expanding, most allocate less than 2% of their portfolios to crypto, averaging around 7%. The rise coincides with clearer U.S. regulatory guidance under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has encouraged broader institutional participation. More than half of hedge funds invested in crypto, global survey says https://t.co/Nds7ZH5fVT — The Globe and Mail (@globeandmail) November 6, 2025 Even after October’s leveraged “flash crash”, 67% of hedge funds reported using crypto futures for exposure — underscoring continued confidence in digital assets. With hedge fund capital at a record $5 trillion, increasing participation highlights a growing belief that BTC and blockchain-based investments are becoming a permanent fixture in global finance. Spanish Research Institute to Sell $10M Bitcoin Bought for $10K in 2012 In Spain, the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER) plans to sell 97 Bitcoin, originally purchased for under $10,000 in 2012 as part of a blockchain research initiative. Those holdings are now worth over $10 million. The Tenerife Island Council, which oversees ITER, confirmed that it’s coordinating the sale through a bank authorized by the Bank of Spain and CNMV. Proceeds will be reinvested into quantum research and other technology projects.

However, the sale underscores how public institutions are becoming more comfortable managing digital assets — even as European banks remain cautious. The move also highlights BTC’s extraordinary long-term return potential, offering a case study for other public entities exploring crypto-backed financing. Robinhood Considers Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) may soon join the list of corporate Bitcoin holders. CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed the company is “still evaluating” whether to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury after a surge in crypto-related income. During the firm’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Tenev noted that holding BTC could deepen the firm’s connection to the crypto economy but would also commit a portion of company reserves. The company’s crypto trading revenue jumped 339% year over year, reaching $268 million, or nearly 20% of total income.

If Robinhood follows through, it would join MicroStrategy and Metaplanet in using Bitcoin as a treasury asset, a move likely to strengthen institutional trust and reinforce BTC’s demand base. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Nears $100K Support as Downtrend Deepens Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $101,300, continuing its pullback after failing to hold above $104,400. The price remains confined within a descending triangle, a pattern that typically signals continued weakness unless buyers step in at key support levels. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to form lower highs, while the 20-EMA has crossed below the 50-EMA, confirming short-term bearish control. A clean break below $100,400 could trigger a measured move toward $97,600, a level aligning with the previous swing low from late October. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI, hovering near 32, shows fading momentum but hasn’t yet flashed a strong reversal signal. Recent candles — including several spinning tops followed by a bearish engulfing pattern — suggest indecision before another potential dip. If BTC rebounds from the $100K region, a breakout above $103,700 could reverse the structure and open upside targets at $106,300 and $111,000. For now, traders may favor short setups toward $97,600, keeping stops above $103,700. While near-term sentiment leans bearish, the broader uptrend remains intact. This correction could provide long-term investors a valuable accumulation window ahead of renewed institutional flows and improving macro conditions. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013225 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

A revolutionary Dogecoin spot ETF could become reality in just 20 days, according to recent developments. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that Bitwise is using an innovative approach that might fast-track approval for this groundbreaking financial product. What Makes This Dogecoin Spot ETF Different? Bitwise confirmed they’re utilizing the SEC’s 8(a) procedure for their Dogecoin spot ETF application. This non-standard listing method removes the “delaying amendment” from the S-1 application. Consequently, the filing automatically becomes effective after 20 days unless the SEC takes separate action to delay it. The traditional ETF approval process typically involves extensive review periods and potential delays. However, this Dogecoin spot ETF application bypasses much of that bureaucracy. Here’s what makes this approach unique: Automatic effectiveness after 20 days No formal SEC approval required SEC must actively intervene to delay Streamlined regulatory process Why Should Investors Care About This Development? This potential Dogecoin spot ETF represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency adoption. Mainstream investors who have been hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges could finally access Dogecoin through traditional brokerage accounts. Moreover, institutional participation might increase substantially. The timing couldn’t be more crucial. As cryptocurrency markets mature, regulated investment products become increasingly important. This Dogecoin spot ETF could open doors for: Retirement account investments Institutional portfolio allocation Simplified tax reporting Enhanced security measures What Challenges Remain for This Dogecoin ETF? Despite the optimistic timeline, potential hurdles still exist. The SEC maintains authority to intervene during the 20-day window. Regulatory concerns about market manipulation and investor protection could prompt commissioners to delay the process. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s volatility might concern regulators. However, the growing acceptance of digital assets suggests that a Dogecoin spot ETF approval aligns with broader financial trends. The market has been eagerly awaiting such products since Bitcoin ETF approvals paved the way. How Will This Impact the Crypto Market? Successful launch of a Dogecoin spot ETF could trigger significant market movements. Other meme coins might see increased attention, while established cryptocurrencies could benefit from renewed investor interest. The approval would validate Dogecoin’s position in the digital asset ecosystem. Furthermore, this development might accelerate similar applications for other cryptocurrencies. The streamlined 8(a) procedure could become a model for future crypto ETF filings, potentially transforming how digital assets enter traditional markets. Final Thoughts on This Groundbreaking Development The potential 20-day timeline for Bitwise’s Dogecoin spot ETF represents a revolutionary approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This method demonstrates how financial innovation can adapt existing frameworks to accommodate emerging asset classes. While uncertainties remain, the prospect of accessible Dogecoin investment through regulated channels marks significant progress for the entire crypto industry. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 8(a) procedure for ETF approval? The 8(a) procedure allows ETF filings to automatically become effective after a set period unless regulators take separate action to delay them. How long until the Dogecoin spot ETF becomes effective? If the SEC doesn’t intervene, the Dogecoin spot ETF could become effective in 20 days from the filing date. Can the SEC stop this Dogecoin ETF approval? Yes, the SEC can take separate action to delay or prevent the ETF from becoming effective during the 20-day window. What makes this Dogecoin ETF different from Bitcoin ETFs? This represents one of the first meme cryptocurrency ETFs and uses a different approval process than most Bitcoin ETFs. How can investors participate in this Dogecoin ETF? Once effective, investors can purchase shares through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to other ETFs. What risks should investors consider? Investors should consider cryptocurrency volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and market risks before investing. Found this information valuable?

The privacy coin’s explosive rally was accompanied by a shielded supply reaching all-time highs, around 16 million ZEC, representing over 76% of the max supply. Technical analysis reveals that an ascending trendline support is guiding the advance, with Fibonacci extensions projecting potential targets at the $1,669 and $3,428 levels. Privacy Coin Revival Amid Surveillance Concerns Only 17 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posted gains over the past 90 days, with privacy coins ZEC, XMR, DASH, and DCR leading the sector’s performance. Source: CoinMarketCap Zcash jumped from $50 to over $130 in early October , reaching its highest levels since April 2022, despite remaining 96% below its all-time high of $3,193 in 2016. Trading volume surged by nearly 6% today to $1.6 billion, while shielded transactions increased by over 60% month-over-month. Market participants attributed momentum to renewed interest in zk-SNARKs, the zero-knowledge proof system that enables transaction verification without disclosing sender, recipient, or amount details. The technology allows optional privacy, appealing to users facing tightening oversight. Naval Ravikant described Bitcoin as “insurance against fiat” and Zcash as “insurance against Bitcoin,” suggesting that ZEC offers protection against the transparent nature of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is insurance against fiat. ZCash is insurance against Bitcoin. https://t.co/rqMrR3bW7O — Naval (@naval) October 1, 2025 During that same period, Grayscale announced the opening of Zcash Trust private placement, providing accredited investors with exposure through a structure similar to its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The announcement lifted confidence as the ZEC market cap rose from $700 million to over $1.8 billion. Currently, the market capitalization sits close to $9 billion. However, there has been a major regulatory concern, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation, which will take effect in 2027, explicitly bans privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. Article 79 prohibits banks and crypto service providers from handling anonymity-enhanced tokens, including Monero and Zcash, as well as anonymous accounts. Fibonacci Extensions Target $1,669 Following Trendline Respect ZEC trades at $542 with 29.67% weekly gains following an ascending channel advance from September lows. The trendline framework shows consistently higher lows while maintaining an upward trajectory, representing textbook uptrend characteristics. Source: X/@eliz883 Using the Fibonacci extension methodology, some analysts project potential resistance levels at $1,669 (3.618 Fibonacci extension) and $3,428 (4.236 extension). The current positioning at a 2.618 extension around $521 already represents a substantial achievement, as major corrections historically begin. Looking at the 15-minute timeframe, consolidation appears near the upper boundary after multiple successful lower trendline support tests. Long wicks indicate that selling pressure is emerging at current levels, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback before a continuation. Volume characteristics support technical levels with real liquidity, making price action more readable and reactions maintain continuity. ZEC’s inclusion among the top cryptocurrencies provides even more liquidity opportunities to validate technical analysis. Currently, ZEC’s next trajectory depends on maintaining the current ascending trendline support, which is around $480-$490, while challenging the $550-$600 resistance. Breaks above $600 with volume confirmation could trigger momentum toward $1,000 psychological level, while trendline violations would signal a correction toward $350-400, invalidating bullish structure.

The company made the announcement Thursday, saying it has formed a new group, the MAI Superintelligence Team under Mustafa Suleyman, who now leads Microsoft’s AI division. The goal is not just to match human intelligence with machines, but to push way beyond it. According to Bloomberg, the company now wants to create AI systems that can outperform humans across every field, including health care, clean energy, and materials science. Mustafa said in a blog post that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is when AI can do anything a human can. But he added that superintelligence goes “far beyond that performance.” He said the new mission is to build what he calls Humanist Superintelligence, a system designed to serve people directly rather than chasing tech milestones. He named personal AI assistants, better medical outcomes, and sustainable energy solutions as real-world targets. The company previously wasn’t allowed to chase AGI, based on a restriction from its original deal with OpenAI, but that clause is now gone. Microsoft forms new team after scrapping AI restriction The updated contract between Microsoft and OpenAI removed the restriction that had kept Microsoft boxed into less powerful models. The new agreement also gives the tech company a 27% stake in OpenAI’s public-benefit company, letting it now work independently on AGI and more advanced tools. The changes come as the two firms shift from full collaboration to what looks more like strategic rivalry. Mustafa, who’s 41 years old, joined Microsoft in 2024 after leaving Inflection AI, a startup he co-founded. Microsoft licensed Inflection’s intellectual property and brought him on board to help shape its future in AI. Since then, Mustafa has reorganized internal teams, moved key Microsoft AI staff into the new group, and hired people from Google’s DeepMind, which he also helped start. Mustafa told employees in September that Microsoft plans to spend big to build out its AI systems. So far, those models are still smaller than the biggest ones coming from OpenAI or Google, but the goal is to catch up fast. He said their timeline extends to 2032, the year when Microsoft’s rights to use OpenAI’s models expire. Microsoft and OpenAI now compete on multiple fronts While Microsoft still leans on OpenAI to power its Copilot chatbot, it’s also building its own voice, image, and text models. That means Microsoft is trying to reduce its dependence on OpenAI, even as the two remain deeply connected. Still, some Microsoft employees allegedly told The Wall Street Journal that replacing OpenAI’s technology could take years. The consumer Copilot app, which runs on OpenAI’s models, still beats Microsoft’s version in downloads. OpenAI, meanwhile, is working with Microsoft’s rivals, including Amazon and Oracle, and building out its own data centers. The company’s enterprise product now makes up 40% of its revenue, up from 30% earlier this year, according to Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer. That growing independence is turning the former allies into direct competitors in more ways than one. Meta, OpenAI, and others have already formed superintelligence teams, but Mustafa says his group is staying away from certain areas. One example: he’s refusing to build AI that generates erotica, putting distance between his team and competitors. Mustafa is framing Microsoft’s version of superintelligence as more people-centered, but the company isn’t hiding the fact that it wants to own the future of AI, on its own terms. Microsoft’s 365 Copilot tools for business are still powered by OpenAI, but if Mustafa’s team delivers, those dependencies may disappear. Still, there’s no clear timeline. Microsoft’s push is just beginning, and even the company admits replacing what it gets from OpenAI won’t be fast. Microsoft stock plunged by 1.4% on Thursday evening, trading at $500.01 in New York. But for now, the company is betting that chasing superintelligence is worth the risk.

XRP emerged as the second most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, favoring a bullish XRP price prediction for the long term. Kaiko, a leading global firm that provides crypto market data to institutional players, shared its ranking for the third quarter of this year. XRP was tied with Ethereum (ETH) in second place, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL). The company analyzes a series of characteristics for each token to construct a 100-point index that analyzes the asset’s strengths and prospects. These factors include potential use cases, resources, and research. Institutional awareness seems to be rapidly growing for the XRP Ledger. Recently, the first spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP was launched, and it has already attracted $100 million from investors despite the latest market sell-off. XRP Price Prediction: Buyers Show Up at $2.10 – Is a Recovery Starting? XRP has recovered today after taking some significant hits in the past few days that pushed down its price to nearly $2.08. The price has bounced near $2.30, and trading volumes have retreated, indicating that the selling pressure could be easing. XRP has bounced off a critical support at $2.10, suggesting the recent sell-off may have been an overreaction. For the bullish momentum to continue, XRP needs to break above the 200-day exponential moving average and see the RSI push past its 14-day moving average. Despite the pullback, institutional interest in Ripple’s ecosystem remains strong – a key factor behind a long-term bullish XRP price prediction. If the rebound gains strength, XRP could rally toward $4 in the coming weeks. To fully capitalize on any upside, secure storage matters.

54112120,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=854759,1762473600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/54112120.jpeg,How to Generate $1 Million with This Crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-to-generate-1-million-with-this-crypto/,"Crypto investors are no strangers to dreaming big. But with RentStac (RNS), the math behind a million-dollar opportunity is more straightforward than most early-stage projects. With the current presale offering a 100% token bonus, now is the moment to crunch real, life-changing numbers. Forget elusive hype. Here’s how much you’d need to put in today to join the seven-figure club and why timing matters more than ever. Understanding the Million Dollar Path At the heart of RentStac’s presale is a simple deal: buy tokens at $0.025 each and get double the amount for free. If you miss this window, future phases offer no such bonus, and token prices will only rise. Let’s break it down. The goal is $1,000,000 in token value when RNS reaches a hypothetical target price of $1 per token, a milestone analysts believe is possible due to the project’s real estate backing and deflationary model. The Calculation: How Much to Invest for $1M At the current rate, $1,000 will buy you 40,000 RNS tokens. With the 100% bonus, that becomes 80,000 tokens. To amass $1 million at $1 per RNS, you’d need 1,000,000 tokens. Here’s the formula: 1,000,000 tokens ÷ 80,000 tokens (per $1,000) = 12.5 So, you’d need to invest: 12.5 x $1,000 = $12,500 By putting in $12,500 during this presale phase, you’d secure 500,000 tokens outright. Thanks to the bonus, this doubles to 1,000,000 RNS, your ticket to $1 million if/when the token reaches $1. Why Acting Now Counts This doubling event is strictly limited to the ongoing presale. In later rounds, the bonus vanishes and the token price climbs. Waiting will cost you either more money for the same position or far less exposure for the same investment. Early backers aren’t just hoping for token appreciation—they’re locking in a historic entry point that won’t repeat. Crypto and real estate rarely line up for such high-leverage entry. Real Estate Backing, Dual Earnings, No Hassle RentStac stands out for more than just the numbers. Every RNS is linked to real rental properties, with ownership organized in secure Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Forget landlord headaches, property management is handled professionally while you keep full transparency from your dashboard. Returns don’t stop at future price gains. The platform uses property-generated income for buybacks and burns, adding scarcity to your holdings. Plus, staking options let investors earn a piece of monthly rent, paid in USDC, directly from holding and staking their tokens. Security First, Big Plans Ahead RentStac smart contracts are already audited and scored at 92.48%, with an additional CertiK audit underway. The roadmap prioritizes rapid property acquisition, stronger rental income flows, and major exchange listings in the next year. These milestones could add both liquidity and visibility, fueling the journey toward that $1 target and rewarding early commitment. Millionaire Math in Your Hands Few opportunities in crypto offer such a calculable shot at $1 million. With the presale’s doubling bonus, a $12,500 investment today could, at $1 per RNS, hit the million mark. Miss the presale, and the path only gets steeper.

Trader Says The Low Must Form Now,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/did-bitcoin-just-bottom-low-must-form-now/,"A day after another billion-dollar liquidation cascade, veteran crypto analyst Trader Mayne says his core thesis is unchanged: the bull cycle’s top is “not in,” and the market is in the process of printing a weekly cycle low that could set up one more leg higher into year-end. “I’ve been banging on the drum about the high not being in,” he said in a November 5 video, adding that he remains “a BTC maxi from the spot perspective,” despite tactical longs and shorts that have been hit-and-miss during the recent volatility. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Mayne framed the selloff—coming less than a month after an almost $20 billion wipeout on October 10—as a feature, not a bug, of late-cycle price discovery. He argued that speculative leverage rapidly re-accumulated in altcoins and that majors still offer sufficient volatility with clearer structure. “People were right back on with the leverage… You really can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” he said, while emphasizing he now “primarily focus[es] on the majors” and holds a core spot stack he hasn’t sold. His near-term timing anchor is cycle theory. Drawing on the four-year template popularized by Bob Loukas, Mayne said he expects the broader crypto top to land between late 2025 and early 2026, but he stressed the immediate setup is about nailing a weekly low within a narrow window that “extends until about mid next week, November 10.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $87,000 If This Happens He wants to see “time and space away from this low” and a reclaim of the monthly open around $110,000–$112,000 to confirm that the decline has been exhausted. If that structure forms, he intends to treat $98,000 as the operative bull-market invalidation on a weekly-closing basis: “That will confirm to me that this is our bull market invalidation… at least in the worst case you have a cut point at like $100k Bitcoin.” Mayne supplemented the timing view with a cross-asset read that he says has been reliable in prior impulses: gold tends to rally first, with Bitcoin following “about 60 to 90 days later.” He cited chart work showing gold’s advance now roughly 80–90 days old, which, if the relationship holds, would “line up very well with Bitcoin being ready to make its next move.” He also expects the BTC-versus-gold cross to bounce, implying outperformance of Bitcoin over the precious metal through year-end: “I’m pretty confident this chart is due for a big bounce and we’re going to see gold underperform Bitcoin for the remainder of the year.” A more subjective—but, in his telling, telling—input is the absence of a true “blow-off” in Bitcoin versus the vertical arcs seen in AI-heavy equities and gold. With megacaps like Nvidia running hard since the spring and gold printing a sharp leg higher, he argued that “it just doesn’t sit right… that Bitcoin hasn’t had [its blow-off],” suggesting latent upside energy remains to be released if the weekly low locks in. On market microstructure and seasonality, Mayne pointed to early-month dynamics. In many green months, he said, the low forms in the first third of the month, analogous to how Monday’s range often frames the week for intraday traders. If November is destined to close higher, an early-month low coupled with a monthly-open reclaim would be consistent with his cycle read. “If we’re bullish for November… I want to be a bull above the monthly open,” he said. The scenario analysis was not one-sided. Mayne repeatedly acknowledged bear signals that have emerged on higher timeframes, including a weekly structure break, prior sweeps on the weekly and monthly, and building momentum divergences. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 He warned of the possibility that the recent range resolves as distribution—“maybe the banks literally came in… and they’ve just been distributing on us here”—and laid out a lower-high path in which a rally fizzles beneath or just above the prior peak before breaking down. “There’s a world where we make an all-time high, but it’s just a weak one… you’re going to have the biggest bear div of all bear divs up here,” he said, cautioning that a marginal new high followed by a swift rejection would flip his posture. In the medium-term, he remains open to two competing macro arcs. In the base case, the classic four-year rhythm holds, the late-2025 window marks the cycle top, and 2026 skews bearish, though he expects drawdowns on Bitcoin to be “truncated” relative to prior 80% collapses given deeper institutional participation. In the alternative, the market “right-translates”—an atypical extension in which a new all-time high could print as late as Q1 2026—forcing a reassessment of the four-year template. Either way, he said, his plan is to sell strength on the next leg and reassess if the market presents higher-low continuation after a new high: “If the market appears to still be bullish, guess what? I can get back on the bull train.” Mayne also flagged the US dollar as a 2026 risk pivot, arguing the DXY is carving a “serious low” on multi-month and yearly structures that could precede a “deflationary rally.” While not a one-to-one driver, he said a strong dollar tends to pressure crypto and other risk assets. That macro overlay, combined with what he views as froth in AI-linked equities, underpins his caution beyond the next advance. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $103,412.

Although the concept remains speculative and highly improbable, several analysts and XRP supporters have examined how the digital asset could theoretically assist the government in addressing its $38 trillion debt crisis. Ripple’s Escrow and U.S. Treasury Intervention In early 2025, XRP researcher Dr. Horace Drew proposed a hypothetical situation where President Donald Trump might gain control of Ripple’s escrowed XRP holdings and assign them to the U.S. Treasury. According to Drew, the escrow, estimated to hold roughly 35 billion XRP valued at around $200 billion at that time, could potentially serve as a financial instrument for the government. ""How's he gunna do it LOL?"" If Trump takes all of the XRP in escrow for the US Treasury (current value $200 billion), then slowly drives the value of XRP up to $500, the total US national debt of $34 trillion will be cancelled. — Red Collie (Dr. Horace Drew) scientist/inventor (@RedCollie1) January 23, 2025 He speculated that if the government managed the asset strategically, perhaps by supporting policies that elevate XRP’s market value to around $500 per token , it could theoretically generate enough capital to offset a significant portion of the national debt, which stood near $34 trillion when he presented the scenario. A similar theory emerged from another community commentator known as UtilityFTW, who suggested Ripple could voluntarily transfer its escrow holdings to the government. In his view, integrating RippleNet as a national payment infrastructure could further strengthen this approach, positioning XRP as a tool for high-value settlements and potentially contributing to debt reduction. Renewed Attention and Trump’s Remarks The conversation reemerged in October 2025 following remarks by Carl Higbie, a host on Newsmax, who proposed a more active government role. He suggested that the Treasury could invest $1 trillion in XRP to boost its market price, sell portions of the token for profit to pay off part of the debt, and then repeat the process. While such an approach would introduce extreme volatility, Higbie argued that this method could gradually chip away at the nation’s financial burden. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Interestingly, Donald Trump himself has publicly mentioned the idea of using cryptocurrency to pay off U.S. debt, though his comment appeared partly sarcastic. Still, his statement helped reignite debates over the potential intersection of crypto assets and national fiscal policy. At present, Ripple’s escrow holds about 35 billion XRP, with an estimated market value of $87.5 billion, based on XRP’s current price of $2.27 . When compared with the $38.1 trillion U.S. national debt, equivalent to roughly $111,559 per citizen, the escrow’s worth remains negligible. Analysts have calculated that for just half of the debt to be covered, the value of the escrow would need to total $19 trillion, which would require XRP to reach approximately $543 per token. To eliminate the entire debt, XRP would have to trade near $1,088, representing an increase of over 43,000% from current levels. Market Outlook and Expert Predictions Despite the implausibility of these numbers, several analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term price potential. Rob Cunningham, host of The KWUL Show, recently suggested that strong market inflows, particularly from institutional investors and potential ETF approvals , could push XRP’s value between $200 and $500. Similarly, projections from Changelly analysts anticipate that XRP might exceed the $500 mark by 2040, driven by broader adoption and market maturity. Adding to this sentiment, Dom Kwok, founder of Easy A, advised investors to hold their XRP positions long-term, asserting that the token could eventually surpass $1,000 if market and regulatory conditions align favorably. While the concept of the U.S. government leveraging XRP to erase its national debt remains purely hypothetical, the discussions underscore the growing intersection between cryptocurrency and macroeconomic policy.

54111713,622701,1762473627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54111713.jpeg,Crypto Leaders React to Mamdani’s Win: Will New York’s Blockchain Adoption Come to a Halt?,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-leaders-react-to-mamdanis-win-will-new-yorks/,"The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, raising questions about the future of the city’s digital-asset ecosystem. With Mamdani securing victory on November 4, 2025, defeating Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, the crypto sector is weighing both uncertainty and opportunity in equal measure. This is a major concern for the crypto community, considering that New York is one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Crypto Community Weighs The Upside And Risks Although Mamdani is neither a vocal advocate for cryptocurrencies nor an outright adversary, his record suggests tighter oversight rather than unbridled growth. Prior to the election, he supported measures such as a moratorium on proof-of-work crypto mining and co-sponsored legislation to tax crypto transactions. Notably, prominent industry figures offered tempered responses. Anthony Pompliano cautioned against surrendering New York’s legacy of ambition, asserting that “the city will continue to stand for ambition and opportunity.” Meanwhile, Scott Melker observed that mayors come and go and that “New York will be fine.” On the other side, voices like crypto advocate Max Keiser predicted economic meltdown, linking Mamdani’s victory to potential deterioration in the city’s financial standing. What Does It Mean For Blockchain Adoption In New York? Under the previous administrations, New York positioned itself as a global hub for digital assets. For example, anti-money laundering scrutiny and crypto licenses were advanced under Cuomo’s tenure. With Mamdani’s win, the city may shift toward stricter regulation and consumer protection over innovation-led growth. For instance, city-level bills such as A7788 (crypto legal fees/fines) and A8966 (crypto transaction tax) are already under consideration. However, it’s important to note that city administrations have limited power over state and federal crypto law, much of the regulatory muscle lies outside the Mayor’s reach. As such, while the pace of blockchain adoption in New York might slow or redirect, the industry is unlikely to see a full halt. Broader Political Climate Adds Complexity Mamdani’s surprising mayoral campaign also drew sharp responses from Donald Trump. The president , who had publicly endorsed Cuomo, warned of funding cuts to New York if Mamdani were elected, calling him a “communist” and suggesting New York could face federal withdrawal of support. Trump’s remarks targeted Mamdani directly in his speech, further stoking uncertainty. For crypto firms operating in New York, the interplay of city policy, federal posture, and broader political shifts will be critical to monitor. In sum, Mamdani’s victory creates a new ecosystem for crypto and blockchain in New York, one that may prioritise consumer protection, housing, and affordability over rapid token-driven growth. While this may slow some initiatives, the city’s role as a global financial hub makes a full retreat unlikely.

The law, signed in July, is designed to establish a national framework for payment stablecoins and provide more certainty regarding how digital dollar tokens are regulated nationwide. Circle sent its comments this week as part of the Treasury’s current rulemaking procedure. It will flesh out what the law will look like in practice. The firm stated that the rules must be strong enough to protect users while also being balanced enough to enable innovation and competition in the expanding digital payments industry. The company’s theme is that every issuer should be subject to the same standards, regardless of whether it is a bank or a private entity, and whether it operates in the US or abroad. Circle urges consistent rules across all stablecoin issuers In its submission, Circle argued that stablecoins used for payments need to be fully backed by cash or high-quality, highly liquid short-term assets . This is intended to prevent stablecoins from losing value in times of financial crisis. The firm argued that clear backing rules are necessary to prevent risks from being imposed on ordinary people. The rules, Circle added, should ensure that no one group receives more favorable treatment. Banks, non-bank providers of financial services that utilize technology, and finance companies whose stablecoins are available in US markets should all be subject to the same supervisory regime. The company warned that inconsistent regulation could push risky stablecoin activity out of the United States and beyond the reach of overseers who are monitoring such products. “Clear conditions of access to US markets, including shared supervision between the US and trusted foreign regulators, will foster competition while protecting against risks arising offshore,” the company said. Circle also stressed the need for robust enforcement. It also stated that penalties for breaking the rules should be substantial enough to deter misuse and maintain confidence in digital assets. Without this, it argued, the aims of the GENIUS Act would not be achieved. Industry groups submit recommendations to the treasury Circle wasn’t the only group that registered its comments. Coinbase also filed comments. The back and forth prompted the Treasury to clarify that a prohibition on paying interest on stablecoin balances should be limited to parties that issue the coins, not to individuals seeking returns from exchanges or platforms in other ways. The request follows warnings from US banking institutions that some stablecoin offerings could begin to operate like bank deposits, potentially displacing traditional savings accounts in a competitive market niche. The GENIUS Act won’t happen overnight. It would take effect 18 months after signing, or 120 days after the regulators complete and finalize the detailed rules. If regulators act quickly, the law might be in effect sooner; if rule-making is slow, there will be a delay. Meanwhile, Congress is considering a broader law that would establish regulations for these digital markets, including guidelines for categorizing and overseeing cryptocurrencies, trading platforms, and digital asset securities. The bill already passed the House earlier this year, but it has not progressed in the Senate. Pauses for long recesses, backroom negotiations, and other legislative priorities have slowed the effort. The doors remain open for bipartisan dialogue, according to news reports, but no new proposals are being brought to the table. Those estimates had been more like 2026, according to previous analyses by congressional leaders. Currently, the schedule is precarious due to present delays.

During its Q3 2025 earnings call event on Wednesday, Treasurer Shiv Verma told analysts the company is “still thinking about it,” when asked if Bitcoin might be part of its treasury plan. Shiv added that:- “We spend a lot of time thinking about this and have this debate constantly,” making it clear the idea isn’t off the table. Shiv didn’t confirm any timeline, but said the team continues to “actively look at” how it could fit into the company’s future. This comes as crypto trading continues to grow into a major part of the business. Robinhood’s crypto revenue jumped 339% in the twelve months ending September 30, with crypto now making up a fifth of total income for the quarter. For the quarter alone, Robinhood’s crypto revenue surged 67.5% to $268 million, driven by heavier volumes, as Cryptopolitan reported . CFO Jason Warnick told investors there was a “nice step-up in crypto volumes” that helped push overall transaction-based revenue to $730 million, a 129% increase from the same time last year. Robinhood pushes tokenized stocks while crypto-linked stocks tank At the same earnings call, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said Robinhood has entered the early stages of a rollout to support tokenized stocks. He explained that the company is currently in “phase one,” with phase two expected to allow secondary trading on Bitstamp. Eventually, the company wants these stock tokens to land on DeFi platforms, letting people trade tokenized shares the same way they trade other tokens on-chain. Vladimir said “where it really starts to get interesting is phase two and phase three,” but gave no hard dates for when that will happen. Meanwhile, crypto’s October crypto downturn left many companies who already hold Bitcoin or Ethereum sitting on unrealized losses. Firms like Metaplanet and Trump Media bought their BTC positions earlier in the year when prices were stronger. Those holdings are now worth less than what was paid. The same thing is happening on the Ethereum side. Bitmine and Sharplink also bought during the April to July rally, and are now down since that momentum vanished. Meanwhile, Robinhood’s own stock just dropped over 10% today. It wasn’t alone. The broader crypto sector got crushed. Investors are reacting to a mix of U.S. job numbers, renewed trade tensions, and a government shutdown that’s now stretched into day 37, the longest in history. Coinbase sank by more than 6%, Galaxy Digital dropped 4%, and mining firms weren’t spared either. MARA Holdings fell 3.6%, CleanSpark and Riot Blockchain lost over 5% each.

A Tether-linked address just made headlines by purchasing a staggering 961 Bitcoin, worth approximately $97.34 million, on the Bitfinex exchange. This massive transaction, reported by Onchain Lens, occurred mere hours ago and signals significant institutional activity in the Bitcoin market. What does this Tether-linked address purchase mean for Bitcoin? The recent acquisition by the Tether-linked address represents one of the largest single transactions witnessed recently. When such substantial amounts enter the market, it often indicates strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Moreover, this move demonstrates how major entities are positioning themselves in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Transactions of this magnitude typically influence market sentiment and can signal upcoming price movements. The timing of this purchase, coming during ongoing market fluctuations, suggests strategic accumulation by knowledgeable investors. Why are Tether-linked addresses important in cryptocurrency? Tether-linked addresses play a crucial role in the digital asset ecosystem for several reasons: They represent substantial liquidity moving between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies Their transactions often precede significant market movements They demonstrate institutional participation in crypto markets Their activity provides insights into market maker strategies They help maintain stability between different digital assets The movement from a Tether-linked address into Bitcoin particularly highlights the ongoing relationship between stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency market. This transaction underscores how major players use stablecoins as stepping stones to acquire other digital assets. How does this affect ordinary cryptocurrency investors? While $97.34 million might seem like an astronomical sum to individual investors, understanding these large transactions can provide valuable insights. The Tether-linked address activity often serves as a barometer for institutional sentiment. When such addresses accumulate Bitcoin, it typically indicates: Positive long-term outlook on Bitcoin’s value Potential price support at current levels Increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrency Growing confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value However, it’s crucial to remember that while these signals are important, they represent just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. Individual investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions. What makes this Tether-linked address transaction remarkable? The scale and timing of this Tether-linked address purchase make it particularly noteworthy. The transaction occurred during a period of relative market uncertainty, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamentals. The sheer size – nearly $100 million – demonstrates the growing maturity of cryptocurrency markets and the increasing participation of substantial players.

It signals growing institutional confidence, demonstrates the maturing relationship between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, and provides valuable insights into market sentiment.

Frequently Asked Questions What is a Tether-linked address? A Tether-linked address is a cryptocurrency wallet associated with Tether operations, often used for large-scale transactions involving USDT and other digital assets.

How does this affect Bitcoin’s price? Large purchases can create buying pressure and influence market sentiment, potentially supporting or increasing Bitcoin’s price in the short to medium term. Should I follow Tether-linked address movements? While informative, these movements should be one of many factors in your research. They provide insight but shouldn’t dictate individual investment strategies. How reliable is Onchain Lens data?

This significant decline reveals growing anxiety among traders and could signal important market movements ahead. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial emotional barometer for digital asset markets. This powerful tool calculates market sentiment using multiple data sources to give investors a clear picture of collective psychology. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear, it often indicates potential buying opportunities for brave investors. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where lower numbers represent fear and higher numbers indicate greed. Currently sitting at 24, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen three points from yesterday’s reading, confirming the market’s negative shift. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Understanding the components behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps investors interpret its signals accurately. The index combines six key factors: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Trading Volume (25%) – Tracks market activity levels Social Media Mentions (15%) – Monitors online discussions Surveys (15%) – Captures direct investor sentiment Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Watches BTC market share Google Trends (10%) – Follows search interest This comprehensive approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects genuine market emotions rather than temporary price movements. Why Should Investors Care About Extreme Fear Readings? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters extreme fear territory, it often creates contrarian opportunities. Historically, periods of extreme fear have frequently preceded market recoveries. However, investors should approach these situations with caution and proper risk management. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 suggests that many traders are becoming increasingly nervous about their positions. This emotional state can lead to panic selling, which might create attractive entry points for long-term investors. What Actionable Insights Does the Current Reading Provide? The dramatic drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to extreme fear levels offers several important insights for market participants. First, it indicates that sentiment has deteriorated significantly from recent levels. Second, it suggests that volatility may increase as emotional trading dominates market activity. Investors watching the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should consider these strategies during extreme fear periods: Dollar-cost average into positions gradually Set clear stop-losses to manage risk Monitor volume for confirmation of trend changes Avoid emotional decisions based on fear alone How Can Traders Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Effectively? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index works best as one tool among many in a trader’s arsenal. While it provides valuable sentiment data, it shouldn’t be the sole factor in investment decisions. Successful traders combine the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with technical analysis, fundamental research, and market news. Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future price direction. Markets can remain in extreme fear or greed for extended periods, so patience remains crucial. Conclusion: Navigating Market Emotions with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 clearly signals that extreme fear has returned to cryptocurrency markets. While this creates challenges for current holders, it may present opportunities for strategic investors. By understanding what drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how to interpret its signals, traders can make more informed decisions during emotional market conditions. Market sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, often reaches extremes before significant trend changes. Whether this current extreme fear reading marks a bottom or simply a pause in downward momentum remains to be seen, but it certainly warrants close attention from all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 24 mean? A reading of 24 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests investors are nervous, potentially leading to increased selling pressure and higher volatility. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing fresh sentiment data for traders and investors to incorporate into their decision-making process. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, historically, extreme fear readings have often coincided with market bottoms, making it a valuable contrarian indicator. Should I buy when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear can present buying opportunities, but always conduct additional research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index provides reliable sentiment data but should be used alongside other analysis methods for comprehensive market understanding. What’s the difference between fear and extreme fear on the index? Fear typically ranges from 25-49, while extreme fear covers 0-24, indicating significantly stronger negative sentiment and potential market stress.

The agreement was reported by Bloomberg and comes as Nvidia faces a brutal three-day market crash that’s erased $450 billion in market value. While Kazakhstan deepens its AI commitment, Wall Street is offloading Nvidia shares at record pace, hammering the company with its worst stock decline since early January. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is pushing to turn Kazakhstan into a heavyweight in Eurasia’s future economy. In a speech delivered in late September, president Tokayev said the country is working to become a full digital power within three years, mostly through a new government body: the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development, which replaces the previous Digital Ministry and now serves as the main structure overseeing AI integration across government, science, and industry. The transition isn’t just branding. The previous ministry managed projects in space, cybersecurity, public services, innovation, and digitization. That same structure will now be powered by AI to reshape those pillars. By August 2024, 93% of government services in Kazakhstan were already running online. National internet coverage was nearly universal at 92.9%, just barely under Germany’s level. Kazakhstan makes AI bet while U.S. douses chip optimism The new AI ministry will also advise Tokayev directly through a presidential AI Development Council. Olaf Groth, a German-American council member, said the goal is not just digitization, but cognification; developing systems that think, analyze, and act. Kazakhstan plans to leverage Nvidia’s chips to build compute capacity for everything from university research to national AI labs. It’s a move to position the country as a regional broker for artificial intelligence development and services. As Kazakhstan goes all-in, Nvidia’s stock is collapsing. On Thursday, the company’s shares dropped 3.6%, leading the entire tech sector lower. The fall started earlier in the week after comments from David Sacks, the Trump administration’s artificial intelligence and crypto policy lead. In a post on X, Sacks said, “There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least five major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place.” He added, “I don’t think anyone was actually asking for a bailout. (That would be ridiculous.) But company executives can clarify their own comments.” Sacks was reacting to a statement made the day before by Sarah Friar, the CFO of OpenAI, during a Wall Street Journal event. Friar had said OpenAI might benefit from a government guarantee to help finance AI chip infrastructure. That comment triggered immediate backlash. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, later denied the company was requesting any government support or protection from failure. AI giants scramble as valuations wobble and China pressure builds The entire chip sector has been under pressure since Wednesday when Qualcomm released solid earnings, but investor fear around AI overvaluation tanked sentiment across the board. Analysts are flagging that top AI companies Nvidia, AMD, Oracle, Broadcom, CoreWeave, and even Amazon are getting too entangled, with shared supply chains and overlapping partnerships making the sector/make look a tad too fragile. Things got worse for Nvidia after CEO Jensen Huang made headlines for saying China “will win” the AI race in a comment given during an interview with the Financial Times. Jensen followed up later on X, posting that China was only “nanoseconds behind” the U.S., but stressed, “It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.” Don’t just read crypto news.

This represents one of the largest Bitcoin options expirations we’ve seen this year, creating significant potential for market volatility and price movements that could impact traders and investors alike. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? According to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, Bitcoin options with a notional value of $4.69 billion will expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC today. The sheer scale of these Bitcoin options creates substantial market pressure that traders need to understand. When this many contracts expire simultaneously, it often triggers increased trading activity and potential price swings. The put/call ratio for these expiring Bitcoin options stands at 0.81, indicating slightly more call options than put options. This ratio provides crucial insight into market sentiment and potential price direction. Moreover, the max pain price sits at $108,000, representing the strike price where the maximum number of options would expire worthless. How Do Bitcoin Options Work and Why Should You Care? Bitcoin options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price by a certain date. Today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration involves both call options (betting on price increases) and put options (betting on price decreases). Understanding this dynamic helps explain why such large expirations can create market turbulence. Key factors to watch include: Put/call ratio of 0.81 – Slightly bullish sentiment Max pain price of $108,000 – Potential price magnet $4.69 billion notional value – Substantial market impact Simultaneous Ethereum options expiration – Broader market effects What About the Ethereum Options Expiring Today? Adding to the market significance, Ethereum options worth $700 million will expire at the same time as the Bitcoin options. These Ethereum contracts show a put/call ratio of 0.95 and a max pain price of $3,650. The nearly equal put/call ratio suggests more balanced sentiment compared to Bitcoin, but still represents substantial market exposure that could influence broader cryptocurrency trends. The simultaneous expiration of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options creates a compounded effect on market liquidity and volatility. Traders often adjust their positions in both assets as these large expirations approach, creating interconnected price movements across the crypto market. What Should Traders Watch For After Expiration? Following today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Price action around the $108,000 max pain level could provide important signals about short-term direction. Additionally, trading volume and open interest changes will reveal how much capital is redeploying into new positions. Historical patterns suggest that large Bitcoin options expirations often precede periods of increased volatility as market makers adjust their hedging strategies. The rebalancing of these substantial positions typically creates trading opportunities for alert market participants who understand the mechanics behind Bitcoin options settlements. Final Thoughts on Today’s Critical Market Event Today’s $4.7 billion Bitcoin options expiration represents a significant market event that could shape short-term price action and volatility. The combination of substantial notional value, specific put/call ratios, and max pain prices creates a complex tapestry of market forces that every crypto trader should understand. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, historical analysis shows that large Bitcoin options expirations often mark important inflection points in market trends. Frequently Asked Questions What time do the Bitcoin options expire? The Bitcoin options expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 7th. What does a put/call ratio of 0.81 mean? A put/call ratio of 0.81 indicates there are slightly more call options than put options, suggesting somewhat bullish market sentiment. What is the max pain price? The max pain price of $108,000 is the strike price where the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, potentially acting as a price magnet. How does this compare to previous Bitcoin options expirations? At $4.7 billion, this represents one of the larger Bitcoin options expirations we’ve seen recently, indicating growing institutional participation in crypto derivatives. Will this affect Bitcoin’s price significantly? Large options expirations often create short-term volatility as positions are adjusted, but the long-term impact depends on broader market factors. Are Ethereum options affected by Bitcoin options expiration? Yes, since both expire simultaneously and many traders hold positions in both assets, there can be correlated effects on pricing and volatility. Found this analysis helpful?

Rockstar’s statement on X said, “We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.” The delay announcement came shortly after groups of former workers gathered outside Rockstar’s UK offices, protesting dismissals that took place in late October. They said management “don’t care about delays to GTA 6” and argued the firings were retaliation against union activity, which Rockstar’s parent denied. Earnings reveal revenue growth and ongoing losses Anyway, Take-Two also reported quarterly earnings today, and its revenue for the second quarter increased 33% to $1.96 billion, beating LSEG estimates of $1.72 billion, thanks to to strong performance from titles like NBA 2K26, Borderlands 4, and ongoing sales of Red Dead Redemption 2. Despite the revenue boost, the company reported a net loss of $133.9 million, or 73 cents per share. The same period the previous year recorded a net loss of $365.5 million, or $2.08 per share, showing the loss narrowed but was still significant. CEO Strauss Zelnick said on the earnings call that:- “We remain both excited and confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience. With the most robust pipeline in our company’s history, we expect to achieve record levels of Net Bookings in Fiscal 2027.” Strauss pointed to continued growth momentum, especially in mobile and the NBA 2K franchise, which has now sold more than 167 million units worldwide. Take-Two raised its bookings outlook to a range of $6.38 billion to $6.48 billion, above the prior estimate of $6.05 billion to $6.15 billion. Reports showed that roughly 40 employees were dismissed after participating in a private Discord chat group involving trade union discussions. A spokesperson for Rockstar’s parent allegedly told Bloomberg this:- “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.” The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain argued otherwise, calling the firings “one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry.” Alex Marshall, president of the union, said in response to Rockstar’s allegations that the gamemaker was “afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.” Security enforcement has been strict at Rockstar since the 2022 leak, when unfinished footage of the next game surfaced publicly. Then in early 2024, staff were required to return to office five days a week, with Rockstar citing security concerns, something the workers’ union called the return-to-office mandate a “reckless” decision. Meanwhile, the community responded in its own way. On Polymarket, traders gave a 48% chance that Bitcoin hits $1,000,000 before GTA 6 releases, and nearly 50% odds that Jesus returns first.

New ecosystem data demonstrate that gaming is becoming the dominant force on-chain, striking a positive note as stalled DeFi projects have been unable to cope with an increasingly turbulent market and talks constrict around key jurisdictions. The contrast also highlights a divide emerging within Web3, with entertainment-focused apps gaining traction alongside financial protocols that are under attack from both external and internal interests. Web3 gaming gains momentum Blockchain gaming also made inroads, despite a slight decline in Web3 use overall. However, the number of daily active wallets on Web3’s networks actually dropped by 3% to approximately 16 million. Meanwhile, gaming-based activity as a percentage of total activity increased its share to 27.9%, the highest of the year. These integrations will never stop with gaming, but will also include user onboarding, gameplay experience, and the expanding reach of multiple blockchain networks. Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon were the main contributors to this activity, with notable projects including Raydium and Pump.fun , JupiterExchange, OKX Dex, and PancakeSwap v2. These platforms could benefit from social trading, lower trading costs, and increased liquidity. Trading in NFTs also surged. Overall NFT volume rose 30% to $546 million, with more than 10.1 million transactions — the most in any month in 2025. Gaming-related digital assets and utility-backed NFTs, integrated with gaming, loyalty programs, and virtual identity customization, were among the biggest volume drivers. This transition occurred from the world of speculative collectibles to that of active and interactive digital artifacts. DeFi absorbs losses and responds October was also a bad month for DeFi, which lost 6.3% of its TVL last month to end the period with $221 billion before tumbling further to start November at $193 billion. The drop occurred following a severe market crash on October 10, which led to massive liquidations. Roughly $20 billion in leveraged positions on large exchanges and lending platforms were erased within days. The case itself worsened as the DeFi protocol Stream Finance lost $93 million. The episode has highlighted wider systemic risks that may be posed by stablecoins and lending against collateral. Analysts later identified at least $284 million more in exposure from similar themes in other DeFisystems. Regulatory pressure compounded the stress. A group of Senate Democrats pleaded for non-custodial wallets to implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. News of the proposal was met with mixed reactions, and industry players speculated that requirements to identify customers who use self-custodied wallets could hinder property-like ownership among users and innovation in favor of less stringent rules across a more accommodating regulatory landscape. Ethereum companies, in response, started banding together to lobby. A coalition of projects, including Aave, Uniswap, Lido, Curve, and The Graph, has formed the Ethereum Protocol Advocacy Alliance. The coalition advocates that decentralized infrastructure should be included in the conversation when discussing regulations and that blockchain networks should remain open-access. Elsewhere, Oracle network RedStone has introduced a new platform called Credora, aiming to offer consistent risk and credit scores across decentralized finance (DeFi) lending markets. The system is designed to make trading more transparent and help reduce systemic risk, especially that inherent in over-leveraged credit markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The integration will surface current market probabilities directly in the search box and chart how those odds change over time. Ask a question like what will GDP growth be for 2025, and Google will display the latest pricing from these markets alongside recent shifts in sentiment. Polymarket And Kalshi Secure Billion-Dollar Valuations As Event Trading Expands Beyond Finance Google framed the move as a way to bring event odds into everyday workflows for investors, researchers, and the crypto crowd that already tracks market implied probabilities across rates, elections, sports, and macro. KALSHI AND GOOGLE FINANCE PARTNER TO ADD PREDICTION MARKETS — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) November 6, 2025 The tie-up lands as both platforms scale. Polymarket drew a recent investment from Intercontinental Exchange that valued the company around $9b. Kalshi raised $300m at a $5b valuation , signaling growing institutional interest in event contracts. Adoption has widened beyond finance. In October, Polymarket and Kalshi became the first officially licensed prediction markets of the NHL, a milestone that put more pressure on incumbent wagering apps like DraftKings and FanDuel to respond. Prediction Markets Cement Place In The New Retail Trading Cycle Once access switches on, Google Finance users will be able to ask questions in natural language and receive relevant market data in line. That includes point-in-time probabilities and historical ranges that show how views evolved around key headlines. Brokerages are leaning in as well. Robinhood partnered with Kalshi in August to offer contracts on professional and college football, then expanded the slate. On the latest earnings call, CEO Vlad Tenev said prediction markets are on fire, pointing to rapid user uptake. Volumes back that up. Weekly turnover across prediction markets topped $2b in late October for the first time, led by Polymarket’s sports boards and a busier slate of news-driven questions. Regulatory positioning is shifting too. Polymarket, once restricted from serving the US after a 2022 CFTC action, re-entered the conversation this year by acquiring a venue with a Designated Contract Market license, paving the way for compliant US access. Prediction Prices Could Become A Core Market Metric If Google’s Rollout Succeeds Competition is building. Bloomberg reported this week that Gemini is preparing to launch prediction market contracts , subject to regulatory approval, with plans to move as soon as possible once cleared. That would place the exchange alongside Kalshi and Polymarket in a fast-growing category. For crypto-native traders, the Google integration could tighten the loop between price discovery and public data. Market odds that once lived on specialized sites will sit a search away, creating a broader funnel for event-driven trading and risk hedging. If the rollout lands smoothly, prediction prices may become another default data point next to stock quotes, bond yields and exchange rates. For a market that prizes real-time signals, crowd-sourced probabilities could become part of the daily toolkit.

Die Kursgeschichte zeigt starke Schwankungen, zuletzt jedoch eine Konsolidierung mit Potenzial. Auf Basis aktueller Nutzungs- und Marktindikatoren lassen sich vage Szenarien für die kommende Zeit formulieren – mit gebotener Vorsicht. Die Kryptowährung Ripple (XRP) steht im Mittelpunkt vieler Erwartungen – nicht nur als Spekulationsobjekt, sondern vor allem als digitales Mittel für reale Zahlungsflüsse. Während viele Coins auf bloße Kursbewegung setzen, will XRP eine Brückenfunktion im globalen Finanzsystem übernehmen. In diesem Artikel schauen wir erst auf den Nutzen von XRP, dann auf die historische Entwicklung und zuletzt wagen wir eine vorsichtige Prognose, wohin die Reise gehen könnte. 1. Nutzen und Funktion von XRP Der zentrale Zweck von Ripple liegt darin, Transaktionen zwischen verschiedenen Währungen schneller, günstiger und effizienter zu gestalten. XRP dient als Brückenwährung, um Liquidität zwischen Banken und Zahlungsdienstleistern bereitzustellen. Damit schließt Ripple eine Lücke, die traditionelle Finanzsysteme bisher nur schwer überwinden konnten. Das XRP Ledger bietet Transaktionen in wenigen Sekunden und mit minimalen Gebühren – ein Vorteil, der besonders bei grenzüberschreitenden Zahlungen relevant ist. Hinzu kommt die Nachhaltigkeit: Im Gegensatz zu Bitcoin oder Ethereum verwendet XRP kein energieintensives Mining. Das Netzwerk validiert Transaktionen über einen Konsens-Mechanismus, der ressourcenschonender arbeitet. Diese technische Effizienz macht Ripple zu einem der umweltfreundlicheren Akteure im Krypto-Bereich. Zunehmend entstehen auch neue Anwendungen: Neben klassischen Finanzlösungen wird XRP zunehmend in DeFi-Projekten, Smart-Contract-Plattformen und Stablecoin-Konzepten integriert. Dadurch wächst die Relevanz des Coins weit über seinen ursprünglichen Zweck hinaus. 2. Historische Preisentwicklung von XRP Seit seiner Einführung im Jahr 2012 hat Ripple eine bewegte Geschichte hinter sich. Der Kursverlauf war durch extreme Schwankungen geprägt – von rasanten Anstiegen bis zu tiefen Korrekturen. Besonders 2017 erlebte XRP einen spektakulären Höhenflug, als der Preis über die Marke von drei Dollar stieg. In den Folgejahren folgten teils drastische Rückgänge, die den Markt wieder auf den Boden der Realität brachten. In den letzten drei Jahren zeigte sich ein stabileres Bild. 2021 profitierte XRP zeitweise vom allgemeinen Aufschwung am Kryptomarkt, fiel danach jedoch zurück und bewegte sich lange um die Marke von 50 Cent. 2025 mit der Wahl von Trump in den USA startete eine Phase des Aufschwungs, in der XRP zwischen 2,20 und maimal 3,40 Dollar pendelte. Aktuell ist Ripple wieder etwas gefallen und pendelt ca. bei 2,30 und 2,50 Dollar. Diese Seitwärtsbewegung deutet darauf hin, dass der Markt aktuell nach einer klaren Richtung sucht. Ein wesentlicher Faktor in der Kursentwicklung war der Rechtsstreit zwischen Ripple Labs und der US-Börsenaufsicht SEC. Die teilweise positive gerichtliche Entscheidung von 2023 brachte wieder Vertrauen in das Projekt zurück und könnte langfristig den regulatorischen Druck mindern – ein möglicher Grundstein für zukünftiges Wachstum. 3. Vorsichtige Prognose und Ausblick Die Zukunft von XRP hängt maßgeblich davon ab, ob Ripple seine technologische und regulatorische Position weiter stärken kann. Sollte es dem Unternehmen gelingen, neue Banken, Zahlungsdienstleister und FinTechs als Partner zu gewinnen, könnte sich die Nachfrage nach XRP deutlich erhöhen. Der Ausbau des Netzwerks und die mögliche Einführung neuer Produkte – etwa XRP-gestützte Stablecoins – könnten die Akzeptanz zusätzlich fördern. Analysten sehen für die kommenden Jahre moderate Aufwärtspotenziale, sofern die allgemeine Marktlage stabil bleibt. Eine Rückkehr zu früheren Hochs erscheint auf absehbare Zeit zwar ambitioniert, jedoch nicht ausgeschlossen, falls sich die institutionelle Nutzung weiter ausweitet. Kurzfristig könnte XRP zwischen 2,20 und 2,80 Dollar schwanken, während langfristig ein langsamer, nachhaltiger Anstieg denkbar wäre. Allerdings bleibt jede Prognose unsicher : Der Kryptomarkt reagiert sensibel auf politische Entscheidungen, technologische Entwicklungen und wirtschaftliche Trends. Anleger sollten daher Geduld und Realismus mitbringen – und sich bewusst sein, dass Chancen und Risiken eng beieinanderliegen.

Miran’s statement came after he mentioned that he anticipates a rate cut in December unless something unexpected occurs during an interview with Jack Farley on the Monetary Matters podcast. The Fed governor also acknowledged that, while the distribution of around-the-table changes is underway, the distribution of views among Fed officials varies. Miran’s remarks follow the Fed’s 25-basis-point rate cut in late October, which lowered the target range to 3.75%–4%. The October cut followed months of elevated inflation , though recent economic data suggest some moderation. Miran calls for a rate cut in the Fed’s December meeting The Federal governor minimized the necessity for more aggressive monetary easing , highlighting that the central bank does not require a 75-basis-point cut and does not need to make up for previous cuts. When addressing economic conditions, Miran described the current decline in the labor market as gradual, rather than accelerating. Therefore, based on his argument, the situation does not require urgent emergency actions. Meanwhile, although Miran expects a rate cut in December , sources have pointed out that the federal governor earlier cautioned that nothing is guaranteed in the end. Still, he shared his belief that the Fed’s decision to continue reducing interest rates is a good idea, possibly even at its final meeting of the year, scheduled for December 9-10. In another interview, Miran outlined earlier forecasts that suggested the likelihood of three rate cuts in 2025. “Has anything changed since then?” the Fed governor asked. When reporters asked Miran about the lack of enough official economic data, he responded that there is insufficient information about the economy due to the government shutdown. He further explained that inflation levels have been lower than expected, and the job market remained steady. On the other hand, sources stated that after several considerations, the Fed decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. This action lowered the target range to 3.75% to 4%. However, Miran was against this move because he wanted a bigger cut, specifically half a percentage point. Regarding his aim to secure a neutral policy stance, Miran mentioned that he prefers a policy stance that strikes a balance, supporting growth without pushing it too hard or holding it back. Fed officials raise concerns about further rate cuts Reliable sources have noted that since the recently held policy meeting, several Fed officials have raised concerns about inflation and are hesitant about reducing rates again in December. Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Fed, commented on the matter, stating that he was not sure about the December rate cut. Additionally, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly echoed similar thoughts while delivering their speeches. On the other hand, Kansas City Federal Reserve president Jeff Schmid expressed his support for maintaining rates unchanged during the policy meeting. Considering the intense nature of the situation, analysts acknowledged that this situation places Miran in a unique position as he recommends further cuts. This followed his remarks that anything can occur between today and December: new information might be released, there could be surprises, or even the occurrence of unexpected events. “But unless we receive new information that significantly changes our outlook, I believe it would still be a reasonable choice to continue with our current approach,” the Fed governor added.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has just slipped to 23, signaling a dramatic change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When the index scores above 75, we’re in an altcoin season where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. However, the current reading of 23 tells a very different story. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Dropping So Dramatically? Several factors contribute to this significant decline in the Altcoin Season Index. Bitcoin’s recent strength has drawn capital away from altcoins, creating a classic ‘flight to safety’ scenario. Moreover, market uncertainty often drives investors toward established assets like Bitcoin rather than riskier alternatives. Key reasons for the index drop include: Bitcoin dominance increasing across exchanges Institutional preference for Bitcoin over smaller altcoins Market volatility driving conservative investment choices Regulatory uncertainty affecting altcoin projects How Does This Altcoin Season Index Affect Your Investments? Understanding the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 23 helps you make informed decisions. When the index remains this low, it typically indicates that Bitcoin is outperforming most other cryptocurrencies. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but it does suggest a more cautious approach might be wise. Consider these investment strategies during low Altcoin Season Index periods: Diversify but prioritize quality over quantity Focus on established projects with strong fundamentals Monitor the index for signs of reversal Consider dollar-cost averaging into positions When Might We See the Altcoin Season Index Recover? Historical patterns suggest that low Altcoin Season Index readings often precede significant altcoin rallies. However, timing these shifts requires careful market analysis. Watch for these potential catalysts that could boost the Altcoin Season Index: Bitcoin price stabilization Positive regulatory developments Major technological breakthroughs in altcoin projects Increased institutional adoption of alternative cryptocurrencies What Should You Do Now With the Altcoin Season Index at 23? The current Altcoin Season Index presents both challenges and opportunities. While caution is warranted, this could also be an excellent time to research fundamentally strong altcoins at discounted prices. Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical, and today’s underperformers could become tomorrow’s leaders. Essential actions to consider: Review your portfolio allocation Research promising altcoin projects Set clear entry and exit strategies Monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 23 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 23 indicates that only 23% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days, signaling strong Bitcoin dominance in the current market cycle. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data refreshes, providing near real-time insights into the relative performance between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. Low index readings can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong projects, though careful research and risk management are essential. What Altcoin Season Index reading indicates a true altcoin season? An Altcoin Season Index above 75 typically indicates an altcoin season, where the majority of top cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, extremely low Altcoin Season Index readings have historically coincided with potential accumulation zones for altcoins. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for investment decisions? The index provides valuable context but should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools for comprehensive investment decisions.

New DeFi Coin Named Among 2025’s Most Promising Projects,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-under-0-05-new-defi-coin-named-among-2025s-most-promising-projects/,"It takes a couple of years between consideration of a new crypto project that draws the attention of the market to the right reason, not hype, but quality design and steady implementation. One of those projects is in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at only $0.035, it is already turning out to be one of the potential best crypto to watch now, due to its transparent pre-sale, product roadmap, and its sustainable model of tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is constructing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, intended to make markets on chains safer and more efficient. Rather than having the speculation, it adds financial mechanistic, which would reward users through participation. The protocol consists of two basic markets. The first one is that of Peer-to-Contract (P2C), a shared market system in which members place their assets and are given the return as mtTokens. These interest-save tokens are a representation of the deposit of the user as well as a part of the earnings of the pool. As an illustration, a user who deposits $1,000 in ETH will be eligible to get mtTokens that will correspondingly increase with interest earned. The second system is the Peer-to-peer (P2P), a lending system that isolates smaller or more specialized assets into their own markets. P2P market transactions allow borrowers to have a variety of loans, both in variable and fixed borrow rates. The size of the loans will be based on a prescribed Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. In cases where the collateral of an individual loan holder is below the safety levels, liquidations are automatically carried out to safeguard the protocol. This mechanism would keep the system solvent and the liquidators are rewarded to repay bad debt by the system. Detailed Presale Overview The presale of Mutuum Finance has been one the most watched DeFi events of the year. Over 17,750 holders and approximately 790 million tokens sold on the project to date means that the project has already raised over $18.45 million. The token began with Phase 1 at $0.01 in early 2025 and has since soared to a value of $0.035 in the current Phase 6, which has increased its value by 250%. The participants who entered at Phase 1 would potentially experience more than 500% appreciation at launch. At present, Phase 6 has been sold more than 83%, showing a profitable and steady demand. The momentum with each presale part is that the allocation and price are fixed so the more the investors participate the faster the sellouts will occur and the price of the tokens will go up. Engagement is another area that Mutuum Finance maintains high as it has a 24-hour leaderboard that gives the daily most significant contributor with $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This incentive plan introduces transparency and interest among investors to join in the early days at increased presale propulsion. The team has also made the process of entry to be made easy by enabling the users to purchase MUTM by card without any purchase restrictions to make it available to both large and retail investors. V1 Launch and Audit V1 launch is one of the Mutuum Finance’s main milestones, which is stated to be live in the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The base features, Liquidity Pool, mt Token, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot will be launched with ETH and USDT as assets to lend, borrow, and use as collaterals to support assets at launch because these are the most liquid and reliable. Security is one of the key concerns. The project has passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, which proves its code reliability and the level of security. This will provide the investors with a greater assurance that the project is constructed to be long lasting. Many say that after the V1 testnet launches and the token is listed on $0.06, the visibility will increase significantly. Some analysts have estimated a 5x to 7x price rise, supported by the buy-and-distribute nature of the token, with MUTM buying on the open market redistributed to the user base who stake on the safety module with mtTokens. Stablecoin and L-2 Growth In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance plans to have its own USD-pegged stablecoin. This secure coin shall be on demand and supported by collaterals in the protocol. The interest charged on loans will be directed to the treasury to handle the growth of the ecosystem and to offer stability whenever there is a fluctuation in the market. Layer-2 integration is the other major segment of the roadmap. The group seeks to implement Mutuum Finance on various chains to provide the quickest services and reduce costs to customers. This will not only ensure lending is done efficiently, but also ensure access to greater volumes of liquidity networks. These characteristics are very essential in terms of scalability. Stablecoins generate foreseeable utility, whereas Layer-2 implementation ensures lower expenses and more users are attracted, two factors that have led to the growth of other successful DeFi initiatives in the past, such as Aave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be among the top cryptocurrency to invest in below $0.05 this year. With Phase 6 coming to its consummation, and investors scrambling to get allocations before the next price spurt, it is becoming apparent why many analysts have called MUTM one of the best potential ventures in 2025.

Recent data from CoinGecko indicates that Bitcoin has retraced nearly 6% over the past week, a decline that has impacted other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), all of which have experienced double-digit losses during the same period. Galaxy Digital Lowers Bitcoin Price Target This downturn marks a stark contrast to the bullish sentiment observed earlier in October, when Bitcoin surged to record its current record high slightly above the $126,000 mark due to a wave of margin buying. However, the euphoria was short-lived, as approximately $20 billion in leveraged positions across the crypto market were abruptly liquidated just days later on October 10, contributing to the ongoing lack of confidence among investors. Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital recently revised its year-end Bitcoin price target down to $120,000, a significant cut from the previous estimate of $185,000, attributing this adjustment to the “significant leverage wipeout.” Related Reading: Weakness In Major Cryptos: What Key Technical Metrics Indicate For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Market analytics firm CryptoQuant has pointed out that Bitcoin’s drop below its 365-day moving average near $102,000 could signal a deeper retreat. This moving average has historically acted as a critical support level during this bull cycle, and its failure to hold could lead to a more substantial correction in Bitcoin’s price. In their analysis, CryptoQuant experts elaborated on the conditions necessary for Bitcoin to reverse its current trajectory and potentially reach new all-time highs. They observed that Bitcoin led a global risk-off movement, testing the critical $100,000 support level. This decline was influenced by a stronger dollar and ongoing uncertainties regarding Federal Reserve (Fed) policy, which have dampened broader risk appetites across various asset classes. Notably, there have been four consecutive sessions of approximately $1.3 billion in net outflows from US spot BTC ETFs, reversing what had been one of the strongest tailwinds for the market in 2025. This diminished demand in the spot market has coincided with forced deleveraging, resulting in over $1 billion in long liquidations at recent lows, which briefly breached intraday support before dip buyers stepped in. Stabilization Of ETF Flows Crucial The options market has further intensified volatility, as dealers remain net short gamma around the $100,000 strike, leading to increased hedging activity near this critical level. The $100,000 mark now stands as a psychological barrier, and any stabilization in ETF flows could shift market sentiment, provided no new macroeconomic shocks occur. On the macroeconomic front, the analysts assert that the current environment remains supportive, albeit clouded by the ongoing government shutdown in Washington. However, policy clarity remains elusive. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Needs To Reclaim This Key Level To Prevent Drop To $1,700 The Federal Reserve’s recent 25 basis point cut in October, which included some dissenting opinions, was accompanied by a cautious tone that pushed back against expectations for another cut in December. Markets are currently pricing in a 60-65% chance of a follow-up move, but as the Fed’s blackout period continues, policymakers may become more comfortable with the idea of pausing, which would help maintain a firm dollar and tight credit conditions. For Bitcoin to break higher sustainably, CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that a reversal in exchange-traded fund outflows and renewed confidence in risk assets will likely be necessary.

54113445,622508,1762477247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54113445.jpeg,Hot Money Floods Binance: $26B In ‘Young Bitcoin’ Inflows Signal Speculative Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/hot-money-floods-binance-26b-young-bitcoin-inflows/,"Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $100,000 level after briefly dipping below it earlier this week — a move that triggered widespread panic selling and reinforced bearish sentiment across the market. The sharp selloff liquidated leveraged positions and sent fear metrics surging, but the swift recovery shows that buyers are still active near key demand zones. According to a new report by CryptoOnchain, the recent market turbulence coincides with a surge in “hot money” flows to Binance. Data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable spike in monthly Bitcoin inflows to the exchange during October 2025, signaling heightened speculative activity. What’s particularly significant is that this inflow is driven almost entirely by “young” coins — UTXOs aged between 0 and 1 day — suggesting that short-term traders and algorithmic participants are dominating recent movements. This trend highlights a clear uptick in intraday and momentum-driven trading, often linked to volatility and short-lived price swings. While such dynamics can amplify downside risk, they also tend to precede strong market reversals once liquidity stabilizes. As Bitcoin regains footing above the $100K threshold, the market now watches closely to see whether this wave of speculative capital marks the beginning of a broader recovery or just another temporary bounce. “Hot Money” Drives Exchange Activity, but Long-Term Holders Stay Firm According to CryptoOnchain, inflows from “young” Bitcoin coins have surged sharply, jumping from roughly $18 billion in September to nearly $26 billion in October. This marks one of the highest inflow levels in the past 12 months, underscoring heightened activity among day traders, speculators, and arbitrage bots. Such behavior typically emerges when markets experience elevated volatility or uncertainty, as short-term participants move assets onto exchanges to position for quick trades. Historically, sharp increases in exchange inflows often hint at bearish sentiment or potential selling pressure, as traders prepare to take profits or hedge risk. However, the UTXO age breakdown tells a more layered story. Inflows from older coins, typically held by long-term holders (LTHs), remain negligible and close to zero. This divergence indicates that the recent activity is largely short-term in nature, confined to traders reacting to immediate market conditions rather than long-term investors exiting positions. In essence, while “hot money” inflows could amplify short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s structural foundation remains intact. The core investor base continues holding off-exchange, showing resilience amid market turbulence. The report suggests that the Bitcoin market is split into two: speculative capital chasing short-term opportunities on one side, and long-term conviction holders quietly standing firm on the other. This balance could determine whether the next move is another shakeout or the start of a new accumulation phase. Bitcoin Faces Resistance After Brief Recovery Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a fragile recovery following its sharp decline below the $100,000 level earlier this week. After hitting a low near $98,900, BTC rebounded modestly to $103,000, where it now faces immediate resistance from the 20-day and 50-day moving averages (blue and green lines). These averages have started to slope downward, confirming the short-term bearish trend and capping upside attempts. The $105,000–$107,000 zone represents the next critical resistance area. A break above this range would likely attract short covering and signal the first signs of stabilization. However, failure to reclaim this zone could lead to renewed selling pressure, with potential retests of $100,000 or even $97,500, a key psychological support level. Trading volume remains elevated, reflecting ongoing market volatility and uncertainty. While bulls have managed to defend $100K for now, momentum remains weak, and sentiment is still heavily bearish across derivatives and spot markets. Bitcoin is consolidating within a fragile structure, attempting to build a base after significant liquidations. To regain bullish momentum, BTC must reclaim its short-term moving averages and hold above $107K — otherwise, downside risks persist as traders remain cautious following the recent leverage wipeout.

The fintech reported net income of $461.5m for the period, according to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a Thursday letter to shareholders , the firm said gross profit rose 18% year over year, led by a 24% jump in Cash App and 9% growth in Square. “Block grew gross profit 18% year over year in the third quarter, with 24% year-over-year growth in Cash App and 9% year-over-year growth in Square,” he said. Shares closed at $70.94 on Wednesday, down 3.7%, and slipped further in after-hours trading to $64.10. We shared our Q3 earnings results today, delivering strong momentum across Block. Gross profit grew 18% year over year, driven by continued strength in both Cash App and Square. Full recap on the quarter here: https://t.co/EvXlVqSmUX pic.twitter.com/ielZTquCVG — Block Investor Relations (@BlockIR) November 6, 2025 Mixed Quarter for Block as Bitcoin Still Anchors Revenue Base Market watchers surveyed by Zacks had forecast $6.34b in revenue and earnings per share of $0.63. Actual results came in slightly lower, with $6.11b in revenue and adjusted EPS of $0.54. Gross profit reached $2.66b, up 18% year over year, while net income climbed 64%. The company forecasted fourth-quarter gross profit of around $2.75b, implying 19% annual growth. Adjusted operating income came in at $409m versus consensus estimates of $473m, while EBITDA rose 3% to $833m, narrowly missing projections of $840m. Bitcoin revenue totaled $1.97b, down from $2.4b a year earlier, yet it remains Block’s second-largest revenue stream behind subscriptions and services. Bitcoin costs dropped to $1.89b from $2.36b during the same period in 2024. Company Expands Bitcoin Suite Even as Holdings Face Quarterly Markdowns The firm’s BTC holdings stood at 8,780 BTC as of Sept. 30, up from 8,485 at the start of the year. Those holdings, valued at more than $1b, saw a negative remeasurement of $59m in the quarter and $178m year-to-date. Block has continued expanding its Bitcoin ecosystem. In October, it launched new payment tools and a merchant wallet to help sellers accept Bitcoin directly. Earlier this year, the company paid $40m to settle allegations from the New York Department of Financial Services over compliance gaps tied to its BTC operations. Founded by Dorsey in 2009, Block has evolved from a payment processor into a broader financial platform with deep exposure to digital assets. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 earlier this year marked a milestone for one of the highest-profile Bitcoin-integrated companies in the US. Shares Slip Post-Earnings, but Analysts Cite Long-Term Crypto Strategy as a Strength Dorsey has long described Bitcoin as “the internet’s native currency” and said his mission is to make it usable for everyday payments. He once remarked that if he were not working on Twitter or Block, he would be dedicating his career entirely to Bitcoin development. Shares continued to slide after the report, down more than 11% in late trading. Still, many analysts view Block’s long-term Bitcoin exposure as strategic, particularly as institutional adoption of crypto assets accelerates globally. Meanwhile, Dorsey’s advocacy for everyday Bitcoin use is gaining traction in Washington. Sen. Cynthia Lummis is drafting legislation to exempt small crypto transactions from capital gains taxes, a proposal inspired by Dorsey’s call to make bitcoin a medium of exchange rather than just a store of value.

Their effort comes as word has spread that the company, SAP SE, the German enterprise software giant, has attracted renewed interest from potential buyers. The pressure arises as software valuations have cooled and public-market investors are voicing concerns about where companies should position themselves for the next leg of growth. For some time now, BlackLine has been recognized as a leader in the financial close and reconciliation automation software category. It counts corporate finance departments among its customers, who rely on its products to automate additional manual accounting-related tasks and produce end-of-month reports more efficiently. The company was a leading beneficiary of the larger move to cloud computing over the past decade. Revenue growth has also slowed, although it has decelerated from an extremely high historical level. The broader markets have become less inclined to underwrite long-term profits for subscription-style software vendors in a booming economy. The only way for BlackLine to fulfill its potential, in their view, is by combining with a larger player, say, SAP, that can integrate its products, sell them worldwide, and innovate at a much faster clip on alternative uses for the technology. Investors push for strategic review A few investment firms that own significant chunks of BlackLine have informed the board in recent weeks that it may need to consider selling itself. Among them are Ananym Capital Management, Tensile Capital Management, and Sheffield Asset Management. A second large shareholder has also privately thrown its support behind the concept. BlackLine is trading at a discount to its long-term potential, they say, particularly as software designed to automate the financial close market heats up. An acquisition by a well-financed acquirer may allow the company to grow more rapidly and enhance product integration, while providing immediate benefits for shareholders in the form of a premium buyout price . The pressure started mounting after the activist investment firm Engaged Capital publicly advocated for a sale. The letter stated that the company is at a strategic crossroads: The business has positions of strength in the market for finance automation, but growth has slowed, margins are declining, and investor sentiment has turned negative. BlackLine’s chief executive, Owen Ryan, hinted at the surging phone traffic during an earnings call last month. The board is aware of how shareholders feel and maintains regular conversations with investors, he added. However, he offered no specifics on the next steps for launching an official sales process. Nevertheless, proponents of BlackLine’s current approach argue that there remains significant room for growth in the world of finance transformation. They also note that an era of technology may have dawned . However, many companies are still stuck with old-school manual ledgers containing a significant amount of revenue, one to which Palabra has relatively appealing access. However, for those who do want a sale now, the window to extract that kind of value may well be today, not in some more distant tomorrow, when bidding wars and, with them, pricing power will only grow worse. SAP moves to strengthen its cloud finance strategy SAP had already attempted to acquire BlackLine earlier this year with an acquisition offer for the company’s shares, according to media reports. BlackLine’s board at the time rejected the offer, claiming that it could create better long-term value for itself independently of StreetAccount. Shares of BlackLine have been lackluster this year, recently closing in the mid-$50s. The shares dropped further after the company lowered its profit forecast, as investors are increasingly skeptical that it can deliver better-than-expected performance on its own. With investors increasing the pressure and given changes in market dynamics, BlackLine is being presented with a major strategic choice: continue along its current path of independence or take advantage of an opportunity for partnership or outright sale. Considering the interest from deep-pocketed players, including SAP, the company’s next move could be the one that either helps it grow its global presence or leaves it too far behind in a march to dominate a crowded finance automation landscape. Investors will be watching closely, as the result could set the tone for how software companies find flexibility to maintain their independence and strategic leeway in the era of cloud computing.

A Closer Look at the Noomez ($NNZ) Burn Model,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-has-1000x-potential-a-closer-look-at-the-noomez/,"Which crypto has 1000x potential?

This level of engagement has made $NNZ a standout among contenders for the next 100x crypto , combining fair distribution, interactive storytelling, and provable on-chain transparency.

For investors comparing the top 10 AI crypto coins for 2025, Noomez represents a project that merges creativity with real token utility and verified transparency.

Scarcity Built into the Core $NNZ stands out for a straightforward reason: scarcity is built into its DNA. With a fixed supply of 280 billion tokens , no minting, and automatic burns at the end of every stage. Burns That Strengthen Value Each unsold token at the close of a stage is burned forever , permanently reducing supply while increasing rarity. As the price progresses from $0.0001 to $0.028 across 28 stages, the deflationary curve naturally rewards early believers, tightening supply as demand grows. Why Analysts Call It a Hidden Gem This structure has already earned recognition among analysts searching for low-cap altcoin gems with 1000x potential. Every burn is on-chain, every price tier is verifiable, and every completed stage strengthens both the token’s floor and its story-driven allure.

54114841,622747,1762480822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54114841.jpeg,"$345 Million In Bitcoin Gone — But FBI Isn’t At Fault, Judges Say",https://bitcoinist.com/345-million-bitcoin-fbi-fault-judges/,"The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has affirmed a district court’s refusal to award a Florida defendant the value of roughly 3,443 bitcoin—now “worth over $345 million”—after the government destroyed an external hard drive he belatedly claimed held the keys, holding that the equitable doctrine of laches bars relief because he spent years denying he owned meaningful cryptocurrency. The published opinion, authored by Judge Elizabeth “Lisa” Branch Grant and joined by Judges Jill Pryor and Marcus, leaves intact the lower court’s ruling that the United States cannot be compelled to replace the bitcoin, even assuming the drive ever contained it. FBI Not To Blame For 3,443 Bitcoin Hard Drive Wipe The case, United States v. Prime, No. 23-13776 , arose from a 2019 arrest that uncovered extensive counterfeiting and identity-theft paraphernalia. Michael Prime ultimately pleaded guilty to access-device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and illegal firearm possession. In the investigation’s early days, agents tried and failed three times to locate cryptocurrency tied to his activities under federal warrants; by sentencing in June 2020, Prime and his counsel had walked back earlier references to thousands of bitcoin, representing instead that his remaining crypto was trivial. The government proceeded accordingly. As Judge Grant summarized, Prime “at least three times” represented he owned “very little bitcoin,” and after release he still did not identify any device as holding valuable keys when he sought the return of property. The government followed its “ordinary practices,” wiping devices it could after notice; the rest—including the orange external drive at issue—were destroyed. “Only later did Prime claim to be a bitcoin tycoon ,” the court wrote. “By then it was too late.” Although headlines have centered the FBI, the record shows it was the US Secret Service that contacted Prime in mid-2022 offering to wipe and return certain devices if he provided passwords. He asked for a pickup time, then filed pro se motions instead; none of those filings mentioned bitcoin or a hard drive. The drive was later destroyed with other electronics because Prime refused to cooperate in removing contraband data. The Eleventh Circuit underscored causation and prejudice: “We have little difficulty concluding that the government would not have destroyed the hard drive if it had thought that it contained millions of dollars in bitcoin.” With the drive gone, “the government cannot return it,” and to the extent the bitcoin ever existed—“and we have our doubts”—ordering the United States to “find and hand over almost 3,443 replacement bitcoin” would be prejudicial “now to the tune of over $345 million.” The panel was openly skeptical of Prime’s attempts to reframe his disclosures. He argued, for example, that when he reported “$200 to $1,500 in bitcoin” in February 2020, he meant the then-market price of a single bitcoin, not his holdings. “We don’t buy it,” the court wrote, noting that in February 2020 BTC traded between “about $8,500 and $10,500” and that Prime had promised “complete, accurate and truthful” asset disclosures encompassing any asset in which he had “any interest” or control. The opinion quotes defense counsel’s own admission at sentencing that the original claim to “some great amount of bitcoin” was “not supported by the evidence.” Having affirmed on laches, the Eleventh Circuit did not reach broader questions, such as whether any BTC—if it existed—would have been forfeitable. The court also noted Prime forfeited any challenge to the factual finding that the drive was destroyed by failing to raise it below. The narrow holding is that equitable relief is unavailable where a claimant’s multi-year denials induced the government to stop searching for assets and to process seized electronics in the ordinary course—conduct the panel repeatedly tied to his non-cooperation and delay rather than to any governmental bad faith. As Judge Grant summarized the district court’s bottom line, “laches barred his bitcoin request. We agree and affirm.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,825.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BTC news|btc price|FBI,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 02:00:22

Santiment reported 21,595 new wallets created in 48 hours — the biggest jump in eight months. The move came as XRP dropped to $2.06 before rallying back to about $2.33, a roughly 13% gain from that low. Related Reading: ‘Good News’ Finally Arrives For SHIB Army As Team Unveils New Update Surge In Wallets Draws Attention Based on reports, the spike in wallet creation has captured market attention because it breaks a recent pattern of heavy selling. Data showed long-term holders were offloading about 260 million XRP per day during last month’s sell-off. Now, fresh wallets are appearing while prices recover. That combination suggests different groups of traders may be acting at the same time — some cutting losses, others buying the dip. Community figures point out that total wallets now stand at 7.226 million and are moving toward 7.5 million, according to an XRP Rich List resource. 📈 XRP’s price has bounced back, and users who bought the dip have enjoyed a nice +12% jump in the past 24 hours. Notably, XRP Ledger data indicates there were 21,595 new $XRP wallets created in a 48-hour span in the past couple days, the highest level of growth in 8 months. pic.twitter.com/vkGLwLJjrk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 5, 2025 A similar but milder burst of network growth was followed by a climb to a yearly high of $3.66. That historical link is being watched. Still, new wallet creation is a signal rather than proof of sustained buying. Some of the incoming addresses can belong to exchanges, custodians, or automated services. So the makeup of new wallets matters as much as the number. ETF Timetable Could Add Fuel Reports have disclosed that an XRP spot ETF might get a US launch date of November 13. ETF talk has a history of drawing institutional interest into crypto markets, and rumors alone can move prices. In this case, analysts in the XRP community are tying the wallet growth to expectations surrounding the ETF. One community analyst, Egrag Crypto, has outlined bullish targets, calling one level “Macro Wick 1” at $10 and another, much higher, “Macro Wick 2” at $50. Those are his technical scenarios, offered as possibilities rather than certainties. Market Volatility Still Present The wider crypto market showed how fast things can swing between November 3 and 4, when the total market cap fell by nearly $350 billion and XRP slid about 13.16% to around $2.20. That pullback is fresh in traders’ minds. Short-term gains can be steep. For example, a $10,000 buy placed two days ago would already have gained about $1,300 after the rebound. Yet big moves work both ways in turbulent markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst For now, the picture is mixed. New wallets and a 13% bounce are encouraging signs of renewed interest. Historical precedents and analyst forecasts add to bullish narratives. But wallet growth alone does not guarantee sustained price rises. Investors should watch where the new wallets are concentrated, monitor daily sell volumes, and pay attention to confirmed news about an ETF.

The stock plunged more than 8% in Tokyo, extending losses from earlier this week as a shift in sentiment toward the high-flying technology sector drove prices down. The sell-off comes as doubts grow over whether valuations for AI-related startups have surged too high, too quickly. Investors flocked to the sector all year, but now they are cashing out and reconsidering how soon AI companies can turn technological promise into reliable revenue. SoftBank has become one of the most ardent champions of AI globally. Between its Vision Funds and direct investments, the firm has holdings in semiconductor manufacturing, artificial intelligence software, data infrastructure, and robotics. This stance also makes the company especially vulnerable as investor sentiment swings against AI. The stock had made a modest recovery on Thursday, climbing almost 3 percent after its steep decline the day before. Wednesday’s 10% decline was the company’s worst trading day since April. The rebound was fleeting, however, and Friday’s slide erased those gains. The broader Japanese tech market was also under pressure. The shares of the semiconductor testing company Advantest plummeted, and those of the chipmaker Renesas Electronics also declined. Shares of Tokyo Electron, a major manufacturer of semiconductor production equipment, also fell. The shares of SK Hynix, a supplier of memory chips to AI data centers, dropped in trading in South Korea. The decreases are also part of a broader rotation out of high-risk, high-reward sectors, analysts say. Slower chip orders, rising funding costs, and longer times for AI adoption are driving this change. U.S. tech decline weighs on sentiment The decline in Asia mirrors losses in major U.S. AI and semiconductor shares from the previous day. Shares of Qualcomm declined after the company reported better-than-expected results, but noted that it could lose a future supply deal with Apple. AMD, which had rallied earlier in the week with hopes for AI chip demand, also lost ground. Software companies closely associated with developing AI technology, such as Palantir and Oracle, also fell. Even Nvidia and Meta Platforms, among the companies central to the current AI boom, finished lower in the U.S. session. Their weakness sent a message to global investors that momentum in the sector could be waning, at least in the short term. Market strategists say investors are rethinking their assumptions about how quickly AI investment will lead to profit growth. Still, many companies are investing large sums in research and cloud infrastructure, as well as manufacturing their own specialized computer chips, without immediate returns on such investments. SoftBank feels pressure over its bet on a diminished AI future Under Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s long-term strategy is based on the conviction that artificial intelligence will revolutionize industries worldwide. The company’s investment in Arm, the British chip designer whose architecture forms the basis of many of the world’s mobile and data devices, has been a key component of this strategy. Gains in Arm’s valuation during the first part of the year had helped buoy SoftBank’s overall view. However, its fortunes have swung dramatically as markets have gyrated. The Vision Funds are also undergoing an overhaul, as SoftBank reduces its holdings in non-core assets and focuses more closely on companies with AI links. As global markets become more cautious, the company is now under pressure to demonstrate clearer and more immediate pathways to profitability from its AI investments. As earnings arrive and central banks make decisions, as global chip demand applies pressure (and occasionally relief) to stocks, investors will be trying to decide whether the current selloff is a quick correction or the beginning of something more lasting. The next few weeks will present a critical juncture for SoftBank in determining how its AI narrative unfolds in the market.

With this, users get real-time prediction data on trending events, such as potential Fed rate cuts or other outcomes, alongside traditional search and financial info. Prediction markets data to feature in search results Google Finance will integrate prediction markets data into Google search, adding Polymarket and Kalshi probabilities so users can query event odds directly from the search box. The rollout is scheduled to begin in the coming weeks via Google Labs for early testers, with a broader release to follow. Polymarket announced the news today on X, expressing excitement at the partnership while emphasizing how the integration is “coming soon” and highlighting the mainstream exposure it brings. There is little doubt that such an integration would provide enhanced insights for users, but that would just be another data point to influence decisions. What really stands out about the integration is that Google Finance’s numerous users will suddenly start getting exposure to prediction markets, which is essentially another case of crypto in use. Google’s Rose Yao announced the deal as part of a broader announcement that revealed it is upgrading Google Finance by adding Deep Search capabilities and corporate earnings tracking, and expanding to India. The term used by Google was that it was including prediction markets’ “data”; however, in its broadcast on social media, Polymarket uses the term “odds.” Kalshi’s CEO, Tarek Mansour in a tweet called it big news while promising there will be a rollout over the next few weeks. What this means for prediction markets News of the Google agreements has triggered excitement among fans of prediction markets , as they know that such an endorsement brings the market closer to further legitimization of prediction markets, even as multiple states claim they are acting illegally in the sports betting space. For now, sports event contracts make up the bulk of trading volume on Kalshi. However, it is clear that many have woken up to the value of prediction markets and the knowledge that it goes well beyond sticks and balls. In fact, many, including Rose Yao, are looking at the predictive power of prediction markets as a major enhancement for Google Finance. “Prediction markets data from [Kalsh and Polymarket] means you can ask questions about future events to see current probabilities in the market and how they’ve changed over time,” Google product leader Rose Yao wrote on X. In a blog post in which it announced the deal, Google shared an example in which it urges the user to ask a question like ‘What will GDP growth be for 2025?’ directly from the search box to see “current probabilities in the market and how they’ve changed over time.” Some experts also believe that a deal with Google could open the floodgates for prediction markets, as it could encourage other corporate giants to partner with prediction markets. Already, giants like the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, have come on board. The Intercontinental Exchange announced a $2 billion investment in Polymarket last month, and the NHL announced licensing deals with both Polymarket and Kalshi at the same time. This is all happening as Polymarket gets ready to re-enter the US market, which it was blocked from in February 2022. The prediction platform has been teasing its re-entry to the States for several weeks now, but there have been reports that the government shutdown is delaying it.

Is the current Bitcoin correction a warning sign or a healthy market reset? As BTC experiences short-term price volatility, top analysts are sharply divided on what comes next for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This Bitcoin correction has triggered intense debate among market experts, with predictions ranging from a steep drop to $56,000 to optimistic views of a temporary consolidation phase. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Correction Debate? The ongoing Bitcoin correction has created two distinct camps among market analysts. On one side, technical analysts point to historical patterns suggesting deeper declines. Meanwhile, on-chain data specialists argue the current movement represents normal market behavior. This division highlights the complex nature of cryptocurrency markets and the different methodologies experts use to assess Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bearish Outlook: Could Bitcoin Really Hit $56,000? Mike McGlone from Bloomberg Intelligence presents a cautious perspective on this Bitcoin correction. His analysis focuses on historical chart patterns that have played out repeatedly in Bitcoin’s history. According to McGlone’s research, Bitcoin typically returns to its 48-month moving average after significant rallies. If this pattern holds true during the current Bitcoin correction, we could see prices testing the $56,000 level. The technical argument for a deeper Bitcoin correction rests on several key factors: Historical price cycle patterns Moving average convergence Previous support and resistance levels Market sentiment indicators Bullish Perspective: Is This a Healthy Bitcoin Correction? Glassnode’s on-chain analysis offers a more optimistic view of the current Bitcoin correction. Their data suggests we’re witnessing a normal market adjustment rather than panic selling. The firm’s key metric—the relative unrealized loss ratio—currently sits at a modest 3.1%, well below the 5% threshold that typically signals market distress. This Bitcoin correction shows several healthy characteristics according to Glassnode: Controlled selling pressure without mass capitulation Stable fundamentals despite price volatility Historical patterns that resemble previous healthy consolidations Strong holder behavior among long-term investors How Should Investors Navigate This Bitcoin Correction? Understanding both perspectives helps investors make informed decisions during this Bitcoin correction. The divided analyst opinions actually provide valuable context for assessing risk and opportunity. While technical analysts warn of potential downside, on-chain data suggests underlying strength remains intact. Key considerations during this Bitcoin correction include: Monitoring the 48-month moving average as potential support Watching the relative unrealized loss metric for changes Assessing your personal risk tolerance and investment horizon Considering dollar-cost averaging strategies What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Bitcoin Corrections Historical data reveals that Bitcoin corrections are normal and often necessary for sustainable growth. Previous cycles show that healthy pullbacks typically range between 20-30%, which aligns with current movements. The current Bitcoin correction falls within these historical parameters, suggesting it could be part of normal market cycles rather than the start of a bear market. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Correction with Confidence The divided analyst opinions on this Bitcoin correction actually reflect the market’s complexity and maturity. While short-term uncertainty persists, both technical and fundamental analyses provide valuable insights for informed decision-making. Remember that market corrections often create opportunities for strategic investors who understand Bitcoin’s long-term potential and historical patterns. Frequently Asked Questions How long do Bitcoin corrections typically last? Bitcoin corrections usually last between 2-8 weeks, though the duration can vary significantly based on market conditions and external factors affecting the current Bitcoin correction. What’s the difference between a correction and a bear market? A correction typically involves a 10-20% price decline and represents temporary market adjustment, while a bear market involves declines of 20% or more over extended periods with fundamental deterioration. Should I buy during a Bitcoin correction? Many investors use Bitcoin corrections as buying opportunities, but this depends on your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and analysis of whether the current Bitcoin correction represents a temporary dip or fundamental change. What indicators should I watch during a Bitcoin correction? Key indicators include trading volume, moving averages, on-chain metrics like the relative unrealized loss ratio, and market sentiment indicators to assess the health of the Bitcoin correction. How does this Bitcoin correction compare to previous ones? The current Bitcoin correction shows similarities to healthy consolidations in past cycles, with moderate selling pressure and stable fundamentals, unlike the extreme conditions seen during the 2022-2023 bear market. Can the Bitcoin correction turn into a crash? While any market movement carries risk, current on-chain data suggests this Bitcoin correction lacks the panic selling and fundamental weaknesses that typically precede major crashes.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Markets opened Friday to a risk-off tone across Asia, with crypto prices and major regional equity benchmarks slipping as investors grew more cautious about the global economic outlook. Bitcoin fell alongside broader digital assets, extending this week’s losses after data pointed to weakening demand and slowing treasury inflows from large holders. Total crypto market cap dropped about 2% in early trading, mirroring sentiment in equities. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $101,545, down 1.5% Ether : $3,320, down 2.5% XRP : $2.21, down 5.1% Total crypto market cap: $3.47 trillion, down 1.9% Regional Markets Track US Losses After Sharp Selloff in AI Shares In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.75%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.74%. The Shenzhen Component lost 0.76%, and the Shanghai Composite eased 0.22%. New Zealand’s Dow Jones NZ edged up 0.20% to 360.52, the only gainer among major indexes. These declines followed Wall Street’s overnight retreat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.84%, the S&P 500 slid 1.12% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.9%, weighed down by a sharp pullback in technology and artificial intelligence-linked stocks that had fueled recent rallies. Really feels like equities are cooked, and if equities are cooked, then our coins are about to get smacked — Flood (@ThinkingUSD) November 6, 2025 The selloff this week came as earnings season wound down and investors turned to private data to gauge economic health amid the ongoing US government shutdown. The latest figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed companies announced 153,074 job cuts in October, nearly triple last year’s total for the same month, driven mainly by the technology and warehousing sectors. Institutional Appetite for Bitcoin Eases, ETF Outflows Deepen Market Reset Thomas Perfumo, global economist at Kraken, said demand from digital asset treasuries such as MicroStrategy, which had supported crypto through the summer, has slowed noticeably. “Crypto ETFs have also experienced significant outflows, despite skewing bullish during prior months of choppy price action,” he added. “While the market was stabilizing after the Oct. 10 liquidation event, this latest ‘reset’ event certainly reduced short-term risk tolerance further. This is evident by the continued retreat in altcoins in favor of assets like Bitcoin, whose market cap dominance ticked higher yet again.” Investors Eye Fed Support as Market Copes With Data Gaps and Valuation Strain Market confidence remains shaky amid the record-long US government shutdown, which has suspended official data releases such as the non-farm payrolls report. Private indicators have filled the gap, but they paint a mixed picture of growth and labor momentum. Treasury yields held steady, while the dollar eased slightly against major peers after weak labor data reinforced bets on another Federal Reserve rate cut this year. The euro rose 0.49% to $1.1547, and the dollar index slipped 0.42% to 99.70. MSCI’s global equity gauge fell 0.59% to 992.00, extending its weekly losses as traders weighed stretched valuations and uncertainty over fiscal and monetary policy. On Wall Street, technology shares led the retreat, with the S&P 500 tech index down 2%. Analysts said the correction reflects profit-taking after months of gains tied to artificial intelligence optimism. Despite the pullback, analysts say the market tone remains orderly. Investors are watching for signs of liquidity stress in money markets, and traders expect the Fed to step in if funding pressures intensify.

The crypto world is buzzing today as SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed company, just moved a staggering $14.5 million in ETH to OKX. This massive Ethereum deposit represents one of the most significant institutional moves we’ve seen recently, and it could signal important market shifts ahead. What Does This Major Ethereum Deposit Mean? The recent Ethereum deposit from SharpLink Gaming’s wallet totaled 4,363.5 ETH, valued at approximately $14.47 million. According to blockchain analytics firm Onchain-lens, this substantial transfer occurred over just four hours. Typically, when large amounts of cryptocurrency move to exchanges, market participants interpret this as potential preparation for selling activity. This isn’t just any ordinary transaction though. The scale of this Ethereum deposit suggests strategic planning by SharpLink’s investment team. The company has been publicly positioning itself as a strategic investor in Ethereum, making this move particularly noteworthy for several reasons: The timing coincides with recent Ethereum price movements It represents a significant portion of their crypto holdings The choice of OKX as the destination exchange matters Market sentiment often reacts to such large transfers Why Are Institutional Ethereum Deposits So Important? Institutional players like SharpLink Gaming bring a new dimension to crypto markets. Their Ethereum deposit activities can influence price action and market psychology in ways retail traders cannot. When a publicly-traded company moves this much Ethereum to an exchange, it typically indicates one of several strategic decisions: Portfolio rebalancing – Adjusting their crypto exposure Profit-taking – Capitalizing on price appreciation Liquidity needs – Converting crypto to fiat for operations Strategic repositioning – Preparing for new investment opportunities The market watches these large Ethereum deposit movements closely because they often precede significant price movements. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t always equal causation. How Should Crypto Investors Interpret This Move? For everyday crypto enthusiasts, understanding the implications of this Ethereum deposit requires looking beyond the headlines. While transfers to exchanges often signal selling intent, there are alternative explanations worth considering. SharpLink might be preparing for: Staking opportunities on OKX’s platform Participation in upcoming token sales Collateral for lending activities Institutional trading strategies The key takeaway is that institutional Ethereum deposit activity provides valuable market intelligence. By monitoring these movements, retail investors can better understand market sentiment and potential price pressure points. What’s Next for Ethereum After This Major Deposit? The aftermath of significant institutional moves like this Ethereum deposit often creates ripple effects across the market. Other institutional players may follow suit, or conversely, see this as a buying opportunity. The Ethereum deposit to OKX could trigger several outcomes: Short-term price volatility as markets digest the news Increased scrutiny of other institutional crypto holdings Regulatory attention to large-scale crypto transfers Potential copycat behavior from other corporations Moreover, this Ethereum deposit highlights the growing maturity of crypto markets. When publicly-traded companies actively manage digital asset portfolios, it signals broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. Key Takeaways for Crypto Market Participants This substantial Ethereum deposit teaches us valuable lessons about today’s crypto landscape. Institutional activity is becoming increasingly transparent through blockchain analytics, providing everyone with unprecedented market insight. The SharpLink Gaming Ethereum deposit demonstrates how corporate crypto strategies are evolving beyond simple buy-and-hold approaches. Most importantly, remember that large transfers don’t automatically mean bearish sentiment. Each Ethereum deposit tells a story about institutional strategy, market timing, and risk management approaches that retail investors can learn from. Frequently Asked Questions Why would SharpLink deposit Ethereum to an exchange? Companies typically move crypto to exchanges for selling, staking, or participating in platform-specific opportunities. The exact reason behind this Ethereum deposit remains speculative until official statements emerge. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large deposits can create selling pressure if converted to fiat, but the impact depends on market conditions and whether other buyers absorb the potential sell volume. Is OKX a common choice for institutional deposits? Yes, OKX has become increasingly popular among institutional traders due to its advanced trading features and global regulatory compliance. Should retail investors worry about institutional moves? While worth monitoring, retail investors should maintain their investment strategies rather than reacting to single transactions. How can I track similar large transfers? Blockchain analytics platforms like Onchain-lens, Etherscan, and various crypto intelligence services monitor large wallet movements. What’s the difference between deposit and withdrawal signals? Deposits to exchanges often suggest selling intent, while withdrawals to private wallets typically indicate long-term holding strategies.

The token, which should maintain a steady $1.00 value, has plummeted to $0.7484 according to recent data from CoinMarketCap. This represents a staggering 25% decline in just 24 hours, leaving investors questioning the stability of algorithmic stablecoins. What Caused the USDX Stablecoin De-Peg? The alarming USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation was first reported by blockchain security firm PeckShield. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. When a USDX stablecoin de-pegs occurs, it signals serious underlying issues within the protocol’s mechanism or market confidence. Several factors can trigger such events: Liquidity crises in trading pools Algorithmic failures in rebase mechanisms Mass panic selling from investors Smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits How Does This USDX Stablecoin De-Pegs Affect Investors? The current USDX stablecoin de-pegs event has immediate consequences for holders. Investors who purchased the token expecting stable value now face significant losses. This situation highlights the inherent risks in algorithmic stablecoins compared to their fully-backed counterparts. When examining any USDX stablecoin de-pegs scenario, consider these critical aspects: Immediate liquidity : Can you exit your position? Recovery potential : Historical patterns of similar events Protocol response : Team actions to restore peg Market sentiment : Community and institutional reactions Is This the End for StablesLab’s USDX? While the current USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation appears dire, history shows that some stablecoins have recovered from similar events. However, each case depends on the specific circumstances and the development team’s response. The severity of this particular USDX stablecoin de-pegs event at 25% below peg suggests significant challenges ahead. The team at StablesLab now faces the critical task of restoring confidence. Their actions in the coming days will determine whether this USDX stablecoin de-pegs becomes a temporary setback or a permanent failure. Lessons from the USDX Stablecoin De-Pegs Incident This USDX stablecoin de-pegs event serves as a stark reminder about cryptocurrency risks. Even assets marketed as “stable” can experience extreme volatility. The incident reinforces why diversification and understanding underlying mechanisms matter more than ever. Key takeaways from this USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation: Always research the backing mechanism of any stablecoin Diversify across different stablecoin types Monitor liquidity and trading volume metrics Stay informed about protocol updates and team communications Navigating Future Stablecoin Investments The USDX stablecoin de-pegs incident doesn’t mean all stablecoins are unsafe. However, it does emphasize the importance of due diligence. When the USDX stablecoin de-pegs occurred, many investors learned hard lessons about algorithmic stability mechanisms. Moving forward, the crypto community will likely scrutinize similar projects more carefully. This USDX stablecoin de-pegs event may ultimately lead to better industry standards and more robust stablecoin designs. Conclusion: The Aftermath of De-Pegging The dramatic USDX stablecoin de-pegs event serves as a crucial learning moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. While stablecoins offer tremendous utility, their complex mechanisms require thorough understanding before investment. The market will watch closely to see how StablesLab responds and whether the USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation can be resolved. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when a stablecoin de-pegs? When a stablecoin de-pegs, it means the token’s value has moved significantly away from its intended peg, typically $1.00 for dollar-pegged stablecoins. How common are stablecoin de-pegging events? While not everyday occurrences, several notable stablecoins have experienced de-pegging throughout crypto history, particularly among algorithmic varieties. Can USDX recover from this de-pegging? Recovery depends on multiple factors including team response, market confidence, and underlying protocol mechanics. Some stablecoins have recovered while others have not. Should I buy USDX while it’s de-pegged? Buying de-pegged stablecoins carries significant risk and should only be considered by experienced investors who understand the potential for total loss. How can I protect myself from stablecoin de-pegging? Diversification across different stablecoin types, staying informed about protocol health, and maintaining reasonable position sizes can help manage risk. What’s the difference between algorithmic and collateralized stablecoins? Algorithmic stablecoins use complex code mechanisms to maintain peg, while collateralized stablecoins hold reserves of other assets to back their value. Found this analysis helpful?

BTC dipped below $103,500 and $102,400 to enter a bearish zone. The decline was such that the price even spiked below the $101,200 support. A low was formed at $100,266 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $104,498 swing high to the $100,266 low.

With traders hunting for the top altcoins to buy now, La Culex’s unique mechanics and fast-moving stages are giving early believers a reason to swarm in before the next price jump. Let’s see, as the market readies for another speculative surge, meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, and La Culex ($CULEX) are redefining what it means to catch momentum early and possibly turn a small stake into a 100x story for 2025. 1. La Culex ($CULEX): The Meme Mosquito With a 100x Sting La Culex Presale has quickly risen to become one of the best meme coins to buy now as it enters Stage 4, “Hive Signal.”La Culex has officially entered its 4th stage, Hive Signal, marking a crucial point in its viral presale journey. The token is currently priced at $0.00002458, with over $13,000 raised and a growing community of more than 100 holders. This steady climb reflects the growing investor confidence in the project’s long-term potential and its ability to attract early believers who recognize the meme coin’s unique market positioning. How to Buy La Culex: A Step-by-Step Guide for the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now Buying La Culex is simple and accessible, even for new investors exploring the best meme coins to buy now. Step one is to connect your wallet, La Culex operates on Ethereum, ensuring full compatibility with MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Step two involves funding your wallet with ETH or USDT, ensuring enough ETH for gas fees. Once you’re ready, head to the official Culex Presale page and connect your wallet. Enter the desired amount, hit “Buy Now,” and confirm the transaction. After the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your tokens directly to your wallet, hold them for long-term growth, or stake them for passive returns. With over $11,000 raised already and the next price hike around the corner, this is the best meme coin to buy now before the buzz becomes a roar. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Giant That Still Rules the Night Sky While not a presale, Bitcoin remains vital when looking at top altcoins to buy now because all presale odds are calculated relative to where the king sits. BTC dominates market cap and sets general trend direction. The global crypto market cap stands around $3.9 trillion and Bitcoin dominance is about 57.8%. Key indicators for Bitcoin include network hash rate, Bitcoin dominance, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and inflation. If the U.S. Federal Reserve signals rate cuts, risk assets like crypto can surge, and Bitcoin often leads. 3. Ethereum (ETH): The Platform That Powers the Swarm Ethereum powers most presales, including meme coins like La Culex. Its staking model, upcoming upgrades, and active developer ecosystem make ETH a core consideration. Staking yields range from 4-7% annually depending on network activity, giving investors insight into potential rewards and liquidity flow. Key indicators include total staked ETH, number of active validators, gas fees, and number of ERC-20 tokens being launched. Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain for deploying smart contracts, which makes it indispensable for presale research and development. 4. Solana (SOL): The High-Speed Jet in the Swarm Solana offers blazing speed and low fees, making it ideal for presale projects and meme coins. Analysts track Solana’s transactions per second, network uptime, token listings, and developer activity to gauge growth potential. Its fast ecosystem allows projects to scale quickly and attract early-stage investors. Social chatter and community engagement also indicate price potential and market momentum. Solana’s combination of speed, cost-efficiency, and active ecosystem makes it a strong candidate for presale launches and altcoin trading strategies. 5. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Drama with a Stage Light Ripple demonstrates how regulation shapes crypto relevance. XRP remains strong due to its use-case in payments and liquidity despite past legal challenges. Investors monitor SEC rulings, partnerships in payments, on-chain escrow releases, and institutional adoption to understand XRP’s stability. XRP shows that tokens can maintain relevance even with regulatory hurdles. Presale strategies often evaluate tokens that have regulatory clarity to mitigate risks associated with legal uncertainty and market volatility. 6. Binance Coin (BNB): The Exchange Powerhouse Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, buzzing through trading, staking, and ecosystem utility. As a major meme coin presale alternative for serious investors, BNB powers transactions, launchpads, and DeFi projects, making it a cornerstone of the crypto market. According to current updates, BNB is priced around $325, with a circulating supply of over 167 million tokens. Early adopters benefit from staking rewards, discounted trading fees, and token burn programs that reduce supply over time. 7. TRON (TRX): The High-Speed DApp Platform TRON operates as a fast blockchain for decentralized applications, staking, and tokenized entertainment projects. Recognized among meme coin presale enthusiasts for its active ecosystem, TRX enables smart contract deployment, NFT minting, and DApp growth with minimal fees. TRON currently trades at approximately $0.09, with a circulating supply of 102 billion tokens. Investors track staking yields, network throughput, and ecosystem adoption to measure potential upside. 8. Cardano (ADA): The Smart Contract Strategist Cardano is known for its research-driven approach to smart contracts, staking, and sustainable blockchain growth. As a meme coin presale-adjacent pick, ADA combines academic rigor with community-driven adoption. Current price stands around $1.15, with over 34 billion tokens circulating. Investors monitor staking rewards, governance proposals, and ecosystem expansions to assess project potential and long-term viability. 9. Bitcoin Cash: The Exchange Utility King BCH plays a central role in the top crypto ecosystem through its exchange utility and smart-chain applications as one of the top altcoins to buy now . It offers trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and is regularly burned to reduce supply, supporting scarcity and value retention. Its strong integration with the Binance Smart Chain makes it a core token for developers and traders alike. Regulatory scrutiny is an ongoing factor, but adoption remains high. Final Thoughts Choosing the top altcoins to buy now isn’t just about picking the next shiny token; it’s about reading the swarm, understanding tokenomics, evaluating utility, tracking community, and sizing risk. La Culex’s mosquito approach reminds investors: small, fast, and capable of leaving a mark. Whether buzzing into La Culex, riding the giants like BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, or flying with meme jets like Cardano, TRON, and Binance (BNB), each coin has its place in the swarm.

Before thousands of attendees, he said digital assets could “ease pressure on the dollar” and declared that America is ready to lead the world as both the “bitcoin superpower” and the “crypto capital.” Trump said his administration’s policies had replaced what he described as years of hostility toward the crypto industry with new support for innovation and growth. Dollar And Bitcoin At Odds Market data shows a long-running tension between the US dollar and Bitcoin . Analysts say their price movements often go in opposite directions. During the Federal Reserve’s 2022 rate hikes, the Dollar Index rose to 114 while Bitcoin fell from $47,000 to below $17,000. But in 2020 and 2021, when the dollar weakened, Bitcoin soared to around $64,000. https://t.co/1yURL8Obgx — Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) November 5, 2025 Reports also note that Bitcoin tends to act like a high-risk asset rather than a hedge, rising when money is cheap and dropping when liquidity tightens. Academic studies using wavelet analysis confirm the two assets often move out of sync, though the pattern isn’t perfectly stable. Policy Moves And Reserve Plans Trump’s position lines up with ongoing policy discussions in Washington. Senator Cynthia Lummis has backed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to help offset the nation’s $35 trillion debt. The idea would start with about 130,000 BTC the government already holds through criminal forfeitures, a supply valued near $34 billion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is reportedly assessing how such a reserve might operate beyond traditional gold valuation methods. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has promoted stablecoins, saying a USD1 token from World Liberty Financial could attract “trillions” into US markets. Lawmakers including Maxine Waters and Elizabeth Warren have raised conflict-of-interest concerns, noting that the GENIUS Act signed in July has no restrictions on presidential family involvement in digital asset ventures. Signs Of Rebound The crypto market is finally showing signs of rejuvenation, with Bitcoin reclaiming the $103,000 mark. Most other crypto assets are also trading in the green zone today. Trump Coin is among those leading the pack, recording massive gains with a double-digit rally in the daily and 14-day charts. TRUMP’s price has rallied 12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, 35% in the 14-day charts, and 1.9% over the previous month. However, the coin is still down 4% over the last week. TRUMP is currently the 4th-best performing crypto in the daily charts, followed by Internet Computer (ICP), Quant (QNT), and Zcash (ZEC). Trump has been highly vocal in support of the crypto industry, even allowing crypto donations for his 2024 Presidential campaign. He issued, among his first executive orders upon assuming office, the establishment of a strategic digital asset reserve for the US.

Among the highlights was a statement from Maxwell Stein, a member of BlackRock’s digital assets team, that sent the audience into applause and resonated with enthusiasts on social media. He revealed that the global financial market is now ready for large-scale blockchain adoption, and the infrastructure being built by companies like Ripple could soon facilitate the movement of trillions of dollars on-chain. BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein Says The Crypto Market Is Ready During his session, Stein highlighted the transformation underway in global finance, noting that traditional securities are still held in legacy systems but that this separation between traditional and tokenized assets is gradually disappearing. Related Reading: Ripple Just Launched A Game-Changing Service In The US Leveraging XRP And RLUSD He explained that in the short term, proving utility is the most important thing to gaining broader adoption and that there are currently two types of users driving this shift: those already in the crypto space and a second wave of early institutional adopters. Stein emphasized the need for continued market momentum to demonstrate the practical usefulness of blockchain solutions and attract larger financial players. “We need that market momentum in order to prove the utility, to actually get the larger players to eventually come in,” he said. As noted by an XRP advocate with the name Diana on the social media platform X, Stein credited Ripple and other early builders for proving that blockchain works. Not as a concept, but as real financial infrastructure. The idea that trillions in capital could eventually move through blockchain rails represents a fundamental change in how the world’s financial systems might operate. The idea sounded like a myth back when the crypto industry was first created. What once seemed like a distant fantasy in crypto’s early days has begun to take shape as reality, and big names like traditional finance are now moving into the crypto industry every day. Nasdaq’s CEO Says Regulation Is Important Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also shared her perspective at the event, focusing on the need for regulatory clarity to encourage broader institutional participation in the digital asset space. She explained that major institutions want to engage but require clearly defined rules that prioritize investor protection and establish stable frameworks. Related Reading: Pundit Elaborates On Ripple/SWIFT Theory That Will Send The XRP Price To $1,000 According to her, once such clarity is achieved, these institutions can confidently enter the market knowing that they are operating under secure and transparent guidelines. Friedman added that significant progress is already happening within traditional finance, as many banks are experimenting with tokenized bonds, fixed income instruments, and the creation of stablecoins. This growing involvement is evidence that institutions are not waiting for innovation to reach them. They are actively finding ways to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while awaiting the full regulatory go-ahead. “But I think to get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” Friedman said.

Despite recent setbacks in its price performance, sentiment among some industry observers remains optimistic. Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders, offered a firm stance in a post on X, writing, “If you are buying this XRP dip you’re a winner. Plain and simple.” His comment came as XRP traded at $2.22, dipping 9.19% over the past week. If you are buying this $XRP dip you’re a winner. Plain and simple. — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 6, 2025 Recent Performance and Market Context XRP’s decline follows a short-lived rally that saw the asset reach an intraday high above $2.5 earlier in the week. Market data indicates a mix of investor reactions as traders assess whether the recent dip presents an opportunity or a warning sign. The broader digital asset sector has also shown signs of slowing momentum, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies facing similar pullbacks. Despite the current weakness, Rietveld is convinced that the asset holds immense potential. It has posted significant gains over the past several months, reaching a peak of $3.65 in July , and its growth has been largely supported by developments surrounding Ripple. While short-term corrections are common, sustained corporate activity and adoption progress may support XRP’s resilience in the coming months. Ripple’s Expanding Reach Ripple’s recent acquisitions have played a central role in shaping sentiment around XRP. The company has been actively broadening its business scope, securing new assets to enhance its institutional infrastructure. Its purchase of GTreasury , a corporate treasury management platform, and its completed acquisition of Hidden Road, now known as Ripple Prime , highlight the company’s ambition to expand its influence across global payment and finance networks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple has invested billions in acquisitions since the start of 2025, positioning itself as a leading provider of enterprise blockchain and payment solutions. These strategic purchases are designed to integrate Ripple’s technology into mainstream financial systems, bridging digital and traditional finance. Such moves suggest that Ripple is intent on transforming from a blockchain innovator into a global financial infrastructure firm, with XRP playing a central role in its broader ecosystem . Outlook for XRP Rietveld’s optimism reflects a viewpoint shared by many long-term XRP supporters who see temporary price drops as opportunities. While short-term volatility remains a concern, confidence in Ripple’s operational direction continues to influence investor behavior.

This massive wave of crypto liquidations primarily hammered traders betting on price increases, revealing the extreme volatility that continues to define digital asset markets. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close traders’ positions because they can no longer meet margin requirements. Think of it as a safety mechanism that triggers when your collateral drops below a certain threshold. However, when markets move rapidly, these crypto liquidations can create cascading effects that amplify price movements. Breaking Down the $376M Liquidation Carnage The recent crypto liquidations tell a clear story: long traders suffered the most significant losses. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC) : $230 million liquidated, with longs accounting for 81.09% Ethereum (ETH) : $130 million liquidated, with longs making up 63.29% Solana (SOL) : $16.76 million liquidated, with longs comprising 83.76% Why Do Long Positions Dominate Crypto Liquidations? Long positions typically dominate crypto liquidations during sharp market downturns for several reasons. First, many traders use excessive leverage when betting on price increases. Second, sudden price drops trigger automatic liquidation protocols. Moreover, the fear of missing out often drives traders to overextend during rallies, making them vulnerable when trends reverse. How Can Traders Avoid Getting Liquidated? Surviving crypto liquidations requires disciplined risk management. Consider these strategies: Use lower leverage ratios to withstand market volatility Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Maintain adequate margin buffer above requirements Diversify across different positions and timeframes The Psychological Impact of Massive Crypto Liquidations Large-scale crypto liquidations create significant psychological pressure on market participants. Fear spreads quickly as traders watch positions evaporate. This emotional response often leads to panic selling, which further fuels the liquidation cycle. Understanding this dynamic helps traders maintain perspective during turbulent periods. What’s Next After This Liquidation Event? Historically, major crypto liquidations often precede market stabilization or reversal points. When weak hands get shaken out, stronger buyers typically emerge. However, traders should monitor market sentiment and technical indicators closely before assuming the worst is over. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Liquidation Landscape The recent $376 million crypto liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of market risks. While long traders bore the brunt this time, all market participants must prioritize risk management. Remember that surviving in cryptocurrency markets requires both strategic planning and emotional discipline during volatile periods. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations trigger when a trader’s position loses enough value that their collateral no longer covers potential losses, forcing automatic closure by the exchange. Why are long positions more vulnerable to liquidation? Long positions become more vulnerable because traders often use higher leverage when betting on price increases, making them susceptible to sudden market downturns. Can I prevent my positions from being liquidated? Yes, you can prevent liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin, setting stop-loss orders, and monitoring positions regularly. Do large liquidations indicate market bottom? While massive liquidations sometimes signal capitulation, they don’t guarantee a market bottom. Always combine liquidation data with other technical and fundamental analysis. How often do major liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events typically happen during periods of extreme volatility, which can occur several times yearly in cryptocurrency markets. What’s the difference between liquidation and stop-loss? A stop-loss is a voluntary order to limit losses, while liquidation is forced position closure by the exchange when margin requirements aren’t met. Found this analysis of crypto liquidations helpful?

Technically, the bears are reigning in both the one and six-month timeframes. The chart suggests buying now is catching a falling knife. IBIT's current level of 58 is a pivot point, with a recent bounce off 57 providing a temporary floor for a bounce, but is potentially a bull trap. A break below 57 could go as low as 55 before hitting resistance, and bulls will need a break above 63 in order to resume the rally definitively. It's rare that I see a chart that makes me want to write about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and by extension its most-liquid ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), but then I saw this chart, showing Bitcoin's recent divergence from both stocks and gold. Since July, Bitcoin (via IBIT, purple) has actually fallen 2%, after rallying to a high of over 15%, while stocks (via SPY , green) grind up 10%, and gold goes on its own roller coaster, up over 25% before ending up still 19% ahead. There was a decoupling that took place. Data by YCharts Nobody said (or should've said) that the crypto ride would be easy, I suppose, but I began to wonder what how far IBIT could fall given that other risk assets like stocks were still doing alright, and gold has been acting much like a risk-on asset this year, moving alongside liquidity. The one-month chart is brutal, down over 15%. Data by YCharts For dip-buyers, what a gift. They get to keep buying the dip, and the next dip too! In all seriousness, long-term believers in Bitcoin may rejoice that we're back to $100K, or around $58 in IBIT. But where do we go from here? IBIT Hourly Chart Technical Analysis Here's the one-month chart with one-hour candles. The same chart as the one above, but just IBIT and my preferred indicators; the legend is at the top. Barchart I'll get straight to it, it looks pretty bleak. The downtrend is clear, and the EMAs are bare stacked. The 20/50/100/200 (blue, yellow, purple, maroon) are all sitting on top of the other, following a death cross on Oct. 16th. A death cross is where the shorter moving average falls below the longer moving average, e.g., 50 EMA (yellow) crossing under 200 EMA (maroon). See where the yellow crosses down under the maroon line a few weeks ago. I tend to ignore the 20 EMA (blue) for reversal crosses, as it can be a little noisy and its crossovers, like Oct. 28th, can be short-lived bull traps. 57 was a clear bottom that triggered a bounce and an immediate gap up. While this may represent a psychological end after this bound structural support, it should note that its subsequent rally petered out when it was capped off by the 20 EMA (blue). Momentum is turning positive, though still neutral, and without a clear break to the upside that would take us above 60, momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD are signalling a bear bounce. The last few sessions do not look like a real rally or sustained move, and look still dominated by the technical downtrend. Bull Case Without a break above 63, there is no continued rally. And so, IBIT traders are essentially hoping for bullish volume to kick in to break above the 50 EMA (yellow). This could create a larger reversal pattern, and a break above the 200 EMA at 63 is necessary to regain upward momentum. That would likely trigger a Golden Cross, the opposite of the Death Cross, the 50 EMA crossing over the 200 EMA. That would be a clear, but lagging, buy signal to get into the trade. The chart offers little other hope for bulls other than a reversal from positive buying pressure, unfortunately. There is hope that 55 could offer structural support below 57, but that would require us to retest 57 again to find out if it is real or if the bounce is a bull trap. Bear Case This is a classic bearish continuation, and bears should consider that right now the trend is their friend. Selling the rip above 60 could be fruitful, as the current rally seems to have few legs, and anymore it does grow are likely to be crushed by the continued cell pressure. Watch for any sort of bullish breakout with the EMAs, but otherwise, this thing looks sick. Ultimately, the chart currently favors a sell until 63 is obtained and sustained. As it is likely to fall again, it will retest 57. A break below that would be a sell down to 55. IBIT Daily Chart Technical Analysis However, we're talking really short-term here, and this advice on the 1-month chart is really just for traders. Let's take a look at the 6-month chart with daily candles: Barchart The last daily candle marked a low on the chart, and both ended with their bodies below the 200 EMA (maroon), which is an ominous signal. The momentum indicators are turning over, with the 20 EMA (blue) falling down below the 50 EMA (yellow) and 100 (purple), now heading toward the 200 EMA. In this timeframe, we have bearish momentum, although we may be rolling over in the MACD into a bullish cycle, though again, this could be the bull trap in the making. Finding lower lows over the last month has really broken the cycle that IBIT was in before, and it's unclear from the chart where a real bottom is yet. We may be hitting a bounce, especially since the current levels in IBIT correspond to the $100K psychological barrier from Bitcoin itself, but buying now for a short-to-medium term bounce is trying to catch the falling knife. It could work out, but you're buying into heavy selling pressure volume-wise, and little bullish momentum, almost none. The bounce we saw off 57 was a low-volume move so far, and so until a greater rally materializes, this may be just a stalling move before the next leg down. Conclusion Ultimately, IBIT bulls have little to look forward to in the chart, with the bleakest picture I've seen in a hot minute for Bitcoin at large. However, it's times like these where the technicals say run away that Bitcoin and IBIT by extension can turn things around. There is a hint of a turning over in technical momentum, and if IBIT can climb over the next few weeks to hit 63 and above, it could run out as far as 68-70 before hitting the next big resistance. However, the bears have been winning this past month, dragging IBIT down 15% while gold and stocks both stay afloat, and it shows little sign of stopping now. 57 proved to be a solid resistance point, but it marked a lower low, and a new six-month low for IBIT. Breaking below this point could easily give way to 55 before another resistance is hit. Investors should consider IBIT very carefully, as it is positioned as a falling knife right now. Bulls who are right may be rewarded with this selloff being seen as a bounce in the future, but they are fighting the trend, and must be wary of doing so. I am staying away from adding any more exposure at the moment, although I am usually an observer, rather than a participant, in most crypto matters these days.

The BTC price reached an impressive $102,012.88 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most significant price points in Bitcoin’s history. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the growing strength and resilience of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This Massive BTC Price Surge? The recent BTC price explosion didn’t happen in isolation. Several key factors have contributed to this historic rally. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major financial players recognize Bitcoin’s value proposition. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions have created a perfect storm for digital asset growth. The current BTC price movement reflects growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors who see Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value. Market analysts point to several catalysts behind this BTC price milestone: Increased institutional investment flowing into Bitcoin ETFs Growing global adoption as a hedge against inflation Positive regulatory developments in key markets Technical breakout from previous resistance levels How Significant Is This BTC Price Achievement? Breaking the $102,000 mark represents more than just a number for the BTC price. This milestone signals a fundamental shift in how markets perceive digital assets. The sustained upward movement in BTC price indicates strong underlying demand and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Historically, such breakthroughs have often preceded extended bullish periods for Bitcoin. The current BTC price level also validates the investment thesis of many early adopters. However, it’s crucial to understand that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. While the current BTC price represents a historic high, investors should always approach with caution and proper risk management strategies. What Does This Mean for Future BTC Price Movements? Looking ahead, the BTC price trajectory appears promising but requires careful monitoring. Technical analysts suggest that maintaining above $100,000 could establish a new support level for future growth. The sustained momentum in BTC price indicates that we might be entering a new phase of market maturity. Key considerations for the future BTC price include: Potential resistance levels around $105,000-$110,000 Market reaction to upcoming regulatory decisions Institutional inflow patterns and their impact on BTC price stability Global economic factors influencing cryptocurrency demand Actionable Insights for Navigating This BTC Price Environment For investors watching the BTC price movement, several strategies can help navigate this volatile yet rewarding market. First, dollar-cost averaging remains a sensible approach regardless of the current BTC price. Second, maintaining a long-term perspective helps avoid emotional decisions during price fluctuations. The current BTC price level might tempt some to take excessive risks, but disciplined investing typically yields better results over time. Remember that while the BTC price has reached impressive heights, cryptocurrency investing carries inherent risks. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting financial professionals before making investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to reach $102,000? The BTC price surge to $102,000 resulted from combined factors including institutional adoption, positive market sentiment, technical breakouts, and growing global acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? While the BTC price has reached new highs, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, investors should always assess their risk tolerance and investment goals before entering any market. How volatile is Bitcoin at this price level? The BTC price remains volatile even at higher levels, though increased institutional participation has somewhat stabilized price movements compared to earlier years. What’s the next major resistance for Bitcoin? Technical analysts suggest the next significant BTC price resistance levels appear around $105,000 to $110,000, though market conditions can change rapidly. Should I consider taking profits at this BTC price? Profit-taking decisions depend on individual investment strategies and financial goals. Some investors take partial profits at major milestones while maintaining core positions. How does this BTC price compare to previous cycles? The current BTC price represents new territory beyond previous cycle highs, suggesting potential structural changes in market dynamics and adoption patterns.

This strategic acquisition brings their total holdings to an impressive 4,004 BTC, signaling strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Why This Bitcoin Accumulation Matters for the Crypto Market American Bitcoin’s latest purchase represents more than just numbers on a balance sheet. This substantial Bitcoin accumulation demonstrates how established companies are positioning themselves in the digital asset space. The timing and scale of this acquisition suggest careful strategic planning rather than impulsive market speculation. Moreover, the company’s growing Bitcoin reserves highlight several key trends: Institutional adoption continues to gain momentum Long-term holding strategies are becoming more common Bitcoin accumulation is seen as a viable treasury reserve asset What Drives American Bitcoin’s Expansion Strategy?

This perspective contrasts with short-term trading mentalities and emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a strategic reserve asset rather than just a speculative instrument. What Challenges Come with Large-Scale Bitcoin Accumulation? While the benefits of Bitcoin accumulation are clear, companies face several practical challenges. Security concerns, regulatory compliance, and price volatility all require sophisticated management approaches. American Bitcoin’s mining background gives them unique advantages in navigating these complexities. Key considerations for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation include: Secure storage solutions for digital assets Regulatory compliance across jurisdictions Price volatility management strategies Integration with traditional financial reporting The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Strategies American Bitcoin’s latest move represents a growing trend among forward-thinking companies.

Her comments come amid rising tensions over monetary policy, inflation, and the role of digital assets in reshaping finance. How Bitcoin Could Reshape Treasury Markets Senator Cynthia Lummis has once again made headlines with her support for Bitcoin, stating in a recent Bloomberg interview that BTC is the only solution to America’s mounting national debt. According to a crypto news source, CryptosRus, posted on X, that Lummis expressed her pro-Bitcoin stance, mentioning that BTC is an asset that will continue to grow over time and is the key to offsetting the burgeoning national debt. Related Reading: Bitcoin In The Crosshairs: US Treasury Secretary Reveals What Senate Democrats Could Learn From BTC Lummis highlighted the concept of a strategic BTC reserve, asserting that it represents the sole viable strategy to offset the national debt. However, CryptosRus noted that her consistent advocacy makes her one of Washington’s most ardent supporters of BTC, pushing for its integration to play the core role of US fiscal strategy. Several companies are actively preparing for this move. An emerging euro-denominated Bitcoin treasury backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Treasury_BTC, has announced the appointment of Tycho Onnasch as its new head of BTC strategy. Onnasch is widely recognized within the BTC community for his foundational work on BTC scaling solutions, insightful market analysis, and deep conviction in BTC. Onnasch’s impressive background includes founding Zest Protocol, a leading BTC yield and landing platform, which is supported by BTC heavyweights Tim Draper and Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao. Academically, Tycho holds a degree from Oxford University, with a specialization in economic history. His achievements were further acknowledged with his inclusion in Forbes’ prestigious 30 under 30 Europe list. Onnasch’s role will be instrumental in driving the company’s BTC strategy and influencing its approach to market interpretation. A Healthier Foundation For Bitcoin Next Leg Higher CryptosRus has also reported that BTC has recently experienced its most significant open interest meltdown of its current cycle since the liquidation event that occurred on October 10. The data reveals substantial drops across major platforms, with Binance’s open interest decreasing by $4 billion, Bybit by over $3 billion, and Gate by more than $2 billion. Due to this liquidation event, traders have not rushed back in with leverage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Lacks Conviction, Market Signals Another Pullback Risk Typically, leverage rebuilds quickly after a wipeout, but the slow recovery from this current scenario suggests that the market confidence is shaken. This sentiment explains the current slow and choppy price action, as the market operates with reduced leverage and fewer aggressive positions. CryptosRus pointed out that when leverage undergoes such a significant reset, the market often leads to an increase in stability. It lowers the risk of another sudden cascade of liquidations and establishes a healthier foundation for the next price movements. The expert concluded that this is a BTC reset, not a breakdown.

As a result, a recent survey conducted by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and PwC revealed that the percentage of traditional hedge funds holding cryptocurrencies has climbed to 55%, up from 47% in 2024. Heavy Crypto Exposure Among Hedge Funds Despite the ongoing volatility in crypto markets, 47% of institutional investors surveyed expressed that the current regulatory environment, shaped by Trump’s appointments of crypto-friendly agency heads and the implementation of the GENIUS Act has encouraged them to increase their allocations to digital assets. James Delaney, managing director of asset management regulation at AIMA, commented on the findings, stating: For most of these funds, regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier. This year, those barriers are starting to be removed. This year’s report may mark a turning point in overcoming these challenges. However, regulatory clarity isn’t the sole factor driving institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on substantial market gains is also a compelling motivator. The survey highlighted that alongside traditional hedge funds, specialized fund managers with at least 50% of their assets in crypto have emerged, with several new funds launched this year. Bitcoin Dominates, Solana’s Popularity Surges Among the crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most commonly held asset, closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Notably, Solana saw a surge in popularity this year, with 73% of the funds now holding it, a marked increase from 45% in 2024. On average, hedge funds have allocated about 7% of their assets to crypto, up from 6% the previous year, although over half of the respondents commit less than 2%. Encouragingly, 71% of those surveyed indicated plans to increase their crypto exposure within the next twelve months. Major firms are also showing interest in this space. Brevan Howard Asset Management has reportedly appointed a former executive from Peter Thiel’s family office to lead a crypto-focused investment division. Additionally, asset managers like Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Elliott Investment Management have disclosed holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETFs . According to the AIMA survey, the proportion of respondents using ETFs has risen to 33%, compared to 25% the previous year. The survey indicated that the most popular access method to the digital asset market among managers is through derivatives, with 67% of respondents utilizing them, an increase from 58% in 2024. Spot trading has also grown, rising to 40% from 25%. Moreover, some asset managers are exploring the tokenization of their funds, similar to initiatives by firms like BlackRock. Over half of the survey participants expressed interest in this approach. Lastly, the survey found that 43% of traditional hedge funds investing in crypto plan to enhance or initiate their engagement with DeFi over the next three years, with nearly a third believing that DeFi could disrupt their business models.

After about a year and seven months since his arrest, Samourai Wallet dev, Keonne Rodriguez, has been sentenced to five years in prison. The case against Samourai Wallet Keonne Rodriguez and his co-founder William Lonergan Hill launched Samourai Wallet in 2015 as a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet. The wallet was advertised on its website and via social media as a “premium privacy service” and it made use of marketing language such as “No email address, no ID check, and no hassle”, and clearly targeted “Dark/Grey Market participants” who were repeatedly reminded that their Bitcoin transfers would be hard to trace on the platform. In April 2024, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill were arrested and later indicted by the U.S. government. Samourai never registered as a money transmitting business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and did not implement effective anti-money-laundering (AML) or “know your customer” (KYC) protocols. P rosecut ors claim that Samourai processed about $237 million in illicit funds between 2015 and April 2024. Rodriguez and Hill pleaded guilty on July 30, 2025, to a charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Rogriguez’s verdict is bad news for privacy advocates On November 6, 2025, Keonne Rodriguez was sentenced to 60 months (5 years) in federal prison. That sentence is the statutory maximum for the charge requested by the prosecution, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier during the week. Rodriguez is also required to pay a fine and will be supervised after his release. Judge Denise L. Cote was not swayed by Rogriguez’s defense of privacy tools, citing its failure to address the real-world consequences of facilitating criminal transactions. The presiding judge also found his letters of remorse failing to show sufficient acknowledgement for the human suffering his actions caused. The verdict is bad news for the other party in this case as well as Tornado Cash developers facing similar charges for running a privacy tool for transmitting funds. Meanwhile, it appears the U.S. government’s promise to allow digital asset innovation while cracking down on illegality does not extend to crypto-mixers and privacy-enhancing tools when it’s used to aid criminal proceeds. This has caused some tension as open-source privacy tools have been praised by advocates as protections for financial freedom and human rights.

BITX is best suited for experienced traders seeking short-term tactical moves, not for long-term investors, due to high fees and inherent risks. Bitcoin's technical charts suggest a possible short-term relief rally provided BTC reclaims key support levels that are well within reach. A BITX swing trade is only considered if Bitcoin closes above $103k on the weekly chart; caution and active management are essential. I last covered the Volatility Shares' 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) for Seeking Alpha in June of this year. At that time, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was in a very similar price range to which it currently finds itself. While the coin is off those prices by about 4%, BITX has performed slightly worse than its 200% leveraged goal based on total return: Data by YCharts At a total return of -13.6%, BITX has returned about 3x the performance of BTC to the downside. To be fair, there have been times throughout these last five months when holding BITX has worked out quite well for shareholders - even those shareholders who have held for far longer than would be recommended by the fund's issuer. That said, since Bitcoin made a marginal new high on October 6th, the fund has been in near free-fall: Data by YCharts With Bitcoin down 18% over the last month, BITX has delivered on that 2x return strategy to the downside. Given the large selloff for both BTC and BITX over these last few weeks, traders are no doubt looking for local bottom opportunities to play a bounce in BTC and its proxies. In this update, I'll offer my technical viewpoint on Bitcoin currently and lay out what I'd like to see in BTC before jumping into BITX for a swing trade. Recapping Risks Before we get into the charts, this brief section will serve as the obligatory risks acknowledgement when assessing leveraged ETFs. For a deeper dive into the risks associated with BITX specifically, I'd encourage both current shareholders and prospective buyers to read my initial coverage of the fund here . First, BITX is not a cheap product as it is an actively managed fund with a 1.85% management fee. Second, BITX is inherently risky because it introduces leverage to what is already a volatile digital asset. Third, given that the fund utilizes futures contracts for its Bitcoin-proxy leverage, expenses will eat away at returns over time as the fund manager rolls over contracts each month. Finally, BITX is flat out not an investment product, it's a trading product. Per the fund's issuer Volatility Shares: The Fund is intended to be used as a short-term trading vehicle. Investors in the Fund should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not actively monitor and manage their portfolio. Thus, BITX should only be used for tactical moves by experienced traders who want leverage on Bitcoin's upside. The question then is: Are we at a pivot point for BTC bulls? Possibly. Bitcoin Charts In this section, I'll offer my opinion on Bitcoin's technical setup over three different time frames; daily, weekly, and monthly. As a reminder, though I often approach my trades from a fundamental standpoint, I do occasionally trade on technicals alone. And while I suspect Bitcoin could be setting up for a 'dead cat' bounce rally following a 21% selloff from its recent peak, I'm personally waiting for a very specific price level to confirm that reversal before I use BITX for a rebound trade. Here's the daily chart: Bitcoin Daily Chart 11/6/25 (TrendSpider) The first thing I want to point out is the enormous wedge that goes back the last several months. Those lines are indicated with yellow. After attempting to break through the top of that wedge no less than three times going back to July, BTC quickly flushed down to the bottom of the wedge in a matter of just a few weeks. Following a defense of $100k on two consecutive candles, my view is Bitcoin is going to attempt a rally up to the 200-day moving average. From current levels, that would be good for a 9-10% gain; potentially 15-20% if played through BITX. But I want to be clear, I don't think this is an overly bullish chart. The 50 and 200 day MAs are foreshadowing a 'death cross' and after hanging on to the 200-day MA as support several times in October, that level is sure to be resistance going forward. Which brings us to the weekly chart: Bitcoin Weekly Chart 11/6/25 (TrendSpider) This is a pretty concerning chart for bulls for a couple of reasons, in my view. First, the yellow arrows display numerous bearish RSI divergences that go back to last December. But also the 50-week MA is now dangerously close to being given up - that level is highlighted with the red circle and arrows. This is what I'm watching through the end of the week. I am not personally willing to play BITX for the bounce unless Bitcoin retakes the 50-week MA on this week's close. That level is currently $102,953. The last time Bitcoin closed a weekly candle below its 50-week MA after making a new all-time high a month prior, the coin fell by roughly 70% over the next twelve months. Now the monthly: Bitcoin Monthly Chart 11/6/25 (TrendSpider) I've shared this chart in previous Seeking Alpha articles covering Bitcoin. I've drawn a linear trend from the tops of the 2017 and 2021 cycles up to today. I don't think it's a coincidence that Bitcoin rallies keep stalling out at this trend-line. Furthermore, BTC is now approaching downside trend support that goes back to August 2024. Again, we see bearish RSI divergences between the cycle highs. And despite the claims from some that four-year Bitcoin cycles are dead, I flat out disagree that such a notion could be true when block reward halving events still exist. Closing Takeaways If I didn't make it clear, I don't find Bitcoin's daily, weekly, or monthly charts to be all that encouraging for the medium term. As I write this on November 6th, I could certainly make the argument that a relief rally for BTC is imminent. That rally could even go as high as 10%. And if that is indeed the case, BITX actually makes some sense for traders who want to maximize gains on the move. From where I sit, I would wait for confirmation that Bitcoin can hold key support before reversing higher to test the 200-day MA. The level that I'm personally watching is $103k on the weekly close. Provided Bitcoin can retake that level, I'll entertain a short term BITX swing trade. As always, be careful with leverage and have a plan when trading these volatile assets and financial products.",BTC-USD|BITX,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-07 04:06:22

The price is now consolidating and might struggle to stay above $2.150 in the near term. XRP price failed to continue higher above $2.420 and corrected lower. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.360 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it dips below $2.150. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price started a recovery wave above $2.25 and $2.30, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price even attempted a move above $2.40 but failed to clear $2.42. A high was formed at $2.414 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a drop below $2.33 and $2.32 levels. The price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.066 swing low to the $2.414 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.360 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The bulls are now active near $2.20 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.066 swing low to the $2.414 high. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.30 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.350 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.420. A clear move above the $2.420 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.30 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.20 level. The next major support is near the $2.150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $1.840.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has officially thrown its support behind a revolutionary yen stablecoin pilot project involving the country’s three largest banks. This exciting development marks a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption in one of the world’s leading economies. What Makes This Yen Stablecoin So Revolutionary? The Financial Services Agency will verify the legal viability of this innovative yen stablecoin, which represents a joint effort by banking giants MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho. This initiative serves as the first project under the Payment Innovation Project (PIP), scheduled to begin this month. The timing couldn’t be more perfect as digital payments continue to transform global finance. According to recent reports from Coindesk Japan and Nikkei, the three banking powerhouses are collaborating to launch both yen- and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. This dual approach demonstrates their commitment to creating comprehensive digital payment solutions that cater to both domestic and international markets. Why Are Stablecoins Becoming So Important? Stablecoins represent one of the most practical applications of blockchain technology in traditional finance. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins maintain a stable value by being pegged to real-world assets like national currencies. The yen stablecoin project offers several key benefits: Reduced transaction costs for cross-border payments Faster settlement times compared to traditional banking Enhanced financial inclusion for underserved populations Improved transparency through blockchain technology Regulatory compliance with FSA oversight How Will This Yen Stablecoin Transform Japanese Finance? The involvement of Japan’s three largest banks brings unprecedented credibility to this yen stablecoin initiative. MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho collectively serve millions of customers and handle trillions of yen in transactions annually. Their participation ensures that this digital currency will integrate seamlessly with existing financial infrastructure while maintaining the highest security standards. Moreover, the FSA’s active support provides crucial regulatory clarity that has often been missing in cryptocurrency projects. This government backing signals that Japan is serious about embracing financial innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. What Challenges Might This Yen Stablecoin Face? Despite the exciting potential, the yen stablecoin project must navigate several challenges. Regulatory compliance remains paramount, as the FSA will closely monitor the pilot program’s progress. Technical scalability, cybersecurity threats, and user adoption also present significant hurdles that the banking consortium must overcome. However, the combined expertise of these financial institutions, coupled with government support, positions this yen stablecoin initiative for success. The lessons learned from this pilot could shape digital currency regulations and implementations worldwide. What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Adoption? Japan’s progressive approach to the yen stablecoin sets a powerful precedent for other nations considering similar initiatives. As one of the world’s largest economies, Japan’s embrace of regulated digital currencies could accelerate global cryptocurrency adoption and encourage other central banks to explore their own digital currency projects. The success of this yen stablecoin could potentially: Establish new standards for digital currency regulation Bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance Create new opportunities for financial innovation Enhance Japan’s position as a fintech leader Japan’s FSA-backed yen stablecoin pilot represents a watershed moment for digital finance. By combining the stability of traditional banking with the innovation of blockchain technology, this initiative could fundamentally transform how we think about money and payments. The collaboration between regulatory authorities and financial institutions demonstrates that responsible innovation is possible in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions What is a yen stablecoin? A yen stablecoin is a digital currency pegged to the Japanese yen, maintaining a 1:1 value ratio with its fiat counterpart through reserves held by the issuing institution. Which banks are involved in the pilot project? MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho – Japan’s three largest banks – are collaborating on this yen stablecoin initiative with FSA support. When does the stablecoin pilot begin? The Payment Innovation Project pilot is scheduled to launch this month, marking the first phase of testing and regulatory verification. Will there be a dollar-backed stablecoin too? Yes, according to Nikkei reports, the banking consortium plans to launch both yen- and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins as part of their digital currency strategy. How is the FSA involved in this project? The Financial Services Agency is providing official support and will verify the legal viability of the yen stablecoin through its Payment Innovation Project framework. What benefits will users see from this stablecoin? Users can expect faster transactions, lower fees, enhanced security, and the convenience of digital payments while maintaining the stability of traditional currency.

However, sources noted that this increase was lower than anticipated. The announcement followed the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications’ release of reports indicating that individuals in the country spent approximately 1.8% more on household items in September than they did the previous year. According to the reports, this was after adjusting for inflation, attributing the increase to entertainment and transportation. However, sources pointed out that the number was lower than the 2.5% increase economists had predicted. This was because individuals spent less on education and housing, negatively affecting the overall numbers. Japan’s household spending increases below economists’ prediction Consumption makes up more than half of Japan’s gross domestic product ( GDP). In the meantime, experts said that while spending had overall remained solid against an inflationary backdrop, it is still possible that a GDP report due on November 17 will show that the economy actually shrank over the past three months to September, snapping five quarters of consecutive growth. Sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous, pointed to a decline in exports and new housing initiatives amid regulatory changes as the reasons behind this economic downturn. Monitoring consumption is crucial to determine whether households adjust to the rising cost of living. In the case of inflation, analysts conducted research. They discovered that inflation levels have been at or above the Bank of Japan’s target of 2% for over three years, with a key price index rising in September. Regarding the increase in Japan’s household spending, the important question for the central bank and the country’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, is whether consumer spending will continue to boost a healthy economic cycle. “We are observing improved consumption figures compared to last year because the results during this time were not good,” stated Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Minami acknowledged that families with working members fuel spending, reflecting the effects of bonuses and higher wages. Concerning wage growth in Japan, sources noted that although nominal wages increased, real wages, which take inflation into account, dropped drastically through September of this year. This decrease suggests that families have less purchasing power, resulting in dissatisfaction among voters. Government support during this period is crucial to bolster the country’s economy. Therefore, Takaichi has introduced an economic package to help families cope with inflation. This package is expected to support electricity and gas bills throughout the winter, as well as regional grants to help offset increasing costs. Moreover, Takaichi’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and other major parties have agreed to ease the tax imposed on gasoline by the end of this year. The yen remains weak against the dollar, sparking worries in Japan Takaichi considers measures to lower prices a key focus after voters demonstrated their unhappiness with the LDP in the recent national elections. This was because the voters felt the price relief efforts were inadequate. To address these concerns, the prime minister essentially ruled out cash handouts, which the LDP had proposed as a significant step before the July election. Notably, Takaichi is known for her advocacy of monetary easing, which has led to market expectations that the Bank of Japan may not hurry to hike interest rates. In addition, she has not directly called on the central bank to shift its policies since taking office last month, yet the yen remains weak against the dollar, recently trading near an eight-month low . This situation has sparked worries among individuals that, instead of a stronger demand, increased import charges from the weaker currency will drive inflation higher.

Coinbase Europe Fined By Irish Regulator On Thursday, the Central Bank of Ireland announced its first enforcement action against the crypto sector after fining Coinbase Europe Limited, the European arm of the US exchange, for multiple anti-money laundering monitoring failures over the past four years. According to the announcement, the Irish regulator and the crypto exchange settled on November 5, 2025, resulting in the $35.3 million (€30.6 million) penalty being reduced to $24.75 million after a 30% settlement scheme discount. Coinbase Europe has admitted the prescribed contraventions and has agreed to the undisputed facts as set out in the Settlement Notice (…). The sanctions have been accepted by Coinbase Europe. The sanctions are subject to confirmation by the High Court and will take effect once confirmed. Coinbase was fined for “faults in the configuration of their transaction monitoring system” that resulted in over 30 million transactions not being properly monitored over 12 months. As the Central Bank detailed, the value of these transactions amounted to €176 billion, approximately 31% of all Coinbase Europe transactions conducted in the period when the faults existed. As a registered Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Ireland, the crypto exchange is required to monitor customer transactions and file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the national Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and Revenue Commissioners if it suspects that any given transaction is facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Nonetheless, Coinbase’s European arm took almost 3 years to fully complete monitoring of the over 30 million impacted transactions, which led to the reporting of 2,708 STRs to the FIU for analysis and potential investigation. The submitted STRs contained suspicions of serious criminal activities, the statement noted. Colm Kincaid, Deputy Governor of Consumer and Investor Protection, asserted that “to be effective in combatting financial crime, law enforcement agencies rely on regulated financial institutions to have systems in place to monitor transactions and report suspicions. The failure of such a system within any financial institution creates an opportunity for criminals to evade detection – and criminals will take that opportunity.” “Where system failures do occur, it is imperative that they are reported to the Central Bank without delay so that appropriate actions can be taken to manage and mitigate the risk,” he concluded. Coinbase Called ‘Corruption Factory’ Last week, Coinbase also faced scrutiny in the US, after Senator Chris Murphy accused the crypto exchange of participating in President Donald Trump’s alleged “corruption factory.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the Democratic Senator claimed that the crypto exchange’s donations to Trump’s presidential campaign were part of a political payoff that allegedly resulted in the dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s lawsuit against the exchange. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, and CPO, Faryar Shirzad, refuted the claims, affirming that the Senator’s allegations were misinformed. Shirzad argued that the SEC lawsuits against the exchange and multiple other crypto companies “were part of a grotesque pattern of bullying and abuse of power by the previous chair.” Meanwhile, Grewal asserted that “What was corrupt was allowing us to go public ‘in the public interest’ and then suing us. What was corrupt was what the Third Circuit held was an arbitrary and capricious denial of our request to get basic rules for crypto.” It’s worth noting that Coinbase has openly criticized the previous administration’s crypto crackdown, asking for a more welcoming approach and clear regulations. Earlier this year, the exchange filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to seek information on the SEC’s spending on enforcement actions against crypto firms during the Biden Administration.",Crypto News|AML Anti-money laundering|AML Compliance|Central Bank of ireland|coinbase|Coinbase Europe|Coinbase settlement|crypto regulation|Irish regulator|total|total crypto market cap|US SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 05:00:25

Here’s What It Means for Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-nears-death-cross-heres-what-it-means-for-price/,"XRP is facing renewed market pressure this week after a sharp decline brought its price to a low of $2.08. While the asset recovered slightly, it is still down 15.32% from last week. The recent drop has added weight to a new technical signal that could shape short-term sentiment for the asset. Coin Bureau posted on X that “XRP’s 50-day moving average (MA) is about to cross below its 200-day MA — a classic death cross pattern.” The accompanying chart highlights the potential crossover forming as XRP continues to lose momentum. The death cross is one of the most closely watched indicators in technical analysis. It occurs when the short-term moving average, in this case the 50-day MA, falls beneath the long-term 200-day MA, often signaling a transition from a bullish to a bearish trend. While such patterns do not always lead to extended declines, they are generally seen as warnings that downward pressure may persist. XRP NEARS DEATH CROSS XRP’s 50-day moving average (MA) is about to cross below its 200-day MA — a classic death cross pattern. Will $XRP fall deeper? pic.twitter.com/hv34jxo8oV — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 4, 2025 The Chart Reveals Growing Weakness Coin Bureau’s chart shows XRP struggling to maintain support after repeated attempts to reclaim levels above $2.6. The 50-day moving average, represented by the blue line, is trending downward and approaching an intersection with the 200-day MA, shown in yellow. The highlighted circle on the chart emphasizes the area where the two lines are set to meet, indicating the possible confirmation of the death cross in the coming days. This pattern follows weeks of uneven trading activity. After briefly recovering to the $2.7 range in late October, XRP has since retreated amid intensified selling pressure. The decline accelerated on November 3, bringing the asset below $2.3 and leaving it vulnerable to further losses if market sentiment fails to improve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Signal Could Mean For Traders The death cross does not guarantee additional downside, but it often reinforces negative sentiment among traders and institutions. Historical data across major cryptocurrencies shows that the pattern tends to precede periods of price stagnation or correction, particularly when accompanied by reduced trading volume. For XRP, this could mean a prolonged consolidation phase unless strong buying interest returns. However, some analysts view the setup as an opportunity rather than a definitive bearish sign. XRP’s current price could be a major buying opportunity for investors interested in medium to long-term holding, as one well-respected analyst recently urged XRP holders to ignore the noise and prepare for a massive upward move.

Bitcoin Could Retest Active Realized Price Next In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin has dropped a notable distance below the short-term holder (STH) Realized Price. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain metric that tracks the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. To any investor, their break-even mark tends to be a level of particular importance, as retests of it can potentially flip their profit-loss situation. Due to this, Realized Price levels have often shown interactions with the asset’s price, as investors make moves to either exit with their money back or buy more to defend their cost basis. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Line That Has Triggered Strong Rebounds Since Nov 2024 A group that’s considered particularly sensitive to short-term volatility is the STH cohort, made up of the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The Realized Price of the STHs generally provides support during bullish trends, but with the recent market crash, Bitcoin has plummeted under it. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin at its post-crash levels is trading significantly below the STH Realized Price located at $112,500. This means that members of the cohort are now notably underwater. “Historically, discounts with such depth from this level have increased the likelihood of further downside toward lower structural supports,” explained Glassnode. One such support is the Active Realized Price, corresponding to the cost basis of the “economically active” part of the BTC supply. A chunk of the cryptocurrency’s supply has been dormant for so long that it can safely be presumed lost. In other words, these tokens will never make their way back into circulation. Such coins have no effect on the market today, so the Active Realized Price excludes them from the data, labeling them “economically inactive.” The report noted that this level “has often served as a critical reference point during extended corrective phases in prior cycles.” At present, the indicator is sitting near $88,500. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Social Sentiment Collapses, But XRP Just Sees Disinterest The Bitcoin STH Realized Price isn’t the only level that the asset has lost recently. As on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has pointed out in an X post, the asset has also declined below the 365-day moving average (MA). CryptoQuant has described the line as “a key technical and psychological support level last broken at the start of the 2022 bear market.” Considering that Bitcoin has lost the STH Realized Price, and now, this level as well, it remains to be seen whether the asset will end up retesting the Active Realized Price and other lower support levels. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,300, down over 6% in the last seven days.

This development suggests that institutional investors are once again viewing Bitcoin as an attractive asset. The timing of this recovery is particularly significant. Many analysts had been watching the outflow trend closely, concerned about weakening institutional interest. However, the substantial $220.86 million inflow demonstrates that confidence in Bitcoin spot ETFs remains strong among major financial players. Which Bitcoin Spot ETFs Led the Charge? The inflow distribution reveals clear winners in the Bitcoin spot ETFs space. BlackRock’s IBIT emerged as the dominant player, attracting an impressive $93.28 million in net inflows. This substantial amount represents nearly half of the total daily inflow, highlighting BlackRock’s continued leadership in the cryptocurrency ETF market. Other major contributors included: Fidelity’s FBTC with $61.64 million Ark Invest’s ARKB with $60.44 million Bitwise’s BITB with $5.5 million Why Does This Matter for Bitcoin Investors? The resurgence in Bitcoin spot ETFs inflows carries important implications for both retail and institutional investors. First, it indicates that major financial institutions maintain their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Second, the diverse participation across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs suggests broad-based interest rather than isolated institutional moves. Moreover, this development could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. When institutional money flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, it often precedes increased retail interest and can contribute to positive price momentum. The timing of this inflow reversal might mark an important inflection point for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. What Challenges Remain for Bitcoin Spot ETFs? Despite the positive news, Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to face several challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a concern for some institutional investors. Additionally, market volatility can still trigger rapid shifts in inflow patterns. However, the strong performance of leading Bitcoin spot ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT demonstrates growing mainstream acceptance. The consistent interest in established Bitcoin spot ETFs also highlights the importance of trusted brand names in the cryptocurrency space. Investors appear to prefer products from well-known financial institutions, which could shape future development in the Bitcoin spot ETFs market. Actionable Insights from the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Inflow For investors monitoring Bitcoin spot ETFs, this development offers several key takeaways. The concentration of inflows in major players suggests that brand reputation matters significantly. Additionally, the sudden reversal after six days of outflows indicates that market sentiment can change rapidly. Investors should consider: Monitoring inflow patterns across different Bitcoin spot ETFs Watching for sustained positive momentum beyond single-day reversals Considering diversification across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs Staying informed about regulatory developments affecting Bitcoin spot ETFs Conclusion: A Promising Turn for Bitcoin Spot ETFs The $220.86 million inflow represents more than just numbers—it signifies renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption story. As Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to attract significant capital, they reinforce cryptocurrency’s growing role in traditional finance. This development marks an encouraging step forward for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly.

How do Bitcoin spot ETFs differ from Bitcoin futures ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs hold actual Bitcoin, while futures ETFs track Bitcoin futures contracts, creating different risk and return profiles. Should retail investors consider Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs offer regulated exposure to Bitcoin, making them suitable for investors comfortable with cryptocurrency volatility but preferring traditional investment vehicles. Can Bitcoin spot ETFs influence Bitcoin’s price? Yes, significant inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs can increase buying pressure on Bitcoin, potentially supporting price appreciation.

This dramatic shift signals renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum-based investment products, marking a potential inflection point for the digital asset market. What Sparked the ETH ETFs Rebound? The sudden reversal in ETH ETFs flows caught many market observers by surprise. According to data from TraderT, this represents the first positive day after a week-long outflow streak that had investors concerned about institutional sentiment. The timing suggests that major financial players are seeing value in current Ethereum price levels. Market analysts point to several factors driving this change. First, improved regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency investments has provided more confidence. Second, the underlying Ethereum network continues to show strong development activity. Finally, the attractive entry points following recent price corrections may have triggered this institutional buying spree. Which ETH ETFs Led the Charge? The inflow distribution reveals clear winners in the ETH ETFs space. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) emerged as the dominant players, attracting substantial investments that drove the overall positive momentum. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) : $4.59 million inflow Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) : $4.95 million inflow Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) : $3.08 million inflow These three products accounted for the majority of the day’s positive flows, demonstrating that established financial institutions continue to attract the bulk of institutional capital when it comes to ETH ETFs. Why Did Grayscale’s ETHE Buck the Trend? While most ETH ETFs enjoyed inflows, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) stood out for the wrong reasons. The fund experienced a $3.53 million outflow, continuing its pattern of being the exception in an otherwise positive day for ETH ETFs. This divergence highlights several important considerations for investors. Grayscale’s product carries higher fees compared to newer competitors, which may explain the continued outflows. Additionally, some investors might be rotating from Grayscale’s trust structure to the more tax-efficient ETF format offered by newer entrants. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The resurgence in ETH ETFs flows provides valuable insights for both retail and institutional investors. This development suggests that professional money managers see current levels as attractive entry points for Ethereum exposure. For long-term investors, the return of institutional interest in ETH ETFs could signal several positive developments. It indicates growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. Moreover, it suggests that sophisticated investors believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition beyond short-term price fluctuations. How Can You Benefit from ETH ETFs Momentum? Understanding the flow patterns in ETH ETFs can help investors make more informed decisions. The current rebound presents opportunities for those looking to gain exposure to Ethereum through regulated, traditional investment vehicles. Diversification : ETH ETFs provide easy access to Ethereum without technical complexities Liquidity : Major ETH ETFs offer high trading volumes and tight spreads Security : Regulated structure provides investor protections Tax Efficiency : ETF structure offers potential tax advantages Conclusion: A New Chapter for ETH ETFs The $9.09 million inflow represents more than just a single day’s trading activity—it marks a potential turning point for ETH ETFs and institutional sentiment toward Ethereum. As major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity continue to attract capital, the legitimacy and maturity of Ethereum as an investment asset becomes increasingly evident. This development should encourage investors to monitor ETH ETFs flows closely, as they often serve as leading indicators of institutional sentiment. The breaking of the seven-day outflow streak suggests that professional investors are once again finding value in Ethereum at current levels, potentially setting the stage for renewed momentum in the weeks ahead. Frequently Asked Questions What are ETH ETFs? ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly holding it.

Which ETH ETF performed best during the rebound? Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) led with $4.95 million in inflows, followed closely by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust with $4.59 million. Should I invest in ETH ETFs now? While the recent inflow is positive, investment decisions should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy.

The country’s largest crypto exchanges, Bithumb and Upbit, handled the highest volume of suspicious transfers. Bithumb facilitated about 12.4 billion won ($9 million) in transactions, while Upbit processed 366 million won ($271,000). The funds were sent to Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian online marketplace sanctioned by the U.S. and UK. Most of the transfers were made in USDT stablecoins. “Realistically, it’s extremely difficult to detect all suspicious transactions on Korean exchanges before they occur,” said Youchull Jung, an attorney specializing in white collar crime at Lee & Ko in South Korea. Jung said the movement of crypto from Korean to Cambodian exchanges reflect the cat-and-mouse dynamic in enforcement with reports filed and transactions blocked only after the money had already started to move. Korea’s offshore financial crime crisis Financial scams that funnel crypto to Cambodia has become a flashpoint in national politics. Lawmakers questioned the effectiveness and speed of regulators’ countermeasures at a parliamentary audit on October 27. Jung explained that increased enforcement in South Korea has driven fraudsters to operate from overseas hubs in Cambodia and the Philippines where they work with local criminal networks. Korea’s supercharged crypto market South Korea has emerged as the world’s second-largest market for digital assets behind the United States. The Bank of Korea said the country’s five main exchanges held a combined $73 billion in assets at the end of 2024, with crypto trading volumes surpassing the stock market. The boom led regulators to roll out a landmark digital asset law in 2024 that tightened oversight of exchanges and strengthened investor protections. The measure expanded the earlier AML Act in 2021 and introduced a Travel Rule requiring registered exchanges to share verified information on crypto transfers over one million won (approx. $800). Regulatory arbitrage While regulators have been busy building a framework for its domestic virtual asset space, criminal groups have exploited blind spots in cross border transfers, explained Jongbaek Park, an attorney specializing in digital assets at Bae, Kim, Lee law firm in South Korea. The Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, first enacted in 1999, remains the country’s primary law on cross border payments and remittances. But it predates the rise of digital assets and doesn’t clearly define cryptocurrencies as a legitimate “means of payment,” leaving regulators and users operating in a legal gray area. “Korea has very strict foreign exchange regulations. Under the current rules, anyone remitting securities must file a report with the Bank of Korea in advance,” said Park. “But it’s not clear whether crypto assets or blockchain tokens fall under that requirement.” According to Park, transferring digital tokens without notifying the Bank of Korea could be in breach of the law. High entry barrier for smaller exchanges The AML act reshaped Korea’s crypto landscape. Before it took effect there were roughly 60 exchanges operating nationwide. After enforcement, only five were able to secure the real-name verified bank account needed to offer Korean won trading. Tae Eon Koo, a fintech attorney at Lin Law Firm in South Korea, described the AML Act as both a strength and bottleneck. The real-name trading system is a major component of South Korea’s crypto AML and KYC regulations. It forces crypto exchanges to form an official partnership with a bank. “The requirement to secure a real-name verification partnership with a domestic bank is not written in law but enforced for AML reasons,” he said. “Without this, it makes it nearly impossible for new players seeking to compete with the established ‘Big 5’ exchanges, to enter the market. He said that current regulation has effectively turned banks into gatekeepers to the Korean won market. Attorney Jongbaek Park adds that regulators’ are “conservative” or ‘extremely selective’ when it comes to giving exchanges permission to directly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. “The Financial Services Commission, as its policy, does not want banks to give bank accounts to many crypto exchanges. At the moment each bank is only allowed to give one bank account to one exchange.” Breaking the crypto duopoly Binance has regained access to South Korea’s crypto market after winning regulatory approval to acquire a 67% stake in local exchange GOPAX. The clearance from the KoFIU, granted on October 16, marks the first major foreign exchange to enter the market since the introduction of the Travel Rule. Binance exited the country in 2021 when it failed to secure a banking partner. “Its re-entry is a big deal,” said Koo “Because it has the potential to break the current duopoly held by Upbit and Bithumb.” Reverse discrimination Some domestic exchanges have accused regulators of engaging in what they call “reverse discrimination,” where global giants such as Binance encounter fewer entry barriers by buying licensed local platforms in South Korea. Meanwhile, domestic exchanges say strict AML and banking rules continue to hold them back from expanding overseas. “The current market sentiment is that existing regulation is not protecting fair competition,” Koo said. “Instead it may be creating an unbalanced playing field.” But, he said Binance’s return could reshape that balance. “Binance brings massive capital, operational expertise, and, most importantly, deep liquidity,” Koo said. “But how much influence it has will depend on whether regulators allow GOPAX to share its order book with Binance’s global platform.” As global exchanges push in and local players push back, the long-term growth and credibility of its crypto market may hinge on how effectively South Korea can curb financial crime through digital channels.

The recent price action has traders questioning whether the crucial $2.2 support level will hold. This development comes after multiple failed attempts to break through key resistance levels, creating significant uncertainty in the market. What Does the XRP Downward Channel Mean for Investors? The XRP downward channel pattern emerged on the four-hour chart after the asset repeatedly failed to conquer the $2.4 resistance level. This failure triggered a decline below the $2.28 support line, confirming the bearish pattern. Technical analysts note that such channels typically indicate continued downward pressure until either support holds or resistance breaks. Market participants should understand that a downward channel doesn’t necessarily mean continuous selling. Instead, it represents a pattern where both highs and lows are trending downward. The key levels to watch now are: $2.2 support – The critical level that must hold $2.28 resistance – The level that could signal recovery $2.4 resistance – The major barrier that previously rejected price advances How Are Technical Indicators Supporting the XRP Downward Channel Analysis? Multiple technical indicators reinforce the XRP downward channel pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved from neutral territory into oversold conditions, suggesting potential for either a bounce or continued weakness. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed a death cross for the first time in two weeks, adding bearish confirmation. These indicators collectively suggest that selling pressure has intensified. However, oversold conditions could also present buying opportunities for contrarian traders. The current XRP downward channel situation requires careful monitoring of these technical signals for potential entry or exit points. What Are the Potential Scenarios for XRP Price Movement? Traders face two primary scenarios in this XRP downward channel situation. If the $2.2 support level holds firm, we could see consolidation followed by a potential rebound. A daily close above $2.28 would signal strength and possibly trigger a renewed attempt to break the $2.4 resistance. Conversely, if the XRP downward channel continues and $2.2 support breaks, the next significant support levels become: $2.15 – Minor historical support $2.05 – Strong previous resistance turned support $1.95 – Major psychological level The current XRP downward channel presents both risks and opportunities. Patient investors might find attractive entry points if support holds, while aggressive traders could short breakdowns. Why Should You Monitor the XRP Downward Channel Closely? Understanding the XRP downward channel dynamics is crucial because breakouts from such patterns often lead to significant price movements. A successful hold at $2.2 could spark a substantial rally, while a breakdown might accelerate selling pressure. The XRP downward channel represents a critical juncture that could determine short to medium-term price direction. Remember that technical patterns like the XRP downward channel work best when combined with fundamental analysis and market sentiment. Current regulatory developments and overall cryptocurrency market conditions will significantly influence whether support holds or breaks. Conclusion: Navigating the XRP Downward Channel Waters The XRP downward channel presents a clear technical picture with defined risk levels. The $2.2 support represents the line in the sand for bulls, while bears will target a breakdown below this level. Successful trading in this environment requires discipline, patience, and careful risk management. Whether you’re looking to buy the dip or short the breakdown, the XRP downward channel offers defined trade setups with clear invalidation points. Frequently Asked Questions What is a downward channel in technical analysis? A downward channel is a chart pattern where price moves between two descending parallel lines, with lower highs and lower lows indicating bearish momentum. How long do downward channels typically last? Downward channels can last from several days to several weeks, depending on the timeframe being analyzed and market conditions. What happens when XRP breaks out of the downward channel? A breakout above the upper channel line typically signals trend reversal and potential upward movement, while a breakdown below support suggests continued decline. Should I buy XRP during a downward channel? This depends on your risk tolerance and trading strategy. Some traders wait for confirmation of support holding, while others scale in gradually during declines. What other indicators should I watch with the XRP downward channel? Monitor volume patterns, Bollinger Bands, and key moving averages alongside the channel pattern for confirmation signals. Can fundamental news override the downward channel pattern? Yes, significant news events can override technical patterns, which is why traders should always consider both technical and fundamental factors. Found this XRP downward channel analysis helpful?

He noted they managed to reduce inflation without triggering a recession. His remarks come a week after the ECB held interest rates steady for the third consecutive meeting, confident that its policy stance is suitable for controlling inflation without hurting growth. At that time, Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, noted that the eurozone economy had made good progress, but they were navigating a period of uncertainty. She emphasized that the central bank works to maintain a strong position despite the ongoing global geopolitical tensions. Vujcic finds it worrying that retail finds are surpassing hedge funds With inflation at close to 2% and GDP growth stronger than expected for Q3, the deposit rate is unlikely to be cut anytime soon, standing at 2% after eight rounds of cuts. The ECB is set to present new quarterly estimates and provide more clarity on inflation at its December meeting. Still, a few officials worry that the projections could show readings below the target for the next three years. For analysts, a rate cut next month seems unlikely, but there is still a 40% chance of one by mid-2026. Vujcic pointed to potential threats to Europe’s economy, warning about fiscal discipline and signs of markets being overpriced, and noted that redemptions from retail funds outpacing those from hedge funds were especially worrying. He stated, “That’s usually a sign that something’s coming that’s not very good.” However, he insists the bank’s policy is “in a good place.” Speaking on Thursday, Luis de Guindos, the ECB’s Vice President, also argued that the bank is comfortable with existing rates and expects any decline in inflation below 2% to be short-lived. Inflation is forecast to drop below 2% next year. However, some policymakers worried this could anchor expectations at very low levels, similar to the pre-pandemic period. “If (undershooting) happens, it will be something that is going to be temporary. “We can be comfortable with the present level interest rates. I think that convergence to 2% without any overshooting or undershooting is now the main baseline scenario for projections,” de Guindos stated. He added that the recent economic readings have shown solid, if modest, growth of about 1%, in line with the bloc’s potential. As a result, policymakers are now “a bit” more optimistic and see the economy tracking the ECB’s forecasts. The ECB is still struggling to gain support for its digital euro project The ECB is facing difficulties in advancing its digital euro project, as the 2029 launch target is encountering mounting opposition from EU legislators and financial institutions. A consortium of 14 lenders, including Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, and ING, has warned that the digital euro could crowd out private payment systems. The banks have argued that the planned retail digital euro would serve the same purposes as existing private options but without providing added value for users. Fernando Navarrete, a Spanish conservative lawmaker overseeing the Parliament’s assessment of the digital euro, has pressed for a toned-down version of the plan. According to a report he published last week, Navarrete believes the digital euro should function primarily as an offline alternative to cash, rather than as a real-time digital payment system, as the ECB plans. He noted that incorporating online payment features risked setting up a rival payment ecosystem that could block private systems from achieving EU-wide reach. Navarrete argued that an online version of the digital euro should be introduced only if European payment firms fail to compete effectively with US giants. The ECB began exploring the idea of a digital euro in 2020. Last week, its Governing Council agreed to move forward with preparations to make issuance possible by 2029, with a pilot phase planned for 2027. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

She pointed out that dollar-pegged tokens are quickly becoming the preferred store of value in emerging markets facing inflation and currency instability. While Wood is still bullish on Bitcoin as a digital store of value similar to gold, she acknowledged that stablecoins are filling a growing need for liquidity and stability. Stablecoins Challenge Bitcoin Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, trimmed her long-term Bitcoin price forecast by $300,000, and pointed to the rapid rise of stablecoins in emerging markets as a major factor reshaping Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Wood explained that she now expects Bitcoin to reach around $1.2 million by 2030, which is down from her earlier $1.5 million projection. She lowered her projection due to the growing dominance of stablecoins as a preferred store of value and medium of exchange in developing economies. “Stablecoins are usurping part of the role that we thought Bitcoin would play,” Wood said, and explained that dollar-pegged tokens are scaling faster than many analysts anticipated. Still, she reiterated her bullish outlook on Bitcoin, and described it as a “global monetary system” and a distinct form of digital gold, while stablecoins are “just cash tokenized on a blockchain.” Her comments were made during a broader trend where emerging market economies are turning to stablecoins to hedge against local currency instability, hyperinflation, and restrictive monetary policies. According to Standard Chartered, stablecoins could drain over $1 trillion from the traditional banking system in emerging markets by 2028, as residents opt for dollar-pegged digital assets over local fiat. Countries like Venezuela and Argentina have become hotspots for this shift. Venezuela is grappling with inflation rates as high as 269% in 2025, and saw widespread adoption of stablecoins like Tether’s USDT as an alternative to both the bolivar and physical US dollars. Meanwhile, strict currency controls and limited access to foreign exchange drive citizens to rely on blockchain-based assets for savings and international transactions. (Source: Chainalysis) Reports in 2024 even suggested that the Venezuelan government used stablecoins to circumvent US sanctions and conduct oil trades. Despite Bitcoin’s slightly lowered forecast, Wood’s stance proves that Bitcoin continues to hold its position as a store of value, while stablecoins increasingly fill the demand for stability and liquidity in regions that are most affected by economic volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 05:30:00

This emergency action comes directly after the devastating Stream Finance incident that resulted in massive financial losses. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges facing synthetic stablecoins in today’s volatile crypto market. Why did Elixir suspend deUSD support? The decision to suspend deUSD support stems from the catastrophic Stream Finance incident, which caused approximately $93 million in losses. Elixir Network, a modular blockchain specializing in decentralized order book liquidity, took immediate action to protect remaining assets and users. The platform recognized the severe implications of continuing operations while the stablecoin’s backing was compromised. Stream Finance’s collapse created an unsustainable situation for deUSD. With approximately 65% of deUSD’s reserve assets tied to the failed platform, the stablecoin faced immediate liquidity and solvency issues. This dependency created a domino effect that forced Elixir’s hand in making the suspension decision. What happened during the Stream Finance incident? The Stream Finance incident represents one of the most significant DeFi failures in recent months. The platform suffered a catastrophic loss that impacted numerous projects and users across the ecosystem. Key aspects of the incident include: $93 million total losses across affected platforms 65% of deUSD reserves were exposed to Stream Finance Immediate depegging of deUSD from the US dollar Price collapse to just 1.5 cents per deUSD token This chain of events demonstrates how interconnected the DeFi ecosystem has become and how quickly problems can spread between platforms. How is Elixir handling repayments to affected users? Elixir Network has taken proactive steps to address user concerns following the deUSD suspension. The platform has already completed repayments to 80% of deUSD holders, showing commitment to user protection despite the challenging circumstances. However, the remaining 20% of holders still await resolution, creating uncertainty within the community. The repayment process highlights both the platform’s responsiveness and the limitations of current DeFi insurance mechanisms. While Elixir moves quickly to address immediate concerns, the situation raises important questions about risk management in decentralized finance. What does deUSD’s depegging mean for synthetic stablecoins? The dramatic depegging of deUSD to just 1.5 cents represents a severe blow to confidence in synthetic stablecoins. This event serves as a stark reminder that algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins carry different risks compared to traditional fiat-backed stablecoins. The depegging occurred rapidly following the Stream Finance revelation, catching many investors off guard. This development forces the broader crypto community to reconsider: Risk assessment for synthetic asset investments Due diligence requirements for reserve backing Diversification strategies across different stablecoin types Emergency response plans for protocol failures What lessons can we learn from Elixir’s deUSD suspension? The Elixir suspends deUSD support situation provides valuable insights for both developers and investors in the DeFi space. The incident underscores the importance of transparent reserve management and the dangers of over-concentration in any single platform or asset. Projects must implement more robust risk management frameworks to prevent similar cascading failures. For investors, this event reinforces the need for thorough research into reserve compositions and dependency risks. The rapid spread of problems from Stream Finance to deUSD demonstrates how quickly value can evaporate in interconnected DeFi ecosystems. Conclusion: Navigating the aftermath of deUSD suspension The Elixir suspends deUSD support decision marks a pivotal moment for decentralized finance. While the immediate focus remains on user repayments and damage control, the long-term implications will shape how synthetic assets are structured and regulated. The incident serves as both a warning and learning opportunity for the entire crypto industry. As Elixir Network continues addressing the fallout, the community watches closely to see how recovery efforts progress. The platform’s handling of this crisis will likely influence future trust in similar DeFi projects and synthetic asset offerings. Frequently Asked Questions What is Elixir Network? Elixir Network is a modular blockchain designed specifically for decentralized order book liquidity, enabling more efficient trading in DeFi ecosystems. Why did deUSD lose its peg? deUSD lost its peg because 65% of its reserve assets were tied to Stream Finance, which suffered a $93 million collapse, destroying the stablecoin’s backing. Will Elixir resume deUSD support? Currently, Elixir has suspended deUSD support indefinitely. Future decisions will depend on the resolution of the Stream Finance situation and reassessment of synthetic asset risks. How much have users lost in this incident? The Stream Finance incident resulted in approximately $93 million in total losses, though Elixir has already repaid 80% of affected deUSD holders. What happens to my deUSD tokens now? deUSD tokens have depegged to approximately 1.5 cents. Elixir is processing repayments, with 80% of holders already compensated through their recovery program. Are other stablecoins at risk? While each stablecoin has different backing mechanisms, this incident highlights the importance of understanding reserve compositions and diversification across all synthetic assets.

Persistent bearish sentiment continues to weigh on the broader crypto market, even as technical indicators point to potential consolidation. BTC faced strong resistance around a previously broken trendline on Monday, triggering an 8.18% decline through Tuesday. The selloff pushed the asset to retest the 50% retracement level near $100,353, where it found short-term support. A modest 2.35% rebound on Wednesday briefly lifted prices, but gains were largely erased the following day. As of Friday, Bitcoin hovered around $102,200, with traders assessing whether the digital asset could stabilise above key technical levels after one of its steepest weekly drops since early autumn. JPMorgan predicts Bitcoin could climb to $170,000 Despite recent weakness, JPMorgan analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. In a new research note, the bank’s strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team said they expect Bitcoin to rise as high as $170,000 within the next 6 to 12 months, citing improving market structure and fading selling pressure. The team noted that the perpetual futures market, a key driver of short-term price swings, appears to have stabilized after weeks of forced liquidations. “The message from recent stabilisation is that deleveraging in perpetual futures is largely behind us,” the note said, suggesting a shift from correction to accumulation. JPMorgan’s price target is derived from a comparative valuation model that aligns Bitcoin’s performance with that of gold. The analysts said Bitcoin’s current valuation remains below its fair value when adjusted for risk relative to the precious metal, implying room for further upside as market conditions normalise. Ethereum and XRP find support after steep drops Ethereum (ETH) also showed signs of stabilisation following a sharp midweek decline. The cryptocurrency was trading around $3,300 on Friday after falling nearly 16% earlier in the week. ETH faced rejection at its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $3,906 on Monday before sliding to test the 50% retracement level at $3,171. Although a mild rebound followed on Wednesday, the recovery stalled at a broken trendline the next day. Analysts said a sustained hold above $3,171 could open the door for a move toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around $3,593. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) continued to trade defensively near $2.22 after multiple failed attempts to break higher. The token fell 12% earlier in the week after being rejected near its 50-day EMA at $2.58. It recovered slightly midweek but again met resistance at $2.35, a key daily level. A close above $2.35 could allow XRP to retest the 50-day EMA near $2.58, though momentum remains fragile amid waning investor confidence across altcoins. Top gainers and losers Filecoin (FIL) rose about 55.96% in the past 24 hours to roughly $2.12, leading the list of top gainers. Internet Computer (ICP) gained about 27.70% over the same period, trading near $7.56 and ranking second among gainers. MYX Finance (MYX) advanced about 23.66% in 24 hours to around $2.46, placing third on the gainers’ board. Tezos (XTZ) increased about 21.88% to approximately $0.6480, taking the fourth spot among the top performers. Zcash (ZEC) climbed about 19.23% to around $597.11, rounding out the top five gainers. Among the day’s top losers, ZKsync (ZK) fell about 7.51% in 24 hours to roughly $0.06649, topping the list. Aster (ASTER) declined about 6.63% to near $1.02, ranking second among losers. DoubleZero (2Z) dropped about 6.14% to around $0.1651, placing third. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) slid about 6.01% to $7.63, taking the fourth spot among decliners.

According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the ETF adopts an approach that could automatically make it effective within twenty days if the US SEC doesn’t object. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention. 4:03 am · 7 Nov 2025 19 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies The move comes after Bitwise’s BSOL (Solana Staking ETF) started trading in late October, recording staggering $56M in trading volume and $69M inflows within the first 24 hours. Such developments reflect increasing demand from institutions and retailers interested in cryptocurrency exposure through compliant monetary vehicles. Bitwise has established itself as a pioneer of advanced cryptocurrency ETFs. As applicants move beyond the common Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, the company wants to dominate meme crypto ETFs. Keep in mind that REX-Osprey’s Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) launched last month . Meanwhile, the 8(a) filing underscores Bitwise’s confidence as issuers use these filings when expecting minimal objections from regulators. While approval isn’t a guarantee, the automatic effectiveness phrase will likely pressure the SEC to respond faster. The 8(a) filing: what is it all about? Under the SEA (Securities Exchange Act) of 1934, 8(a) forms allow companies to apply for automatic registration of specific asset classes. For exchange-traded funds, the Trust can go live if the SEC doesn’t object or intervene within 20 days. The mechanism could prove crucial, especially after the new generic listing rules softened regulations. Meanwhile, Bitwise’s 8(a) spot DOGE ETF filing reflects the firm’s conviction in no major regulatory challenges or desire to push beyond the boundaries of existing policy. If the ETF launches without the SEC’s intervention, it might set the stage for similar applications in the coming times. An approved Dogecoin ETF would offer investors exposure to the meme without directly holding the tokens. The exchange-traded fund would keep DOGE in custody while tracking its real-time price movements. Dogecoin’s mainstream journey Dogecoin launched in 2013 as an internet joke. However, it has evolved into a financial giant with a nearly $25 billion market cap. While social media hype, especially on X, has fueled DOGE’s growth in recent years, the project has continued to shed its meme identity. Dogecoin is gaining real-world utility through cryptocurrency reserves and ETFs. For instance, CleanCore plans to accumulate up to 5% of DOGE’s supply. Spot Dogecoin ETFs mark a strategic step in transforming the altcoin from a meme token to a compliant fiscal asset. DOGE price outlook The original meme token has struggled lately, down 11% on the weekly timeframe. It is trading at $0.1642 after a brief decline over the past 24 hours. Chart by CoinMarketCap Bulls should reclaim the key level at $0.1884 to shift DOGE’s short-term trajectory to the upside. That’s a roughly 13% increase from the market price.

An Expert Analyst Responds,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-caused-bitcoins-recent-price-drop-an-expert-analyst-responds/,"The cryptocurrency market came under severe selling pressure in the first week of November, with the outlook weakening. As October's volatile run continues, Bitcoin fell nearly 21% from its recent high to $99,000 on Tuesday. While BTC soon returned above the psychological $100,000 threshold, experts believe the crypto market's extraordinary rally may be over for a while. The declines in Bitcoin and altcoins over the past week are particularly striking. Today, Bitcoin rebounded slightly to just below $101,000, but it's still down about 5% on a weekly basis. Ethereum fell 12% to below $3,372 during the same period, while Solana fell 19% to below $158. While Bitcoin advocates tout the asset as a “gold-like independent store of value,” its price movements are also aligned with global economic conditions. Last week's cryptocurrency market weakness coincided with uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future policy and a decline in the S&P 500. Related News: Surprising Statements from Ripple (XRP) CEO Brad Garlinghouse: “In 2026...” Jasper De Maere, OTC trader at Wintermute, noted that the current weakness is a “combination of the October 10 crash, a slightly more hawkish tone from the Fed, and a general risk-off trend.” Recent statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have also dampened the crypto market. Powell said the October interest rate cut could be the last of the year, noting that committee members have “differing views” on the future. Bitcoin and Ethereum retreated 1.6% and 2%, respectively, in the 24 hours following Powell's remarks. Some analysts believe the crypto market weakness could persist for some time. “Many long-term investors who believe in the four-year cycle theory are selling positions, convinced the cycle has peaked,” said James Butterfill, research director at CoinShares. *This is not investment advice.

The study notes that Polymarket was not itself responsible for wash trading, while the crypto-based structure could have enabled it. In 2024, concerns over wash trading and potential market manipulation plagued the decentralized prediction platform. At the time, researchers noted that a “significant portion” of the virtual market’s activity might stem from wash trading. Wash trading is a tactic where shares are repeatedly bought and sold to give the impression of higher trading volume. The volume of activity on Polymarket has been significantly inflated by so-called wash trading in which users rapidly buy and sell the same contracts, according to a new study by Columbia University researchers https://t.co/kWTEDPn6IS — Bloomberg (@business) November 7, 2025 Key Findings: Artificial Trading Skews Polymarket’s True Activity The study says that the phenomenon referred to as “artificial trading” has accounted for nearly 25% of all buy and sell transactions on Polymarket over the last three years. A Polymarket representative told Bloomberg on Friday that the predictions market is reviewing the study and has no immediate comment. Per the researchers’ algorithm split up, the prevalence of wash trade was found to be 45% of all-time volume in sports markets, 17% in election markets, 12% in politics markets, and 3% in crypto markets. “I’m hopeful that Polymarket will welcome the analysis in our paper,” Yash Kanoria, a professor at Columbia University’s business school and co-author, told Bloomberg . “Wash trading doesn’t add liquidity or information to the market, so it would seem valuable to distinguish authentic from inauthentic volume.” The prediction market hit record highs in October for volume, active traders, and new market launches, led by the native token launch . Polymarket trading volume reached an unprecedented $2.59 billion high in October. The platform recently announced securing $205 million across two previously undisclosed funding rounds, between 2024 and 2025, valuing the firm at $1.2 billion. Polymarket Accuracy and Indicators of Credibility According to independent tracking, Polymarket is more than 95% accurate in the closing hours of a market. In a detailed analysis , Cryptonews author Eric Huffman notes that Polymarket is legit and legal in many leading markets worldwide. The platform’s top rival Kalshi, achieved a monthly trading volume record, breaking above $4.39B in October. According to data collected by Dune Analytics , Kalshi and Polymarket saw notional trading volume rise above $2 billion for the first time during the week ending Oct. 19. In the U.S., the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) labeled Polymarket’s prediction markets as “binary options,” which can only be offered by a registered exchange. This resulted in a $1.4 million civil penalty for Polymarket and forced the platform to restrict access to U.S. users.

54121268,622376,1762495201,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54121268.jpeg,"21,595 New XRP Wallets Created In 48 Hours: Highest In 8 Months",https://bitcoinist.com/21595-new-xrp-wallets-48-hours-highest-in-8-months/,"On-chain data shows XRP has witnessed a huge wave of wallet creation recently, indicating an influx of users has occurred on the network. XRP Network Growth Metric Has Spiked Recently According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment , XRP has seen a huge spike in its Network Growth recently. This indicator keeps track of the daily total amount of addresses coming online on the blockchain for the first time. A wallet is “online” on the network when it participates in some kind of transaction activity. As such, the addresses coming online for the first time would be those making their first transaction. When the value of the Network Growth is high, it means a large number of addresses are joining the network. Such a trend can arise due to a number of reasons. New investors coming into the market and old ones who had sold earlier, making a return, both contribute to a rise in the metric. Similarly, existing users creating multiple wallets for a purpose like privacy also naturally contribute to the indicator’s growth. In general, an uptick in the metric involves all of these factors simultaneously to some degree, meaning that whenever its value is high, some net adoption of the asset can be assumed to be occurring. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Network Growth over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Network Growth has observed a huge spike recently, implying a large number of new addresses have been created on the blockchain. This uptick in wallet generation came alongside the crash in the asset’s price. In total, 21,595 new addresses made their first transaction for the first time in a 48-hour span, the highest level in 8 months. Given the timing of the spike, it’s possible that new investors are swooping in to buy the XRP dip. The last time retail adoption occurred at a similar rate was in July. Back then, retail FOMO coincided with a top in the cryptocurrency’s price. This time around, the asset has actually seen a rebound since the spike occurred, so it only remains to be seen whether the trend will continue. XRP Price Has Made Some Recovery Bearish winds have calmed a bit for XRP as its price has climbed back to the $2.3 level from its low on Tuesday. Though on the weekly timeframe, the coin is still down more than 10%. Interestingly, the low around $2 during the market crash was right at the lower level of the consolidation channel highlighted by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post . Sharing the chart, the analyst had noted that this $2 lower level could be where XRP can find support. So far, it appears that the line has been holding up.",XRP|XRP Addresses|XRP Adoption|XRP Network Growth|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 06:00:01

Crypto market expert Tara has emphasized that this ongoing retracement sets the foundation for Bitcoin’s next major bottom. Her analysis points to a potential Wave 5 correction that could drive the BTC price as low as $94,000 before the next major bullish trend begins. Bitcoin Price Eyes Recovery After Wave 5 Retracement In a technical analysis shared on X social media, Tara disclosed that Bitcoin’s latest price correction “is probably one of the most important retraces it will have in a long time.” She views the decline as an essential process that prepares the leading cryptocurrency for a strong rebound in the future. Based on her Elliott Wave analysis, there are only two waves left before the broader market shift begins. Related Reading: Analyst’s Full Market Breakdown Shows Why Bitcoin Price Is Headed For $120,000 The analyst notes that the primary reason the Bitcoin price crash is important is that it allows the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to recover, creating ideal conditions for a Bullish Divergence. Subsequently, this divergence could establish a solid bottom for BTC, which is a critical signal for the start of a renewed uptrend. In her chart, Tara identifies a key Fibonacci Retracement zone between $103,400 and $104,900 as the resistance range for its current wave. The 0.382 Fib level is located near $103,478, where the Bitcoin price intersects with the Moving Average (MA), while the 0.5 Fib level aligns with $104,943. The analyst notes that this range could act as a crucial pivot zone before BTC resumes its correction in the final Wave 5 down to $94,000. Additionally, the chart shows that Bitcoin is currently retracing from a previous low near the 0.618 Fibonacci Extension around $103,755.79. Trading volume has also declined by over 48% in the past 24 hours, while RSI remains weak at 33.96, signaling that the market is still oversold. Why The Path To $94,000 Matters For The Next Bull Cycle In responding to questions from crypto community members under her X post, Tara clarified that Bitcoin could first rise to $104,000, representing a 0.97% increase from current levels above $103,000, before crashing 9.6% to $94,000. She expects a price bottom to occur quickly and soon, whereas it may take longer for Bitcoin to build solid support before reversing into a new bullish phase. Related Reading: Here’s What Happened The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Closed October In The Red Tara stated that the ongoing retracement could peak around the day of her analysis, but the bottom might take a few more days to form. Despite the anticipated “pain,” she reassured market watchers that the correction is necessary for Bitcoin’s next leg higher. She also emphasized that the market may not feel bullish until mid-December 2025.

54121295,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88885,1762495333,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,GTreasury CEO Says XRP Major Use Case Out Loud,https://timestabloid.com/gtreasury-ceo-says-xrp-major-use-case-out-loud/,"XRP enthusiast Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) recently posted a video from Ripple’s Swell conference where GTreasury CEO Renaat Ver Eecke described a challenge facing many of his clients: the need to move large sums of money quickly and affordably. Speaking about conversations with enterprise clients, he explained that one executive admitted to being “too scared about crypto.” Ver Eecke said he responded by suggesting a product that could move money within minutes. The executive then noted he had subsidiaries in Europe holding $50 million in reserve due to settlement delays of several days, saying he could free that cash and generate yield if faster movement were possible. The @GTreasury CEO Renaat Ver Eecke at @ripple Swell says his clients have a problem. They need to be able to move $50 million+ in a fast and inexpensive way. They may want to put @bgarlinghouse best friend @arrington on the phone with them. XRP solves this. You know where… pic.twitter.com/VqOIVU22nu — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) November 5, 2025 XRP as a Solution for High-Value Transactions Digital Asset Investor attached a separate clip of Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital, discussing a prior transaction executed with XRP. Arrington recounted moving over $50 million with XRP in 2 seconds for $0.3 . He added that the process “fills a big need” for institutions and compared it to traditional financial systems that can take days and charge higher fees for similar transfers. His comments reinforced XRP’s established reputation for speed and low transaction cost, an aspect that continues to attract institutional interest. Arrington explained that when limited partners eventually request redemptions, “we just send it in XRP again,” emphasizing the efficiency of cross-border settlements without traditional wire delays. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Connecting Institutional Needs and Blockchain Efficiency Ver Eecke’s remarks aligned with a growing recognition among corporates that slow settlements limit access to liquidity. Many large organizations continue to hold substantial idle balances in different regions to mitigate payment delays, a practice that can reduce yield opportunities and tie up operational capital. The comments from the video highlighted a persistent issue in corporate treasury management, a liquidity trapped in waiting periods and settlement lags. GTreasury’s role in solving these inefficiencies has expanded since its planned $1 billion acquisition by Ripple, which aims to integrate blockchain technology with traditional treasury operations. For GTreasury, whose clients manage billions across multiple jurisdictions, the ability to move funds of $50 million or more within seconds would mark a significant shift from traditional payment rails. If Ripple’s integration with GTreasury’s systems succeeds, it could enable institutions to deploy cash more dynamically and introduce XRP as a solution to many financial problems worldwide.

Miran said neither an aggressive interest rate cut was necessary nor was there a need to make up for steps not taken in the past. Miran said, “There's no need for a 75 basis point interest rate cut. Similarly, I don't see a need to make up for the inadequacy of previous cuts.” Related News: Three Top-Level FED Officials Made Critical Statements About the US Economy Miran, noting that there are differing opinions within the Fed regarding the magnitude of interest rate cuts, stated that he wants to reach neutral interest rates with 50 basis point steps, while many of his colleagues prefer gradual cuts of 25 basis points. Miran used cautious language when stating that a rate cut in December was highly likely. Speaking to the Monetary Matters podcast, he said: “Unless there are any surprises, I expect we will cut interest rates in December. The distribution of votes on the table is actually different from the distribution of opinion. Therefore, based on current information, I anticipate a rate cut in December, but nothing is a 100% guarantee.” *This is not investment advice.
