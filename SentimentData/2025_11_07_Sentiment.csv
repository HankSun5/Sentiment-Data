Here’s why this move favors a bullish Solana price prediction . Forward Industries is, by far, the most influential treasury company in the world for Solana, with total holdings of 6.8 million tokens worth approximately $1 billion at the time of writing. Breaking news from our team The Forward Industries Board authorized, on November 3, 2025, a share repurchase program permitting Forward Industries to repurchase up to $1 billion of its common stock. Get the full press release below pic.twitter.com/rqsDDRGp54 — Forward Industries $FORD (@FWDind) November 4, 2025 Earlier, the firm announced a $1 billion buyback program for its stock that will be progressively executed through at-the-market offerings and block trades. Since Forward Industries has made its Solana investments its core mission, this move increases shareholders’ value as it ramps up the number of tokens that each share represents. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Is On a Downtrend But Has Hit a Key Support Already In the past 30 days, SOL has lost 31.8% of its value as market sentiment soured following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff increase on Chinese imported goods. The daily chart shows that Solana has been on a downtrend since late September, making a series of lower highs and lower lows along the way to form a descending price channel. However, the token just hit the channel’s lower bound, favoring an upcoming bounce. The token also broke below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory. For SOL to recover, it would have to break out of this price channel. Ideally, it would have to move above $180 first to confirm a trend reversal. If that happens, Solana could rise to $200 soon and possibly beyond as institutional interest remains strong. Forward Industries’ recent moves highlight how Wall Street is waking up to the potential of altcoins like Solana and the tech powering them. One early-stage project capitalizing on this shift is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a new crypto presale building the first high-speed Bitcoin Layer-2 on Solana. By using Solana’s lightning-fast network, HYPER aims to fix Bitcoin’s biggest limitations – slow speeds, high fees, and lack of programmability – while unlocking access to trading, staking, and DeFi. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $26M to Kickstart a New Era for Bitcoin BTC holders have been unable to earn yield on their investment for years, as the network’s design can’t cope with the speed that DeFi applications need. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) solves this by launching the first true Bitcoin L2 with the help of the Solana blockchain to allow developers to launch yield-farming, staking, payments, and other decentralized apps. The Hyper Bridge was created to receive BTC tokens safely on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2. Once in there, investors can use any of these dApps without having to leave the Bitcoin ecosystem. Analysts believe that, once the solution becomes widely adopted by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for $HYPER should skyrocket. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up your favorite wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

Analyst Gives Date,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/when-will-bitcoin-btc-price-recover-analyst-gives-date/,"As the pullback in Bitcoin (BTC) price creates a cautious atmosphere in the market, cryptocurrency analyst Colin Talks Crypto has assessed multiple indicators that he argues point to a possible bullish reversal towards mid-November. According to the analyst, a potential recovery in Bitcoin is supported by several technical and macro factors, saying: Colin Talks Crypto predicts the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 200-day SMA will cross around mid-November. He noted that in past cycles, this crossover has often signaled local bottoms, suggesting this technical signal carries a strong possibility of a reversal. Related News: Three Top-Level FED Officials Made Critical Statements About the US Economy According to the analyst, gold's price action is a leading indicator for Bitcoin. He stated that the upward trend in gold could create similar upward momentum for BTC. Colin Talks Crypto argued that even as Bitcoin surged to $126,000, classic cyclical indicators showed no signs of “overheating” or overly optimistic market sentiment, suggesting the bullish cycle may not have peaked yet. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's announcement that the balance sheet contraction program (QT) will end on December 1st strengthens the possibility of a new period of liquidity, according to analysts.

The potential US government shutdown resolution could significantly impact digital asset markets that have been struggling with volatility. How Does Market Uncertainty Affect Crypto Investments? Market uncertainty creates hesitation among both institutional and retail investors. When political deadlocks occur, trading volumes typically decrease as participants wait for clearer signals. Glassnode’s experts note that this particular period of market uncertainty has been especially challenging for cryptocurrency recovery. The connection between traditional finance and crypto markets means political stability matters more than many realize. As Negentropic, the shared account of Glassnode co-founders, emphasized on X: markets thrive on clarity . This fundamental truth explains why reducing market uncertainty becomes crucial for sustainable growth. What’s Driving the Shutdown Resolution Efforts? Senator John Thune’s push for a vote signals serious progress toward ending the political standoff. Key developments include: Senate Republicans preparing to work through the weekend Bipartisan negotiations gaining momentum Growing recognition of economic consequences This determined approach suggests lawmakers understand how market uncertainty affects broader economic conditions. The resolution timing becomes particularly important for cryptocurrency markets approaching critical technical levels. Why Should Crypto Traders Monitor Political Developments? Political decisions directly influence investor sentiment and capital flows. The current market uncertainty stems from not knowing how government operations might affect: Regulatory clarity for digital assets Institutional investment decisions Macroeconomic policy directions Glassnode’s tracking of on-chain data shows how periods of market uncertainty correlate with reduced network activity and trading volumes. Resolving the shutdown could reverse these trends quickly. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? Reduced market uncertainty typically benefits risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Historical patterns suggest that when political clarity emerges, we often see: Increased institutional positioning Retail investor confidence returning Improved liquidity conditions The current situation reminds us that market uncertainty, while challenging, often creates opportunities for prepared investors. Monitoring Glassnode’s analysis and on-chain metrics can help navigate these transitions effectively. Conclusion: Clarity Brings Opportunity The potential resolution of the US government shutdown represents more than just political progress—it signals reducing market uncertainty that has constrained cryptocurrency markets. As Glassnode’s analysis highlights, markets function best with clear operating environments. For crypto investors, this development could mark the beginning of a more favorable period for digital asset appreciation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions How does a government shutdown affect cryptocurrency markets? Government shutdowns create market uncertainty that reduces investor confidence across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This typically leads to lower trading volumes and increased volatility. Why is Glassnode’s analysis important for crypto investors? Glassnode provides crucial on-chain data and market insights that help investors understand underlying market conditions beyond price movements alone. What happens to crypto markets when political uncertainty decreases? Reduced political uncertainty generally leads to improved market sentiment, increased trading activity, and often higher prices for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. How quickly might markets react to a shutdown resolution? Cryptocurrency markets typically react quickly to political developments, with price movements often occurring within hours of significant announcements. Should investors change their strategy during periods of market uncertainty? While every investor’s situation differs, many experts recommend maintaining long-term strategies while potentially using volatility to accumulate positions at favorable prices. What other factors should crypto investors watch alongside political developments? Investors should monitor regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data, technological developments, and on-chain metrics alongside political news. Found this analysis helpful?

Wednesday trading saw the meme coin log just 94 billion tokens in exchange flows, roughly $850,000 worth of activity for a token boasting a $5.3 billion market cap. SHIB Exchange Netflow. Source: CryptoQuant . This flatline in wallet-to-exchange transfers signals a deep market hesitation. Stagnation like this has historically been associated with one of two outcomes: a gradual decline as interest fades, or a quiet accumulation phase that sets up for a rebound. The muted flow data reflects a lack of conviction on both sides of the market, likely tied to FUD surrounding the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and renewed fears of slowing economic growth. For any decisive Shiba Inu price action beyond the current multi-month bleed, traders will need to watch for major catalysts like ecosystem updates or broader shifts in risk sentiment. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: What’s Next for SHIB? Shiba Inu’s prolonged consolidation phase continues, with the meme coin locked within a six-month descending channel now retesting its lower boundary as support. This creates a decisive moment for the wider Shiba Inu price direction; the slow bleed could escalate into a free fall. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView. A recent RSI bounce from the 30 oversold threshold has already stalled, reflecting a lack of buying conviction, while the MACD histogram widens below the signal line, confirming persistent sell-side dominance. All eyes remain on the $0.0000085 level, the final structural barrier before a potential channel breakdown. Should this level fail, a retest of the $0.0000067 demand zone 25% lower looks likely. Still, a rebound in momentum could spark a reversal. Regaining the $0.000012 zone would position SHIB for a potential breakout move, targeting $0.000024, a 170% rally if broader sentiment improves. Maxi Doge: The Token That Could Step Up as SHIB Struggles Meme coin rotations are as consistent as they are powerful. When one market leader hits a ceiling, capital naturally flows to the next high-upside contender. That dynamic is now playing out between Shiba Inu and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an early Doge-themed token gaining traction just as SHIB grapples with liquidity issues. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised nearly $4 million, while early backers are earning up to 78% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed out on the Doge wave before, MaxiDoge could be the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

Data shows that whales have been accumulating vast amounts of ETH within a short window. The accumulation coincides with Ethereum recording a new network throughput milestone, which adds further strength to the argument that the cryptocurrency is still solid even during the price weakness. Whales Scoop Up $1.12 Billion Worth Of ETH In 48 Hours Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain shows that some Ethereum whale addresses have accumulated a combined 323,523 ETH, valued at approximately $1.12 billion, within the past 48-hour period. One of the biggest purchases came from a whale who bought 257,543 ETH, worth about $896 million, at an average price of $3,480 per ETH. Another cluster of addresses, referred to as the “seven siblings” by Lookonchain, collectively added 37,971 ETH worth $133 million at an average price of $3,515. The data also revealed participation from a whale known for swing trading Ethereum through over-the-counter deals, who acquired 14,004 ETH for about $45.5 million. This address bought these ETH at an average price of $3,247, which was exactly around the recent price low. Two newly created wallets also bought 10,000 ETH and 4,005 ETH, respectively, totaling more than $47 million combined. In total, whales accumulated 323,523 ETH at an average price of $3,469, showing how most of them are capitalizing on the price break below $3,400. Price Weakness Might Be Setting Stage For Breakout Although Ethereum’s drop might have unsettled some traders, the whale accumulation might be pointing to optimistic days ahead. The large-scale accumulation below $3,400 has contributed to the successful defense of $3,200. This follows the trend of accumulation leading to maintenance of support levels. If ETH maintains stability above $3,200 support and on-chain activity continues to climb, then the price could rebound above $4,000 before the end of the month. The first step, however, in this is for Ethereum to reclaim $3,800 and register a strong weekly close above the level. Interestingly, Ethereum’s network performance has maintained its level of robustness despite the market’s correction. The blockchain ecosystem recently achieved a new record throughput of 24,192 transactions per second (TPS), setting a new benchmark for activity across the network.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Whales|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Lookonchain|tps|Transactions Per Second,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 23:00:21

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst According to Crypto Onchain, Bitcoin hit an intraday low of $98,900 before buyers pushed the price back above $101,000 and later to $103,400 at the time of writing. The top coin’s year-to-date gain sits at close to 10% after peaking at an all-time high of $126,300 in October. Bears Break $107,000 Fortress Based on analysis from Crypto Onchain and on-chain data provider CryptoQuant, Bitcoin lost the $107,000 support after roughly 130 days of trading in a band between that level and $123,000. The move sparked heavy liquidations in the futures market. About $640 million in long positions were wiped out over a 24-hour stretch. That figure, market watchers say, is the second-largest daily long liquidation event since June 2021. The October 10 event remains the largest on record for comparison. The $101,000 level has taken on extra meaning. Traders point out that bulls stepped in near $98,000 and pushed the market back toward the lower trendline of a long-term ascending channel that has held since October 2023. Reports have disclosed that defending this channel bottom would be read as a bullish sign, while a close below it could signal deeper losses and a break in the market structure that has supported the rally. CME Gap Could Pull Price Lower A nearby gap on the CME futures chart sits between $92,000 and $93,000, roughly 10% from current prices, and some analysts are watching that area closely. Historically, Bitcoin has often filled such gaps before resuming its next leg up, and the gap is now a possible target if bearish pressure continues. At the same time, strong buying interest around the $101,000 zone could halt any slide and force prices back up. Liquidations And Market Mood The cascade of liquidations amplified selling pressure, particularly among highly leveraged traders. Futures positions were forcefully closed, and this intensified the intraday drop. Yet buyers were quick to take advantage of the lower levels, and the rebound to $103,000 level showed a degree of demand at current prices. Volume and near-term momentum will be key in determining whether that demand is durable.

Broader moves in US equities and large trader activity are also being monitored, since they helped trigger the recent pullback.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ended its five‑year lawsuit against Ripple back in August, clearing a major weight off the company. Then this Wednesday in San Francisco, investors tied to Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities put $500 million into Ripple, valuing the company at $40 billion, according to Bloomberg. The timing was almost rude. The new valuation plus a roughly 9% rise in XRP this year pushed Chris into billionaire territory with a net worth of $15.3 billion, placing him among the world’s richest for the first time. Most of that wealth comes from his 18% stake in Ripple and his 2.7 billion XRP tokens worth about $6.3 billion as of Wednesday. He also holds $1.8 billion in real estate and assorted investments. That breakdown was confirmed directly to Bloomberg. Born in San Francisco and raised in Cupertino, Chris is 64, and has been building companies since the 1990s, long before crypto existed. He went to San Jose State at first to study aeronautics. Chris switched to business, transferred to San Francisco State, and graduated with accounting and business administration degrees in 1984. He then worked as an auditor at Chevron before earning an MBA from Stanford. Building companies and building wealth The first time Chris made real noise was in 1996 when he co‑founded E‑Loan, the first platform to show consumer credit scores online. He sold it nine years later to Popular Inc. for $300 million. After that, he created Prosper Marketplace, a group‑lending platform partly inspired by his wife’s background in Cambodia. He stepped away from Prosper in 2012. A few months later, he co‑founded OpenCoin, which became Ripple. The company focused on cross‑border payments using XRP. Chris led it as CEO until 2016, then moved into the chairman role. His work now also stretches into local issues. With his wife, Lyna Lam, he supports Cambodian community projects, climate efforts, food access, and San Francisco’s neighborhood revival. The pair founded the A Khmer Buddhist Foundation and are helping fund a new temple in San Jose. Locally, Chris has been politically active for years. He funded a private camera network in San Francisco to combat property crime and recently gave $9.4 million to help the city build a real‑time police operations center. Ripple, meanwhile, is not going public anytime soon, as was reported by Cryptopolitan. When asked Wednesday, Ripple President Monica Long said, “No plan, no timeline.” Crypto markets shake while fortunes shift While Chris climbs the billionaire rankings, crypto trading is showing the opposite energy. On Hyperliquid, one wallet opened two heavy short positions against Bitcoin and XRP totaling $140 million. That trader is now up $3.1 million in about nine hours. The wallet was funded with $7 million USDC routed through an Arbitrum wallet that redeemed from a zero address, making the source hard to trace. Observers are already speculating insider knowledge. This reminds traders of the alleged “Trump insider whale” who reportedly made almost $200 million by shorting before the $19 billion liquidation crash on October 10. Someone linked to that wallet denied having inside info, even though the shorts lined up exactly before former President Trump’s tariff threat tanked markets. Bitcoin has been sliding. It dropped 7.4% on Tuesday in New York to $96,794, its first fall below $100,000 since June. That puts it more than 20% below last month’s record high. Ether dropped up to 15%, and several altcoins lost 50% this year. Many traders stayed sidelined after the October liquidation wave. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is still low. Even though funding rates look favorable, few are stepping back in. Bitcoin is up less than 10% this year, trailing stocks and failing to hedge portfolios.

A PwC and AIMA survey shows 55% of global hedge funds now hold crypto, while Spain’s ITER plans to sell $10M in Bitcoin bought for $10K. Meanwhile, Robinhood considers adding BTC to its treasury, signaling rising corporate adoption even as technical charts hint at a $100K support retest. Hedge Funds Expand Crypto Exposure as Institutional Interest Deepens A growing share of hedge funds is now venturing into digital assets. According to a joint report by PwC and the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), 55% of global hedge funds currently hold cryptocurrency-related investments, up from 47% a year ago. The survey of 122 funds found that while participation is expanding, most allocate less than 2% of their portfolios to crypto, averaging around 7%. The rise coincides with clearer U.S. regulatory guidance under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has encouraged broader institutional participation. More than half of hedge funds invested in crypto, global survey says https://t.co/Nds7ZH5fVT — The Globe and Mail (@globeandmail) November 6, 2025 Even after October’s leveraged “flash crash”, 67% of hedge funds reported using crypto futures for exposure — underscoring continued confidence in digital assets. With hedge fund capital at a record $5 trillion, increasing participation highlights a growing belief that BTC and blockchain-based investments are becoming a permanent fixture in global finance. Spanish Research Institute to Sell $10M Bitcoin Bought for $10K in 2012 In Spain, the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER) plans to sell 97 Bitcoin, originally purchased for under $10,000 in 2012 as part of a blockchain research initiative. Those holdings are now worth over $10 million. The Tenerife Island Council, which oversees ITER, confirmed that it’s coordinating the sale through a bank authorized by the Bank of Spain and CNMV. Proceeds will be reinvested into quantum research and other technology projects.

However, the sale underscores how public institutions are becoming more comfortable managing digital assets — even as European banks remain cautious. The move also highlights BTC’s extraordinary long-term return potential, offering a case study for other public entities exploring crypto-backed financing. Robinhood Considers Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) may soon join the list of corporate Bitcoin holders. CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed the company is “still evaluating” whether to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury after a surge in crypto-related income. During the firm’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Tenev noted that holding BTC could deepen the firm’s connection to the crypto economy but would also commit a portion of company reserves. The company’s crypto trading revenue jumped 339% year over year, reaching $268 million, or nearly 20% of total income.

If Robinhood follows through, it would join MicroStrategy and Metaplanet in using Bitcoin as a treasury asset, a move likely to strengthen institutional trust and reinforce BTC’s demand base. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Nears $100K Support as Downtrend Deepens Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $101,300, continuing its pullback after failing to hold above $104,400. The price remains confined within a descending triangle, a pattern that typically signals continued weakness unless buyers step in at key support levels. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to form lower highs, while the 20-EMA has crossed below the 50-EMA, confirming short-term bearish control. A clean break below $100,400 could trigger a measured move toward $97,600, a level aligning with the previous swing low from late October. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI, hovering near 32, shows fading momentum but hasn’t yet flashed a strong reversal signal. Recent candles — including several spinning tops followed by a bearish engulfing pattern — suggest indecision before another potential dip. If BTC rebounds from the $100K region, a breakout above $103,700 could reverse the structure and open upside targets at $106,300 and $111,000. For now, traders may favor short setups toward $97,600, keeping stops above $103,700. While near-term sentiment leans bearish, the broader uptrend remains intact. This correction could provide long-term investors a valuable accumulation window ahead of renewed institutional flows and improving macro conditions. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed. Built as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it merges Bitcoin’s stability with Solana’s high-performance framework. The result: lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation, all secured by Bitcoin. Audited by Consult , the project emphasizes trust and scalability as adoption builds. And momentum is already strong. The presale has surpassed $25.9 million, with tokens priced at just $0.013225 before the next increase. As Bitcoin activity climbs and demand for efficient BTC-based apps rises, Bitcoin Hyper stands out as the bridge uniting two of crypto’s biggest ecosystems.

A revolutionary Dogecoin spot ETF could become reality in just 20 days, according to recent developments. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that Bitwise is using an innovative approach that might fast-track approval for this groundbreaking financial product. What Makes This Dogecoin Spot ETF Different? Bitwise confirmed they’re utilizing the SEC’s 8(a) procedure for their Dogecoin spot ETF application. This non-standard listing method removes the “delaying amendment” from the S-1 application. Consequently, the filing automatically becomes effective after 20 days unless the SEC takes separate action to delay it. The traditional ETF approval process typically involves extensive review periods and potential delays. However, this Dogecoin spot ETF application bypasses much of that bureaucracy. Here’s what makes this approach unique: Automatic effectiveness after 20 days No formal SEC approval required SEC must actively intervene to delay Streamlined regulatory process Why Should Investors Care About This Development? This potential Dogecoin spot ETF represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency adoption. Mainstream investors who have been hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges could finally access Dogecoin through traditional brokerage accounts. Moreover, institutional participation might increase substantially. The timing couldn’t be more crucial. As cryptocurrency markets mature, regulated investment products become increasingly important. This Dogecoin spot ETF could open doors for: Retirement account investments Institutional portfolio allocation Simplified tax reporting Enhanced security measures What Challenges Remain for This Dogecoin ETF? Despite the optimistic timeline, potential hurdles still exist. The SEC maintains authority to intervene during the 20-day window. Regulatory concerns about market manipulation and investor protection could prompt commissioners to delay the process. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s volatility might concern regulators. However, the growing acceptance of digital assets suggests that a Dogecoin spot ETF approval aligns with broader financial trends. The market has been eagerly awaiting such products since Bitcoin ETF approvals paved the way. How Will This Impact the Crypto Market? Successful launch of a Dogecoin spot ETF could trigger significant market movements. Other meme coins might see increased attention, while established cryptocurrencies could benefit from renewed investor interest. The approval would validate Dogecoin’s position in the digital asset ecosystem. Furthermore, this development might accelerate similar applications for other cryptocurrencies. The streamlined 8(a) procedure could become a model for future crypto ETF filings, potentially transforming how digital assets enter traditional markets. Final Thoughts on This Groundbreaking Development The potential 20-day timeline for Bitwise’s Dogecoin spot ETF represents a revolutionary approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This method demonstrates how financial innovation can adapt existing frameworks to accommodate emerging asset classes. While uncertainties remain, the prospect of accessible Dogecoin investment through regulated channels marks significant progress for the entire crypto industry. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 8(a) procedure for ETF approval? The 8(a) procedure allows ETF filings to automatically become effective after a set period unless regulators take separate action to delay them. How long until the Dogecoin spot ETF becomes effective? If the SEC doesn’t intervene, the Dogecoin spot ETF could become effective in 20 days from the filing date. Can the SEC stop this Dogecoin ETF approval? Yes, the SEC can take separate action to delay or prevent the ETF from becoming effective during the 20-day window. What makes this Dogecoin ETF different from Bitcoin ETFs? This represents one of the first meme cryptocurrency ETFs and uses a different approval process than most Bitcoin ETFs. How can investors participate in this Dogecoin ETF? Once effective, investors can purchase shares through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to other ETFs. What risks should investors consider? Investors should consider cryptocurrency volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and market risks before investing. Found this information valuable?

The privacy coin’s explosive rally was accompanied by a shielded supply reaching all-time highs, around 16 million ZEC, representing over 76% of the max supply. Technical analysis reveals that an ascending trendline support is guiding the advance, with Fibonacci extensions projecting potential targets at the $1,669 and $3,428 levels. Privacy Coin Revival Amid Surveillance Concerns Only 17 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posted gains over the past 90 days, with privacy coins ZEC, XMR, DASH, and DCR leading the sector’s performance. Source: CoinMarketCap Zcash jumped from $50 to over $130 in early October , reaching its highest levels since April 2022, despite remaining 96% below its all-time high of $3,193 in 2016. Trading volume surged by nearly 6% today to $1.6 billion, while shielded transactions increased by over 60% month-over-month. Market participants attributed momentum to renewed interest in zk-SNARKs, the zero-knowledge proof system that enables transaction verification without disclosing sender, recipient, or amount details. The technology allows optional privacy, appealing to users facing tightening oversight. Naval Ravikant described Bitcoin as “insurance against fiat” and Zcash as “insurance against Bitcoin,” suggesting that ZEC offers protection against the transparent nature of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is insurance against fiat. ZCash is insurance against Bitcoin. https://t.co/rqMrR3bW7O — Naval (@naval) October 1, 2025 During that same period, Grayscale announced the opening of Zcash Trust private placement, providing accredited investors with exposure through a structure similar to its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The announcement lifted confidence as the ZEC market cap rose from $700 million to over $1.8 billion. Currently, the market capitalization sits close to $9 billion. However, there has been a major regulatory concern, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation, which will take effect in 2027, explicitly bans privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. Article 79 prohibits banks and crypto service providers from handling anonymity-enhanced tokens, including Monero and Zcash, as well as anonymous accounts. Fibonacci Extensions Target $1,669 Following Trendline Respect ZEC trades at $542 with 29.67% weekly gains following an ascending channel advance from September lows. The trendline framework shows consistently higher lows while maintaining an upward trajectory, representing textbook uptrend characteristics. Source: X/@eliz883 Using the Fibonacci extension methodology, some analysts project potential resistance levels at $1,669 (3.618 Fibonacci extension) and $3,428 (4.236 extension). The current positioning at a 2.618 extension around $521 already represents a substantial achievement, as major corrections historically begin. Looking at the 15-minute timeframe, consolidation appears near the upper boundary after multiple successful lower trendline support tests. Long wicks indicate that selling pressure is emerging at current levels, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback before a continuation. Volume characteristics support technical levels with real liquidity, making price action more readable and reactions maintain continuity. ZEC’s inclusion among the top cryptocurrencies provides even more liquidity opportunities to validate technical analysis. Currently, ZEC’s next trajectory depends on maintaining the current ascending trendline support, which is around $480-$490, while challenging the $550-$600 resistance. Breaks above $600 with volume confirmation could trigger momentum toward $1,000 psychological level, while trendline violations would signal a correction toward $350-400, invalidating bullish structure.

The company made the announcement Thursday, saying it has formed a new group, the MAI Superintelligence Team under Mustafa Suleyman, who now leads Microsoft’s AI division. The goal is not just to match human intelligence with machines, but to push way beyond it. According to Bloomberg, the company now wants to create AI systems that can outperform humans across every field, including health care, clean energy, and materials science. Mustafa said in a blog post that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is when AI can do anything a human can. But he added that superintelligence goes “far beyond that performance.” He said the new mission is to build what he calls Humanist Superintelligence, a system designed to serve people directly rather than chasing tech milestones. He named personal AI assistants, better medical outcomes, and sustainable energy solutions as real-world targets. The company previously wasn’t allowed to chase AGI, based on a restriction from its original deal with OpenAI, but that clause is now gone. Microsoft forms new team after scrapping AI restriction The updated contract between Microsoft and OpenAI removed the restriction that had kept Microsoft boxed into less powerful models. The new agreement also gives the tech company a 27% stake in OpenAI’s public-benefit company, letting it now work independently on AGI and more advanced tools. The changes come as the two firms shift from full collaboration to what looks more like strategic rivalry. Mustafa, who’s 41 years old, joined Microsoft in 2024 after leaving Inflection AI, a startup he co-founded. Microsoft licensed Inflection’s intellectual property and brought him on board to help shape its future in AI. Since then, Mustafa has reorganized internal teams, moved key Microsoft AI staff into the new group, and hired people from Google’s DeepMind, which he also helped start. Mustafa told employees in September that Microsoft plans to spend big to build out its AI systems. So far, those models are still smaller than the biggest ones coming from OpenAI or Google, but the goal is to catch up fast. He said their timeline extends to 2032, the year when Microsoft’s rights to use OpenAI’s models expire. Microsoft and OpenAI now compete on multiple fronts While Microsoft still leans on OpenAI to power its Copilot chatbot, it’s also building its own voice, image, and text models. That means Microsoft is trying to reduce its dependence on OpenAI, even as the two remain deeply connected. Still, some Microsoft employees allegedly told The Wall Street Journal that replacing OpenAI’s technology could take years. The consumer Copilot app, which runs on OpenAI’s models, still beats Microsoft’s version in downloads. OpenAI, meanwhile, is working with Microsoft’s rivals, including Amazon and Oracle, and building out its own data centers. The company’s enterprise product now makes up 40% of its revenue, up from 30% earlier this year, according to Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer. That growing independence is turning the former allies into direct competitors in more ways than one. Meta, OpenAI, and others have already formed superintelligence teams, but Mustafa says his group is staying away from certain areas. One example: he’s refusing to build AI that generates erotica, putting distance between his team and competitors. Mustafa is framing Microsoft’s version of superintelligence as more people-centered, but the company isn’t hiding the fact that it wants to own the future of AI, on its own terms. Microsoft’s 365 Copilot tools for business are still powered by OpenAI, but if Mustafa’s team delivers, those dependencies may disappear. Still, there’s no clear timeline. Microsoft’s push is just beginning, and even the company admits replacing what it gets from OpenAI won’t be fast. Microsoft stock plunged by 1.4% on Thursday evening, trading at $500.01 in New York. But for now, the company is betting that chasing superintelligence is worth the risk.

XRP emerged as the second most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, favoring a bullish XRP price prediction for the long term. Kaiko, a leading global firm that provides crypto market data to institutional players, shared its ranking for the third quarter of this year. XRP was tied with Ethereum (ETH) in second place, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL). The company analyzes a series of characteristics for each token to construct a 100-point index that analyzes the asset’s strengths and prospects. These factors include potential use cases, resources, and research. Institutional awareness seems to be rapidly growing for the XRP Ledger. Recently, the first spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP was launched, and it has already attracted $100 million from investors despite the latest market sell-off. XRP Price Prediction: Buyers Show Up at $2.10 – Is a Recovery Starting? XRP has recovered today after taking some significant hits in the past few days that pushed down its price to nearly $2.08. The price has bounced near $2.30, and trading volumes have retreated, indicating that the selling pressure could be easing. XRP has bounced off a critical support at $2.10, suggesting the recent sell-off may have been an overreaction. For the bullish momentum to continue, XRP needs to break above the 200-day exponential moving average and see the RSI push past its 14-day moving average. Despite the pullback, institutional interest in Ripple’s ecosystem remains strong – a key factor behind a long-term bullish XRP price prediction. If the rebound gains strength, XRP could rally toward $4 in the coming weeks. To fully capitalize on any upside, secure storage matters.

But with RentStac (RNS), the math behind a million-dollar opportunity is more straightforward than most early-stage projects. With the current presale offering a 100% token bonus, now is the moment to crunch real, life-changing numbers. Forget elusive hype. Here’s how much you’d need to put in today to join the seven-figure club and why timing matters more than ever. Understanding the Million Dollar Path At the heart of RentStac’s presale is a simple deal: buy tokens at $0.025 each and get double the amount for free. If you miss this window, future phases offer no such bonus, and token prices will only rise. Let’s break it down. The goal is $1,000,000 in token value when RNS reaches a hypothetical target price of $1 per token, a milestone analysts believe is possible due to the project’s real estate backing and deflationary model. The Calculation: How Much to Invest for $1M At the current rate, $1,000 will buy you 40,000 RNS tokens. With the 100% bonus, that becomes 80,000 tokens. To amass $1 million at $1 per RNS, you’d need 1,000,000 tokens. Here’s the formula: 1,000,000 tokens ÷ 80,000 tokens (per $1,000) = 12.5 So, you’d need to invest: 12.5 x $1,000 = $12,500 By putting in $12,500 during this presale phase, you’d secure 500,000 tokens outright. Thanks to the bonus, this doubles to 1,000,000 RNS, your ticket to $1 million if/when the token reaches $1. Why Acting Now Counts This doubling event is strictly limited to the ongoing presale. In later rounds, the bonus vanishes and the token price climbs. Waiting will cost you either more money for the same position or far less exposure for the same investment. Early backers aren’t just hoping for token appreciation—they’re locking in a historic entry point that won’t repeat. Crypto and real estate rarely line up for such high-leverage entry. Real Estate Backing, Dual Earnings, No Hassle RentStac stands out for more than just the numbers. Every RNS is linked to real rental properties, with ownership organized in secure Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Forget landlord headaches, property management is handled professionally while you keep full transparency from your dashboard. Returns don’t stop at future price gains. The platform uses property-generated income for buybacks and burns, adding scarcity to your holdings. Plus, staking options let investors earn a piece of monthly rent, paid in USDC, directly from holding and staking their tokens. Security First, Big Plans Ahead RentStac smart contracts are already audited and scored at 92.48%, with an additional CertiK audit underway. The roadmap prioritizes rapid property acquisition, stronger rental income flows, and major exchange listings in the next year. These milestones could add both liquidity and visibility, fueling the journey toward that $1 target and rewarding early commitment. Millionaire Math in Your Hands Few opportunities in crypto offer such a calculable shot at $1 million. With the presale’s doubling bonus, a $12,500 investment today could, at $1 per RNS, hit the million mark. Miss the presale, and the path only gets steeper.

Trader Says The Low Must Form Now,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/did-bitcoin-just-bottom-low-must-form-now/,"A day after another billion-dollar liquidation cascade, veteran crypto analyst Trader Mayne says his core thesis is unchanged: the bull cycle’s top is “not in,” and the market is in the process of printing a weekly cycle low that could set up one more leg higher into year-end. “I’ve been banging on the drum about the high not being in,” he said in a November 5 video, adding that he remains “a BTC maxi from the spot perspective,” despite tactical longs and shorts that have been hit-and-miss during the recent volatility. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Mayne framed the selloff—coming less than a month after an almost $20 billion wipeout on October 10—as a feature, not a bug, of late-cycle price discovery. He argued that speculative leverage rapidly re-accumulated in altcoins and that majors still offer sufficient volatility with clearer structure. “People were right back on with the leverage… You really can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” he said, while emphasizing he now “primarily focus[es] on the majors” and holds a core spot stack he hasn’t sold. His near-term timing anchor is cycle theory. Drawing on the four-year template popularized by Bob Loukas, Mayne said he expects the broader crypto top to land between late 2025 and early 2026, but he stressed the immediate setup is about nailing a weekly low within a narrow window that “extends until about mid next week, November 10.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $87,000 If This Happens He wants to see “time and space away from this low” and a reclaim of the monthly open around $110,000–$112,000 to confirm that the decline has been exhausted. If that structure forms, he intends to treat $98,000 as the operative bull-market invalidation on a weekly-closing basis: “That will confirm to me that this is our bull market invalidation… at least in the worst case you have a cut point at like $100k Bitcoin.” Mayne supplemented the timing view with a cross-asset read that he says has been reliable in prior impulses: gold tends to rally first, with Bitcoin following “about 60 to 90 days later.” He cited chart work showing gold’s advance now roughly 80–90 days old, which, if the relationship holds, would “line up very well with Bitcoin being ready to make its next move.” He also expects the BTC-versus-gold cross to bounce, implying outperformance of Bitcoin over the precious metal through year-end: “I’m pretty confident this chart is due for a big bounce and we’re going to see gold underperform Bitcoin for the remainder of the year.” A more subjective—but, in his telling, telling—input is the absence of a true “blow-off” in Bitcoin versus the vertical arcs seen in AI-heavy equities and gold. With megacaps like Nvidia running hard since the spring and gold printing a sharp leg higher, he argued that “it just doesn’t sit right… that Bitcoin hasn’t had [its blow-off],” suggesting latent upside energy remains to be released if the weekly low locks in. On market microstructure and seasonality, Mayne pointed to early-month dynamics. In many green months, he said, the low forms in the first third of the month, analogous to how Monday’s range often frames the week for intraday traders. If November is destined to close higher, an early-month low coupled with a monthly-open reclaim would be consistent with his cycle read. “If we’re bullish for November… I want to be a bull above the monthly open,” he said. The scenario analysis was not one-sided. Mayne repeatedly acknowledged bear signals that have emerged on higher timeframes, including a weekly structure break, prior sweeps on the weekly and monthly, and building momentum divergences. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 He warned of the possibility that the recent range resolves as distribution—“maybe the banks literally came in… and they’ve just been distributing on us here”—and laid out a lower-high path in which a rally fizzles beneath or just above the prior peak before breaking down. “There’s a world where we make an all-time high, but it’s just a weak one… you’re going to have the biggest bear div of all bear divs up here,” he said, cautioning that a marginal new high followed by a swift rejection would flip his posture. In the medium-term, he remains open to two competing macro arcs. In the base case, the classic four-year rhythm holds, the late-2025 window marks the cycle top, and 2026 skews bearish, though he expects drawdowns on Bitcoin to be “truncated” relative to prior 80% collapses given deeper institutional participation. In the alternative, the market “right-translates”—an atypical extension in which a new all-time high could print as late as Q1 2026—forcing a reassessment of the four-year template. Either way, he said, his plan is to sell strength on the next leg and reassess if the market presents higher-low continuation after a new high: “If the market appears to still be bullish, guess what? I can get back on the bull train.” Mayne also flagged the US dollar as a 2026 risk pivot, arguing the DXY is carving a “serious low” on multi-month and yearly structures that could precede a “deflationary rally.” While not a one-to-one driver, he said a strong dollar tends to pressure crypto and other risk assets. That macro overlay, combined with what he views as froth in AI-linked equities, underpins his caution beyond the next advance. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $103,412.

Although the concept remains speculative and highly improbable, several analysts and XRP supporters have examined how the digital asset could theoretically assist the government in addressing its $38 trillion debt crisis. Ripple’s Escrow and U.S. Treasury Intervention In early 2025, XRP researcher Dr. Horace Drew proposed a hypothetical situation where President Donald Trump might gain control of Ripple’s escrowed XRP holdings and assign them to the U.S. Treasury. According to Drew, the escrow, estimated to hold roughly 35 billion XRP valued at around $200 billion at that time, could potentially serve as a financial instrument for the government. ""How's he gunna do it LOL?"" If Trump takes all of the XRP in escrow for the US Treasury (current value $200 billion), then slowly drives the value of XRP up to $500, the total US national debt of $34 trillion will be cancelled. — Red Collie (Dr. Horace Drew) scientist/inventor (@RedCollie1) January 23, 2025 He speculated that if the government managed the asset strategically, perhaps by supporting policies that elevate XRP’s market value to around $500 per token , it could theoretically generate enough capital to offset a significant portion of the national debt, which stood near $34 trillion when he presented the scenario. A similar theory emerged from another community commentator known as UtilityFTW, who suggested Ripple could voluntarily transfer its escrow holdings to the government. In his view, integrating RippleNet as a national payment infrastructure could further strengthen this approach, positioning XRP as a tool for high-value settlements and potentially contributing to debt reduction. Renewed Attention and Trump’s Remarks The conversation reemerged in October 2025 following remarks by Carl Higbie, a host on Newsmax, who proposed a more active government role. He suggested that the Treasury could invest $1 trillion in XRP to boost its market price, sell portions of the token for profit to pay off part of the debt, and then repeat the process. While such an approach would introduce extreme volatility, Higbie argued that this method could gradually chip away at the nation’s financial burden. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Interestingly, Donald Trump himself has publicly mentioned the idea of using cryptocurrency to pay off U.S. debt, though his comment appeared partly sarcastic. Still, his statement helped reignite debates over the potential intersection of crypto assets and national fiscal policy. At present, Ripple’s escrow holds about 35 billion XRP, with an estimated market value of $87.5 billion, based on XRP’s current price of $2.27 . When compared with the $38.1 trillion U.S. national debt, equivalent to roughly $111,559 per citizen, the escrow’s worth remains negligible. Analysts have calculated that for just half of the debt to be covered, the value of the escrow would need to total $19 trillion, which would require XRP to reach approximately $543 per token. To eliminate the entire debt, XRP would have to trade near $1,088, representing an increase of over 43,000% from current levels. Market Outlook and Expert Predictions Despite the implausibility of these numbers, several analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term price potential. Rob Cunningham, host of The KWUL Show, recently suggested that strong market inflows, particularly from institutional investors and potential ETF approvals , could push XRP’s value between $200 and $500. Similarly, projections from Changelly analysts anticipate that XRP might exceed the $500 mark by 2040, driven by broader adoption and market maturity. Adding to this sentiment, Dom Kwok, founder of Easy A, advised investors to hold their XRP positions long-term, asserting that the token could eventually surpass $1,000 if market and regulatory conditions align favorably. While the concept of the U.S. government leveraging XRP to erase its national debt remains purely hypothetical, the discussions underscore the growing intersection between cryptocurrency and macroeconomic policy.

54111713,622701,1762473627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54111713.jpeg,Crypto Leaders React to Mamdani’s Win: Will New York’s Blockchain Adoption Come to a Halt?,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-leaders-react-to-mamdanis-win-will-new-yorks/,"The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, raising questions about the future of the city’s digital-asset ecosystem. With Mamdani securing victory on November 4, 2025, defeating Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, the crypto sector is weighing both uncertainty and opportunity in equal measure. This is a major concern for the crypto community, considering that New York is one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Crypto Community Weighs The Upside And Risks Although Mamdani is neither a vocal advocate for cryptocurrencies nor an outright adversary, his record suggests tighter oversight rather than unbridled growth. Prior to the election, he supported measures such as a moratorium on proof-of-work crypto mining and co-sponsored legislation to tax crypto transactions. Notably, prominent industry figures offered tempered responses. Anthony Pompliano cautioned against surrendering New York’s legacy of ambition, asserting that “the city will continue to stand for ambition and opportunity.” Meanwhile, Scott Melker observed that mayors come and go and that “New York will be fine.” On the other side, voices like crypto advocate Max Keiser predicted economic meltdown, linking Mamdani’s victory to potential deterioration in the city’s financial standing. What Does It Mean For Blockchain Adoption In New York? Under the previous administrations, New York positioned itself as a global hub for digital assets. For example, anti-money laundering scrutiny and crypto licenses were advanced under Cuomo’s tenure. With Mamdani’s win, the city may shift toward stricter regulation and consumer protection over innovation-led growth. For instance, city-level bills such as A7788 (crypto legal fees/fines) and A8966 (crypto transaction tax) are already under consideration. However, it’s important to note that city administrations have limited power over state and federal crypto law, much of the regulatory muscle lies outside the Mayor’s reach. As such, while the pace of blockchain adoption in New York might slow or redirect, the industry is unlikely to see a full halt. Broader Political Climate Adds Complexity Mamdani’s surprising mayoral campaign also drew sharp responses from Donald Trump. The president , who had publicly endorsed Cuomo, warned of funding cuts to New York if Mamdani were elected, calling him a “communist” and suggesting New York could face federal withdrawal of support. Trump’s remarks targeted Mamdani directly in his speech, further stoking uncertainty. For crypto firms operating in New York, the interplay of city policy, federal posture, and broader political shifts will be critical to monitor. In sum, Mamdani’s victory creates a new ecosystem for crypto and blockchain in New York, one that may prioritise consumer protection, housing, and affordability over rapid token-driven growth. While this may slow some initiatives, the city’s role as a global financial hub makes a full retreat unlikely.

The law, signed in July, is designed to establish a national framework for payment stablecoins and provide more certainty regarding how digital dollar tokens are regulated nationwide. Circle sent its comments this week as part of the Treasury’s current rulemaking procedure. It will flesh out what the law will look like in practice. The firm stated that the rules must be strong enough to protect users while also being balanced enough to enable innovation and competition in the expanding digital payments industry. The company’s theme is that every issuer should be subject to the same standards, regardless of whether it is a bank or a private entity, and whether it operates in the US or abroad. Circle urges consistent rules across all stablecoin issuers In its submission, Circle argued that stablecoins used for payments need to be fully backed by cash or high-quality, highly liquid short-term assets . This is intended to prevent stablecoins from losing value in times of financial crisis. The firm argued that clear backing rules are necessary to prevent risks from being imposed on ordinary people. The rules, Circle added, should ensure that no one group receives more favorable treatment. Banks, non-bank providers of financial services that utilize technology, and finance companies whose stablecoins are available in US markets should all be subject to the same supervisory regime. The company warned that inconsistent regulation could push risky stablecoin activity out of the United States and beyond the reach of overseers who are monitoring such products. “Clear conditions of access to US markets, including shared supervision between the US and trusted foreign regulators, will foster competition while protecting against risks arising offshore,” the company said. Circle also stressed the need for robust enforcement. It also stated that penalties for breaking the rules should be substantial enough to deter misuse and maintain confidence in digital assets. Without this, it argued, the aims of the GENIUS Act would not be achieved. Industry groups submit recommendations to the treasury Circle wasn’t the only group that registered its comments. Coinbase also filed comments. The back and forth prompted the Treasury to clarify that a prohibition on paying interest on stablecoin balances should be limited to parties that issue the coins, not to individuals seeking returns from exchanges or platforms in other ways. The request follows warnings from US banking institutions that some stablecoin offerings could begin to operate like bank deposits, potentially displacing traditional savings accounts in a competitive market niche. The GENIUS Act won’t happen overnight. It would take effect 18 months after signing, or 120 days after the regulators complete and finalize the detailed rules. If regulators act quickly, the law might be in effect sooner; if rule-making is slow, there will be a delay. Meanwhile, Congress is considering a broader law that would establish regulations for these digital markets, including guidelines for categorizing and overseeing cryptocurrencies, trading platforms, and digital asset securities. The bill already passed the House earlier this year, but it has not progressed in the Senate. Pauses for long recesses, backroom negotiations, and other legislative priorities have slowed the effort. The doors remain open for bipartisan dialogue, according to news reports, but no new proposals are being brought to the table. Those estimates had been more like 2026, according to previous analyses by congressional leaders. Currently, the schedule is precarious due to present delays. Get seen where it counts.

During its Q3 2025 earnings call event on Wednesday, Treasurer Shiv Verma told analysts the company is “still thinking about it,” when asked if Bitcoin might be part of its treasury plan. Shiv added that:- “We spend a lot of time thinking about this and have this debate constantly,” making it clear the idea isn’t off the table. Shiv didn’t confirm any timeline, but said the team continues to “actively look at” how it could fit into the company’s future. This comes as crypto trading continues to grow into a major part of the business. Robinhood’s crypto revenue jumped 339% in the twelve months ending September 30, with crypto now making up a fifth of total income for the quarter. For the quarter alone, Robinhood’s crypto revenue surged 67.5% to $268 million, driven by heavier volumes, as Cryptopolitan reported . CFO Jason Warnick told investors there was a “nice step-up in crypto volumes” that helped push overall transaction-based revenue to $730 million, a 129% increase from the same time last year. Robinhood pushes tokenized stocks while crypto-linked stocks tank At the same earnings call, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said Robinhood has entered the early stages of a rollout to support tokenized stocks. He explained that the company is currently in “phase one,” with phase two expected to allow secondary trading on Bitstamp. Eventually, the company wants these stock tokens to land on DeFi platforms, letting people trade tokenized shares the same way they trade other tokens on-chain. Vladimir said “where it really starts to get interesting is phase two and phase three,” but gave no hard dates for when that will happen. Meanwhile, crypto’s October crypto downturn left many companies who already hold Bitcoin or Ethereum sitting on unrealized losses. Firms like Metaplanet and Trump Media bought their BTC positions earlier in the year when prices were stronger. Those holdings are now worth less than what was paid. The same thing is happening on the Ethereum side. Bitmine and Sharplink also bought during the April to July rally, and are now down since that momentum vanished. Meanwhile, Robinhood’s own stock just dropped over 10% today. It wasn’t alone. The broader crypto sector got crushed. Investors are reacting to a mix of U.S. job numbers, renewed trade tensions, and a government shutdown that’s now stretched into day 37, the longest in history. Coinbase sank by more than 6%, Galaxy Digital dropped 4%, and mining firms weren’t spared either. MARA Holdings fell 3.6%, CleanSpark and Riot Blockchain lost over 5% each. Stocks linked to Bitcoin treasuries fell 6.5%, and Ethereum treasury names like BitMine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming dropped 7% and 6%, respectively. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

A Tether-linked address just made headlines by purchasing a staggering 961 Bitcoin, worth approximately $97.34 million, on the Bitfinex exchange. This massive transaction, reported by Onchain Lens, occurred mere hours ago and signals significant institutional activity in the Bitcoin market. What does this Tether-linked address purchase mean for Bitcoin? The recent acquisition by the Tether-linked address represents one of the largest single transactions witnessed recently. When such substantial amounts enter the market, it often indicates strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Moreover, this move demonstrates how major entities are positioning themselves in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Transactions of this magnitude typically influence market sentiment and can signal upcoming price movements. The timing of this purchase, coming during ongoing market fluctuations, suggests strategic accumulation by knowledgeable investors. Why are Tether-linked addresses important in cryptocurrency? Tether-linked addresses play a crucial role in the digital asset ecosystem for several reasons: They represent substantial liquidity moving between stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies Their transactions often precede significant market movements They demonstrate institutional participation in crypto markets Their activity provides insights into market maker strategies They help maintain stability between different digital assets The movement from a Tether-linked address into Bitcoin particularly highlights the ongoing relationship between stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency market. This transaction underscores how major players use stablecoins as stepping stones to acquire other digital assets. How does this affect ordinary cryptocurrency investors? While $97.34 million might seem like an astronomical sum to individual investors, understanding these large transactions can provide valuable insights. The Tether-linked address activity often serves as a barometer for institutional sentiment. When such addresses accumulate Bitcoin, it typically indicates: Positive long-term outlook on Bitcoin’s value Potential price support at current levels Increased institutional adoption of cryptocurrency Growing confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value However, it’s crucial to remember that while these signals are important, they represent just one piece of the complex cryptocurrency puzzle. Individual investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple factors before making investment decisions. What makes this Tether-linked address transaction remarkable? The scale and timing of this Tether-linked address purchase make it particularly noteworthy. The transaction occurred during a period of relative market uncertainty, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s fundamentals.

This significant decline reveals growing anxiety among traders and could signal important market movements ahead. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial emotional barometer for digital asset markets. This powerful tool calculates market sentiment using multiple data sources to give investors a clear picture of collective psychology. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear, it often indicates potential buying opportunities for brave investors. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where lower numbers represent fear and higher numbers indicate greed. Currently sitting at 24, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen three points from yesterday’s reading, confirming the market’s negative shift. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Understanding the components behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps investors interpret its signals accurately. The index combines six key factors: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Trading Volume (25%) – Tracks market activity levels Social Media Mentions (15%) – Monitors online discussions Surveys (15%) – Captures direct investor sentiment Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Watches BTC market share Google Trends (10%) – Follows search interest This comprehensive approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects genuine market emotions rather than temporary price movements. Why Should Investors Care About Extreme Fear Readings? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters extreme fear territory, it often creates contrarian opportunities. Historically, periods of extreme fear have frequently preceded market recoveries. However, investors should approach these situations with caution and proper risk management. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 suggests that many traders are becoming increasingly nervous about their positions. This emotional state can lead to panic selling, which might create attractive entry points for long-term investors. What Actionable Insights Does the Current Reading Provide? The dramatic drop in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to extreme fear levels offers several important insights for market participants. First, it indicates that sentiment has deteriorated significantly from recent levels. Second, it suggests that volatility may increase as emotional trading dominates market activity. Investors watching the Crypto Fear & Greed Index should consider these strategies during extreme fear periods: Dollar-cost average into positions gradually Set clear stop-losses to manage risk Monitor volume for confirmation of trend changes Avoid emotional decisions based on fear alone How Can Traders Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Effectively? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index works best as one tool among many in a trader’s arsenal. While it provides valuable sentiment data, it shouldn’t be the sole factor in investment decisions. Successful traders combine the Crypto Fear & Greed Index with technical analysis, fundamental research, and market news. Remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures current sentiment, not future price direction. Markets can remain in extreme fear or greed for extended periods, so patience remains crucial. Conclusion: Navigating Market Emotions with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 clearly signals that extreme fear has returned to cryptocurrency markets. While this creates challenges for current holders, it may present opportunities for strategic investors. By understanding what drives the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and how to interpret its signals, traders can make more informed decisions during emotional market conditions. Market sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, often reaches extremes before significant trend changes. Whether this current extreme fear reading marks a bottom or simply a pause in downward momentum remains to be seen, but it certainly warrants close attention from all market participants. Frequently Asked Questions What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index of 24 mean? A reading of 24 indicates extreme fear in cryptocurrency markets. This suggests investors are nervous, potentially leading to increased selling pressure and higher volatility. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index updates daily, providing fresh sentiment data for traders and investors to incorporate into their decision-making process. Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict market bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, historically, extreme fear readings have often coincided with market bottoms, making it a valuable contrarian indicator. Should I buy when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear? Extreme fear can present buying opportunities, but always conduct additional research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. How reliable is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index provides reliable sentiment data but should be used alongside other analysis methods for comprehensive market understanding. What’s the difference between fear and extreme fear on the index? Fear typically ranges from 25-49, while extreme fear covers 0-24, indicating significantly stronger negative sentiment and potential market stress.

The agreement was reported by Bloomberg and comes as Nvidia faces a brutal three-day market crash that’s erased $450 billion in market value. While Kazakhstan deepens its AI commitment, Wall Street is offloading Nvidia shares at record pace, hammering the company with its worst stock decline since early January. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is pushing to turn Kazakhstan into a heavyweight in Eurasia’s future economy. In a speech delivered in late September, president Tokayev said the country is working to become a full digital power within three years, mostly through a new government body: the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development, which replaces the previous Digital Ministry and now serves as the main structure overseeing AI integration across government, science, and industry. The transition isn’t just branding. The previous ministry managed projects in space, cybersecurity, public services, innovation, and digitization. That same structure will now be powered by AI to reshape those pillars. By August 2024, 93% of government services in Kazakhstan were already running online. National internet coverage was nearly universal at 92.9%, just barely under Germany’s level. Kazakhstan makes AI bet while U.S. douses chip optimism The new AI ministry will also advise Tokayev directly through a presidential AI Development Council. Olaf Groth, a German-American council member, said the goal is not just digitization, but cognification; developing systems that think, analyze, and act. Kazakhstan plans to leverage Nvidia’s chips to build compute capacity for everything from university research to national AI labs. It’s a move to position the country as a regional broker for artificial intelligence development and services. As Kazakhstan goes all-in, Nvidia’s stock is collapsing. On Thursday, the company’s shares dropped 3.6%, leading the entire tech sector lower. The fall started earlier in the week after comments from David Sacks, the Trump administration’s artificial intelligence and crypto policy lead. In a post on X, Sacks said, “There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least five major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place.” He added, “I don’t think anyone was actually asking for a bailout. (That would be ridiculous.) But company executives can clarify their own comments.” Sacks was reacting to a statement made the day before by Sarah Friar, the CFO of OpenAI, during a Wall Street Journal event. Friar had said OpenAI might benefit from a government guarantee to help finance AI chip infrastructure. That comment triggered immediate backlash. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, later denied the company was requesting any government support or protection from failure. AI giants scramble as valuations wobble and China pressure builds The entire chip sector has been under pressure since Wednesday when Qualcomm released solid earnings, but investor fear around AI overvaluation tanked sentiment across the board. Analysts are flagging that top AI companies Nvidia, AMD, Oracle, Broadcom, CoreWeave, and even Amazon are getting too entangled, with shared supply chains and overlapping partnerships making the sector/make look a tad too fragile. Things got worse for Nvidia after CEO Jensen Huang made headlines for saying China “will win” the AI race in a comment given during an interview with the Financial Times. Jensen followed up later on X, posting that China was only “nanoseconds behind” the U.S., but stressed, “It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",Tech|Nvidia,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-07 00:25:16

This represents one of the largest Bitcoin options expirations we’ve seen this year, creating significant potential for market volatility and price movements that could impact traders and investors alike. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? According to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, Bitcoin options with a notional value of $4.69 billion will expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC today. The sheer scale of these Bitcoin options creates substantial market pressure that traders need to understand. When this many contracts expire simultaneously, it often triggers increased trading activity and potential price swings. The put/call ratio for these expiring Bitcoin options stands at 0.81, indicating slightly more call options than put options. This ratio provides crucial insight into market sentiment and potential price direction. Moreover, the max pain price sits at $108,000, representing the strike price where the maximum number of options would expire worthless. How Do Bitcoin Options Work and Why Should You Care? Bitcoin options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price by a certain date. Today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration involves both call options (betting on price increases) and put options (betting on price decreases). Understanding this dynamic helps explain why such large expirations can create market turbulence. Key factors to watch include: Put/call ratio of 0.81 – Slightly bullish sentiment Max pain price of $108,000 – Potential price magnet $4.69 billion notional value – Substantial market impact Simultaneous Ethereum options expiration – Broader market effects What About the Ethereum Options Expiring Today? Adding to the market significance, Ethereum options worth $700 million will expire at the same time as the Bitcoin options. These Ethereum contracts show a put/call ratio of 0.95 and a max pain price of $3,650. The nearly equal put/call ratio suggests more balanced sentiment compared to Bitcoin, but still represents substantial market exposure that could influence broader cryptocurrency trends. The simultaneous expiration of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options creates a compounded effect on market liquidity and volatility. Traders often adjust their positions in both assets as these large expirations approach, creating interconnected price movements across the crypto market. What Should Traders Watch For After Expiration? Following today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Price action around the $108,000 max pain level could provide important signals about short-term direction. Additionally, trading volume and open interest changes will reveal how much capital is redeploying into new positions. Historical patterns suggest that large Bitcoin options expirations often precede periods of increased volatility as market makers adjust their hedging strategies. The rebalancing of these substantial positions typically creates trading opportunities for alert market participants who understand the mechanics behind Bitcoin options settlements. Final Thoughts on Today’s Critical Market Event Today’s $4.7 billion Bitcoin options expiration represents a significant market event that could shape short-term price action and volatility. The combination of substantial notional value, specific put/call ratios, and max pain prices creates a complex tapestry of market forces that every crypto trader should understand. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, historical analysis shows that large Bitcoin options expirations often mark important inflection points in market trends. Frequently Asked Questions What time do the Bitcoin options expire? The Bitcoin options expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 7th. What does a put/call ratio of 0.81 mean? A put/call ratio of 0.81 indicates there are slightly more call options than put options, suggesting somewhat bullish market sentiment. What is the max pain price? The max pain price of $108,000 is the strike price where the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, potentially acting as a price magnet. How does this compare to previous Bitcoin options expirations? At $4.7 billion, this represents one of the larger Bitcoin options expirations we’ve seen recently, indicating growing institutional participation in crypto derivatives. Will this affect Bitcoin’s price significantly? Large options expirations often create short-term volatility as positions are adjusted, but the long-term impact depends on broader market factors. Are Ethereum options affected by Bitcoin options expiration? Yes, since both expire simultaneously and many traders hold positions in both assets, there can be correlated effects on pricing and volatility. Found this analysis helpful?

Rockstar’s statement on X said, “We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.” The delay announcement came shortly after groups of former workers gathered outside Rockstar’s UK offices, protesting dismissals that took place in late October. They said management “don’t care about delays to GTA 6” and argued the firings were retaliation against union activity, which Rockstar’s parent denied. Earnings reveal revenue growth and ongoing losses Anyway, Take-Two also reported quarterly earnings today, and its revenue for the second quarter increased 33% to $1.96 billion, beating LSEG estimates of $1.72 billion, thanks to to strong performance from titles like NBA 2K26, Borderlands 4, and ongoing sales of Red Dead Redemption 2. Despite the revenue boost, the company reported a net loss of $133.9 million, or 73 cents per share. The same period the previous year recorded a net loss of $365.5 million, or $2.08 per share, showing the loss narrowed but was still significant. CEO Strauss Zelnick said on the earnings call that:- “We remain both excited and confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience. With the most robust pipeline in our company’s history, we expect to achieve record levels of Net Bookings in Fiscal 2027.” Strauss pointed to continued growth momentum, especially in mobile and the NBA 2K franchise, which has now sold more than 167 million units worldwide. Take-Two raised its bookings outlook to a range of $6.38 billion to $6.48 billion, above the prior estimate of $6.05 billion to $6.15 billion. Reports showed that roughly 40 employees were dismissed after participating in a private Discord chat group involving trade union discussions. A spokesperson for Rockstar’s parent allegedly told Bloomberg this:- “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.” The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain argued otherwise, calling the firings “one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry.” Alex Marshall, president of the union, said in response to Rockstar’s allegations that the gamemaker was “afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.” Security enforcement has been strict at Rockstar since the 2022 leak, when unfinished footage of the next game surfaced publicly. Then in early 2024, staff were required to return to office five days a week, with Rockstar citing security concerns, something the workers’ union called the return-to-office mandate a “reckless” decision. Meanwhile, the community responded in its own way. On Polymarket, traders gave a 48% chance that Bitcoin hits $1,000,000 before GTA 6 releases, and nearly 50% odds that Jesus returns first.

New ecosystem data demonstrate that gaming is becoming the dominant force on-chain, striking a positive note as stalled DeFi projects have been unable to cope with an increasingly turbulent market and talks constrict around key jurisdictions. The contrast also highlights a divide emerging within Web3, with entertainment-focused apps gaining traction alongside financial protocols that are under attack from both external and internal interests. Web3 gaming gains momentum Blockchain gaming also made inroads, despite a slight decline in Web3 use overall. However, the number of daily active wallets on Web3’s networks actually dropped by 3% to approximately 16 million. Meanwhile, gaming-based activity as a percentage of total activity increased its share to 27.9%, the highest of the year. These integrations will never stop with gaming, but will also include user onboarding, gameplay experience, and the expanding reach of multiple blockchain networks. Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon were the main contributors to this activity, with notable projects including Raydium and Pump.fun , JupiterExchange, OKX Dex, and PancakeSwap v2. These platforms could benefit from social trading, lower trading costs, and increased liquidity. Trading in NFTs also surged. Overall NFT volume rose 30% to $546 million, with more than 10.1 million transactions — the most in any month in 2025. Gaming-related digital assets and utility-backed NFTs, integrated with gaming, loyalty programs, and virtual identity customization, were among the biggest volume drivers. This transition occurred from the world of speculative collectibles to that of active and interactive digital artifacts. DeFi absorbs losses and responds October was also a bad month for DeFi, which lost 6.3% of its TVL last month to end the period with $221 billion before tumbling further to start November at $193 billion. The drop occurred following a severe market crash on October 10, which led to massive liquidations. Roughly $20 billion in leveraged positions on large exchanges and lending platforms were erased within days. The case itself worsened as the DeFi protocol Stream Finance lost $93 million. The episode has highlighted wider systemic risks that may be posed by stablecoins and lending against collateral. Analysts later identified at least $284 million more in exposure from similar themes in other DeFisystems. Regulatory pressure compounded the stress. A group of Senate Democrats pleaded for non-custodial wallets to implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. News of the proposal was met with mixed reactions, and industry players speculated that requirements to identify customers who use self-custodied wallets could hinder property-like ownership among users and innovation in favor of less stringent rules across a more accommodating regulatory landscape. Ethereum companies, in response, started banding together to lobby. A coalition of projects, including Aave, Uniswap, Lido, Curve, and The Graph, has formed the Ethereum Protocol Advocacy Alliance. The coalition advocates that decentralized infrastructure should be included in the conversation when discussing regulations and that blockchain networks should remain open-access. Elsewhere, Oracle network RedStone has introduced a new platform called Credora, aiming to offer consistent risk and credit scores across decentralized finance (DeFi) lending markets. The system is designed to make trading more transparent and help reduce systemic risk, especially that inherent in over-leveraged credit markets.

The integration will surface current market probabilities directly in the search box and chart how those odds change over time. Ask a question like what will GDP growth be for 2025, and Google will display the latest pricing from these markets alongside recent shifts in sentiment. Polymarket And Kalshi Secure Billion-Dollar Valuations As Event Trading Expands Beyond Finance Google framed the move as a way to bring event odds into everyday workflows for investors, researchers, and the crypto crowd that already tracks market implied probabilities across rates, elections, sports, and macro. KALSHI AND GOOGLE FINANCE PARTNER TO ADD PREDICTION MARKETS — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) November 6, 2025 The tie-up lands as both platforms scale. Polymarket drew a recent investment from Intercontinental Exchange that valued the company around $9b. Kalshi raised $300m at a $5b valuation , signaling growing institutional interest in event contracts. Adoption has widened beyond finance. In October, Polymarket and Kalshi became the first officially licensed prediction markets of the NHL, a milestone that put more pressure on incumbent wagering apps like DraftKings and FanDuel to respond. Prediction Markets Cement Place In The New Retail Trading Cycle Once access switches on, Google Finance users will be able to ask questions in natural language and receive relevant market data in line. That includes point-in-time probabilities and historical ranges that show how views evolved around key headlines. Brokerages are leaning in as well. Robinhood partnered with Kalshi in August to offer contracts on professional and college football, then expanded the slate. On the latest earnings call, CEO Vlad Tenev said prediction markets are on fire, pointing to rapid user uptake. Volumes back that up. Weekly turnover across prediction markets topped $2b in late October for the first time, led by Polymarket’s sports boards and a busier slate of news-driven questions. Regulatory positioning is shifting too. Polymarket, once restricted from serving the US after a 2022 CFTC action, re-entered the conversation this year by acquiring a venue with a Designated Contract Market license, paving the way for compliant US access. Prediction Prices Could Become A Core Market Metric If Google’s Rollout Succeeds Competition is building. Bloomberg reported this week that Gemini is preparing to launch prediction market contracts , subject to regulatory approval, with plans to move as soon as possible once cleared. That would place the exchange alongside Kalshi and Polymarket in a fast-growing category. For crypto-native traders, the Google integration could tighten the loop between price discovery and public data. Market odds that once lived on specialized sites will sit a search away, creating a broader funnel for event-driven trading and risk hedging. If the rollout lands smoothly, prediction prices may become another default data point next to stock quotes, bond yields and exchange rates. For a market that prizes real-time signals, crowd-sourced probabilities could become part of the daily toolkit.

Die Kursgeschichte zeigt starke Schwankungen, zuletzt jedoch eine Konsolidierung mit Potenzial. Auf Basis aktueller Nutzungs- und Marktindikatoren lassen sich vage Szenarien für die kommende Zeit formulieren – mit gebotener Vorsicht. Die Kryptowährung Ripple (XRP) steht im Mittelpunkt vieler Erwartungen – nicht nur als Spekulationsobjekt, sondern vor allem als digitales Mittel für reale Zahlungsflüsse. Während viele Coins auf bloße Kursbewegung setzen, will XRP eine Brückenfunktion im globalen Finanzsystem übernehmen. In diesem Artikel schauen wir erst auf den Nutzen von XRP, dann auf die historische Entwicklung und zuletzt wagen wir eine vorsichtige Prognose, wohin die Reise gehen könnte. 1. Nutzen und Funktion von XRP Der zentrale Zweck von Ripple liegt darin, Transaktionen zwischen verschiedenen Währungen schneller, günstiger und effizienter zu gestalten. XRP dient als Brückenwährung, um Liquidität zwischen Banken und Zahlungsdienstleistern bereitzustellen. Damit schließt Ripple eine Lücke, die traditionelle Finanzsysteme bisher nur schwer überwinden konnten. Das XRP Ledger bietet Transaktionen in wenigen Sekunden und mit minimalen Gebühren – ein Vorteil, der besonders bei grenzüberschreitenden Zahlungen relevant ist. Hinzu kommt die Nachhaltigkeit: Im Gegensatz zu Bitcoin oder Ethereum verwendet XRP kein energieintensives Mining. Das Netzwerk validiert Transaktionen über einen Konsens-Mechanismus, der ressourcenschonender arbeitet. Diese technische Effizienz macht Ripple zu einem der umweltfreundlicheren Akteure im Krypto-Bereich. Zunehmend entstehen auch neue Anwendungen: Neben klassischen Finanzlösungen wird XRP zunehmend in DeFi-Projekten, Smart-Contract-Plattformen und Stablecoin-Konzepten integriert. Dadurch wächst die Relevanz des Coins weit über seinen ursprünglichen Zweck hinaus. 2. Historische Preisentwicklung von XRP Seit seiner Einführung im Jahr 2012 hat Ripple eine bewegte Geschichte hinter sich. Der Kursverlauf war durch extreme Schwankungen geprägt – von rasanten Anstiegen bis zu tiefen Korrekturen. Besonders 2017 erlebte XRP einen spektakulären Höhenflug, als der Preis über die Marke von drei Dollar stieg. In den Folgejahren folgten teils drastische Rückgänge, die den Markt wieder auf den Boden der Realität brachten. In den letzten drei Jahren zeigte sich ein stabileres Bild. 2021 profitierte XRP zeitweise vom allgemeinen Aufschwung am Kryptomarkt, fiel danach jedoch zurück und bewegte sich lange um die Marke von 50 Cent. 2025 mit der Wahl von Trump in den USA startete eine Phase des Aufschwungs, in der XRP zwischen 2,20 und maimal 3,40 Dollar pendelte. Aktuell ist Ripple wieder etwas gefallen und pendelt ca. bei 2,30 und 2,50 Dollar. Diese Seitwärtsbewegung deutet darauf hin, dass der Markt aktuell nach einer klaren Richtung sucht. Ein wesentlicher Faktor in der Kursentwicklung war der Rechtsstreit zwischen Ripple Labs und der US-Börsenaufsicht SEC. Die teilweise positive gerichtliche Entscheidung von 2023 brachte wieder Vertrauen in das Projekt zurück und könnte langfristig den regulatorischen Druck mindern – ein möglicher Grundstein für zukünftiges Wachstum. 3. Vorsichtige Prognose und Ausblick Die Zukunft von XRP hängt maßgeblich davon ab, ob Ripple seine technologische und regulatorische Position weiter stärken kann. Sollte es dem Unternehmen gelingen, neue Banken, Zahlungsdienstleister und FinTechs als Partner zu gewinnen, könnte sich die Nachfrage nach XRP deutlich erhöhen. Der Ausbau des Netzwerks und die mögliche Einführung neuer Produkte – etwa XRP-gestützte Stablecoins – könnten die Akzeptanz zusätzlich fördern. Analysten sehen für die kommenden Jahre moderate Aufwärtspotenziale, sofern die allgemeine Marktlage stabil bleibt. Eine Rückkehr zu früheren Hochs erscheint auf absehbare Zeit zwar ambitioniert, jedoch nicht ausgeschlossen, falls sich die institutionelle Nutzung weiter ausweitet. Kurzfristig könnte XRP zwischen 2,20 und 2,80 Dollar schwanken, während langfristig ein langsamer, nachhaltiger Anstieg denkbar wäre. Allerdings bleibt jede Prognose unsicher : Der Kryptomarkt reagiert sensibel auf politische Entscheidungen, technologische Entwicklungen und wirtschaftliche Trends. Anleger sollten daher Geduld und Realismus mitbringen – und sich bewusst sein, dass Chancen und Risiken eng beieinanderliegen.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has just slipped to 23, signaling a dramatic change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When the index scores above 75, we’re in an altcoin season where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. However, the current reading of 23 tells a very different story. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Dropping So Dramatically? Several factors contribute to this significant decline in the Altcoin Season Index. Bitcoin’s recent strength has drawn capital away from altcoins, creating a classic ‘flight to safety’ scenario. Moreover, market uncertainty often drives investors toward established assets like Bitcoin rather than riskier alternatives. Key reasons for the index drop include: Bitcoin dominance increasing across exchanges Institutional preference for Bitcoin over smaller altcoins Market volatility driving conservative investment choices Regulatory uncertainty affecting altcoin projects How Does This Altcoin Season Index Affect Your Investments? Understanding the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 23 helps you make informed decisions. When the index remains this low, it typically indicates that Bitcoin is outperforming most other cryptocurrencies. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but it does suggest a more cautious approach might be wise. Consider these investment strategies during low Altcoin Season Index periods: Diversify but prioritize quality over quantity Focus on established projects with strong fundamentals Monitor the index for signs of reversal Consider dollar-cost averaging into positions When Might We See the Altcoin Season Index Recover? Historical patterns suggest that low Altcoin Season Index readings often precede significant altcoin rallies. However, timing these shifts requires careful market analysis. Watch for these potential catalysts that could boost the Altcoin Season Index: Bitcoin price stabilization Positive regulatory developments Major technological breakthroughs in altcoin projects Increased institutional adoption of alternative cryptocurrencies What Should You Do Now With the Altcoin Season Index at 23? The current Altcoin Season Index presents both challenges and opportunities. While caution is warranted, this could also be an excellent time to research fundamentally strong altcoins at discounted prices. Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical, and today’s underperformers could become tomorrow’s leaders. Essential actions to consider: Review your portfolio allocation Research promising altcoin projects Set clear entry and exit strategies Monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 23 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 23 indicates that only 23% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days, signaling strong Bitcoin dominance in the current market cycle. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data refreshes, providing near real-time insights into the relative performance between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. Low index readings can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong projects, though careful research and risk management are essential. What Altcoin Season Index reading indicates a true altcoin season? An Altcoin Season Index above 75 typically indicates an altcoin season, where the majority of top cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, extremely low Altcoin Season Index readings have historically coincided with potential accumulation zones for altcoins. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for investment decisions? The index provides valuable context but should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools for comprehensive investment decisions.

54113300,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=850495,1762477230,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/54113300.jpeg,Warning Signals: Bitcoin 365-Day Moving Average At Risk of Collapse,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/warning-signals-bitcoin-365-day-moving-average-at-risk-of-collapse/,"The cryptocurrency market is currently facing significant bearish pressure, with Bitcoin (BTC) struggling to reclaim previously crucial support levels. Recent data from CoinGecko indicates that Bitcoin has retraced nearly 6% over the past week, a decline that has impacted other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), all of which have experienced double-digit losses during the same period. Galaxy Digital Lowers Bitcoin Price Target This downturn marks a stark contrast to the bullish sentiment observed earlier in October, when Bitcoin surged to record its current record high slightly above the $126,000 mark due to a wave of margin buying. However, the euphoria was short-lived, as approximately $20 billion in leveraged positions across the crypto market were abruptly liquidated just days later on October 10, contributing to the ongoing lack of confidence among investors. Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital recently revised its year-end Bitcoin price target down to $120,000, a significant cut from the previous estimate of $185,000, attributing this adjustment to the “significant leverage wipeout.” Related Reading: Weakness In Major Cryptos: What Key Technical Metrics Indicate For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Market analytics firm CryptoQuant has pointed out that Bitcoin’s drop below its 365-day moving average near $102,000 could signal a deeper retreat. This moving average has historically acted as a critical support level during this bull cycle, and its failure to hold could lead to a more substantial correction in Bitcoin’s price. In their analysis, CryptoQuant experts elaborated on the conditions necessary for Bitcoin to reverse its current trajectory and potentially reach new all-time highs. They observed that Bitcoin led a global risk-off movement, testing the critical $100,000 support level. This decline was influenced by a stronger dollar and ongoing uncertainties regarding Federal Reserve (Fed) policy, which have dampened broader risk appetites across various asset classes. Notably, there have been four consecutive sessions of approximately $1.3 billion in net outflows from US spot BTC ETFs, reversing what had been one of the strongest tailwinds for the market in 2025. This diminished demand in the spot market has coincided with forced deleveraging, resulting in over $1 billion in long liquidations at recent lows, which briefly breached intraday support before dip buyers stepped in. Stabilization Of ETF Flows Crucial The options market has further intensified volatility, as dealers remain net short gamma around the $100,000 strike, leading to increased hedging activity near this critical level. The $100,000 mark now stands as a psychological barrier, and any stabilization in ETF flows could shift market sentiment, provided no new macroeconomic shocks occur. On the macroeconomic front, the analysts assert that the current environment remains supportive, albeit clouded by the ongoing government shutdown in Washington. However, policy clarity remains elusive. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Needs To Reclaim This Key Level To Prevent Drop To $1,700 The Federal Reserve’s recent 25 basis point cut in October, which included some dissenting opinions, was accompanied by a cautious tone that pushed back against expectations for another cut in December. Markets are currently pricing in a 60-65% chance of a follow-up move, but as the Fed’s blackout period continues, policymakers may become more comfortable with the idea of pausing, which would help maintain a firm dollar and tight credit conditions. For Bitcoin to break higher sustainably, CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that a reversal in exchange-traded fund outflows and renewed confidence in risk assets will likely be necessary.

54113445,622508,1762477247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54113445.jpeg,Hot Money Floods Binance: $26B In ‘Young Bitcoin’ Inflows Signal Speculative Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/hot-money-floods-binance-26b-young-bitcoin-inflows/,"Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $100,000 level after briefly dipping below it earlier this week — a move that triggered widespread panic selling and reinforced bearish sentiment across the market. The sharp selloff liquidated leveraged positions and sent fear metrics surging, but the swift recovery shows that buyers are still active near key demand zones. According to a new report by CryptoOnchain, the recent market turbulence coincides with a surge in “hot money” flows to Binance. Data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable spike in monthly Bitcoin inflows to the exchange during October 2025, signaling heightened speculative activity. What’s particularly significant is that this inflow is driven almost entirely by “young” coins — UTXOs aged between 0 and 1 day — suggesting that short-term traders and algorithmic participants are dominating recent movements. This trend highlights a clear uptick in intraday and momentum-driven trading, often linked to volatility and short-lived price swings. While such dynamics can amplify downside risk, they also tend to precede strong market reversals once liquidity stabilizes. As Bitcoin regains footing above the $100K threshold, the market now watches closely to see whether this wave of speculative capital marks the beginning of a broader recovery or just another temporary bounce. “Hot Money” Drives Exchange Activity, but Long-Term Holders Stay Firm According to CryptoOnchain, inflows from “young” Bitcoin coins have surged sharply, jumping from roughly $18 billion in September to nearly $26 billion in October. This marks one of the highest inflow levels in the past 12 months, underscoring heightened activity among day traders, speculators, and arbitrage bots. Such behavior typically emerges when markets experience elevated volatility or uncertainty, as short-term participants move assets onto exchanges to position for quick trades. Historically, sharp increases in exchange inflows often hint at bearish sentiment or potential selling pressure, as traders prepare to take profits or hedge risk. However, the UTXO age breakdown tells a more layered story. Inflows from older coins, typically held by long-term holders (LTHs), remain negligible and close to zero. This divergence indicates that the recent activity is largely short-term in nature, confined to traders reacting to immediate market conditions rather than long-term investors exiting positions. In essence, while “hot money” inflows could amplify short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s structural foundation remains intact. The core investor base continues holding off-exchange, showing resilience amid market turbulence. The report suggests that the Bitcoin market is split into two: speculative capital chasing short-term opportunities on one side, and long-term conviction holders quietly standing firm on the other. This balance could determine whether the next move is another shakeout or the start of a new accumulation phase. Bitcoin Faces Resistance After Brief Recovery Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a fragile recovery following its sharp decline below the $100,000 level earlier this week. After hitting a low near $98,900, BTC rebounded modestly to $103,000, where it now faces immediate resistance from the 20-day and 50-day moving averages (blue and green lines). These averages have started to slope downward, confirming the short-term bearish trend and capping upside attempts. The $105,000–$107,000 zone represents the next critical resistance area. A break above this range would likely attract short covering and signal the first signs of stabilization. However, failure to reclaim this zone could lead to renewed selling pressure, with potential retests of $100,000 or even $97,500, a key psychological support level. Trading volume remains elevated, reflecting ongoing market volatility and uncertainty. While bulls have managed to defend $100K for now, momentum remains weak, and sentiment is still heavily bearish across derivatives and spot markets. Bitcoin is consolidating within a fragile structure, attempting to build a base after significant liquidations. To regain bullish momentum, BTC must reclaim its short-term moving averages and hold above $107K — otherwise, downside risks persist as traders remain cautious following the recent leverage wipeout.
