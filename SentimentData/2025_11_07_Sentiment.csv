Here’s why this move favors a bullish Solana price prediction . Forward Industries is, by far, the most influential treasury company in the world for Solana, with total holdings of 6.8 million tokens worth approximately $1 billion at the time of writing. Breaking news from our team The Forward Industries Board authorized, on November 3, 2025, a share repurchase program permitting Forward Industries to repurchase up to $1 billion of its common stock. Get the full press release below pic.twitter.com/rqsDDRGp54 — Forward Industries $FORD (@FWDind) November 4, 2025 Earlier, the firm announced a $1 billion buyback program for its stock that will be progressively executed through at-the-market offerings and block trades. Since Forward Industries has made its Solana investments its core mission, this move increases shareholders’ value as it ramps up the number of tokens that each share represents. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Is On a Downtrend But Has Hit a Key Support Already In the past 30 days, SOL has lost 31.8% of its value as market sentiment soured following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff increase on Chinese imported goods. The daily chart shows that Solana has been on a downtrend since late September, making a series of lower highs and lower lows along the way to form a descending price channel. However, the token just hit the channel’s lower bound, favoring an upcoming bounce. The token also broke below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory. For SOL to recover, it would have to break out of this price channel. Ideally, it would have to move above $180 first to confirm a trend reversal. If that happens, Solana could rise to $200 soon and possibly beyond as institutional interest remains strong. Forward Industries’ recent moves highlight how Wall Street is waking up to the potential of altcoins like Solana and the tech powering them. One early-stage project capitalizing on this shift is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a new crypto presale building the first high-speed Bitcoin Layer-2 on Solana. By using Solana’s lightning-fast network, HYPER aims to fix Bitcoin’s biggest limitations – slow speeds, high fees, and lack of programmability – while unlocking access to trading, staking, and DeFi. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Raises $26M to Kickstart a New Era for Bitcoin BTC holders have been unable to earn yield on their investment for years, as the network’s design can’t cope with the speed that DeFi applications need. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) solves this by launching the first true Bitcoin L2 with the help of the Solana blockchain to allow developers to launch yield-farming, staking, payments, and other decentralized apps. The Hyper Bridge was created to receive BTC tokens safely on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2. Once in there, investors can use any of these dApps without having to leave the Bitcoin ecosystem. Analysts believe that, once the solution becomes widely adopted by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for $HYPER should skyrocket. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up your favorite wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or SOL or use a bank card to complete the transaction.

According to the analyst, a potential recovery in Bitcoin is supported by several technical and macro factors, saying: Colin Talks Crypto predicts the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 200-day SMA will cross around mid-November. He noted that in past cycles, this crossover has often signaled local bottoms, suggesting this technical signal carries a strong possibility of a reversal. Related News: Three Top-Level FED Officials Made Critical Statements About the US Economy According to the analyst, gold's price action is a leading indicator for Bitcoin. He stated that the upward trend in gold could create similar upward momentum for BTC. Colin Talks Crypto argued that even as Bitcoin surged to $126,000, classic cyclical indicators showed no signs of “overheating” or overly optimistic market sentiment, suggesting the bullish cycle may not have peaked yet. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's announcement that the balance sheet contraction program (QT) will end on December 1st strengthens the possibility of a new period of liquidity, according to analysts.

The potential US government shutdown resolution could significantly impact digital asset markets that have been struggling with volatility. How Does Market Uncertainty Affect Crypto Investments? Market uncertainty creates hesitation among both institutional and retail investors. When political deadlocks occur, trading volumes typically decrease as participants wait for clearer signals. Glassnode’s experts note that this particular period of market uncertainty has been especially challenging for cryptocurrency recovery. The connection between traditional finance and crypto markets means political stability matters more than many realize. As Negentropic, the shared account of Glassnode co-founders, emphasized on X: markets thrive on clarity . This fundamental truth explains why reducing market uncertainty becomes crucial for sustainable growth. What’s Driving the Shutdown Resolution Efforts? Senator John Thune’s push for a vote signals serious progress toward ending the political standoff. Key developments include: Senate Republicans preparing to work through the weekend Bipartisan negotiations gaining momentum Growing recognition of economic consequences This determined approach suggests lawmakers understand how market uncertainty affects broader economic conditions. The resolution timing becomes particularly important for cryptocurrency markets approaching critical technical levels. Why Should Crypto Traders Monitor Political Developments? Political decisions directly influence investor sentiment and capital flows. The current market uncertainty stems from not knowing how government operations might affect: Regulatory clarity for digital assets Institutional investment decisions Macroeconomic policy directions Glassnode’s tracking of on-chain data shows how periods of market uncertainty correlate with reduced network activity and trading volumes. Resolving the shutdown could reverse these trends quickly. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? Reduced market uncertainty typically benefits risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Historical patterns suggest that when political clarity emerges, we often see: Increased institutional positioning Retail investor confidence returning Improved liquidity conditions The current situation reminds us that market uncertainty, while challenging, often creates opportunities for prepared investors. Monitoring Glassnode’s analysis and on-chain metrics can help navigate these transitions effectively. Conclusion: Clarity Brings Opportunity The potential resolution of the US government shutdown represents more than just political progress—it signals reducing market uncertainty that has constrained cryptocurrency markets. As Glassnode’s analysis highlights, markets function best with clear operating environments. For crypto investors, this development could mark the beginning of a more favorable period for digital asset appreciation and adoption. Frequently Asked Questions How does a government shutdown affect cryptocurrency markets? Government shutdowns create market uncertainty that reduces investor confidence across all risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This typically leads to lower trading volumes and increased volatility. Why is Glassnode’s analysis important for crypto investors? Glassnode provides crucial on-chain data and market insights that help investors understand underlying market conditions beyond price movements alone. What happens to crypto markets when political uncertainty decreases? Reduced political uncertainty generally leads to improved market sentiment, increased trading activity, and often higher prices for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. How quickly might markets react to a shutdown resolution? Cryptocurrency markets typically react quickly to political developments, with price movements often occurring within hours of significant announcements. Should investors change their strategy during periods of market uncertainty? While every investor’s situation differs, many experts recommend maintaining long-term strategies while potentially using volatility to accumulate positions at favorable prices. What other factors should crypto investors watch alongside political developments? Investors should monitor regulatory announcements, macroeconomic data, technological developments, and on-chain metrics alongside political news. Found this analysis helpful?

Wednesday trading saw the meme coin log just 94 billion tokens in exchange flows, roughly $850,000 worth of activity for a token boasting a $5.3 billion market cap. SHIB Exchange Netflow. Source: CryptoQuant . This flatline in wallet-to-exchange transfers signals a deep market hesitation. Stagnation like this has historically been associated with one of two outcomes: a gradual decline as interest fades, or a quiet accumulation phase that sets up for a rebound. The muted flow data reflects a lack of conviction on both sides of the market, likely tied to FUD surrounding the prolonged U.S. government shutdown and renewed fears of slowing economic growth. For any decisive Shiba Inu price action beyond the current multi-month bleed, traders will need to watch for major catalysts like ecosystem updates or broader shifts in risk sentiment. Shiba Inu Price Prediction: What’s Next for SHIB? Shiba Inu’s prolonged consolidation phase continues, with the meme coin locked within a six-month descending channel now retesting its lower boundary as support. This creates a decisive moment for the wider Shiba Inu price direction; the slow bleed could escalate into a free fall. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, descending channel. Source: TradingView. A recent RSI bounce from the 30 oversold threshold has already stalled, reflecting a lack of buying conviction, while the MACD histogram widens below the signal line, confirming persistent sell-side dominance. All eyes remain on the $0.0000085 level, the final structural barrier before a potential channel breakdown. Should this level fail, a retest of the $0.0000067 demand zone 25% lower looks likely. Still, a rebound in momentum could spark a reversal. Regaining the $0.000012 zone would position SHIB for a potential breakout move, targeting $0.000024, a 170% rally if broader sentiment improves. Maxi Doge: The Token That Could Step Up as SHIB Struggles Meme coin rotations are as consistent as they are powerful. When one market leader hits a ceiling, capital naturally flows to the next high-upside contender. That dynamic is now playing out between Shiba Inu and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , an early Doge-themed token gaining traction just as SHIB grapples with liquidity issues. Every bull run eventually delivers its own parabolic Doge-themed runner. Shiba Inu carried the torch from Dogecoin in 2021, then Floki, Bonk, Dogwifhat, Neiro, and most recently Dowge. The hype is already translating into numbers. The $MAXI presale has raised nearly $4 million, while early backers are earning up to 78% APY through staking rewards. For those who missed out on the Doge wave before, MaxiDoge could be the next chance to catch a meme coin breakout before it takes off.

Data shows that whales have been accumulating vast amounts of ETH within a short window. The accumulation coincides with Ethereum recording a new network throughput milestone, which adds further strength to the argument that the cryptocurrency is still solid even during the price weakness. Whales Scoop Up $1.12 Billion Worth Of ETH In 48 Hours Data from the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain shows that some Ethereum whale addresses have accumulated a combined 323,523 ETH, valued at approximately $1.12 billion, within the past 48-hour period. One of the biggest purchases came from a whale who bought 257,543 ETH, worth about $896 million, at an average price of $3,480 per ETH. Another cluster of addresses, referred to as the “seven siblings” by Lookonchain, collectively added 37,971 ETH worth $133 million at an average price of $3,515. The data also revealed participation from a whale known for swing trading Ethereum through over-the-counter deals, who acquired 14,004 ETH for about $45.5 million. This address bought these ETH at an average price of $3,247, which was exactly around the recent price low. Two newly created wallets also bought 10,000 ETH and 4,005 ETH, respectively, totaling more than $47 million combined. In total, whales accumulated 323,523 ETH at an average price of $3,469, showing how most of them are capitalizing on the price break below $3,400. Price Weakness Might Be Setting Stage For Breakout Although Ethereum’s drop might have unsettled some traders, the whale accumulation might be pointing to optimistic days ahead. The large-scale accumulation below $3,400 has contributed to the successful defense of $3,200. This follows the trend of accumulation leading to maintenance of support levels. If ETH maintains stability above $3,200 support and on-chain activity continues to climb, then the price could rebound above $4,000 before the end of the month. The first step, however, in this is for Ethereum to reclaim $3,800 and register a strong weekly close above the level. Interestingly, Ethereum’s network performance has maintained its level of robustness despite the market’s correction. The blockchain ecosystem recently achieved a new record throughput of 24,192 transactions per second (TPS), setting a new benchmark for activity across the network.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Whales|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Lookonchain|tps|Transactions Per Second,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-06 23:00:21

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst According to Crypto Onchain, Bitcoin hit an intraday low of $98,900 before buyers pushed the price back above $101,000 and later to $103,400 at the time of writing. The top coin’s year-to-date gain sits at close to 10% after peaking at an all-time high of $126,300 in October. Bears Break $107,000 Fortress Based on analysis from Crypto Onchain and on-chain data provider CryptoQuant, Bitcoin lost the $107,000 support after roughly 130 days of trading in a band between that level and $123,000. The move sparked heavy liquidations in the futures market. About $640 million in long positions were wiped out over a 24-hour stretch. That figure, market watchers say, is the second-largest daily long liquidation event since June 2021. The October 10 event remains the largest on record for comparison. The $101,000 level has taken on extra meaning. Traders point out that bulls stepped in near $98,000 and pushed the market back toward the lower trendline of a long-term ascending channel that has held since October 2023. Reports have disclosed that defending this channel bottom would be read as a bullish sign, while a close below it could signal deeper losses and a break in the market structure that has supported the rally. CME Gap Could Pull Price Lower A nearby gap on the CME futures chart sits between $92,000 and $93,000, roughly 10% from current prices, and some analysts are watching that area closely. Historically, Bitcoin has often filled such gaps before resuming its next leg up, and the gap is now a possible target if bearish pressure continues. At the same time, strong buying interest around the $101,000 zone could halt any slide and force prices back up. Liquidations And Market Mood The cascade of liquidations amplified selling pressure, particularly among highly leveraged traders. Futures positions were forcefully closed, and this intensified the intraday drop. Yet buyers were quick to take advantage of the lower levels, and the rebound to $103,000 level showed a degree of demand at current prices. Volume and near-term momentum will be key in determining whether that demand is durable.

Broader moves in US equities and large trader activity are also being monitored, since they helped trigger the recent pullback.

The Securities and Exchange Commission ended its five‑year lawsuit against Ripple back in August, clearing a major weight off the company. Then this Wednesday in San Francisco, investors tied to Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities put $500 million into Ripple, valuing the company at $40 billion, according to Bloomberg. The timing was almost rude. The new valuation plus a roughly 9% rise in XRP this year pushed Chris into billionaire territory with a net worth of $15.3 billion, placing him among the world’s richest for the first time. Most of that wealth comes from his 18% stake in Ripple and his 2.7 billion XRP tokens worth about $6.3 billion as of Wednesday. He also holds $1.8 billion in real estate and assorted investments. That breakdown was confirmed directly to Bloomberg. Born in San Francisco and raised in Cupertino, Chris is 64, and has been building companies since the 1990s, long before crypto existed. He went to San Jose State at first to study aeronautics. Chris switched to business, transferred to San Francisco State, and graduated with accounting and business administration degrees in 1984. He then worked as an auditor at Chevron before earning an MBA from Stanford. Building companies and building wealth The first time Chris made real noise was in 1996 when he co‑founded E‑Loan, the first platform to show consumer credit scores online. He sold it nine years later to Popular Inc. for $300 million. After that, he created Prosper Marketplace, a group‑lending platform partly inspired by his wife’s background in Cambodia. He stepped away from Prosper in 2012. A few months later, he co‑founded OpenCoin, which became Ripple. The company focused on cross‑border payments using XRP. Chris led it as CEO until 2016, then moved into the chairman role. His work now also stretches into local issues. With his wife, Lyna Lam, he supports Cambodian community projects, climate efforts, food access, and San Francisco’s neighborhood revival. The pair founded the A Khmer Buddhist Foundation and are helping fund a new temple in San Jose. Locally, Chris has been politically active for years. He funded a private camera network in San Francisco to combat property crime and recently gave $9.4 million to help the city build a real‑time police operations center. Ripple, meanwhile, is not going public anytime soon, as was reported by Cryptopolitan. When asked Wednesday, Ripple President Monica Long said, “No plan, no timeline.” Crypto markets shake while fortunes shift While Chris climbs the billionaire rankings, crypto trading is showing the opposite energy. On Hyperliquid, one wallet opened two heavy short positions against Bitcoin and XRP totaling $140 million. That trader is now up $3.1 million in about nine hours. The wallet was funded with $7 million USDC routed through an Arbitrum wallet that redeemed from a zero address, making the source hard to trace. Observers are already speculating insider knowledge. This reminds traders of the alleged “Trump insider whale” who reportedly made almost $200 million by shorting before the $19 billion liquidation crash on October 10. Someone linked to that wallet denied having inside info, even though the shorts lined up exactly before former President Trump’s tariff threat tanked markets. Bitcoin has been sliding. It dropped 7.4% on Tuesday in New York to $96,794, its first fall below $100,000 since June. That puts it more than 20% below last month’s record high. Ether dropped up to 15%, and several altcoins lost 50% this year. Many traders stayed sidelined after the October liquidation wave. Open interest in Bitcoin futures is still low. Even though funding rates look favorable, few are stepping back in. Bitcoin is up less than 10% this year, trailing stocks and failing to hedge portfolios.

A PwC and AIMA survey shows 55% of global hedge funds now hold crypto, while Spain’s ITER plans to sell $10M in Bitcoin bought for $10K. Meanwhile, Robinhood considers adding BTC to its treasury, signaling rising corporate adoption even as technical charts hint at a $100K support retest. Hedge Funds Expand Crypto Exposure as Institutional Interest Deepens A growing share of hedge funds is now venturing into digital assets. According to a joint report by PwC and the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), 55% of global hedge funds currently hold cryptocurrency-related investments, up from 47% a year ago. The survey of 122 funds found that while participation is expanding, most allocate less than 2% of their portfolios to crypto, averaging around 7%. The rise coincides with clearer U.S. regulatory guidance under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has encouraged broader institutional participation. More than half of hedge funds invested in crypto, global survey says https://t.co/Nds7ZH5fVT — The Globe and Mail (@globeandmail) November 6, 2025 Even after October’s leveraged “flash crash”, 67% of hedge funds reported using crypto futures for exposure — underscoring continued confidence in digital assets. With hedge fund capital at a record $5 trillion, increasing participation highlights a growing belief that BTC and blockchain-based investments are becoming a permanent fixture in global finance. Spanish Research Institute to Sell $10M Bitcoin Bought for $10K in 2012 In Spain, the Institute of Technology and Renewable Energies (ITER) plans to sell 97 Bitcoin, originally purchased for under $10,000 in 2012 as part of a blockchain research initiative. Those holdings are now worth over $10 million. The Tenerife Island Council, which oversees ITER, confirmed that it’s coordinating the sale through a bank authorized by the Bank of Spain and CNMV. Proceeds will be reinvested into quantum research and other technology projects.

However, the sale underscores how public institutions are becoming more comfortable managing digital assets — even as European banks remain cautious. The move also highlights BTC’s extraordinary long-term return potential, offering a case study for other public entities exploring crypto-backed financing. Robinhood Considers Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Robinhood (NASDAQ: HOOD) may soon join the list of corporate Bitcoin holders. CEO Vlad Tenev confirmed the company is “still evaluating” whether to add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury after a surge in crypto-related income. During the firm’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Tenev noted that holding BTC could deepen the firm’s connection to the crypto economy but would also commit a portion of company reserves. The company’s crypto trading revenue jumped 339% year over year, reaching $268 million, or nearly 20% of total income.

If Robinhood follows through, it would join MicroStrategy and Metaplanet in using Bitcoin as a treasury asset, a move likely to strengthen institutional trust and reinforce BTC’s demand base. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Nears $100K Support as Downtrend Deepens Bitcoin (BTC) is trading near $101,300, continuing its pullback after failing to hold above $104,400. The price remains confined within a descending triangle, a pattern that typically signals continued weakness unless buyers step in at key support levels. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin continues to form lower highs, while the 20-EMA has crossed below the 50-EMA, confirming short-term bearish control. A clean break below $100,400 could trigger a measured move toward $97,600, a level aligning with the previous swing low from late October. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI, hovering near 32, shows fading momentum but hasn’t yet flashed a strong reversal signal. Recent candles — including several spinning tops followed by a bearish engulfing pattern — suggest indecision before another potential dip. If BTC rebounds from the $100K region, a breakout above $103,700 could reverse the structure and open upside targets at $106,300 and $111,000. For now, traders may favor short setups toward $97,600, keeping stops above $103,700. While near-term sentiment leans bearish, the broader uptrend remains intact. This correction could provide long-term investors a valuable accumulation window ahead of renewed institutional flows and improving macro conditions. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of BTC on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem. While BTC remains the gold standard for security, Bitcoin Hyper adds what it always lacked: Solana-level speed.

A revolutionary Dogecoin spot ETF could become reality in just 20 days, according to recent developments. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that Bitwise is using an innovative approach that might fast-track approval for this groundbreaking financial product. What Makes This Dogecoin Spot ETF Different? Bitwise confirmed they’re utilizing the SEC’s 8(a) procedure for their Dogecoin spot ETF application. This non-standard listing method removes the “delaying amendment” from the S-1 application. Consequently, the filing automatically becomes effective after 20 days unless the SEC takes separate action to delay it. The traditional ETF approval process typically involves extensive review periods and potential delays. However, this Dogecoin spot ETF application bypasses much of that bureaucracy. Here’s what makes this approach unique: Automatic effectiveness after 20 days No formal SEC approval required SEC must actively intervene to delay Streamlined regulatory process Why Should Investors Care About This Development? This potential Dogecoin spot ETF represents a significant milestone for cryptocurrency adoption. Mainstream investors who have been hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges could finally access Dogecoin through traditional brokerage accounts. Moreover, institutional participation might increase substantially. The timing couldn’t be more crucial. As cryptocurrency markets mature, regulated investment products become increasingly important. This Dogecoin spot ETF could open doors for: Retirement account investments Institutional portfolio allocation Simplified tax reporting Enhanced security measures What Challenges Remain for This Dogecoin ETF? Despite the optimistic timeline, potential hurdles still exist. The SEC maintains authority to intervene during the 20-day window. Regulatory concerns about market manipulation and investor protection could prompt commissioners to delay the process. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s volatility might concern regulators. However, the growing acceptance of digital assets suggests that a Dogecoin spot ETF approval aligns with broader financial trends. The market has been eagerly awaiting such products since Bitcoin ETF approvals paved the way. How Will This Impact the Crypto Market? Successful launch of a Dogecoin spot ETF could trigger significant market movements. Other meme coins might see increased attention, while established cryptocurrencies could benefit from renewed investor interest. The approval would validate Dogecoin’s position in the digital asset ecosystem. Furthermore, this development might accelerate similar applications for other cryptocurrencies. The streamlined 8(a) procedure could become a model for future crypto ETF filings, potentially transforming how digital assets enter traditional markets. Final Thoughts on This Groundbreaking Development The potential 20-day timeline for Bitwise’s Dogecoin spot ETF represents a revolutionary approach to cryptocurrency regulation. This method demonstrates how financial innovation can adapt existing frameworks to accommodate emerging asset classes. While uncertainties remain, the prospect of accessible Dogecoin investment through regulated channels marks significant progress for the entire crypto industry. Frequently Asked Questions What is the 8(a) procedure for ETF approval? The 8(a) procedure allows ETF filings to automatically become effective after a set period unless regulators take separate action to delay them. How long until the Dogecoin spot ETF becomes effective? If the SEC doesn’t intervene, the Dogecoin spot ETF could become effective in 20 days from the filing date. Can the SEC stop this Dogecoin ETF approval? Yes, the SEC can take separate action to delay or prevent the ETF from becoming effective during the 20-day window. What makes this Dogecoin ETF different from Bitcoin ETFs? This represents one of the first meme cryptocurrency ETFs and uses a different approval process than most Bitcoin ETFs. How can investors participate in this Dogecoin ETF? Once effective, investors can purchase shares through traditional brokerage accounts, similar to other ETFs. What risks should investors consider? Investors should consider cryptocurrency volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and market risks before investing. Found this information valuable?

The privacy coin’s explosive rally was accompanied by a shielded supply reaching all-time highs, around 16 million ZEC, representing over 76% of the max supply. Technical analysis reveals that an ascending trendline support is guiding the advance, with Fibonacci extensions projecting potential targets at the $1,669 and $3,428 levels. Privacy Coin Revival Amid Surveillance Concerns Only 17 of the top 100 cryptocurrencies posted gains over the past 90 days, with privacy coins ZEC, XMR, DASH, and DCR leading the sector’s performance. Source: CoinMarketCap Zcash jumped from $50 to over $130 in early October , reaching its highest levels since April 2022, despite remaining 96% below its all-time high of $3,193 in 2016. Trading volume surged by nearly 6% today to $1.6 billion, while shielded transactions increased by over 60% month-over-month. Market participants attributed momentum to renewed interest in zk-SNARKs, the zero-knowledge proof system that enables transaction verification without disclosing sender, recipient, or amount details. The technology allows optional privacy, appealing to users facing tightening oversight. Naval Ravikant described Bitcoin as “insurance against fiat” and Zcash as “insurance against Bitcoin,” suggesting that ZEC offers protection against the transparent nature of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is insurance against fiat. ZCash is insurance against Bitcoin. https://t.co/rqMrR3bW7O — Naval (@naval) October 1, 2025 During that same period, Grayscale announced the opening of Zcash Trust private placement, providing accredited investors with exposure through a structure similar to its Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The announcement lifted confidence as the ZEC market cap rose from $700 million to over $1.8 billion. Currently, the market capitalization sits close to $9 billion. However, there has been a major regulatory concern, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation, which will take effect in 2027, explicitly bans privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. Article 79 prohibits banks and crypto service providers from handling anonymity-enhanced tokens, including Monero and Zcash, as well as anonymous accounts. Fibonacci Extensions Target $1,669 Following Trendline Respect ZEC trades at $542 with 29.67% weekly gains following an ascending channel advance from September lows. The trendline framework shows consistently higher lows while maintaining an upward trajectory, representing textbook uptrend characteristics. Source: X/@eliz883 Using the Fibonacci extension methodology, some analysts project potential resistance levels at $1,669 (3.618 Fibonacci extension) and $3,428 (4.236 extension). The current positioning at a 2.618 extension around $521 already represents a substantial achievement, as major corrections historically begin. Looking at the 15-minute timeframe, consolidation appears near the upper boundary after multiple successful lower trendline support tests. Long wicks indicate that selling pressure is emerging at current levels, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback before a continuation. Volume characteristics support technical levels with real liquidity, making price action more readable and reactions maintain continuity. ZEC’s inclusion among the top cryptocurrencies provides even more liquidity opportunities to validate technical analysis. Currently, ZEC’s next trajectory depends on maintaining the current ascending trendline support, which is around $480-$490, while challenging the $550-$600 resistance. Breaks above $600 with volume confirmation could trigger momentum toward $1,000 psychological level, while trendline violations would signal a correction toward $350-400, invalidating bullish structure.

The company made the announcement Thursday, saying it has formed a new group, the MAI Superintelligence Team under Mustafa Suleyman, who now leads Microsoft’s AI division. The goal is not just to match human intelligence with machines, but to push way beyond it. According to Bloomberg, the company now wants to create AI systems that can outperform humans across every field, including health care, clean energy, and materials science. Mustafa said in a blog post that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is when AI can do anything a human can. But he added that superintelligence goes “far beyond that performance.” He said the new mission is to build what he calls Humanist Superintelligence, a system designed to serve people directly rather than chasing tech milestones. He named personal AI assistants, better medical outcomes, and sustainable energy solutions as real-world targets. The company previously wasn’t allowed to chase AGI, based on a restriction from its original deal with OpenAI, but that clause is now gone. Microsoft forms new team after scrapping AI restriction The updated contract between Microsoft and OpenAI removed the restriction that had kept Microsoft boxed into less powerful models. The new agreement also gives the tech company a 27% stake in OpenAI’s public-benefit company, letting it now work independently on AGI and more advanced tools. The changes come as the two firms shift from full collaboration to what looks more like strategic rivalry. Mustafa, who’s 41 years old, joined Microsoft in 2024 after leaving Inflection AI, a startup he co-founded. Microsoft licensed Inflection’s intellectual property and brought him on board to help shape its future in AI. Since then, Mustafa has reorganized internal teams, moved key Microsoft AI staff into the new group, and hired people from Google’s DeepMind, which he also helped start. Mustafa told employees in September that Microsoft plans to spend big to build out its AI systems. So far, those models are still smaller than the biggest ones coming from OpenAI or Google, but the goal is to catch up fast. He said their timeline extends to 2032, the year when Microsoft’s rights to use OpenAI’s models expire. Microsoft and OpenAI now compete on multiple fronts While Microsoft still leans on OpenAI to power its Copilot chatbot, it’s also building its own voice, image, and text models. That means Microsoft is trying to reduce its dependence on OpenAI, even as the two remain deeply connected. Still, some Microsoft employees allegedly told The Wall Street Journal that replacing OpenAI’s technology could take years. The consumer Copilot app, which runs on OpenAI’s models, still beats Microsoft’s version in downloads. OpenAI, meanwhile, is working with Microsoft’s rivals, including Amazon and Oracle, and building out its own data centers. The company’s enterprise product now makes up 40% of its revenue, up from 30% earlier this year, according to Sarah Friar, OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer. That growing independence is turning the former allies into direct competitors in more ways than one. Meta, OpenAI, and others have already formed superintelligence teams, but Mustafa says his group is staying away from certain areas. One example: he’s refusing to build AI that generates erotica, putting distance between his team and competitors. Mustafa is framing Microsoft’s version of superintelligence as more people-centered, but the company isn’t hiding the fact that it wants to own the future of AI, on its own terms. Microsoft’s 365 Copilot tools for business are still powered by OpenAI, but if Mustafa’s team delivers, those dependencies may disappear. Still, there’s no clear timeline. Microsoft’s push is just beginning, and even the company admits replacing what it gets from OpenAI won’t be fast. Microsoft stock plunged by 1.4% on Thursday evening, trading at $500.01 in New York. But for now, the company is betting that chasing superintelligence is worth the risk.

XRP emerged as the second most popular cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin, favoring a bullish XRP price prediction for the long term. Kaiko, a leading global firm that provides crypto market data to institutional players, shared its ranking for the third quarter of this year. XRP was tied with Ethereum (ETH) in second place, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL). The company analyzes a series of characteristics for each token to construct a 100-point index that analyzes the asset’s strengths and prospects. These factors include potential use cases, resources, and research. Institutional awareness seems to be rapidly growing for the XRP Ledger. Recently, the first spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) for XRP was launched, and it has already attracted $100 million from investors despite the latest market sell-off. XRP Price Prediction: Buyers Show Up at $2.10 – Is a Recovery Starting? XRP has recovered today after taking some significant hits in the past few days that pushed down its price to nearly $2.08. The price has bounced near $2.30, and trading volumes have retreated, indicating that the selling pressure could be easing. XRP has bounced off a critical support at $2.10, suggesting the recent sell-off may have been an overreaction. For the bullish momentum to continue, XRP needs to break above the 200-day exponential moving average and see the RSI push past its 14-day moving average. Despite the pullback, institutional interest in Ripple’s ecosystem remains strong – a key factor behind a long-term bullish XRP price prediction. If the rebound gains strength, XRP could rally toward $4 in the coming weeks. To fully capitalize on any upside, secure storage matters.

But with RentStac (RNS), the math behind a million-dollar opportunity is more straightforward than most early-stage projects. With the current presale offering a 100% token bonus, now is the moment to crunch real, life-changing numbers. Forget elusive hype. Here’s how much you’d need to put in today to join the seven-figure club and why timing matters more than ever. Understanding the Million Dollar Path At the heart of RentStac’s presale is a simple deal: buy tokens at $0.025 each and get double the amount for free. If you miss this window, future phases offer no such bonus, and token prices will only rise. Let’s break it down. The goal is $1,000,000 in token value when RNS reaches a hypothetical target price of $1 per token, a milestone analysts believe is possible due to the project’s real estate backing and deflationary model. The Calculation: How Much to Invest for $1M At the current rate, $1,000 will buy you 40,000 RNS tokens. With the 100% bonus, that becomes 80,000 tokens. To amass $1 million at $1 per RNS, you’d need 1,000,000 tokens. Here’s the formula: 1,000,000 tokens ÷ 80,000 tokens (per $1,000) = 12.5 So, you’d need to invest: 12.5 x $1,000 = $12,500 By putting in $12,500 during this presale phase, you’d secure 500,000 tokens outright. Thanks to the bonus, this doubles to 1,000,000 RNS, your ticket to $1 million if/when the token reaches $1. Why Acting Now Counts This doubling event is strictly limited to the ongoing presale. In later rounds, the bonus vanishes and the token price climbs. Waiting will cost you either more money for the same position or far less exposure for the same investment. Early backers aren’t just hoping for token appreciation—they’re locking in a historic entry point that won’t repeat. Crypto and real estate rarely line up for such high-leverage entry. Real Estate Backing, Dual Earnings, No Hassle RentStac stands out for more than just the numbers. Every RNS is linked to real rental properties, with ownership organized in secure Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Forget landlord headaches, property management is handled professionally while you keep full transparency from your dashboard. Returns don’t stop at future price gains. The platform uses property-generated income for buybacks and burns, adding scarcity to your holdings. Plus, staking options let investors earn a piece of monthly rent, paid in USDC, directly from holding and staking their tokens. Security First, Big Plans Ahead RentStac smart contracts are already audited and scored at 92.48%, with an additional CertiK audit underway. The roadmap prioritizes rapid property acquisition, stronger rental income flows, and major exchange listings in the next year. These milestones could add both liquidity and visibility, fueling the journey toward that $1 target and rewarding early commitment. Millionaire Math in Your Hands Few opportunities in crypto offer such a calculable shot at $1 million. With the presale’s doubling bonus, a $12,500 investment today could, at $1 per RNS, hit the million mark. Miss the presale, and the path only gets steeper.

Trader Says The Low Must Form Now,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/did-bitcoin-just-bottom-low-must-form-now/,"A day after another billion-dollar liquidation cascade, veteran crypto analyst Trader Mayne says his core thesis is unchanged: the bull cycle’s top is “not in,” and the market is in the process of printing a weekly cycle low that could set up one more leg higher into year-end. “I’ve been banging on the drum about the high not being in,” he said in a November 5 video, adding that he remains “a BTC maxi from the spot perspective,” despite tactical longs and shorts that have been hit-and-miss during the recent volatility. Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Mayne framed the selloff—coming less than a month after an almost $20 billion wipeout on October 10—as a feature, not a bug, of late-cycle price discovery. He argued that speculative leverage rapidly re-accumulated in altcoins and that majors still offer sufficient volatility with clearer structure. “People were right back on with the leverage… You really can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” he said, while emphasizing he now “primarily focus[es] on the majors” and holds a core spot stack he hasn’t sold. His near-term timing anchor is cycle theory. Drawing on the four-year template popularized by Bob Loukas, Mayne said he expects the broader crypto top to land between late 2025 and early 2026, but he stressed the immediate setup is about nailing a weekly low within a narrow window that “extends until about mid next week, November 10.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $87,000 If This Happens He wants to see “time and space away from this low” and a reclaim of the monthly open around $110,000–$112,000 to confirm that the decline has been exhausted. If that structure forms, he intends to treat $98,000 as the operative bull-market invalidation on a weekly-closing basis: “That will confirm to me that this is our bull market invalidation… at least in the worst case you have a cut point at like $100k Bitcoin.” Mayne supplemented the timing view with a cross-asset read that he says has been reliable in prior impulses: gold tends to rally first, with Bitcoin following “about 60 to 90 days later.” He cited chart work showing gold’s advance now roughly 80–90 days old, which, if the relationship holds, would “line up very well with Bitcoin being ready to make its next move.” He also expects the BTC-versus-gold cross to bounce, implying outperformance of Bitcoin over the precious metal through year-end: “I’m pretty confident this chart is due for a big bounce and we’re going to see gold underperform Bitcoin for the remainder of the year.” A more subjective—but, in his telling, telling—input is the absence of a true “blow-off” in Bitcoin versus the vertical arcs seen in AI-heavy equities and gold. With megacaps like Nvidia running hard since the spring and gold printing a sharp leg higher, he argued that “it just doesn’t sit right… that Bitcoin hasn’t had [its blow-off],” suggesting latent upside energy remains to be released if the weekly low locks in. On market microstructure and seasonality, Mayne pointed to early-month dynamics. In many green months, he said, the low forms in the first third of the month, analogous to how Monday’s range often frames the week for intraday traders. If November is destined to close higher, an early-month low coupled with a monthly-open reclaim would be consistent with his cycle read. “If we’re bullish for November… I want to be a bull above the monthly open,” he said. The scenario analysis was not one-sided. Mayne repeatedly acknowledged bear signals that have emerged on higher timeframes, including a weekly structure break, prior sweeps on the weekly and monthly, and building momentum divergences. Related Reading: Galaxy Digital Slashes Bitcoin EOY Price Target To $120,000 He warned of the possibility that the recent range resolves as distribution—“maybe the banks literally came in… and they’ve just been distributing on us here”—and laid out a lower-high path in which a rally fizzles beneath or just above the prior peak before breaking down. “There’s a world where we make an all-time high, but it’s just a weak one… you’re going to have the biggest bear div of all bear divs up here,” he said, cautioning that a marginal new high followed by a swift rejection would flip his posture. In the medium-term, he remains open to two competing macro arcs. In the base case, the classic four-year rhythm holds, the late-2025 window marks the cycle top, and 2026 skews bearish, though he expects drawdowns on Bitcoin to be “truncated” relative to prior 80% collapses given deeper institutional participation. In the alternative, the market “right-translates”—an atypical extension in which a new all-time high could print as late as Q1 2026—forcing a reassessment of the four-year template. Either way, he said, his plan is to sell strength on the next leg and reassess if the market presents higher-low continuation after a new high: “If the market appears to still be bullish, guess what? I can get back on the bull train.” Mayne also flagged the US dollar as a 2026 risk pivot, arguing the DXY is carving a “serious low” on multi-month and yearly structures that could precede a “deflationary rally.” While not a one-to-one driver, he said a strong dollar tends to pressure crypto and other risk assets. That macro overlay, combined with what he views as froth in AI-linked equities, underpins his caution beyond the next advance. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $103,412.

54111695,https://timestabloid.com/?p=88868,1762473607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Could Settle U.S. Debt If Trump Does This,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-could-settle-u-s-debt-if-trump-does-this/,"Discussions about the potential use of Ripple’s XRP to help reduce the United States’ mounting national debt have resurfaced within the crypto community. Although the concept remains speculative and highly improbable, several analysts and XRP supporters have examined how the digital asset could theoretically assist the government in addressing its $38 trillion debt crisis. Ripple’s Escrow and U.S. Treasury Intervention In early 2025, XRP researcher Dr. Horace Drew proposed a hypothetical situation where President Donald Trump might gain control of Ripple’s escrowed XRP holdings and assign them to the U.S. Treasury. According to Drew, the escrow, estimated to hold roughly 35 billion XRP valued at around $200 billion at that time, could potentially serve as a financial instrument for the government. ""How's he gunna do it LOL?"" If Trump takes all of the XRP in escrow for the US Treasury (current value $200 billion), then slowly drives the value of XRP up to $500, the total US national debt of $34 trillion will be cancelled. — Red Collie (Dr. Horace Drew) scientist/inventor (@RedCollie1) January 23, 2025 He speculated that if the government managed the asset strategically, perhaps by supporting policies that elevate XRP’s market value to around $500 per token , it could theoretically generate enough capital to offset a significant portion of the national debt, which stood near $34 trillion when he presented the scenario. A similar theory emerged from another community commentator known as UtilityFTW, who suggested Ripple could voluntarily transfer its escrow holdings to the government. In his view, integrating RippleNet as a national payment infrastructure could further strengthen this approach, positioning XRP as a tool for high-value settlements and potentially contributing to debt reduction. Renewed Attention and Trump’s Remarks The conversation reemerged in October 2025 following remarks by Carl Higbie, a host on Newsmax, who proposed a more active government role. He suggested that the Treasury could invest $1 trillion in XRP to boost its market price, sell portions of the token for profit to pay off part of the debt, and then repeat the process. While such an approach would introduce extreme volatility, Higbie argued that this method could gradually chip away at the nation’s financial burden. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Interestingly, Donald Trump himself has publicly mentioned the idea of using cryptocurrency to pay off U.S. debt, though his comment appeared partly sarcastic. Still, his statement helped reignite debates over the potential intersection of crypto assets and national fiscal policy. At present, Ripple’s escrow holds about 35 billion XRP, with an estimated market value of $87.5 billion, based on XRP’s current price of $2.27 . When compared with the $38.1 trillion U.S. national debt, equivalent to roughly $111,559 per citizen, the escrow’s worth remains negligible. Analysts have calculated that for just half of the debt to be covered, the value of the escrow would need to total $19 trillion, which would require XRP to reach approximately $543 per token. To eliminate the entire debt, XRP would have to trade near $1,088, representing an increase of over 43,000% from current levels. Market Outlook and Expert Predictions Despite the implausibility of these numbers, several analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term price potential. Rob Cunningham, host of The KWUL Show, recently suggested that strong market inflows, particularly from institutional investors and potential ETF approvals , could push XRP’s value between $200 and $500. Similarly, projections from Changelly analysts anticipate that XRP might exceed the $500 mark by 2040, driven by broader adoption and market maturity. Adding to this sentiment, Dom Kwok, founder of Easy A, advised investors to hold their XRP positions long-term, asserting that the token could eventually surpass $1,000 if market and regulatory conditions align favorably. While the concept of the U.S. government leveraging XRP to erase its national debt remains purely hypothetical, the discussions underscore the growing intersection between cryptocurrency and macroeconomic policy.

54111713,622701,1762473627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54111713.jpeg,Crypto Leaders React to Mamdani’s Win: Will New York’s Blockchain Adoption Come to a Halt?,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-leaders-react-to-mamdanis-win-will-new-yorks/,"The election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York City sent ripples through the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities, raising questions about the future of the city’s digital-asset ecosystem. With Mamdani securing victory on November 4, 2025, defeating Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, the crypto sector is weighing both uncertainty and opportunity in equal measure. This is a major concern for the crypto community, considering that New York is one of the wealthiest cities in the world. Crypto Community Weighs The Upside And Risks Although Mamdani is neither a vocal advocate for cryptocurrencies nor an outright adversary, his record suggests tighter oversight rather than unbridled growth. Prior to the election, he supported measures such as a moratorium on proof-of-work crypto mining and co-sponsored legislation to tax crypto transactions. Notably, prominent industry figures offered tempered responses. Anthony Pompliano cautioned against surrendering New York’s legacy of ambition, asserting that “the city will continue to stand for ambition and opportunity.” Meanwhile, Scott Melker observed that mayors come and go and that “New York will be fine.” On the other side, voices like crypto advocate Max Keiser predicted economic meltdown, linking Mamdani’s victory to potential deterioration in the city’s financial standing. What Does It Mean For Blockchain Adoption In New York? Under the previous administrations, New York positioned itself as a global hub for digital assets. For example, anti-money laundering scrutiny and crypto licenses were advanced under Cuomo’s tenure. With Mamdani’s win, the city may shift toward stricter regulation and consumer protection over innovation-led growth. For instance, city-level bills such as A7788 (crypto legal fees/fines) and A8966 (crypto transaction tax) are already under consideration. However, it’s important to note that city administrations have limited power over state and federal crypto law, much of the regulatory muscle lies outside the Mayor’s reach. As such, while the pace of blockchain adoption in New York might slow or redirect, the industry is unlikely to see a full halt. Broader Political Climate Adds Complexity Mamdani’s surprising mayoral campaign also drew sharp responses from Donald Trump. The president , who had publicly endorsed Cuomo, warned of funding cuts to New York if Mamdani were elected, calling him a “communist” and suggesting New York could face federal withdrawal of support. Trump’s remarks targeted Mamdani directly in his speech, further stoking uncertainty. For crypto firms operating in New York, the interplay of city policy, federal posture, and broader political shifts will be critical to monitor. In sum, Mamdani’s victory creates a new ecosystem for crypto and blockchain in New York, one that may prioritise consumer protection, housing, and affordability over rapid token-driven growth. While this may slow some initiatives, the city’s role as a global financial hub makes a full retreat unlikely.

The law, signed in July, is designed to establish a national framework for payment stablecoins and provide more certainty regarding how digital dollar tokens are regulated nationwide. Circle sent its comments this week as part of the Treasury’s current rulemaking procedure. It will flesh out what the law will look like in practice. The firm stated that the rules must be strong enough to protect users while also being balanced enough to enable innovation and competition in the expanding digital payments industry. The company’s theme is that every issuer should be subject to the same standards, regardless of whether it is a bank or a private entity, and whether it operates in the US or abroad. Circle urges consistent rules across all stablecoin issuers In its submission, Circle argued that stablecoins used for payments need to be fully backed by cash or high-quality, highly liquid short-term assets . This is intended to prevent stablecoins from losing value in times of financial crisis. The firm argued that clear backing rules are necessary to prevent risks from being imposed on ordinary people. The rules, Circle added, should ensure that no one group receives more favorable treatment. Banks, non-bank providers of financial services that utilize technology, and finance companies whose stablecoins are available in US markets should all be subject to the same supervisory regime. The company warned that inconsistent regulation could push risky stablecoin activity out of the United States and beyond the reach of overseers who are monitoring such products. “Clear conditions of access to US markets, including shared supervision between the US and trusted foreign regulators, will foster competition while protecting against risks arising offshore,” the company said. Circle also stressed the need for robust enforcement. It also stated that penalties for breaking the rules should be substantial enough to deter misuse and maintain confidence in digital assets. Without this, it argued, the aims of the GENIUS Act would not be achieved. Industry groups submit recommendations to the treasury Circle wasn’t the only group that registered its comments. Coinbase also filed comments. The back and forth prompted the Treasury to clarify that a prohibition on paying interest on stablecoin balances should be limited to parties that issue the coins, not to individuals seeking returns from exchanges or platforms in other ways. The request follows warnings from US banking institutions that some stablecoin offerings could begin to operate like bank deposits, potentially displacing traditional savings accounts in a competitive market niche. The GENIUS Act won’t happen overnight. It would take effect 18 months after signing, or 120 days after the regulators complete and finalize the detailed rules. If regulators act quickly, the law might be in effect sooner; if rule-making is slow, there will be a delay. Meanwhile, Congress is considering a broader law that would establish regulations for these digital markets, including guidelines for categorizing and overseeing cryptocurrencies, trading platforms, and digital asset securities. The bill already passed the House earlier this year, but it has not progressed in the Senate. Pauses for long recesses, backroom negotiations, and other legislative priorities have slowed the effort. The doors remain open for bipartisan dialogue, according to news reports, but no new proposals are being brought to the table. Those estimates had been more like 2026, according to previous analyses by congressional leaders. Currently, the schedule is precarious due to present delays.

During its Q3 2025 earnings call event on Wednesday, Treasurer Shiv Verma told analysts the company is “still thinking about it,” when asked if Bitcoin might be part of its treasury plan. Shiv added that:- “We spend a lot of time thinking about this and have this debate constantly,” making it clear the idea isn’t off the table. Shiv didn’t confirm any timeline, but said the team continues to “actively look at” how it could fit into the company’s future. This comes as crypto trading continues to grow into a major part of the business. Robinhood’s crypto revenue jumped 339% in the twelve months ending September 30, with crypto now making up a fifth of total income for the quarter. For the quarter alone, Robinhood’s crypto revenue surged 67.5% to $268 million, driven by heavier volumes, as Cryptopolitan reported . CFO Jason Warnick told investors there was a “nice step-up in crypto volumes” that helped push overall transaction-based revenue to $730 million, a 129% increase from the same time last year. Robinhood pushes tokenized stocks while crypto-linked stocks tank At the same earnings call, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said Robinhood has entered the early stages of a rollout to support tokenized stocks. He explained that the company is currently in “phase one,” with phase two expected to allow secondary trading on Bitstamp. Eventually, the company wants these stock tokens to land on DeFi platforms, letting people trade tokenized shares the same way they trade other tokens on-chain. Vladimir said “where it really starts to get interesting is phase two and phase three,” but gave no hard dates for when that will happen. Meanwhile, crypto’s October crypto downturn left many companies who already hold Bitcoin or Ethereum sitting on unrealized losses. Firms like Metaplanet and Trump Media bought their BTC positions earlier in the year when prices were stronger. Those holdings are now worth less than what was paid. The same thing is happening on the Ethereum side. Bitmine and Sharplink also bought during the April to July rally, and are now down since that momentum vanished. Meanwhile, Robinhood’s own stock just dropped over 10% today. It wasn’t alone. The broader crypto sector got crushed. Investors are reacting to a mix of U.S. job numbers, renewed trade tensions, and a government shutdown that’s now stretched into day 37, the longest in history. Coinbase sank by more than 6%, Galaxy Digital dropped 4%, and mining firms weren’t spared either. MARA Holdings fell 3.6%, CleanSpark and Riot Blockchain lost over 5% each.

This significant decline reveals growing anxiety among traders and could signal important market movements ahead. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Actually Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a crucial emotional barometer for digital asset markets. This powerful tool calculates market sentiment using multiple data sources to give investors a clear picture of collective psychology. When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear, it often indicates potential buying opportunities for brave investors. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where lower numbers represent fear and higher numbers indicate greed. Currently sitting at 24, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen three points from yesterday’s reading, confirming the market’s negative shift. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? Understanding the components behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index helps investors interpret its signals accurately. The index combines six key factors: Volatility (25%) – Measures price fluctuations Trading Volume (25%) – Tracks market activity levels Social Media Mentions (15%) – Monitors online discussions Surveys (15%) – Captures direct investor sentiment Bitcoin Dominance (10%) – Watches BTC market share Google Trends (10%) – Follows search interest This comprehensive approach ensures the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reflects genuine market emotions rather than temporary price movements. Why Should Investors Care About Extreme Fear Readings? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index enters extreme fear territory, it often creates contrarian opportunities. Historically, periods of extreme fear have frequently preceded market recoveries. However, investors should approach these situations with caution and proper risk management. The current Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 24 suggests that many traders are becoming increasingly nervous about their positions. This emotional state can lead to panic selling, which might create attractive entry points for long-term investors. What Actionable Insights Does the Current Reading Provide?

The agreement was reported by Bloomberg and comes as Nvidia faces a brutal three-day market crash that’s erased $450 billion in market value. While Kazakhstan deepens its AI commitment, Wall Street is offloading Nvidia shares at record pace, hammering the company with its worst stock decline since early January. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev is pushing to turn Kazakhstan into a heavyweight in Eurasia’s future economy. In a speech delivered in late September, president Tokayev said the country is working to become a full digital power within three years, mostly through a new government body: the Ministry of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Development, which replaces the previous Digital Ministry and now serves as the main structure overseeing AI integration across government, science, and industry. The transition isn’t just branding. The previous ministry managed projects in space, cybersecurity, public services, innovation, and digitization. That same structure will now be powered by AI to reshape those pillars. By August 2024, 93% of government services in Kazakhstan were already running online. National internet coverage was nearly universal at 92.9%, just barely under Germany’s level. Kazakhstan makes AI bet while U.S. douses chip optimism The new AI ministry will also advise Tokayev directly through a presidential AI Development Council. Olaf Groth, a German-American council member, said the goal is not just digitization, but cognification; developing systems that think, analyze, and act. Kazakhstan plans to leverage Nvidia’s chips to build compute capacity for everything from university research to national AI labs. It’s a move to position the country as a regional broker for artificial intelligence development and services. As Kazakhstan goes all-in, Nvidia’s stock is collapsing. On Thursday, the company’s shares dropped 3.6%, leading the entire tech sector lower. The fall started earlier in the week after comments from David Sacks, the Trump administration’s artificial intelligence and crypto policy lead. In a post on X, Sacks said, “There will be no federal bailout for AI. The U.S. has at least five major frontier model companies. If one fails, others will take its place.” He added, “I don’t think anyone was actually asking for a bailout. (That would be ridiculous.) But company executives can clarify their own comments.” Sacks was reacting to a statement made the day before by Sarah Friar, the CFO of OpenAI, during a Wall Street Journal event. Friar had said OpenAI might benefit from a government guarantee to help finance AI chip infrastructure. That comment triggered immediate backlash. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, later denied the company was requesting any government support or protection from failure. AI giants scramble as valuations wobble and China pressure builds The entire chip sector has been under pressure since Wednesday when Qualcomm released solid earnings, but investor fear around AI overvaluation tanked sentiment across the board. Analysts are flagging that top AI companies Nvidia, AMD, Oracle, Broadcom, CoreWeave, and even Amazon are getting too entangled, with shared supply chains and overlapping partnerships making the sector/make look a tad too fragile. Things got worse for Nvidia after CEO Jensen Huang made headlines for saying China “will win” the AI race in a comment given during an interview with the Financial Times. Jensen followed up later on X, posting that China was only “nanoseconds behind” the U.S., but stressed, “It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide.” Don’t just read crypto news.

This represents one of the largest Bitcoin options expirations we’ve seen this year, creating significant potential for market volatility and price movements that could impact traders and investors alike. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean? According to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, Bitcoin options with a notional value of $4.69 billion will expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC today. The sheer scale of these Bitcoin options creates substantial market pressure that traders need to understand. When this many contracts expire simultaneously, it often triggers increased trading activity and potential price swings. The put/call ratio for these expiring Bitcoin options stands at 0.81, indicating slightly more call options than put options. This ratio provides crucial insight into market sentiment and potential price direction. Moreover, the max pain price sits at $108,000, representing the strike price where the maximum number of options would expire worthless. How Do Bitcoin Options Work and Why Should You Care? Bitcoin options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a specific price by a certain date. Today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration involves both call options (betting on price increases) and put options (betting on price decreases). Understanding this dynamic helps explain why such large expirations can create market turbulence. Key factors to watch include: Put/call ratio of 0.81 – Slightly bullish sentiment Max pain price of $108,000 – Potential price magnet $4.69 billion notional value – Substantial market impact Simultaneous Ethereum options expiration – Broader market effects What About the Ethereum Options Expiring Today? Adding to the market significance, Ethereum options worth $700 million will expire at the same time as the Bitcoin options. These Ethereum contracts show a put/call ratio of 0.95 and a max pain price of $3,650. The nearly equal put/call ratio suggests more balanced sentiment compared to Bitcoin, but still represents substantial market exposure that could influence broader cryptocurrency trends. The simultaneous expiration of both Bitcoin and Ethereum options creates a compounded effect on market liquidity and volatility. Traders often adjust their positions in both assets as these large expirations approach, creating interconnected price movements across the crypto market. What Should Traders Watch For After Expiration? Following today’s massive Bitcoin options expiration, market participants should monitor several key indicators. Price action around the $108,000 max pain level could provide important signals about short-term direction. Additionally, trading volume and open interest changes will reveal how much capital is redeploying into new positions. Historical patterns suggest that large Bitcoin options expirations often precede periods of increased volatility as market makers adjust their hedging strategies. The rebalancing of these substantial positions typically creates trading opportunities for alert market participants who understand the mechanics behind Bitcoin options settlements. Final Thoughts on Today’s Critical Market Event Today’s $4.7 billion Bitcoin options expiration represents a significant market event that could shape short-term price action and volatility. The combination of substantial notional value, specific put/call ratios, and max pain prices creates a complex tapestry of market forces that every crypto trader should understand. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, historical analysis shows that large Bitcoin options expirations often mark important inflection points in market trends. Frequently Asked Questions What time do the Bitcoin options expire? The Bitcoin options expire at 8:00 a.m. UTC on November 7th. What does a put/call ratio of 0.81 mean? A put/call ratio of 0.81 indicates there are slightly more call options than put options, suggesting somewhat bullish market sentiment. What is the max pain price? The max pain price of $108,000 is the strike price where the maximum number of options contracts would expire worthless, potentially acting as a price magnet. How does this compare to previous Bitcoin options expirations? At $4.7 billion, this represents one of the larger Bitcoin options expirations we’ve seen recently, indicating growing institutional participation in crypto derivatives. Will this affect Bitcoin’s price significantly? Large options expirations often create short-term volatility as positions are adjusted, but the long-term impact depends on broader market factors. Are Ethereum options affected by Bitcoin options expiration? Yes, since both expire simultaneously and many traders hold positions in both assets, there can be correlated effects on pricing and volatility. Found this analysis helpful?

Rockstar’s statement on X said, “We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve.” The delay announcement came shortly after groups of former workers gathered outside Rockstar’s UK offices, protesting dismissals that took place in late October. They said management “don’t care about delays to GTA 6” and argued the firings were retaliation against union activity, which Rockstar’s parent denied. Earnings reveal revenue growth and ongoing losses Anyway, Take-Two also reported quarterly earnings today, and its revenue for the second quarter increased 33% to $1.96 billion, beating LSEG estimates of $1.72 billion, thanks to to strong performance from titles like NBA 2K26, Borderlands 4, and ongoing sales of Red Dead Redemption 2. Despite the revenue boost, the company reported a net loss of $133.9 million, or 73 cents per share. The same period the previous year recorded a net loss of $365.5 million, or $2.08 per share, showing the loss narrowed but was still significant. CEO Strauss Zelnick said on the earnings call that:- “We remain both excited and confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience. With the most robust pipeline in our company’s history, we expect to achieve record levels of Net Bookings in Fiscal 2027.” Strauss pointed to continued growth momentum, especially in mobile and the NBA 2K franchise, which has now sold more than 167 million units worldwide. Take-Two raised its bookings outlook to a range of $6.38 billion to $6.48 billion, above the prior estimate of $6.05 billion to $6.15 billion. Reports showed that roughly 40 employees were dismissed after participating in a private Discord chat group involving trade union discussions. A spokesperson for Rockstar’s parent allegedly told Bloomberg this:- “Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies. This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.” The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain argued otherwise, calling the firings “one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry.” Alex Marshall, president of the union, said in response to Rockstar’s allegations that the gamemaker was “afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.” Security enforcement has been strict at Rockstar since the 2022 leak, when unfinished footage of the next game surfaced publicly. Then in early 2024, staff were required to return to office five days a week, with Rockstar citing security concerns, something the workers’ union called the return-to-office mandate a “reckless” decision. Meanwhile, the community responded in its own way. On Polymarket, traders gave a 48% chance that Bitcoin hits $1,000,000 before GTA 6 releases, and nearly 50% odds that Jesus returns first.

New ecosystem data demonstrate that gaming is becoming the dominant force on-chain, striking a positive note as stalled DeFi projects have been unable to cope with an increasingly turbulent market and talks constrict around key jurisdictions. The contrast also highlights a divide emerging within Web3, with entertainment-focused apps gaining traction alongside financial protocols that are under attack from both external and internal interests. Web3 gaming gains momentum Blockchain gaming also made inroads, despite a slight decline in Web3 use overall. However, the number of daily active wallets on Web3’s networks actually dropped by 3% to approximately 16 million. Meanwhile, gaming-based activity as a percentage of total activity increased its share to 27.9%, the highest of the year. These integrations will never stop with gaming, but will also include user onboarding, gameplay experience, and the expanding reach of multiple blockchain networks. Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon were the main contributors to this activity, with notable projects including Raydium and Pump.fun , JupiterExchange, OKX Dex, and PancakeSwap v2. These platforms could benefit from social trading, lower trading costs, and increased liquidity. Trading in NFTs also surged. Overall NFT volume rose 30% to $546 million, with more than 10.1 million transactions — the most in any month in 2025. Gaming-related digital assets and utility-backed NFTs, integrated with gaming, loyalty programs, and virtual identity customization, were among the biggest volume drivers. This transition occurred from the world of speculative collectibles to that of active and interactive digital artifacts. DeFi absorbs losses and responds October was also a bad month for DeFi, which lost 6.3% of its TVL last month to end the period with $221 billion before tumbling further to start November at $193 billion. The drop occurred following a severe market crash on October 10, which led to massive liquidations. Roughly $20 billion in leveraged positions on large exchanges and lending platforms were erased within days. The case itself worsened as the DeFi protocol Stream Finance lost $93 million. The episode has highlighted wider systemic risks that may be posed by stablecoins and lending against collateral. Analysts later identified at least $284 million more in exposure from similar themes in other DeFisystems. Regulatory pressure compounded the stress. A group of Senate Democrats pleaded for non-custodial wallets to implement know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. News of the proposal was met with mixed reactions, and industry players speculated that requirements to identify customers who use self-custodied wallets could hinder property-like ownership among users and innovation in favor of less stringent rules across a more accommodating regulatory landscape. Ethereum companies, in response, started banding together to lobby. A coalition of projects, including Aave, Uniswap, Lido, Curve, and The Graph, has formed the Ethereum Protocol Advocacy Alliance. The coalition advocates that decentralized infrastructure should be included in the conversation when discussing regulations and that blockchain networks should remain open-access. Elsewhere, Oracle network RedStone has introduced a new platform called Credora, aiming to offer consistent risk and credit scores across decentralized finance (DeFi) lending markets. The system is designed to make trading more transparent and help reduce systemic risk, especially that inherent in over-leveraged credit markets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The integration will surface current market probabilities directly in the search box and chart how those odds change over time. Ask a question like what will GDP growth be for 2025, and Google will display the latest pricing from these markets alongside recent shifts in sentiment. Polymarket And Kalshi Secure Billion-Dollar Valuations As Event Trading Expands Beyond Finance Google framed the move as a way to bring event odds into everyday workflows for investors, researchers, and the crypto crowd that already tracks market implied probabilities across rates, elections, sports, and macro. KALSHI AND GOOGLE FINANCE PARTNER TO ADD PREDICTION MARKETS — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) November 6, 2025 The tie-up lands as both platforms scale. Polymarket drew a recent investment from Intercontinental Exchange that valued the company around $9b. Kalshi raised $300m at a $5b valuation , signaling growing institutional interest in event contracts. Adoption has widened beyond finance. In October, Polymarket and Kalshi became the first officially licensed prediction markets of the NHL, a milestone that put more pressure on incumbent wagering apps like DraftKings and FanDuel to respond. Prediction Markets Cement Place In The New Retail Trading Cycle Once access switches on, Google Finance users will be able to ask questions in natural language and receive relevant market data in line. That includes point-in-time probabilities and historical ranges that show how views evolved around key headlines. Brokerages are leaning in as well. Robinhood partnered with Kalshi in August to offer contracts on professional and college football, then expanded the slate. On the latest earnings call, CEO Vlad Tenev said prediction markets are on fire, pointing to rapid user uptake. Volumes back that up. Weekly turnover across prediction markets topped $2b in late October for the first time, led by Polymarket’s sports boards and a busier slate of news-driven questions. Regulatory positioning is shifting too. Polymarket, once restricted from serving the US after a 2022 CFTC action, re-entered the conversation this year by acquiring a venue with a Designated Contract Market license, paving the way for compliant US access. Prediction Prices Could Become A Core Market Metric If Google’s Rollout Succeeds Competition is building. Bloomberg reported this week that Gemini is preparing to launch prediction market contracts , subject to regulatory approval, with plans to move as soon as possible once cleared. That would place the exchange alongside Kalshi and Polymarket in a fast-growing category. For crypto-native traders, the Google integration could tighten the loop between price discovery and public data. Market odds that once lived on specialized sites will sit a search away, creating a broader funnel for event-driven trading and risk hedging. If the rollout lands smoothly, prediction prices may become another default data point next to stock quotes, bond yields and exchange rates. For a market that prizes real-time signals, crowd-sourced probabilities could become part of the daily toolkit.

54112909,623280,1762476427,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54112909.jpeg,Ripple Prognose: Wohin geht die Reise für XRP und wie profitiert BTC Hyper von diesem Trend?,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-xrp-nutzen-historie-ausblick-prognose-kurs/,"Ripple (XRP) verbindet schnelle, kostengünstige grenzüberschreitende Zahlungen mit wachsender Real-Welt-Anwendung. Die Kursgeschichte zeigt starke Schwankungen, zuletzt jedoch eine Konsolidierung mit Potenzial. Auf Basis aktueller Nutzungs- und Marktindikatoren lassen sich vage Szenarien für die kommende Zeit formulieren – mit gebotener Vorsicht. Die Kryptowährung Ripple (XRP) steht im Mittelpunkt vieler Erwartungen – nicht nur als Spekulationsobjekt, sondern vor allem als digitales Mittel für reale Zahlungsflüsse. Während viele Coins auf bloße Kursbewegung setzen, will XRP eine Brückenfunktion im globalen Finanzsystem übernehmen. In diesem Artikel schauen wir erst auf den Nutzen von XRP, dann auf die historische Entwicklung und zuletzt wagen wir eine vorsichtige Prognose, wohin die Reise gehen könnte. 1. Nutzen und Funktion von XRP Der zentrale Zweck von Ripple liegt darin, Transaktionen zwischen verschiedenen Währungen schneller, günstiger und effizienter zu gestalten. XRP dient als Brückenwährung, um Liquidität zwischen Banken und Zahlungsdienstleistern bereitzustellen. Damit schließt Ripple eine Lücke, die traditionelle Finanzsysteme bisher nur schwer überwinden konnten. Das XRP Ledger bietet Transaktionen in wenigen Sekunden und mit minimalen Gebühren – ein Vorteil, der besonders bei grenzüberschreitenden Zahlungen relevant ist. Hinzu kommt die Nachhaltigkeit: Im Gegensatz zu Bitcoin oder Ethereum verwendet XRP kein energieintensives Mining. Das Netzwerk validiert Transaktionen über einen Konsens-Mechanismus, der ressourcenschonender arbeitet. Diese technische Effizienz macht Ripple zu einem der umweltfreundlicheren Akteure im Krypto-Bereich. Zunehmend entstehen auch neue Anwendungen: Neben klassischen Finanzlösungen wird XRP zunehmend in DeFi-Projekten, Smart-Contract-Plattformen und Stablecoin-Konzepten integriert. Dadurch wächst die Relevanz des Coins weit über seinen ursprünglichen Zweck hinaus. 2. Historische Preisentwicklung von XRP Seit seiner Einführung im Jahr 2012 hat Ripple eine bewegte Geschichte hinter sich. Der Kursverlauf war durch extreme Schwankungen geprägt – von rasanten Anstiegen bis zu tiefen Korrekturen. Besonders 2017 erlebte XRP einen spektakulären Höhenflug, als der Preis über die Marke von drei Dollar stieg. In den Folgejahren folgten teils drastische Rückgänge, die den Markt wieder auf den Boden der Realität brachten. In den letzten drei Jahren zeigte sich ein stabileres Bild. 2021 profitierte XRP zeitweise vom allgemeinen Aufschwung am Kryptomarkt, fiel danach jedoch zurück und bewegte sich lange um die Marke von 50 Cent. 2025 mit der Wahl von Trump in den USA startete eine Phase des Aufschwungs, in der XRP zwischen 2,20 und maimal 3,40 Dollar pendelte. Aktuell ist Ripple wieder etwas gefallen und pendelt ca. bei 2,30 und 2,50 Dollar. Diese Seitwärtsbewegung deutet darauf hin, dass der Markt aktuell nach einer klaren Richtung sucht. Ein wesentlicher Faktor in der Kursentwicklung war der Rechtsstreit zwischen Ripple Labs und der US-Börsenaufsicht SEC. Die teilweise positive gerichtliche Entscheidung von 2023 brachte wieder Vertrauen in das Projekt zurück und könnte langfristig den regulatorischen Druck mindern – ein möglicher Grundstein für zukünftiges Wachstum. 3. Vorsichtige Prognose und Ausblick Die Zukunft von XRP hängt maßgeblich davon ab, ob Ripple seine technologische und regulatorische Position weiter stärken kann. Sollte es dem Unternehmen gelingen, neue Banken, Zahlungsdienstleister und FinTechs als Partner zu gewinnen, könnte sich die Nachfrage nach XRP deutlich erhöhen. Der Ausbau des Netzwerks und die mögliche Einführung neuer Produkte – etwa XRP-gestützte Stablecoins – könnten die Akzeptanz zusätzlich fördern. Analysten sehen für die kommenden Jahre moderate Aufwärtspotenziale, sofern die allgemeine Marktlage stabil bleibt. Eine Rückkehr zu früheren Hochs erscheint auf absehbare Zeit zwar ambitioniert, jedoch nicht ausgeschlossen, falls sich die institutionelle Nutzung weiter ausweitet. Kurzfristig könnte XRP zwischen 2,20 und 2,80 Dollar schwanken, während langfristig ein langsamer, nachhaltiger Anstieg denkbar wäre. Allerdings bleibt jede Prognose unsicher : Der Kryptomarkt reagiert sensibel auf politische Entscheidungen, technologische Entwicklungen und wirtschaftliche Trends. Anleger sollten daher Geduld und Realismus mitbringen – und sich bewusst sein, dass Chancen und Risiken eng beieinanderliegen. Bitcoin Hyper: Technologische Erweiterung in einem zunehmend institutionellen Kryptomarkt Der Kryptomarkt entwickelt sich rasant weiter – und Bitcoin steht dabei im Zentrum. Immer mehr Banken, Fonds und börsennotierte Unternehmen integrieren Bitcoin in ihre Strategien. Parallel dazu gewinnen auch Ethereum und Ripple durch regulatorische Klarheit und institutionelle Nutzung an Akzeptanz. Diese zunehmende Institutionalisierung stärkt das Vertrauen in digitale Vermögenswerte und sorgt für nachhaltiges Wachstum. Bitcoin Hyper ist so positioniert, dass es direkt von dieser Entwicklung profitieren kann. Es baut auf der bewährten Sicherheitsarchitektur des Bitcoin-Netzwerks auf, die als das sicherste und dezentralste Computersystem der Welt gilt, und erweitert sie um moderne, hochperformante Funktionen. Technische Brücke zwischen Stabilität und Skalierbarkeit Bitcoin Hyper nutzt die Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), um die technische Lücke zwischen Bitcoin und modernen Hochgeschwindigkeits-Blockchains zu schließen. Dadurch können Transaktionen in Echtzeit verarbeitet werden – mit extrem niedrigen Gebühren und voller Smart-Contract-Funktionalität. Über eine dezentrale Canonical Bridge werden BTC-Assets sicher zwischen Layer 1 (Bitcoin) und Layer 2 (Bitcoin Hyper) übertragen, ohne zentrale Verwahrung. BTC bleibt dabei vollständig durch das Bitcoin-Netzwerk abgesichert, während Nutzer auf der Hyper-Schicht blitzschnell handeln, zahlen und Anwendungen ausführen können. Diese Architektur verbindet das Beste aus beiden Welten: Bitcoins Stabilität und Sicherheit mit Solanas Effizienz und Skalierbarkeit. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Der Treibstoff für Bitcoins nächste Evolutionsstufe Der Token $HYPER bildet das ökonomische Rückgrat des Systems. Er wird für Transaktionsgebühren, Staking und Governance verwendet und ist somit integraler Bestandteil der Netzwerkökonomie. Wenn Bitcoin – getrieben durch institutionelles Kapital und wachsende Marktakzeptanz – weiter an Bedeutung gewinnt, steigt auch die Relevanz von Bitcoin Hyper. Denn mit jeder neuen Welle institutioneller Adaption wächst der Bedarf, Bitcoin nicht nur zu halten, sondern aktiv zu nutzen.

Miran’s statement came after he mentioned that he anticipates a rate cut in December unless something unexpected occurs during an interview with Jack Farley on the Monetary Matters podcast. The Fed governor also acknowledged that, while the distribution of around-the-table changes is underway, the distribution of views among Fed officials varies. Miran’s remarks follow the Fed’s 25-basis-point rate cut in late October, which lowered the target range to 3.75%–4%. The October cut followed months of elevated inflation , though recent economic data suggest some moderation. Miran calls for a rate cut in the Fed’s December meeting The Federal governor minimized the necessity for more aggressive monetary easing , highlighting that the central bank does not require a 75-basis-point cut and does not need to make up for previous cuts. When addressing economic conditions, Miran described the current decline in the labor market as gradual, rather than accelerating. Therefore, based on his argument, the situation does not require urgent emergency actions. Meanwhile, although Miran expects a rate cut in December , sources have pointed out that the federal governor earlier cautioned that nothing is guaranteed in the end. Still, he shared his belief that the Fed’s decision to continue reducing interest rates is a good idea, possibly even at its final meeting of the year, scheduled for December 9-10. In another interview, Miran outlined earlier forecasts that suggested the likelihood of three rate cuts in 2025. “Has anything changed since then?” the Fed governor asked. When reporters asked Miran about the lack of enough official economic data, he responded that there is insufficient information about the economy due to the government shutdown. He further explained that inflation levels have been lower than expected, and the job market remained steady. On the other hand, sources stated that after several considerations, the Fed decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. This action lowered the target range to 3.75% to 4%. However, Miran was against this move because he wanted a bigger cut, specifically half a percentage point. Regarding his aim to secure a neutral policy stance, Miran mentioned that he prefers a policy stance that strikes a balance, supporting growth without pushing it too hard or holding it back. Fed officials raise concerns about further rate cuts Reliable sources have noted that since the recently held policy meeting, several Fed officials have raised concerns about inflation and are hesitant about reducing rates again in December. Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Fed, commented on the matter, stating that he was not sure about the December rate cut. Additionally, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook and San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly echoed similar thoughts while delivering their speeches. On the other hand, Kansas City Federal Reserve president Jeff Schmid expressed his support for maintaining rates unchanged during the policy meeting. Considering the intense nature of the situation, analysts acknowledged that this situation places Miran in a unique position as he recommends further cuts. This followed his remarks that anything can occur between today and December: new information might be released, there could be surprises, or even the occurrence of unexpected events. “But unless we receive new information that significantly changes our outlook, I believe it would still be a reasonable choice to continue with our current approach,” the Fed governor added.

The latest data reveals a significant shift that every crypto investor needs to understand. The Altcoin Season Index has just slipped to 23, signaling a dramatic change in market dynamics that could impact your investment strategy. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index serves as a crucial barometer for cryptocurrency market sentiment. This important metric compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. When the index scores above 75, we’re in an altcoin season where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. However, the current reading of 23 tells a very different story. Why is the Altcoin Season Index Dropping So Dramatically? Several factors contribute to this significant decline in the Altcoin Season Index. Bitcoin’s recent strength has drawn capital away from altcoins, creating a classic ‘flight to safety’ scenario. Moreover, market uncertainty often drives investors toward established assets like Bitcoin rather than riskier alternatives. Key reasons for the index drop include: Bitcoin dominance increasing across exchanges Institutional preference for Bitcoin over smaller altcoins Market volatility driving conservative investment choices Regulatory uncertainty affecting altcoin projects How Does This Altcoin Season Index Affect Your Investments? Understanding the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 23 helps you make informed decisions. When the index remains this low, it typically indicates that Bitcoin is outperforming most other cryptocurrencies. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but it does suggest a more cautious approach might be wise. Consider these investment strategies during low Altcoin Season Index periods: Diversify but prioritize quality over quantity Focus on established projects with strong fundamentals Monitor the index for signs of reversal Consider dollar-cost averaging into positions When Might We See the Altcoin Season Index Recover? Historical patterns suggest that low Altcoin Season Index readings often precede significant altcoin rallies. However, timing these shifts requires careful market analysis. Watch for these potential catalysts that could boost the Altcoin Season Index: Bitcoin price stabilization Positive regulatory developments Major technological breakthroughs in altcoin projects Increased institutional adoption of alternative cryptocurrencies What Should You Do Now With the Altcoin Season Index at 23? The current Altcoin Season Index presents both challenges and opportunities. While caution is warranted, this could also be an excellent time to research fundamentally strong altcoins at discounted prices. Remember that cryptocurrency markets are cyclical, and today’s underperformers could become tomorrow’s leaders. Essential actions to consider: Review your portfolio allocation Research promising altcoin projects Set clear entry and exit strategies Monitor the Altcoin Season Index regularly Frequently Asked Questions What does an Altcoin Season Index of 23 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 23 indicates that only 23% of top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days, signaling strong Bitcoin dominance in the current market cycle. How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index typically updates regularly as market data refreshes, providing near real-time insights into the relative performance between Bitcoin and altcoins. Should I sell my altcoins when the index is low? Not necessarily. Low index readings can present buying opportunities for fundamentally strong projects, though careful research and risk management are essential. What Altcoin Season Index reading indicates a true altcoin season? An Altcoin Season Index above 75 typically indicates an altcoin season, where the majority of top cryptocurrencies are outperforming Bitcoin. Can the Altcoin Season Index predict market bottoms? While not a perfect timing tool, extremely low Altcoin Season Index readings have historically coincided with potential accumulation zones for altcoins. How reliable is the Altcoin Season Index for investment decisions? The index provides valuable context but should be used alongside other fundamental and technical analysis tools for comprehensive investment decisions.

New DeFi Coin Named Among 2025’s Most Promising Projects,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-big-crypto-under-0-05-new-defi-coin-named-among-2025s-most-promising-projects/,"It takes a couple of years between consideration of a new crypto project that draws the attention of the market to the right reason, not hype, but quality design and steady implementation. One of those projects is in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at only $0.035, it is already turning out to be one of the potential best crypto to watch now, due to its transparent pre-sale, product roadmap, and its sustainable model of tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is constructing a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol, intended to make markets on chains safer and more efficient. Rather than having the speculation, it adds financial mechanistic, which would reward users through participation. The protocol consists of two basic markets. The first one is that of Peer-to-Contract (P2C), a shared market system in which members place their assets and are given the return as mtTokens. These interest-save tokens are a representation of the deposit of the user as well as a part of the earnings of the pool. As an illustration, a user who deposits $1,000 in ETH will be eligible to get mtTokens that will correspondingly increase with interest earned. The second system is the Peer-to-peer (P2P), a lending system that isolates smaller or more specialized assets into their own markets. P2P market transactions allow borrowers to have a variety of loans, both in variable and fixed borrow rates. The size of the loans will be based on a prescribed Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. In cases where the collateral of an individual loan holder is below the safety levels, liquidations are automatically carried out to safeguard the protocol. This mechanism would keep the system solvent and the liquidators are rewarded to repay bad debt by the system. Detailed Presale Overview The presale of Mutuum Finance has been one the most watched DeFi events of the year. Over 17,750 holders and approximately 790 million tokens sold on the project to date means that the project has already raised over $18.45 million. The token began with Phase 1 at $0.01 in early 2025 and has since soared to a value of $0.035 in the current Phase 6, which has increased its value by 250%. The participants who entered at Phase 1 would potentially experience more than 500% appreciation at launch. At present, Phase 6 has been sold more than 83%, showing a profitable and steady demand. The momentum with each presale part is that the allocation and price are fixed so the more the investors participate the faster the sellouts will occur and the price of the tokens will go up. Engagement is another area that Mutuum Finance maintains high as it has a 24-hour leaderboard that gives the daily most significant contributor with $500 worth of MUTM tokens. This incentive plan introduces transparency and interest among investors to join in the early days at increased presale propulsion. The team has also made the process of entry to be made easy by enabling the users to purchase MUTM by card without any purchase restrictions to make it available to both large and retail investors. V1 Launch and Audit V1 launch is one of the Mutuum Finance’s main milestones, which is stated to be live in the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The base features, Liquidity Pool, mt Token, Debt Token and Liquidator Bot will be launched with ETH and USDT as assets to lend, borrow, and use as collaterals to support assets at launch because these are the most liquid and reliable. Security is one of the key concerns. The project has passed a CertiK audit with a 90/100 Token Scan score, which proves its code reliability and the level of security. This will provide the investors with a greater assurance that the project is constructed to be long lasting. Many say that after the V1 testnet launches and the token is listed on $0.06, the visibility will increase significantly. Some analysts have estimated a 5x to 7x price rise, supported by the buy-and-distribute nature of the token, with MUTM buying on the open market redistributed to the user base who stake on the safety module with mtTokens. Stablecoin and L-2 Growth In addition to lending, Mutuum Finance plans to have its own USD-pegged stablecoin. This secure coin shall be on demand and supported by collaterals in the protocol. The interest charged on loans will be directed to the treasury to handle the growth of the ecosystem and to offer stability whenever there is a fluctuation in the market. Layer-2 integration is the other major segment of the roadmap. The group seeks to implement Mutuum Finance on various chains to provide the quickest services and reduce costs to customers. This will not only ensure lending is done efficiently, but also ensure access to greater volumes of liquidity networks. These characteristics are very essential in terms of scalability. Stablecoins generate foreseeable utility, whereas Layer-2 implementation ensures lower expenses and more users are attracted, two factors that have led to the growth of other successful DeFi initiatives in the past, such as Aave. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could be among the top cryptocurrency to invest in below $0.05 this year. With Phase 6 coming to its consummation, and investors scrambling to get allocations before the next price spurt, it is becoming apparent why many analysts have called MUTM one of the best potential ventures in 2025.

Recent data from CoinGecko indicates that Bitcoin has retraced nearly 6% over the past week, a decline that has impacted other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL), all of which have experienced double-digit losses during the same period. Galaxy Digital Lowers Bitcoin Price Target This downturn marks a stark contrast to the bullish sentiment observed earlier in October, when Bitcoin surged to record its current record high slightly above the $126,000 mark due to a wave of margin buying. However, the euphoria was short-lived, as approximately $20 billion in leveraged positions across the crypto market were abruptly liquidated just days later on October 10, contributing to the ongoing lack of confidence among investors. Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital recently revised its year-end Bitcoin price target down to $120,000, a significant cut from the previous estimate of $185,000, attributing this adjustment to the “significant leverage wipeout.” Related Reading: Weakness In Major Cryptos: What Key Technical Metrics Indicate For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Market analytics firm CryptoQuant has pointed out that Bitcoin’s drop below its 365-day moving average near $102,000 could signal a deeper retreat. This moving average has historically acted as a critical support level during this bull cycle, and its failure to hold could lead to a more substantial correction in Bitcoin’s price. In their analysis, CryptoQuant experts elaborated on the conditions necessary for Bitcoin to reverse its current trajectory and potentially reach new all-time highs. They observed that Bitcoin led a global risk-off movement, testing the critical $100,000 support level. This decline was influenced by a stronger dollar and ongoing uncertainties regarding Federal Reserve (Fed) policy, which have dampened broader risk appetites across various asset classes. Notably, there have been four consecutive sessions of approximately $1.3 billion in net outflows from US spot BTC ETFs, reversing what had been one of the strongest tailwinds for the market in 2025. This diminished demand in the spot market has coincided with forced deleveraging, resulting in over $1 billion in long liquidations at recent lows, which briefly breached intraday support before dip buyers stepped in. Stabilization Of ETF Flows Crucial The options market has further intensified volatility, as dealers remain net short gamma around the $100,000 strike, leading to increased hedging activity near this critical level. The $100,000 mark now stands as a psychological barrier, and any stabilization in ETF flows could shift market sentiment, provided no new macroeconomic shocks occur. On the macroeconomic front, the analysts assert that the current environment remains supportive, albeit clouded by the ongoing government shutdown in Washington. However, policy clarity remains elusive. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Needs To Reclaim This Key Level To Prevent Drop To $1,700 The Federal Reserve’s recent 25 basis point cut in October, which included some dissenting opinions, was accompanied by a cautious tone that pushed back against expectations for another cut in December. Markets are currently pricing in a 60-65% chance of a follow-up move, but as the Fed’s blackout period continues, policymakers may become more comfortable with the idea of pausing, which would help maintain a firm dollar and tight credit conditions. For Bitcoin to break higher sustainably, CryptoQuant’s analysis suggests that a reversal in exchange-traded fund outflows and renewed confidence in risk assets will likely be necessary.

54113445,622508,1762477247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54113445.jpeg,Hot Money Floods Binance: $26B In ‘Young Bitcoin’ Inflows Signal Speculative Surge,https://bitcoinist.com/hot-money-floods-binance-26b-young-bitcoin-inflows/,"Bitcoin has managed to reclaim the $100,000 level after briefly dipping below it earlier this week — a move that triggered widespread panic selling and reinforced bearish sentiment across the market. The sharp selloff liquidated leveraged positions and sent fear metrics surging, but the swift recovery shows that buyers are still active near key demand zones. According to a new report by CryptoOnchain, the recent market turbulence coincides with a surge in “hot money” flows to Binance. Data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable spike in monthly Bitcoin inflows to the exchange during October 2025, signaling heightened speculative activity. What’s particularly significant is that this inflow is driven almost entirely by “young” coins — UTXOs aged between 0 and 1 day — suggesting that short-term traders and algorithmic participants are dominating recent movements. This trend highlights a clear uptick in intraday and momentum-driven trading, often linked to volatility and short-lived price swings. While such dynamics can amplify downside risk, they also tend to precede strong market reversals once liquidity stabilizes. As Bitcoin regains footing above the $100K threshold, the market now watches closely to see whether this wave of speculative capital marks the beginning of a broader recovery or just another temporary bounce. “Hot Money” Drives Exchange Activity, but Long-Term Holders Stay Firm According to CryptoOnchain, inflows from “young” Bitcoin coins have surged sharply, jumping from roughly $18 billion in September to nearly $26 billion in October. This marks one of the highest inflow levels in the past 12 months, underscoring heightened activity among day traders, speculators, and arbitrage bots. Such behavior typically emerges when markets experience elevated volatility or uncertainty, as short-term participants move assets onto exchanges to position for quick trades. Historically, sharp increases in exchange inflows often hint at bearish sentiment or potential selling pressure, as traders prepare to take profits or hedge risk. However, the UTXO age breakdown tells a more layered story. Inflows from older coins, typically held by long-term holders (LTHs), remain negligible and close to zero. This divergence indicates that the recent activity is largely short-term in nature, confined to traders reacting to immediate market conditions rather than long-term investors exiting positions. In essence, while “hot money” inflows could amplify short-term volatility, Bitcoin’s structural foundation remains intact. The core investor base continues holding off-exchange, showing resilience amid market turbulence. The report suggests that the Bitcoin market is split into two: speculative capital chasing short-term opportunities on one side, and long-term conviction holders quietly standing firm on the other. This balance could determine whether the next move is another shakeout or the start of a new accumulation phase. Bitcoin Faces Resistance After Brief Recovery Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart shows a fragile recovery following its sharp decline below the $100,000 level earlier this week. After hitting a low near $98,900, BTC rebounded modestly to $103,000, where it now faces immediate resistance from the 20-day and 50-day moving averages (blue and green lines). These averages have started to slope downward, confirming the short-term bearish trend and capping upside attempts. The $105,000–$107,000 zone represents the next critical resistance area. A break above this range would likely attract short covering and signal the first signs of stabilization. However, failure to reclaim this zone could lead to renewed selling pressure, with potential retests of $100,000 or even $97,500, a key psychological support level. Trading volume remains elevated, reflecting ongoing market volatility and uncertainty. While bulls have managed to defend $100K for now, momentum remains weak, and sentiment is still heavily bearish across derivatives and spot markets. Bitcoin is consolidating within a fragile structure, attempting to build a base after significant liquidations. To regain bullish momentum, BTC must reclaim its short-term moving averages and hold above $107K — otherwise, downside risks persist as traders remain cautious following the recent leverage wipeout.

Gross profit grew 18% year over year, driven by continued strength in both Cash App and Square. Full recap on the quarter here: https://t.co/EvXlVqSmUX pic.twitter.com/ielZTquCVG — Block Investor Relations (@BlockIR) November 6, 2025 Mixed Quarter for Block as Bitcoin Still Anchors Revenue Base Market watchers surveyed by Zacks had forecast $6.34b in revenue and earnings per share of $0.63. Actual results came in slightly lower, with $6.11b in revenue and adjusted EPS of $0.54. Gross profit reached $2.66b, up 18% year over year, while net income climbed 64%. The company forecasted fourth-quarter gross profit of around $2.75b, implying 19% annual growth. Adjusted operating income came in at $409m versus consensus estimates of $473m, while EBITDA rose 3% to $833m, narrowly missing projections of $840m. Bitcoin revenue totaled $1.97b, down from $2.4b a year earlier, yet it remains Block’s second-largest revenue stream behind subscriptions and services. Bitcoin costs dropped to $1.89b from $2.36b during the same period in 2024. Company Expands Bitcoin Suite Even as Holdings Face Quarterly Markdowns The firm’s BTC holdings stood at 8,780 BTC as of Sept. 30, up from 8,485 at the start of the year. Those holdings, valued at more than $1b, saw a negative remeasurement of $59m in the quarter and $178m year-to-date. Block has continued expanding its Bitcoin ecosystem. In October, it launched new payment tools and a merchant wallet to help sellers accept Bitcoin directly. Earlier this year, the company paid $40m to settle allegations from the New York Department of Financial Services over compliance gaps tied to its BTC operations. Founded by Dorsey in 2009, Block has evolved from a payment processor into a broader financial platform with deep exposure to digital assets. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 earlier this year marked a milestone for one of the highest-profile Bitcoin-integrated companies in the US. Shares Slip Post-Earnings, but Analysts Cite Long-Term Crypto Strategy as a Strength Dorsey has long described Bitcoin as “the internet’s native currency” and said his mission is to make it usable for everyday payments. He once remarked that if he were not working on Twitter or Block, he would be dedicating his career entirely to Bitcoin development. Shares continued to slide after the report, down more than 11% in late trading. Still, many analysts view Block’s long-term Bitcoin exposure as strategic, particularly as institutional adoption of crypto assets accelerates globally. Meanwhile, Dorsey’s advocacy for everyday Bitcoin use is gaining traction in Washington. Sen. Cynthia Lummis is drafting legislation to exempt small crypto transactions from capital gains taxes, a proposal inspired by Dorsey’s call to make bitcoin a medium of exchange rather than just a store of value.

Their effort comes as word has spread that the company, SAP SE, the German enterprise software giant, has attracted renewed interest from potential buyers. The pressure arises as software valuations have cooled and public-market investors are voicing concerns about where companies should position themselves for the next leg of growth. For some time now, BlackLine has been recognized as a leader in the financial close and reconciliation automation software category. It counts corporate finance departments among its customers, who rely on its products to automate additional manual accounting-related tasks and produce end-of-month reports more efficiently. The company was a leading beneficiary of the larger move to cloud computing over the past decade. Revenue growth has also slowed, although it has decelerated from an extremely high historical level. The broader markets have become less inclined to underwrite long-term profits for subscription-style software vendors in a booming economy. The only way for BlackLine to fulfill its potential, in their view, is by combining with a larger player, say, SAP, that can integrate its products, sell them worldwide, and innovate at a much faster clip on alternative uses for the technology. Investors push for strategic review A few investment firms that own significant chunks of BlackLine have informed the board in recent weeks that it may need to consider selling itself. Among them are Ananym Capital Management, Tensile Capital Management, and Sheffield Asset Management. A second large shareholder has also privately thrown its support behind the concept. BlackLine is trading at a discount to its long-term potential, they say, particularly as software designed to automate the financial close market heats up. An acquisition by a well-financed acquirer may allow the company to grow more rapidly and enhance product integration, while providing immediate benefits for shareholders in the form of a premium buyout price . The pressure started mounting after the activist investment firm Engaged Capital publicly advocated for a sale. The letter stated that the company is at a strategic crossroads: The business has positions of strength in the market for finance automation, but growth has slowed, margins are declining, and investor sentiment has turned negative. BlackLine’s chief executive, Owen Ryan, hinted at the surging phone traffic during an earnings call last month. The board is aware of how shareholders feel and maintains regular conversations with investors, he added. However, he offered no specifics on the next steps for launching an official sales process. Nevertheless, proponents of BlackLine’s current approach argue that there remains significant room for growth in the world of finance transformation. They also note that an era of technology may have dawned . However, many companies are still stuck with old-school manual ledgers containing a significant amount of revenue, one to which Palabra has relatively appealing access. However, for those who do want a sale now, the window to extract that kind of value may well be today, not in some more distant tomorrow, when bidding wars and, with them, pricing power will only grow worse. SAP moves to strengthen its cloud finance strategy SAP had already attempted to acquire BlackLine earlier this year with an acquisition offer for the company’s shares, according to media reports. BlackLine’s board at the time rejected the offer, claiming that it could create better long-term value for itself independently of StreetAccount. Shares of BlackLine have been lackluster this year, recently closing in the mid-$50s. The shares dropped further after the company lowered its profit forecast, as investors are increasingly skeptical that it can deliver better-than-expected performance on its own. With investors increasing the pressure and given changes in market dynamics, BlackLine is being presented with a major strategic choice: continue along its current path of independence or take advantage of an opportunity for partnership or outright sale. Considering the interest from deep-pocketed players, including SAP, the company’s next move could be the one that either helps it grow its global presence or leaves it too far behind in a march to dominate a crowded finance automation landscape. Investors will be watching closely, as the result could set the tone for how software companies find flexibility to maintain their independence and strategic leeway in the era of cloud computing.

A Closer Look at the Noomez ($NNZ) Burn Model,https://timestabloid.com/which-crypto-has-1000x-potential-a-closer-look-at-the-noomez/,"Which crypto has 1000x potential? Only a few coins manage to spark true curiosity. Among the growing list of low-cap altcoin gems with 1000x potential , one project stands out not just for its tokenomics but for the story it tells, Noomez ($NNZ) . Currently priced at just $0.0000123 , $NNZ has entered Stage 2 of its presale, marking the next step in an evolving narrative powered by burns, community belief, and a cosmic character named Nik Noomez . Some are already calling it the next 100x crypto , but believers think it could go far beyond, maybe even all the way back to the Moons. Stage 2 Has Begun: The Rise of Nik Noomez Long before charts and token trackers, there was Nik Noomez , the lunar-born messenger who came to guide the faithful back to the Moons. His arrival marks more than a presale milestone; it’s the awakening of the Noomverse , a world where belief fuels the mission and every transaction lights the path forward. With over 100 holders , nearly $16,480.70 raised, and a current price of $0.0000123, the $NNZ community is proving its strength early. For investors seeking the best AI crypto coins 2025 , the rise of Noomez represents a new kind of fusion: narrative, deflation, and intelligent design. Key Fact : At the end of every presale stage, unsold $NNZ tokens are permanently burned , making each new phase rarer than the last Transparency and Community Rewards: How the Noom Gauge and Stage X Million Airdrop Work $NNZ is interactive. The Noom Gauge is a real-time tracker of community growth and project progress. Each completed stage ignites a glowing segment, symbolizing belief, momentum, and collective achievement. How It Works 28-Stage Progress: Each stage lights one segment of the Noom Gauge, visually representing presale growth. Community Visibility: Every burn and stage completion is verifiable on-chain. Fair Reward System: At the end of each stage, one random wallet wins X million $NNZ , equal to the stage number (e.g., Stage 2 = 2M $NNZ). Easy Entry: A Minimum $20 purchase is required to qualify for the airdrop. Transparency First: All winners are selected through a verifiable randomizer , ensuring fairness and trust. This level of engagement has made $NNZ a standout among contenders for the next 100x crypto , combining fair distribution, interactive storytelling, and provable on-chain transparency. Built for Longevity: The Noom Engine and Post-Launch Ecosystem Beyond the presale, $NNZ evolves into the Noom Engine , a self-sustaining ecosystem that transforms hype into real, continuous value. The Noom Rewards staking system offers up to 66% APY , with multipliers for early-stage stakers and time-locked commitments. For investors comparing the top 10 AI crypto coins for 2025, Noomez represents a project that merges creativity with real token utility and verified transparency. The Noom Vault: The Hidden Catalyst for the Coming Explosion While each stage pushes $NNZ forward, two monumental milestones define the presale’s true potential: the Stage 14 Vault and the Stage 28 Final Vault . These are not mere rewards; they are on-chain events that reshape tokenomics, ignite community excitement, and elevate scarcity. What Makes the Vaults Special Stage 14 – The First Vault: 14 million $NNZ airdrop Strategic token burns Surprise community rewards Stage 28 – The Final Vault: 28 million $NNZ airdrop NFT first-edition reveal Noom Engine partner announcement One-hour countdown to launch Liquidity lock and trading activation The Deflationary Power of $NNZ: The Engine Behind the Moon Mission Behind the scenes, Noomez ($NNZ) is built on the principles of value, scarcity, and community. Scarcity Built into the Core $NNZ stands out for a straightforward reason: scarcity is built into its DNA. With a fixed supply of 280 billion tokens , no minting, and automatic burns at the end of every stage. Burns That Strengthen Value Each unsold token at the close of a stage is burned forever , permanently reducing supply while increasing rarity. As the price progresses from $0.0001 to $0.028 across 28 stages, the deflationary curve naturally rewards early believers, tightening supply as demand grows. Why Analysts Call It a Hidden Gem This structure has already earned recognition among analysts searching for low-cap altcoin gems with 1000x potential. Every burn is on-chain, every price tier is verifiable, and every completed stage strengthens both the token’s floor and its story-driven allure.

54114841,622747,1762480822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54114841.jpeg,"$345 Million In Bitcoin Gone — But FBI Isn’t At Fault, Judges Say",https://bitcoinist.com/345-million-bitcoin-fbi-fault-judges/,"The US Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit has affirmed a district court’s refusal to award a Florida defendant the value of roughly 3,443 bitcoin—now “worth over $345 million”—after the government destroyed an external hard drive he belatedly claimed held the keys, holding that the equitable doctrine of laches bars relief because he spent years denying he owned meaningful cryptocurrency. The published opinion, authored by Judge Elizabeth “Lisa” Branch Grant and joined by Judges Jill Pryor and Marcus, leaves intact the lower court’s ruling that the United States cannot be compelled to replace the bitcoin, even assuming the drive ever contained it. FBI Not To Blame For 3,443 Bitcoin Hard Drive Wipe The case, United States v. Prime, No. 23-13776 , arose from a 2019 arrest that uncovered extensive counterfeiting and identity-theft paraphernalia. Michael Prime ultimately pleaded guilty to access-device fraud, aggravated identity theft, and illegal firearm possession. In the investigation’s early days, agents tried and failed three times to locate cryptocurrency tied to his activities under federal warrants; by sentencing in June 2020, Prime and his counsel had walked back earlier references to thousands of bitcoin, representing instead that his remaining crypto was trivial. The government proceeded accordingly. As Judge Grant summarized, Prime “at least three times” represented he owned “very little bitcoin,” and after release he still did not identify any device as holding valuable keys when he sought the return of property. The government followed its “ordinary practices,” wiping devices it could after notice; the rest—including the orange external drive at issue—were destroyed. “Only later did Prime claim to be a bitcoin tycoon ,” the court wrote. “By then it was too late.” Although headlines have centered the FBI, the record shows it was the US Secret Service that contacted Prime in mid-2022 offering to wipe and return certain devices if he provided passwords. He asked for a pickup time, then filed pro se motions instead; none of those filings mentioned bitcoin or a hard drive. The drive was later destroyed with other electronics because Prime refused to cooperate in removing contraband data. The Eleventh Circuit underscored causation and prejudice: “We have little difficulty concluding that the government would not have destroyed the hard drive if it had thought that it contained millions of dollars in bitcoin.” With the drive gone, “the government cannot return it,” and to the extent the bitcoin ever existed—“and we have our doubts”—ordering the United States to “find and hand over almost 3,443 replacement bitcoin” would be prejudicial “now to the tune of over $345 million.” The panel was openly skeptical of Prime’s attempts to reframe his disclosures. He argued, for example, that when he reported “$200 to $1,500 in bitcoin” in February 2020, he meant the then-market price of a single bitcoin, not his holdings. “We don’t buy it,” the court wrote, noting that in February 2020 BTC traded between “about $8,500 and $10,500” and that Prime had promised “complete, accurate and truthful” asset disclosures encompassing any asset in which he had “any interest” or control. The opinion quotes defense counsel’s own admission at sentencing that the original claim to “some great amount of bitcoin” was “not supported by the evidence.” Having affirmed on laches, the Eleventh Circuit did not reach broader questions, such as whether any BTC—if it existed—would have been forfeitable. The court also noted Prime forfeited any challenge to the factual finding that the drive was destroyed by failing to raise it below. The narrow holding is that equitable relief is unavailable where a claimant’s multi-year denials induced the government to stop searching for assets and to process seized electronics in the ordinary course—conduct the panel repeatedly tied to his non-cooperation and delay rather than to any governmental bad faith. As Judge Grant summarized the district court’s bottom line, “laches barred his bitcoin request. We agree and affirm.” At press time, BTC traded at $102,825.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BTC news|btc price|FBI,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 02:00:22

Santiment reported 21,595 new wallets created in 48 hours — the biggest jump in eight months. The move came as XRP dropped to $2.06 before rallying back to about $2.33, a roughly 13% gain from that low. Related Reading: ‘Good News’ Finally Arrives For SHIB Army As Team Unveils New Update Surge In Wallets Draws Attention Based on reports, the spike in wallet creation has captured market attention because it breaks a recent pattern of heavy selling. Data showed long-term holders were offloading about 260 million XRP per day during last month’s sell-off. Now, fresh wallets are appearing while prices recover. That combination suggests different groups of traders may be acting at the same time — some cutting losses, others buying the dip. Community figures point out that total wallets now stand at 7.226 million and are moving toward 7.5 million, according to an XRP Rich List resource. 📈 XRP’s price has bounced back, and users who bought the dip have enjoyed a nice +12% jump in the past 24 hours. Notably, XRP Ledger data indicates there were 21,595 new $XRP wallets created in a 48-hour span in the past couple days, the highest level of growth in 8 months. pic.twitter.com/vkGLwLJjrk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 5, 2025 A similar but milder burst of network growth was followed by a climb to a yearly high of $3.66. That historical link is being watched. Still, new wallet creation is a signal rather than proof of sustained buying. Some of the incoming addresses can belong to exchanges, custodians, or automated services. So the makeup of new wallets matters as much as the number. ETF Timetable Could Add Fuel Reports have disclosed that an XRP spot ETF might get a US launch date of November 13. ETF talk has a history of drawing institutional interest into crypto markets, and rumors alone can move prices. In this case, analysts in the XRP community are tying the wallet growth to expectations surrounding the ETF. One community analyst, Egrag Crypto, has outlined bullish targets, calling one level “Macro Wick 1” at $10 and another, much higher, “Macro Wick 2” at $50. Those are his technical scenarios, offered as possibilities rather than certainties. Market Volatility Still Present The wider crypto market showed how fast things can swing between November 3 and 4, when the total market cap fell by nearly $350 billion and XRP slid about 13.16% to around $2.20. That pullback is fresh in traders’ minds. Short-term gains can be steep. For example, a $10,000 buy placed two days ago would already have gained about $1,300 after the rebound. Yet big moves work both ways in turbulent markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Grip Holds — But Signs Of Weakness Are Piling Up: Analyst For now, the picture is mixed. New wallets and a 13% bounce are encouraging signs of renewed interest. Historical precedents and analyst forecasts add to bullish narratives.

Investors should watch where the new wallets are concentrated, monitor daily sell volumes, and pay attention to confirmed news about an ETF.

The stock plunged more than 8% in Tokyo, extending losses from earlier this week as a shift in sentiment toward the high-flying technology sector drove prices down. The sell-off comes as doubts grow over whether valuations for AI-related startups have surged too high, too quickly. Investors flocked to the sector all year, but now they are cashing out and reconsidering how soon AI companies can turn technological promise into reliable revenue. SoftBank has become one of the most ardent champions of AI globally. Between its Vision Funds and direct investments, the firm has holdings in semiconductor manufacturing, artificial intelligence software, data infrastructure, and robotics. This stance also makes the company especially vulnerable as investor sentiment swings against AI. The stock had made a modest recovery on Thursday, climbing almost 3 percent after its steep decline the day before. Wednesday’s 10% decline was the company’s worst trading day since April. The rebound was fleeting, however, and Friday’s slide erased those gains. The broader Japanese tech market was also under pressure. The shares of the semiconductor testing company Advantest plummeted, and those of the chipmaker Renesas Electronics also declined. Shares of Tokyo Electron, a major manufacturer of semiconductor production equipment, also fell. The shares of SK Hynix, a supplier of memory chips to AI data centers, dropped in trading in South Korea. The decreases are also part of a broader rotation out of high-risk, high-reward sectors, analysts say. Slower chip orders, rising funding costs, and longer times for AI adoption are driving this change. U.S. tech decline weighs on sentiment The decline in Asia mirrors losses in major U.S. AI and semiconductor shares from the previous day. Shares of Qualcomm declined after the company reported better-than-expected results, but noted that it could lose a future supply deal with Apple. AMD, which had rallied earlier in the week with hopes for AI chip demand, also lost ground. Software companies closely associated with developing AI technology, such as Palantir and Oracle, also fell. Even Nvidia and Meta Platforms, among the companies central to the current AI boom, finished lower in the U.S. session. Their weakness sent a message to global investors that momentum in the sector could be waning, at least in the short term. Market strategists say investors are rethinking their assumptions about how quickly AI investment will lead to profit growth. Still, many companies are investing large sums in research and cloud infrastructure, as well as manufacturing their own specialized computer chips, without immediate returns on such investments. SoftBank feels pressure over its bet on a diminished AI future Under Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s long-term strategy is based on the conviction that artificial intelligence will revolutionize industries worldwide. The company’s investment in Arm, the British chip designer whose architecture forms the basis of many of the world’s mobile and data devices, has been a key component of this strategy. Gains in Arm’s valuation during the first part of the year had helped buoy SoftBank’s overall view. However, its fortunes have swung dramatically as markets have gyrated. The Vision Funds are also undergoing an overhaul, as SoftBank reduces its holdings in non-core assets and focuses more closely on companies with AI links. As global markets become more cautious, the company is now under pressure to demonstrate clearer and more immediate pathways to profitability from its AI investments. As earnings arrive and central banks make decisions, as global chip demand applies pressure (and occasionally relief) to stocks, investors will be trying to decide whether the current selloff is a quick correction or the beginning of something more lasting. The next few weeks will present a critical juncture for SoftBank in determining how its AI narrative unfolds in the market.

The term used by Google was that it was including prediction markets’ “data”; however, in its broadcast on social media, Polymarket uses the term “odds.” Kalshi’s CEO, Tarek Mansour in a tweet called it big news while promising there will be a rollout over the next few weeks. What this means for prediction markets News of the Google agreements has triggered excitement among fans of prediction markets , as they know that such an endorsement brings the market closer to further legitimization of prediction markets, even as multiple states claim they are acting illegally in the sports betting space. For now, sports event contracts make up the bulk of trading volume on Kalshi. However, it is clear that many have woken up to the value of prediction markets and the knowledge that it goes well beyond sticks and balls. In fact, many, including Rose Yao, are looking at the predictive power of prediction markets as a major enhancement for Google Finance. “Prediction markets data from [Kalsh and Polymarket] means you can ask questions about future events to see current probabilities in the market and how they’ve changed over time,” Google product leader Rose Yao wrote on X. In a blog post in which it announced the deal, Google shared an example in which it urges the user to ask a question like ‘What will GDP growth be for 2025?’ directly from the search box to see “current probabilities in the market and how they’ve changed over time.” Some experts also believe that a deal with Google could open the floodgates for prediction markets, as it could encourage other corporate giants to partner with prediction markets. Already, giants like the Intercontinental Exchange, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, have come on board. The Intercontinental Exchange announced a $2 billion investment in Polymarket last month, and the NHL announced licensing deals with both Polymarket and Kalshi at the same time. This is all happening as Polymarket gets ready to re-enter the US market, which it was blocked from in February 2022. The prediction platform has been teasing its re-entry to the States for several weeks now, but there have been reports that the government shutdown is delaying it.

Is the current Bitcoin correction a warning sign or a healthy market reset? As BTC experiences short-term price volatility, top analysts are sharply divided on what comes next for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This Bitcoin correction has triggered intense debate among market experts, with predictions ranging from a steep drop to $56,000 to optimistic views of a temporary consolidation phase. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Correction Debate? The ongoing Bitcoin correction has created two distinct camps among market analysts. On one side, technical analysts point to historical patterns suggesting deeper declines. Meanwhile, on-chain data specialists argue the current movement represents normal market behavior. This division highlights the complex nature of cryptocurrency markets and the different methodologies experts use to assess Bitcoin’s trajectory. Bearish Outlook: Could Bitcoin Really Hit $56,000? Mike McGlone from Bloomberg Intelligence presents a cautious perspective on this Bitcoin correction. His analysis focuses on historical chart patterns that have played out repeatedly in Bitcoin’s history. According to McGlone’s research, Bitcoin typically returns to its 48-month moving average after significant rallies. If this pattern holds true during the current Bitcoin correction, we could see prices testing the $56,000 level. The technical argument for a deeper Bitcoin correction rests on several key factors: Historical price cycle patterns Moving average convergence Previous support and resistance levels Market sentiment indicators Bullish Perspective: Is This a Healthy Bitcoin Correction? Glassnode’s on-chain analysis offers a more optimistic view of the current Bitcoin correction. Their data suggests we’re witnessing a normal market adjustment rather than panic selling. The firm’s key metric—the relative unrealized loss ratio—currently sits at a modest 3.1%, well below the 5% threshold that typically signals market distress. This Bitcoin correction shows several healthy characteristics according to Glassnode: Controlled selling pressure without mass capitulation Stable fundamentals despite price volatility Historical patterns that resemble previous healthy consolidations Strong holder behavior among long-term investors How Should Investors Navigate This Bitcoin Correction? Understanding both perspectives helps investors make informed decisions during this Bitcoin correction. The divided analyst opinions actually provide valuable context for assessing risk and opportunity. While technical analysts warn of potential downside, on-chain data suggests underlying strength remains intact. Key considerations during this Bitcoin correction include: Monitoring the 48-month moving average as potential support Watching the relative unrealized loss metric for changes Assessing your personal risk tolerance and investment horizon Considering dollar-cost averaging strategies What Historical Patterns Tell Us About Bitcoin Corrections Historical data reveals that Bitcoin corrections are normal and often necessary for sustainable growth. Previous cycles show that healthy pullbacks typically range between 20-30%, which aligns with current movements. The current Bitcoin correction falls within these historical parameters, suggesting it could be part of normal market cycles rather than the start of a bear market. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Correction with Confidence The divided analyst opinions on this Bitcoin correction actually reflect the market’s complexity and maturity. While short-term uncertainty persists, both technical and fundamental analyses provide valuable insights for informed decision-making. Remember that market corrections often create opportunities for strategic investors who understand Bitcoin’s long-term potential and historical patterns. Frequently Asked Questions How long do Bitcoin corrections typically last? Bitcoin corrections usually last between 2-8 weeks, though the duration can vary significantly based on market conditions and external factors affecting the current Bitcoin correction. What’s the difference between a correction and a bear market? A correction typically involves a 10-20% price decline and represents temporary market adjustment, while a bear market involves declines of 20% or more over extended periods with fundamental deterioration. Should I buy during a Bitcoin correction? Many investors use Bitcoin corrections as buying opportunities, but this depends on your risk tolerance, investment strategy, and analysis of whether the current Bitcoin correction represents a temporary dip or fundamental change. What indicators should I watch during a Bitcoin correction? Key indicators include trading volume, moving averages, on-chain metrics like the relative unrealized loss ratio, and market sentiment indicators to assess the health of the Bitcoin correction. How does this Bitcoin correction compare to previous ones? The current Bitcoin correction shows similarities to healthy consolidations in past cycles, with moderate selling pressure and stable fundamentals, unlike the extreme conditions seen during the 2022-2023 bear market. Can the Bitcoin correction turn into a crash? While any market movement carries risk, current on-chain data suggests this Bitcoin correction lacks the panic selling and fundamental weaknesses that typically precede major crashes.

Here’s what’s moving before the bell. Markets opened Friday to a risk-off tone across Asia, with crypto prices and major regional equity benchmarks slipping as investors grew more cautious about the global economic outlook. Bitcoin fell alongside broader digital assets, extending this week’s losses after data pointed to weakening demand and slowing treasury inflows from large holders. Total crypto market cap dropped about 2% in early trading, mirroring sentiment in equities. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $101,545, down 1.5% Ether : $3,320, down 2.5% XRP : $2.21, down 5.1% Total crypto market cap: $3.47 trillion, down 1.9% Regional Markets Track US Losses After Sharp Selloff in AI Shares In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.75%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.74%. The Shenzhen Component lost 0.76%, and the Shanghai Composite eased 0.22%. New Zealand’s Dow Jones NZ edged up 0.20% to 360.52, the only gainer among major indexes. These declines followed Wall Street’s overnight retreat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.84%, the S&P 500 slid 1.12% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.9%, weighed down by a sharp pullback in technology and artificial intelligence-linked stocks that had fueled recent rallies. Really feels like equities are cooked, and if equities are cooked, then our coins are about to get smacked — Flood (@ThinkingUSD) November 6, 2025 The selloff this week came as earnings season wound down and investors turned to private data to gauge economic health amid the ongoing US government shutdown. The latest figures from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed companies announced 153,074 job cuts in October, nearly triple last year’s total for the same month, driven mainly by the technology and warehousing sectors. Institutional Appetite for Bitcoin Eases, ETF Outflows Deepen Market Reset Thomas Perfumo, global economist at Kraken, said demand from digital asset treasuries such as MicroStrategy, which had supported crypto through the summer, has slowed noticeably. “Crypto ETFs have also experienced significant outflows, despite skewing bullish during prior months of choppy price action,” he added. “While the market was stabilizing after the Oct. 10 liquidation event, this latest ‘reset’ event certainly reduced short-term risk tolerance further. This is evident by the continued retreat in altcoins in favor of assets like Bitcoin, whose market cap dominance ticked higher yet again.” Investors Eye Fed Support as Market Copes With Data Gaps and Valuation Strain Market confidence remains shaky amid the record-long US government shutdown, which has suspended official data releases such as the non-farm payrolls report. Private indicators have filled the gap, but they paint a mixed picture of growth and labor momentum. Treasury yields held steady, while the dollar eased slightly against major peers after weak labor data reinforced bets on another Federal Reserve rate cut this year. The euro rose 0.49% to $1.1547, and the dollar index slipped 0.42% to 99.70. MSCI’s global equity gauge fell 0.59% to 992.00, extending its weekly losses as traders weighed stretched valuations and uncertainty over fiscal and monetary policy. On Wall Street, technology shares led the retreat, with the S&P 500 tech index down 2%. Analysts said the correction reflects profit-taking after months of gains tied to artificial intelligence optimism. Despite the pullback, analysts say the market tone remains orderly. Investors are watching for signs of liquidity stress in money markets, and traders expect the Fed to step in if funding pressures intensify.

The crypto world is buzzing today as SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed company, just moved a staggering $14.5 million in ETH to OKX. This massive Ethereum deposit represents one of the most significant institutional moves we’ve seen recently, and it could signal important market shifts ahead. What Does This Major Ethereum Deposit Mean? The recent Ethereum deposit from SharpLink Gaming’s wallet totaled 4,363.5 ETH, valued at approximately $14.47 million. According to blockchain analytics firm Onchain-lens, this substantial transfer occurred over just four hours. Typically, when large amounts of cryptocurrency move to exchanges, market participants interpret this as potential preparation for selling activity. This isn’t just any ordinary transaction though. The scale of this Ethereum deposit suggests strategic planning by SharpLink’s investment team. The company has been publicly positioning itself as a strategic investor in Ethereum, making this move particularly noteworthy for several reasons: The timing coincides with recent Ethereum price movements It represents a significant portion of their crypto holdings The choice of OKX as the destination exchange matters Market sentiment often reacts to such large transfers Why Are Institutional Ethereum Deposits So Important? Institutional players like SharpLink Gaming bring a new dimension to crypto markets. Their Ethereum deposit activities can influence price action and market psychology in ways retail traders cannot. When a publicly-traded company moves this much Ethereum to an exchange, it typically indicates one of several strategic decisions: Portfolio rebalancing – Adjusting their crypto exposure Profit-taking – Capitalizing on price appreciation Liquidity needs – Converting crypto to fiat for operations Strategic repositioning – Preparing for new investment opportunities The market watches these large Ethereum deposit movements closely because they often precede significant price movements. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation doesn’t always equal causation. How Should Crypto Investors Interpret This Move? For everyday crypto enthusiasts, understanding the implications of this Ethereum deposit requires looking beyond the headlines. While transfers to exchanges often signal selling intent, there are alternative explanations worth considering. SharpLink might be preparing for: Staking opportunities on OKX’s platform Participation in upcoming token sales Collateral for lending activities Institutional trading strategies The key takeaway is that institutional Ethereum deposit activity provides valuable market intelligence. By monitoring these movements, retail investors can better understand market sentiment and potential price pressure points. What’s Next for Ethereum After This Major Deposit? The aftermath of significant institutional moves like this Ethereum deposit often creates ripple effects across the market. Other institutional players may follow suit, or conversely, see this as a buying opportunity. The Ethereum deposit to OKX could trigger several outcomes: Short-term price volatility as markets digest the news Increased scrutiny of other institutional crypto holdings Regulatory attention to large-scale crypto transfers Potential copycat behavior from other corporations Moreover, this Ethereum deposit highlights the growing maturity of crypto markets. When publicly-traded companies actively manage digital asset portfolios, it signals broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment vehicles. Key Takeaways for Crypto Market Participants This substantial Ethereum deposit teaches us valuable lessons about today’s crypto landscape. Institutional activity is becoming increasingly transparent through blockchain analytics, providing everyone with unprecedented market insight. The SharpLink Gaming Ethereum deposit demonstrates how corporate crypto strategies are evolving beyond simple buy-and-hold approaches. Most importantly, remember that large transfers don’t automatically mean bearish sentiment. Each Ethereum deposit tells a story about institutional strategy, market timing, and risk management approaches that retail investors can learn from. Frequently Asked Questions Why would SharpLink deposit Ethereum to an exchange? Companies typically move crypto to exchanges for selling, staking, or participating in platform-specific opportunities. The exact reason behind this Ethereum deposit remains speculative until official statements emerge. How does this affect Ethereum’s price? Large deposits can create selling pressure if converted to fiat, but the impact depends on market conditions and whether other buyers absorb the potential sell volume. Is OKX a common choice for institutional deposits? Yes, OKX has become increasingly popular among institutional traders due to its advanced trading features and global regulatory compliance. Should retail investors worry about institutional moves? While worth monitoring, retail investors should maintain their investment strategies rather than reacting to single transactions. How can I track similar large transfers? Blockchain analytics platforms like Onchain-lens, Etherscan, and various crypto intelligence services monitor large wallet movements. What’s the difference between deposit and withdrawal signals? Deposits to exchanges often suggest selling intent, while withdrawals to private wallets typically indicate long-term holding strategies.

The token, which should maintain a steady $1.00 value, has plummeted to $0.7484 according to recent data from CoinMarketCap. This represents a staggering 25% decline in just 24 hours, leaving investors questioning the stability of algorithmic stablecoins. What Caused the USDX Stablecoin De-Peg? The alarming USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation was first reported by blockchain security firm PeckShield. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a consistent value, typically pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar. When a USDX stablecoin de-pegs occurs, it signals serious underlying issues within the protocol’s mechanism or market confidence. Several factors can trigger such events: Liquidity crises in trading pools Algorithmic failures in rebase mechanisms Mass panic selling from investors Smart contract vulnerabilities or exploits How Does This USDX Stablecoin De-Pegs Affect Investors? The current USDX stablecoin de-pegs event has immediate consequences for holders. Investors who purchased the token expecting stable value now face significant losses. This situation highlights the inherent risks in algorithmic stablecoins compared to their fully-backed counterparts. When examining any USDX stablecoin de-pegs scenario, consider these critical aspects: Immediate liquidity : Can you exit your position? Recovery potential : Historical patterns of similar events Protocol response : Team actions to restore peg Market sentiment : Community and institutional reactions Is This the End for StablesLab’s USDX? While the current USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation appears dire, history shows that some stablecoins have recovered from similar events. However, each case depends on the specific circumstances and the development team’s response. The severity of this particular USDX stablecoin de-pegs event at 25% below peg suggests significant challenges ahead. The team at StablesLab now faces the critical task of restoring confidence. Their actions in the coming days will determine whether this USDX stablecoin de-pegs becomes a temporary setback or a permanent failure. Lessons from the USDX Stablecoin De-Pegs Incident This USDX stablecoin de-pegs event serves as a stark reminder about cryptocurrency risks. Even assets marketed as “stable” can experience extreme volatility. The incident reinforces why diversification and understanding underlying mechanisms matter more than ever. Key takeaways from this USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation: Always research the backing mechanism of any stablecoin Diversify across different stablecoin types Monitor liquidity and trading volume metrics Stay informed about protocol updates and team communications Navigating Future Stablecoin Investments The USDX stablecoin de-pegs incident doesn’t mean all stablecoins are unsafe. However, it does emphasize the importance of due diligence. When the USDX stablecoin de-pegs occurred, many investors learned hard lessons about algorithmic stability mechanisms. Moving forward, the crypto community will likely scrutinize similar projects more carefully. This USDX stablecoin de-pegs event may ultimately lead to better industry standards and more robust stablecoin designs. Conclusion: The Aftermath of De-Pegging The dramatic USDX stablecoin de-pegs event serves as a crucial learning moment for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. While stablecoins offer tremendous utility, their complex mechanisms require thorough understanding before investment. The market will watch closely to see how StablesLab responds and whether the USDX stablecoin de-pegs situation can be resolved. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when a stablecoin de-pegs? When a stablecoin de-pegs, it means the token’s value has moved significantly away from its intended peg, typically $1.00 for dollar-pegged stablecoins. How common are stablecoin de-pegging events? While not everyday occurrences, several notable stablecoins have experienced de-pegging throughout crypto history, particularly among algorithmic varieties. Can USDX recover from this de-pegging? Recovery depends on multiple factors including team response, market confidence, and underlying protocol mechanics. Some stablecoins have recovered while others have not. Should I buy USDX while it’s de-pegged? Buying de-pegged stablecoins carries significant risk and should only be considered by experienced investors who understand the potential for total loss. How can I protect myself from stablecoin de-pegging? Diversification across different stablecoin types, staying informed about protocol health, and maintaining reasonable position sizes can help manage risk. What’s the difference between algorithmic and collateralized stablecoins? Algorithmic stablecoins use complex code mechanisms to maintain peg, while collateralized stablecoins hold reserves of other assets to back their value. Found this analysis helpful?

BTC dipped below $103,500 and $102,400 to enter a bearish zone. The decline was such that the price even spiked below the $101,200 support.

With traders hunting for the top altcoins to buy now, La Culex’s unique mechanics and fast-moving stages are giving early believers a reason to swarm in before the next price jump. Let’s see, as the market readies for another speculative surge, meme coins like Pepe, Bonk, and La Culex ($CULEX) are redefining what it means to catch momentum early and possibly turn a small stake into a 100x story for 2025. 1. La Culex ($CULEX): The Meme Mosquito With a 100x Sting La Culex Presale has quickly risen to become one of the best meme coins to buy now as it enters Stage 4, “Hive Signal.”La Culex has officially entered its 4th stage, Hive Signal, marking a crucial point in its viral presale journey. The token is currently priced at $0.00002458, with over $13,000 raised and a growing community of more than 100 holders. This steady climb reflects the growing investor confidence in the project’s long-term potential and its ability to attract early believers who recognize the meme coin’s unique market positioning. How to Buy La Culex: A Step-by-Step Guide for the Best Meme Coin to Buy Now Buying La Culex is simple and accessible, even for new investors exploring the best meme coins to buy now. Step one is to connect your wallet, La Culex operates on Ethereum, ensuring full compatibility with MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Step two involves funding your wallet with ETH or USDT, ensuring enough ETH for gas fees. Once you’re ready, head to the official Culex Presale page and connect your wallet. Enter the desired amount, hit “Buy Now,” and confirm the transaction. After the presale ends, you’ll be able to claim your tokens directly to your wallet, hold them for long-term growth, or stake them for passive returns. With over $11,000 raised already and the next price hike around the corner, this is the best meme coin to buy now before the buzz becomes a roar. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): The Giant That Still Rules the Night Sky While not a presale, Bitcoin remains vital when looking at top altcoins to buy now because all presale odds are calculated relative to where the king sits. BTC dominates market cap and sets general trend direction. The global crypto market cap stands around $3.9 trillion and Bitcoin dominance is about 57.8%. Key indicators for Bitcoin include network hash rate, Bitcoin dominance, institutional inflows, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and inflation. If the U.S. Federal Reserve signals rate cuts, risk assets like crypto can surge, and Bitcoin often leads. 3. Ethereum (ETH): The Platform That Powers the Swarm Ethereum powers most presales, including meme coins like La Culex. Its staking model, upcoming upgrades, and active developer ecosystem make ETH a core consideration. Staking yields range from 4-7% annually depending on network activity, giving investors insight into potential rewards and liquidity flow. Key indicators include total staked ETH, number of active validators, gas fees, and number of ERC-20 tokens being launched. Ethereum remains the foundational blockchain for deploying smart contracts, which makes it indispensable for presale research and development. 4. Solana (SOL): The High-Speed Jet in the Swarm Solana offers blazing speed and low fees, making it ideal for presale projects and meme coins. Analysts track Solana’s transactions per second, network uptime, token listings, and developer activity to gauge growth potential. Its fast ecosystem allows projects to scale quickly and attract early-stage investors. Social chatter and community engagement also indicate price potential and market momentum. Solana’s combination of speed, cost-efficiency, and active ecosystem makes it a strong candidate for presale launches and altcoin trading strategies. 5. Ripple (XRP): Regulatory Drama with a Stage Light Ripple demonstrates how regulation shapes crypto relevance. XRP remains strong due to its use-case in payments and liquidity despite past legal challenges. Investors monitor SEC rulings, partnerships in payments, on-chain escrow releases, and institutional adoption to understand XRP’s stability. XRP shows that tokens can maintain relevance even with regulatory hurdles. Presale strategies often evaluate tokens that have regulatory clarity to mitigate risks associated with legal uncertainty and market volatility. 6. Binance Coin (BNB): The Exchange Powerhouse Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance ecosystem, buzzing through trading, staking, and ecosystem utility. As a major meme coin presale alternative for serious investors, BNB powers transactions, launchpads, and DeFi projects, making it a cornerstone of the crypto market. According to current updates, BNB is priced around $325, with a circulating supply of over 167 million tokens. Early adopters benefit from staking rewards, discounted trading fees, and token burn programs that reduce supply over time. 7. TRON (TRX): The High-Speed DApp Platform TRON operates as a fast blockchain for decentralized applications, staking, and tokenized entertainment projects. Recognized among meme coin presale enthusiasts for its active ecosystem, TRX enables smart contract deployment, NFT minting, and DApp growth with minimal fees. TRON currently trades at approximately $0.09, with a circulating supply of 102 billion tokens. Investors track staking yields, network throughput, and ecosystem adoption to measure potential upside. 8. Cardano (ADA): The Smart Contract Strategist Cardano is known for its research-driven approach to smart contracts, staking, and sustainable blockchain growth. As a meme coin presale-adjacent pick, ADA combines academic rigor with community-driven adoption. Current price stands around $1.15, with over 34 billion tokens circulating. Investors monitor staking rewards, governance proposals, and ecosystem expansions to assess project potential and long-term viability. 9. Bitcoin Cash: The Exchange Utility King BCH plays a central role in the top crypto ecosystem through its exchange utility and smart-chain applications as one of the top altcoins to buy now . It offers trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and is regularly burned to reduce supply, supporting scarcity and value retention. Its strong integration with the Binance Smart Chain makes it a core token for developers and traders alike. Regulatory scrutiny is an ongoing factor, but adoption remains high. Final Thoughts Choosing the top altcoins to buy now isn’t just about picking the next shiny token; it’s about reading the swarm, understanding tokenomics, evaluating utility, tracking community, and sizing risk. La Culex’s mosquito approach reminds investors: small, fast, and capable of leaving a mark. Whether buzzing into La Culex, riding the giants like BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, or flying with meme jets like Cardano, TRON, and Binance (BNB), each coin has its place in the swarm.

Before thousands of attendees, he said digital assets could “ease pressure on the dollar” and declared that America is ready to lead the world as both the “bitcoin superpower” and the “crypto capital.” Trump said his administration’s policies had replaced what he described as years of hostility toward the crypto industry with new support for innovation and growth. Dollar And Bitcoin At Odds Market data shows a long-running tension between the US dollar and Bitcoin . Analysts say their price movements often go in opposite directions. During the Federal Reserve’s 2022 rate hikes, the Dollar Index rose to 114 while Bitcoin fell from $47,000 to below $17,000. But in 2020 and 2021, when the dollar weakened, Bitcoin soared to around $64,000. https://t.co/1yURL8Obgx — Cynthia Lummis (@CynthiaMLummis) November 5, 2025 Reports also note that Bitcoin tends to act like a high-risk asset rather than a hedge, rising when money is cheap and dropping when liquidity tightens. Academic studies using wavelet analysis confirm the two assets often move out of sync, though the pattern isn’t perfectly stable. Policy Moves And Reserve Plans Trump’s position lines up with ongoing policy discussions in Washington. Senator Cynthia Lummis has backed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to help offset the nation’s $35 trillion debt. The idea would start with about 130,000 BTC the government already holds through criminal forfeitures, a supply valued near $34 billion. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is reportedly assessing how such a reserve might operate beyond traditional gold valuation methods. Meanwhile, Eric Trump has promoted stablecoins, saying a USD1 token from World Liberty Financial could attract “trillions” into US markets. Lawmakers including Maxine Waters and Elizabeth Warren have raised conflict-of-interest concerns, noting that the GENIUS Act signed in July has no restrictions on presidential family involvement in digital asset ventures. Signs Of Rebound The crypto market is finally showing signs of rejuvenation, with Bitcoin reclaiming the $103,000 mark. Most other crypto assets are also trading in the green zone today. Trump Coin is among those leading the pack, recording massive gains with a double-digit rally in the daily and 14-day charts. TRUMP’s price has rallied 12% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data, 35% in the 14-day charts, and 1.9% over the previous month. However, the coin is still down 4% over the last week. TRUMP is currently the 4th-best performing crypto in the daily charts, followed by Internet Computer (ICP), Quant (QNT), and Zcash (ZEC). Trump has been highly vocal in support of the crypto industry, even allowing crypto donations for his 2024 Presidential campaign. He issued, among his first executive orders upon assuming office, the establishment of a strategic digital asset reserve for the US.

Among the highlights was a statement from Maxwell Stein, a member of BlackRock’s digital assets team, that sent the audience into applause and resonated with enthusiasts on social media. He revealed that the global financial market is now ready for large-scale blockchain adoption, and the infrastructure being built by companies like Ripple could soon facilitate the movement of trillions of dollars on-chain. BlackRock’s Maxwell Stein Says The Crypto Market Is Ready During his session, Stein highlighted the transformation underway in global finance, noting that traditional securities are still held in legacy systems but that this separation between traditional and tokenized assets is gradually disappearing. Related Reading: Ripple Just Launched A Game-Changing Service In The US Leveraging XRP And RLUSD He explained that in the short term, proving utility is the most important thing to gaining broader adoption and that there are currently two types of users driving this shift: those already in the crypto space and a second wave of early institutional adopters. Stein emphasized the need for continued market momentum to demonstrate the practical usefulness of blockchain solutions and attract larger financial players. “We need that market momentum in order to prove the utility, to actually get the larger players to eventually come in,” he said. As noted by an XRP advocate with the name Diana on the social media platform X, Stein credited Ripple and other early builders for proving that blockchain works. Not as a concept, but as real financial infrastructure. The idea that trillions in capital could eventually move through blockchain rails represents a fundamental change in how the world’s financial systems might operate. The idea sounded like a myth back when the crypto industry was first created. What once seemed like a distant fantasy in crypto’s early days has begun to take shape as reality, and big names like traditional finance are now moving into the crypto industry every day. Nasdaq’s CEO Says Regulation Is Important Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman also shared her perspective at the event, focusing on the need for regulatory clarity to encourage broader institutional participation in the digital asset space. She explained that major institutions want to engage but require clearly defined rules that prioritize investor protection and establish stable frameworks. Related Reading: Pundit Elaborates On Ripple/SWIFT Theory That Will Send The XRP Price To $1,000 According to her, once such clarity is achieved, these institutions can confidently enter the market knowing that they are operating under secure and transparent guidelines. Friedman added that significant progress is already happening within traditional finance, as many banks are experimenting with tokenized bonds, fixed income instruments, and the creation of stablecoins. This growing involvement is evidence that institutions are not waiting for innovation to reach them. They are actively finding ways to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while awaiting the full regulatory go-ahead. “But I think to get them really engaged in the market, there has to be regulatory clarity,” Friedman said.

Despite recent setbacks in its price performance, sentiment among some industry observers remains optimistic. Levi Rietveld, the creator of Crypto Crusaders, offered a firm stance in a post on X, writing, “If you are buying this XRP dip you’re a winner. Plain and simple.” His comment came as XRP traded at $2.22, dipping 9.19% over the past week. If you are buying this $XRP dip you’re a winner. Plain and simple. — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 6, 2025 Recent Performance and Market Context XRP’s decline follows a short-lived rally that saw the asset reach an intraday high above $2.5 earlier in the week. Market data indicates a mix of investor reactions as traders assess whether the recent dip presents an opportunity or a warning sign. The broader digital asset sector has also shown signs of slowing momentum, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies facing similar pullbacks. Despite the current weakness, Rietveld is convinced that the asset holds immense potential. It has posted significant gains over the past several months, reaching a peak of $3.65 in July , and its growth has been largely supported by developments surrounding Ripple. While short-term corrections are common, sustained corporate activity and adoption progress may support XRP’s resilience in the coming months. Ripple’s Expanding Reach Ripple’s recent acquisitions have played a central role in shaping sentiment around XRP. The company has been actively broadening its business scope, securing new assets to enhance its institutional infrastructure. Its purchase of GTreasury , a corporate treasury management platform, and its completed acquisition of Hidden Road, now known as Ripple Prime , highlight the company’s ambition to expand its influence across global payment and finance networks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple has invested billions in acquisitions since the start of 2025, positioning itself as a leading provider of enterprise blockchain and payment solutions. These strategic purchases are designed to integrate Ripple’s technology into mainstream financial systems, bridging digital and traditional finance. Such moves suggest that Ripple is intent on transforming from a blockchain innovator into a global financial infrastructure firm, with XRP playing a central role in its broader ecosystem . Outlook for XRP Rietveld’s optimism reflects a viewpoint shared by many long-term XRP supporters who see temporary price drops as opportunities. While short-term volatility remains a concern, confidence in Ripple’s operational direction continues to influence investor behavior. Market participants have pointed to Ripple’s corporate developments as evidence of long-term value creation.

This massive wave of crypto liquidations primarily hammered traders betting on price increases, revealing the extreme volatility that continues to define digital asset markets. What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Crypto liquidations occur when exchanges automatically close traders’ positions because they can no longer meet margin requirements. Think of it as a safety mechanism that triggers when your collateral drops below a certain threshold. However, when markets move rapidly, these crypto liquidations can create cascading effects that amplify price movements. Breaking Down the $376M Liquidation Carnage The recent crypto liquidations tell a clear story: long traders suffered the most significant losses. Here’s the detailed breakdown: Bitcoin (BTC) : $230 million liquidated, with longs accounting for 81.09% Ethereum (ETH) : $130 million liquidated, with longs making up 63.29% Solana (SOL) : $16.76 million liquidated, with longs comprising 83.76% Why Do Long Positions Dominate Crypto Liquidations? Long positions typically dominate crypto liquidations during sharp market downturns for several reasons. First, many traders use excessive leverage when betting on price increases. Second, sudden price drops trigger automatic liquidation protocols. Moreover, the fear of missing out often drives traders to overextend during rallies, making them vulnerable when trends reverse. How Can Traders Avoid Getting Liquidated? Surviving crypto liquidations requires disciplined risk management. Consider these strategies: Use lower leverage ratios to withstand market volatility Set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels Maintain adequate margin buffer above requirements Diversify across different positions and timeframes The Psychological Impact of Massive Crypto Liquidations Large-scale crypto liquidations create significant psychological pressure on market participants. Fear spreads quickly as traders watch positions evaporate. This emotional response often leads to panic selling, which further fuels the liquidation cycle. Understanding this dynamic helps traders maintain perspective during turbulent periods. What’s Next After This Liquidation Event? Historically, major crypto liquidations often precede market stabilization or reversal points. When weak hands get shaken out, stronger buyers typically emerge. However, traders should monitor market sentiment and technical indicators closely before assuming the worst is over. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Liquidation Landscape The recent $376 million crypto liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of market risks. While long traders bore the brunt this time, all market participants must prioritize risk management. Remember that surviving in cryptocurrency markets requires both strategic planning and emotional discipline during volatile periods. Frequently Asked Questions What triggers crypto liquidations? Crypto liquidations trigger when a trader’s position loses enough value that their collateral no longer covers potential losses, forcing automatic closure by the exchange. Why are long positions more vulnerable to liquidation? Long positions become more vulnerable because traders often use higher leverage when betting on price increases, making them susceptible to sudden market downturns. Can I prevent my positions from being liquidated? Yes, you can prevent liquidation by using lower leverage, maintaining sufficient margin, setting stop-loss orders, and monitoring positions regularly. Do large liquidations indicate market bottom? While massive liquidations sometimes signal capitulation, they don’t guarantee a market bottom. Always combine liquidation data with other technical and fundamental analysis. How often do major liquidation events occur? Significant liquidation events typically happen during periods of extreme volatility, which can occur several times yearly in cryptocurrency markets. What’s the difference between liquidation and stop-loss? A stop-loss is a voluntary order to limit losses, while liquidation is forced position closure by the exchange when margin requirements aren’t met. Found this analysis of crypto liquidations helpful?

Technically, the bears are reigning in both the one and six-month timeframes. The chart suggests buying now is catching a falling knife. IBIT's current level of 58 is a pivot point, with a recent bounce off 57 providing a temporary floor for a bounce, but is potentially a bull trap. A break below 57 could go as low as 55 before hitting resistance, and bulls will need a break above 63 in order to resume the rally definitively. It's rare that I see a chart that makes me want to write about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and by extension its most-liquid ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), but then I saw this chart, showing Bitcoin's recent divergence from both stocks and gold. Since July, Bitcoin (via IBIT, purple) has actually fallen 2%, after rallying to a high of over 15%, while stocks (via SPY , green) grind up 10%, and gold goes on its own roller coaster, up over 25% before ending up still 19% ahead. There was a decoupling that took place. Data by YCharts Nobody said (or should've said) that the crypto ride would be easy, I suppose, but I began to wonder what how far IBIT could fall given that other risk assets like stocks were still doing alright, and gold has been acting much like a risk-on asset this year, moving alongside liquidity. The one-month chart is brutal, down over 15%. Data by YCharts For dip-buyers, what a gift. They get to keep buying the dip, and the next dip too! In all seriousness, long-term believers in Bitcoin may rejoice that we're back to $100K, or around $58 in IBIT. But where do we go from here? IBIT Hourly Chart Technical Analysis Here's the one-month chart with one-hour candles. The same chart as the one above, but just IBIT and my preferred indicators; the legend is at the top. Barchart I'll get straight to it, it looks pretty bleak. The downtrend is clear, and the EMAs are bare stacked. The 20/50/100/200 (blue, yellow, purple, maroon) are all sitting on top of the other, following a death cross on Oct. 16th. A death cross is where the shorter moving average falls below the longer moving average, e.g., 50 EMA (yellow) crossing under 200 EMA (maroon). See where the yellow crosses down under the maroon line a few weeks ago. I tend to ignore the 20 EMA (blue) for reversal crosses, as it can be a little noisy and its crossovers, like Oct. 28th, can be short-lived bull traps. 57 was a clear bottom that triggered a bounce and an immediate gap up. While this may represent a psychological end after this bound structural support, it should note that its subsequent rally petered out when it was capped off by the 20 EMA (blue). Momentum is turning positive, though still neutral, and without a clear break to the upside that would take us above 60, momentum indicators like the RSI and MACD are signalling a bear bounce. The last few sessions do not look like a real rally or sustained move, and look still dominated by the technical downtrend. Bull Case Without a break above 63, there is no continued rally. And so, IBIT traders are essentially hoping for bullish volume to kick in to break above the 50 EMA (yellow). This could create a larger reversal pattern, and a break above the 200 EMA at 63 is necessary to regain upward momentum. That would likely trigger a Golden Cross, the opposite of the Death Cross, the 50 EMA crossing over the 200 EMA. That would be a clear, but lagging, buy signal to get into the trade. The chart offers little other hope for bulls other than a reversal from positive buying pressure, unfortunately. There is hope that 55 could offer structural support below 57, but that would require us to retest 57 again to find out if it is real or if the bounce is a bull trap. Bear Case This is a classic bearish continuation, and bears should consider that right now the trend is their friend. Selling the rip above 60 could be fruitful, as the current rally seems to have few legs, and anymore it does grow are likely to be crushed by the continued cell pressure. Watch for any sort of bullish breakout with the EMAs, but otherwise, this thing looks sick. Ultimately, the chart currently favors a sell until 63 is obtained and sustained. As it is likely to fall again, it will retest 57. A break below that would be a sell down to 55. IBIT Daily Chart Technical Analysis However, we're talking really short-term here, and this advice on the 1-month chart is really just for traders. Let's take a look at the 6-month chart with daily candles: Barchart The last daily candle marked a low on the chart, and both ended with their bodies below the 200 EMA (maroon), which is an ominous signal. The momentum indicators are turning over, with the 20 EMA (blue) falling down below the 50 EMA (yellow) and 100 (purple), now heading toward the 200 EMA. In this timeframe, we have bearish momentum, although we may be rolling over in the MACD into a bullish cycle, though again, this could be the bull trap in the making. Finding lower lows over the last month has really broken the cycle that IBIT was in before, and it's unclear from the chart where a real bottom is yet. We may be hitting a bounce, especially since the current levels in IBIT correspond to the $100K psychological barrier from Bitcoin itself, but buying now for a short-to-medium term bounce is trying to catch the falling knife. It could work out, but you're buying into heavy selling pressure volume-wise, and little bullish momentum, almost none. The bounce we saw off 57 was a low-volume move so far, and so until a greater rally materializes, this may be just a stalling move before the next leg down. Conclusion Ultimately, IBIT bulls have little to look forward to in the chart, with the bleakest picture I've seen in a hot minute for Bitcoin at large. However, it's times like these where the technicals say run away that Bitcoin and IBIT by extension can turn things around. There is a hint of a turning over in technical momentum, and if IBIT can climb over the next few weeks to hit 63 and above, it could run out as far as 68-70 before hitting the next big resistance. However, the bears have been winning this past month, dragging IBIT down 15% while gold and stocks both stay afloat, and it shows little sign of stopping now. 57 proved to be a solid resistance point, but it marked a lower low, and a new six-month low for IBIT. Breaking below this point could easily give way to 55 before another resistance is hit. Investors should consider IBIT very carefully, as it is positioned as a falling knife right now. Bulls who are right may be rewarded with this selloff being seen as a bounce in the future, but they are fighting the trend, and must be wary of doing so. I am staying away from adding any more exposure at the moment, although I am usually an observer, rather than a participant, in most crypto matters these days.

The BTC price reached an impressive $102,012.88 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most significant price points in Bitcoin’s history. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the growing strength and resilience of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This Massive BTC Price Surge? The recent BTC price explosion didn’t happen in isolation. Several key factors have contributed to this historic rally. First, institutional adoption continues to accelerate as major financial players recognize Bitcoin’s value proposition. Moreover, macroeconomic conditions have created a perfect storm for digital asset growth. The current BTC price movement reflects growing confidence among both retail and institutional investors who see Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value. Market analysts point to several catalysts behind this BTC price milestone: Increased institutional investment flowing into Bitcoin ETFs Growing global adoption as a hedge against inflation Positive regulatory developments in key markets Technical breakout from previous resistance levels How Significant Is This BTC Price Achievement? Breaking the $102,000 mark represents more than just a number for the BTC price. This milestone signals a fundamental shift in how markets perceive digital assets. The sustained upward movement in BTC price indicates strong underlying demand and reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Historically, such breakthroughs have often preceded extended bullish periods for Bitcoin. The current BTC price level also validates the investment thesis of many early adopters. However, it’s crucial to understand that cryptocurrency markets remain volatile. While the current BTC price represents a historic high, investors should always approach with caution and proper risk management strategies. What Does This Mean for Future BTC Price Movements? Looking ahead, the BTC price trajectory appears promising but requires careful monitoring. Technical analysts suggest that maintaining above $100,000 could establish a new support level for future growth. The sustained momentum in BTC price indicates that we might be entering a new phase of market maturity. Key considerations for the future BTC price include: Potential resistance levels around $105,000-$110,000 Market reaction to upcoming regulatory decisions Institutional inflow patterns and their impact on BTC price stability Global economic factors influencing cryptocurrency demand Actionable Insights for Navigating This BTC Price Environment For investors watching the BTC price movement, several strategies can help navigate this volatile yet rewarding market. First, dollar-cost averaging remains a sensible approach regardless of the current BTC price. Second, maintaining a long-term perspective helps avoid emotional decisions during price fluctuations. The current BTC price level might tempt some to take excessive risks, but disciplined investing typically yields better results over time. Remember that while the BTC price has reached impressive heights, cryptocurrency investing carries inherent risks. Always conduct thorough research and consider consulting financial professionals before making investment decisions. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to reach $102,000? The BTC price surge to $102,000 resulted from combined factors including institutional adoption, positive market sentiment, technical breakouts, and growing global acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? While the BTC price has reached new highs, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, investors should always assess their risk tolerance and investment goals before entering any market. How volatile is Bitcoin at this price level? The BTC price remains volatile even at higher levels, though increased institutional participation has somewhat stabilized price movements compared to earlier years. What’s the next major resistance for Bitcoin? Technical analysts suggest the next significant BTC price resistance levels appear around $105,000 to $110,000, though market conditions can change rapidly. Should I consider taking profits at this BTC price? Profit-taking decisions depend on individual investment strategies and financial goals. Some investors take partial profits at major milestones while maintaining core positions. How does this BTC price compare to previous cycles? The current BTC price represents new territory beyond previous cycle highs, suggesting potential structural changes in market dynamics and adoption patterns.

This strategic acquisition brings their total holdings to an impressive 4,004 BTC, signaling strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Why This Bitcoin Accumulation Matters for the Crypto Market American Bitcoin’s latest purchase represents more than just numbers on a balance sheet. This substantial Bitcoin accumulation demonstrates how established companies are positioning themselves in the digital asset space. The timing and scale of this acquisition suggest careful strategic planning rather than impulsive market speculation. Moreover, the company’s growing Bitcoin reserves highlight several key trends: Institutional adoption continues to gain momentum Long-term holding strategies are becoming more common Bitcoin accumulation is seen as a viable treasury reserve asset What Drives American Bitcoin’s Expansion Strategy? The company’s latest Bitcoin accumulation move raises important questions about their overall strategy. With Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump involved in leadership positions, the company combines political visibility with cryptocurrency expertise. This unique positioning could influence how traditional investors view Bitcoin opportunities. Several factors likely contributed to this decision: Current market conditions favoring accumulation Long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s store of value properties Strategic positioning for future institutional adoption Diversification of corporate assets How Does This Bitcoin Accumulation Impact Market Perception? When established companies engage in systematic Bitcoin accumulation, it sends powerful signals to the broader market. American Bitcoin’s growing holdings demonstrate practical application of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. This approach could encourage other companies to consider similar strategies. The company’s consistent Bitcoin accumulation pattern suggests they view current prices as attractive for long-term investment. This perspective contrasts with short-term trading mentalities and emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a strategic reserve asset rather than just a speculative instrument. What Challenges Come with Large-Scale Bitcoin Accumulation? While the benefits of Bitcoin accumulation are clear, companies face several practical challenges. Security concerns, regulatory compliance, and price volatility all require sophisticated management approaches. American Bitcoin’s mining background gives them unique advantages in navigating these complexities. Key considerations for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation include: Secure storage solutions for digital assets Regulatory compliance across jurisdictions Price volatility management strategies Integration with traditional financial reporting The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Accumulation Strategies American Bitcoin’s latest move represents a growing trend among forward-thinking companies. As more organizations recognize Bitcoin’s potential, we can expect to see continued Bitcoin accumulation from various sectors. This institutional participation could fundamentally change how Bitcoin functions within global financial systems. The company’s systematic Bitcoin accumulation approach provides a blueprint for other corporations considering digital asset adoption. Their success could inspire similar strategies across multiple industries, potentially accelerating mainstream Bitcoin acceptance. FAQs How much Bitcoin does American Bitcoin now hold? Following their latest purchase, American Bitcoin holds 4,004 BTC in total. Who is involved with American Bitcoin? Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are both involved with the company in leadership positions. Why are companies accumulating Bitcoin? Companies view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a diversification tool, and a potential long-term store of value. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price? Large-scale accumulation by institutions can create buying pressure and potentially support price stability. How do companies securely store large Bitcoin holdings? Most use a combination of cold storage solutions, multi-signature wallets, and professional custody services. Is this trend likely to continue? Many analysts believe corporate Bitcoin accumulation will increase as regulatory clarity improves and adoption grows. Found this analysis of American Bitcoin’s strategic moves insightful?

Her comments come amid rising tensions over monetary policy, inflation, and the role of digital assets in reshaping finance. How Bitcoin Could Reshape Treasury Markets Senator Cynthia Lummis has once again made headlines with her support for Bitcoin, stating in a recent Bloomberg interview that BTC is the only solution to America’s mounting national debt. According to a crypto news source, CryptosRus, posted on X, that Lummis expressed her pro-Bitcoin stance, mentioning that BTC is an asset that will continue to grow over time and is the key to offsetting the burgeoning national debt. Related Reading: Bitcoin In The Crosshairs: US Treasury Secretary Reveals What Senate Democrats Could Learn From BTC Lummis highlighted the concept of a strategic BTC reserve, asserting that it represents the sole viable strategy to offset the national debt. However, CryptosRus noted that her consistent advocacy makes her one of Washington’s most ardent supporters of BTC, pushing for its integration to play the core role of US fiscal strategy. Several companies are actively preparing for this move. An emerging euro-denominated Bitcoin treasury backed by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Treasury_BTC, has announced the appointment of Tycho Onnasch as its new head of BTC strategy. Onnasch is widely recognized within the BTC community for his foundational work on BTC scaling solutions, insightful market analysis, and deep conviction in BTC. Onnasch’s impressive background includes founding Zest Protocol, a leading BTC yield and landing platform, which is supported by BTC heavyweights Tim Draper and Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao. Academically, Tycho holds a degree from Oxford University, with a specialization in economic history. His achievements were further acknowledged with his inclusion in Forbes’ prestigious 30 under 30 Europe list. Onnasch’s role will be instrumental in driving the company’s BTC strategy and influencing its approach to market interpretation. A Healthier Foundation For Bitcoin Next Leg Higher CryptosRus has also reported that BTC has recently experienced its most significant open interest meltdown of its current cycle since the liquidation event that occurred on October 10. The data reveals substantial drops across major platforms, with Binance’s open interest decreasing by $4 billion, Bybit by over $3 billion, and Gate by more than $2 billion. Due to this liquidation event, traders have not rushed back in with leverage. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovery Lacks Conviction, Market Signals Another Pullback Risk Typically, leverage rebuilds quickly after a wipeout, but the slow recovery from this current scenario suggests that the market confidence is shaken. This sentiment explains the current slow and choppy price action, as the market operates with reduced leverage and fewer aggressive positions. CryptosRus pointed out that when leverage undergoes such a significant reset, the market often leads to an increase in stability. It lowers the risk of another sudden cascade of liquidations and establishes a healthier foundation for the next price movements. The expert concluded that this is a BTC reset, not a breakdown.

As a result, a recent survey conducted by the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) and PwC revealed that the percentage of traditional hedge funds holding cryptocurrencies has climbed to 55%, up from 47% in 2024. Heavy Crypto Exposure Among Hedge Funds Despite the ongoing volatility in crypto markets, 47% of institutional investors surveyed expressed that the current regulatory environment, shaped by Trump’s appointments of crypto-friendly agency heads and the implementation of the GENIUS Act has encouraged them to increase their allocations to digital assets. James Delaney, managing director of asset management regulation at AIMA, commented on the findings, stating: For most of these funds, regulatory uncertainty has been a major barrier. This year, those barriers are starting to be removed. This year’s report may mark a turning point in overcoming these challenges. However, regulatory clarity isn’t the sole factor driving institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. The fear of missing out (FOMO) on substantial market gains is also a compelling motivator. The survey highlighted that alongside traditional hedge funds, specialized fund managers with at least 50% of their assets in crypto have emerged, with several new funds launched this year. Bitcoin Dominates, Solana’s Popularity Surges Among the crypto-focused funds, Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most commonly held asset, closely followed by Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Notably, Solana saw a surge in popularity this year, with 73% of the funds now holding it, a marked increase from 45% in 2024. On average, hedge funds have allocated about 7% of their assets to crypto, up from 6% the previous year, although over half of the respondents commit less than 2%. Encouragingly, 71% of those surveyed indicated plans to increase their crypto exposure within the next twelve months. Major firms are also showing interest in this space. Brevan Howard Asset Management has reportedly appointed a former executive from Peter Thiel’s family office to lead a crypto-focused investment division. Additionally, asset managers like Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Elliott Investment Management have disclosed holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked ETFs . According to the AIMA survey, the proportion of respondents using ETFs has risen to 33%, compared to 25% the previous year. The survey indicated that the most popular access method to the digital asset market among managers is through derivatives, with 67% of respondents utilizing them, an increase from 58% in 2024. Spot trading has also grown, rising to 40% from 25%. Moreover, some asset managers are exploring the tokenization of their funds, similar to initiatives by firms like BlackRock. Over half of the survey participants expressed interest in this approach. Lastly, the survey found that 43% of traditional hedge funds investing in crypto plan to enhance or initiate their engagement with DeFi over the next three years, with nearly a third believing that DeFi could disrupt their business models.

After about a year and seven months since his arrest, Samourai Wallet dev, Keonne Rodriguez, has been sentenced to five years in prison. The case against Samourai Wallet Keonne Rodriguez and his co-founder William Lonergan Hill launched Samourai Wallet in 2015 as a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet. The wallet was advertised on its website and via social media as a “premium privacy service” and it made use of marketing language such as “No email address, no ID check, and no hassle”, and clearly targeted “Dark/Grey Market participants” who were repeatedly reminded that their Bitcoin transfers would be hard to trace on the platform. In April 2024, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill were arrested and later indicted by the U.S. government. Samourai never registered as a money transmitting business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and did not implement effective anti-money-laundering (AML) or “know your customer” (KYC) protocols. P rosecut ors claim that Samourai processed about $237 million in illicit funds between 2015 and April 2024. Rodriguez and Hill pleaded guilty on July 30, 2025, to a charge of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Rogriguez’s verdict is bad news for privacy advocates On November 6, 2025, Keonne Rodriguez was sentenced to 60 months (5 years) in federal prison. That sentence is the statutory maximum for the charge requested by the prosecution, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier during the week. Rodriguez is also required to pay a fine and will be supervised after his release. Judge Denise L. Cote was not swayed by Rogriguez’s defense of privacy tools, citing its failure to address the real-world consequences of facilitating criminal transactions. The presiding judge also found his letters of remorse failing to show sufficient acknowledgement for the human suffering his actions caused. The verdict is bad news for the other party in this case as well as Tornado Cash developers facing similar charges for running a privacy tool for transmitting funds. Meanwhile, it appears the U.S. government’s promise to allow digital asset innovation while cracking down on illegality does not extend to crypto-mixers and privacy-enhancing tools when it’s used to aid criminal proceeds. This has caused some tension as open-source privacy tools have been praised by advocates as protections for financial freedom and human rights.

BITX is best suited for experienced traders seeking short-term tactical moves, not for long-term investors, due to high fees and inherent risks. Bitcoin's technical charts suggest a possible short-term relief rally provided BTC reclaims key support levels that are well within reach. A BITX swing trade is only considered if Bitcoin closes above $103k on the weekly chart; caution and active management are essential. I last covered the Volatility Shares' 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) for Seeking Alpha in June of this year. At that time, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) was in a very similar price range to which it currently finds itself. While the coin is off those prices by about 4%, BITX has performed slightly worse than its 200% leveraged goal based on total return: Data by YCharts At a total return of -13.6%, BITX has returned about 3x the performance of BTC to the downside. To be fair, there have been times throughout these last five months when holding BITX has worked out quite well for shareholders - even those shareholders who have held for far longer than would be recommended by the fund's issuer. That said, since Bitcoin made a marginal new high on October 6th, the fund has been in near free-fall: Data by YCharts With Bitcoin down 18% over the last month, BITX has delivered on that 2x return strategy to the downside. Given the large selloff for both BTC and BITX over these last few weeks, traders are no doubt looking for local bottom opportunities to play a bounce in BTC and its proxies. In this update, I'll offer my technical viewpoint on Bitcoin currently and lay out what I'd like to see in BTC before jumping into BITX for a swing trade. Recapping Risks Before we get into the charts, this brief section will serve as the obligatory risks acknowledgement when assessing leveraged ETFs. For a deeper dive into the risks associated with BITX specifically, I'd encourage both current shareholders and prospective buyers to read my initial coverage of the fund here . First, BITX is not a cheap product as it is an actively managed fund with a 1.85% management fee. Second, BITX is inherently risky because it introduces leverage to what is already a volatile digital asset. Third, given that the fund utilizes futures contracts for its Bitcoin-proxy leverage, expenses will eat away at returns over time as the fund manager rolls over contracts each month. Finally, BITX is flat out not an investment product, it's a trading product. Per the fund's issuer Volatility Shares: The Fund is intended to be used as a short-term trading vehicle. Investors in the Fund should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily. The Fund is not intended to be used by, and is not appropriate for, investors who do not actively monitor and manage their portfolio. Thus, BITX should only be used for tactical moves by experienced traders who want leverage on Bitcoin's upside. The question then is: Are we at a pivot point for BTC bulls? Possibly. Bitcoin Charts In this section, I'll offer my opinion on Bitcoin's technical setup over three different time frames; daily, weekly, and monthly. As a reminder, though I often approach my trades from a fundamental standpoint, I do occasionally trade on technicals alone. And while I suspect Bitcoin could be setting up for a 'dead cat' bounce rally following a 21% selloff from its recent peak, I'm personally waiting for a very specific price level to confirm that reversal before I use BITX for a rebound trade. Here's the daily chart: Bitcoin Daily Chart 11/6/25 (TrendSpider) The first thing I want to point out is the enormous wedge that goes back the last several months. Those lines are indicated with yellow. After attempting to break through the top of that wedge no less than three times going back to July, BTC quickly flushed down to the bottom of the wedge in a matter of just a few weeks. Following a defense of $100k on two consecutive candles, my view is Bitcoin is going to attempt a rally up to the 200-day moving average. From current levels, that would be good for a 9-10% gain; potentially 15-20% if played through BITX. But I want to be clear, I don't think this is an overly bullish chart. The 50 and 200 day MAs are foreshadowing a 'death cross' and after hanging on to the 200-day MA as support several times in October, that level is sure to be resistance going forward. Which brings us to the weekly chart: Bitcoin Weekly Chart 11/6/25 (TrendSpider) This is a pretty concerning chart for bulls for a couple of reasons, in my view. First, the yellow arrows display numerous bearish RSI divergences that go back to last December. But also the 50-week MA is now dangerously close to being given up - that level is highlighted with the red circle and arrows. This is what I'm watching through the end of the week. I am not personally willing to play BITX for the bounce unless Bitcoin retakes the 50-week MA on this week's close. That level is currently $102,953. The last time Bitcoin closed a weekly candle below its 50-week MA after making a new all-time high a month prior, the coin fell by roughly 70% over the next twelve months. Now the monthly: Bitcoin Monthly Chart 11/6/25 (TrendSpider) I've shared this chart in previous Seeking Alpha articles covering Bitcoin. I've drawn a linear trend from the tops of the 2017 and 2021 cycles up to today. I don't think it's a coincidence that Bitcoin rallies keep stalling out at this trend-line. Furthermore, BTC is now approaching downside trend support that goes back to August 2024. Again, we see bearish RSI divergences between the cycle highs. And despite the claims from some that four-year Bitcoin cycles are dead, I flat out disagree that such a notion could be true when block reward halving events still exist. Closing Takeaways If I didn't make it clear, I don't find Bitcoin's daily, weekly, or monthly charts to be all that encouraging for the medium term. As I write this on November 6th, I could certainly make the argument that a relief rally for BTC is imminent. That rally could even go as high as 10%. And if that is indeed the case, BITX actually makes some sense for traders who want to maximize gains on the move. From where I sit, I would wait for confirmation that Bitcoin can hold key support before reversing higher to test the 200-day MA. The level that I'm personally watching is $103k on the weekly close. Provided Bitcoin can retake that level, I'll entertain a short term BITX swing trade. As always, be careful with leverage and have a plan when trading these volatile assets and financial products.",BTC-USD|BITX,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-11-07 04:06:22

The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.360 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it dips below $2.150.

A high was formed at $2.414 and the price started a fresh decline. There was a drop below $2.33 and $2.32 levels. The price traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.066 swing low to the $2.414 high. Besides, there was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $2.360 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.30 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The bulls are now active near $2.20 and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.066 swing low to the $2.414 high. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.30 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.350 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.420. A clear move above the $2.420 resistance might send the price toward the $2.50 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.650. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.30 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.20 level. The next major support is near the $2.150 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.150 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.050.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) has officially thrown its support behind a revolutionary yen stablecoin pilot project involving the country’s three largest banks. This exciting development marks a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption in one of the world’s leading economies. What Makes This Yen Stablecoin So Revolutionary? The Financial Services Agency will verify the legal viability of this innovative yen stablecoin, which represents a joint effort by banking giants MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho. This initiative serves as the first project under the Payment Innovation Project (PIP), scheduled to begin this month. The timing couldn’t be more perfect as digital payments continue to transform global finance. According to recent reports from Coindesk Japan and Nikkei, the three banking powerhouses are collaborating to launch both yen- and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins. This dual approach demonstrates their commitment to creating comprehensive digital payment solutions that cater to both domestic and international markets. Why Are Stablecoins Becoming So Important? Stablecoins represent one of the most practical applications of blockchain technology in traditional finance. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins maintain a stable value by being pegged to real-world assets like national currencies. The yen stablecoin project offers several key benefits: Reduced transaction costs for cross-border payments Faster settlement times compared to traditional banking Enhanced financial inclusion for underserved populations Improved transparency through blockchain technology Regulatory compliance with FSA oversight How Will This Yen Stablecoin Transform Japanese Finance? The involvement of Japan’s three largest banks brings unprecedented credibility to this yen stablecoin initiative. MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho collectively serve millions of customers and handle trillions of yen in transactions annually. Their participation ensures that this digital currency will integrate seamlessly with existing financial infrastructure while maintaining the highest security standards. Moreover, the FSA’s active support provides crucial regulatory clarity that has often been missing in cryptocurrency projects. This government backing signals that Japan is serious about embracing financial innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. What Challenges Might This Yen Stablecoin Face? Despite the exciting potential, the yen stablecoin project must navigate several challenges. Regulatory compliance remains paramount, as the FSA will closely monitor the pilot program’s progress. Technical scalability, cybersecurity threats, and user adoption also present significant hurdles that the banking consortium must overcome. However, the combined expertise of these financial institutions, coupled with government support, positions this yen stablecoin initiative for success. The lessons learned from this pilot could shape digital currency regulations and implementations worldwide. What Does This Mean for Global Cryptocurrency Adoption? Japan’s progressive approach to the yen stablecoin sets a powerful precedent for other nations considering similar initiatives. As one of the world’s largest economies, Japan’s embrace of regulated digital currencies could accelerate global cryptocurrency adoption and encourage other central banks to explore their own digital currency projects. The success of this yen stablecoin could potentially: Establish new standards for digital currency regulation Bridge the gap between traditional and digital finance Create new opportunities for financial innovation Enhance Japan’s position as a fintech leader Japan’s FSA-backed yen stablecoin pilot represents a watershed moment for digital finance. By combining the stability of traditional banking with the innovation of blockchain technology, this initiative could fundamentally transform how we think about money and payments. The collaboration between regulatory authorities and financial institutions demonstrates that responsible innovation is possible in the cryptocurrency space. Frequently Asked Questions What is a yen stablecoin? A yen stablecoin is a digital currency pegged to the Japanese yen, maintaining a 1:1 value ratio with its fiat counterpart through reserves held by the issuing institution. Which banks are involved in the pilot project? MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho – Japan’s three largest banks – are collaborating on this yen stablecoin initiative with FSA support. When does the stablecoin pilot begin? The Payment Innovation Project pilot is scheduled to launch this month, marking the first phase of testing and regulatory verification. Will there be a dollar-backed stablecoin too? Yes, according to Nikkei reports, the banking consortium plans to launch both yen- and U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins as part of their digital currency strategy. How is the FSA involved in this project? The Financial Services Agency is providing official support and will verify the legal viability of the yen stablecoin through its Payment Innovation Project framework. What benefits will users see from this stablecoin? Users can expect faster transactions, lower fees, enhanced security, and the convenience of digital payments while maintaining the stability of traditional currency.

However, sources noted that this increase was lower than anticipated. The announcement followed the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications’ release of reports indicating that individuals in the country spent approximately 1.8% more on household items in September than they did the previous year. According to the reports, this was after adjusting for inflation, attributing the increase to entertainment and transportation. However, sources pointed out that the number was lower than the 2.5% increase economists had predicted. This was because individuals spent less on education and housing, negatively affecting the overall numbers. Japan’s household spending increases below economists’ prediction Consumption makes up more than half of Japan’s gross domestic product ( GDP). In the meantime, experts said that while spending had overall remained solid against an inflationary backdrop, it is still possible that a GDP report due on November 17 will show that the economy actually shrank over the past three months to September, snapping five quarters of consecutive growth. Sources familiar with the situation, who wished to remain anonymous, pointed to a decline in exports and new housing initiatives amid regulatory changes as the reasons behind this economic downturn. Monitoring consumption is crucial to determine whether households adjust to the rising cost of living. In the case of inflation, analysts conducted research. They discovered that inflation levels have been at or above the Bank of Japan’s target of 2% for over three years, with a key price index rising in September. Regarding the increase in Japan’s household spending, the important question for the central bank and the country’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, is whether consumer spending will continue to boost a healthy economic cycle. “We are observing improved consumption figures compared to last year because the results during this time were not good,” stated Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. Minami acknowledged that families with working members fuel spending, reflecting the effects of bonuses and higher wages. Concerning wage growth in Japan, sources noted that although nominal wages increased, real wages, which take inflation into account, dropped drastically through September of this year. This decrease suggests that families have less purchasing power, resulting in dissatisfaction among voters. Government support during this period is crucial to bolster the country’s economy. Therefore, Takaichi has introduced an economic package to help families cope with inflation. This package is expected to support electricity and gas bills throughout the winter, as well as regional grants to help offset increasing costs. Moreover, Takaichi’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and other major parties have agreed to ease the tax imposed on gasoline by the end of this year. The yen remains weak against the dollar, sparking worries in Japan Takaichi considers measures to lower prices a key focus after voters demonstrated their unhappiness with the LDP in the recent national elections. This was because the voters felt the price relief efforts were inadequate. To address these concerns, the prime minister essentially ruled out cash handouts, which the LDP had proposed as a significant step before the July election. Notably, Takaichi is known for her advocacy of monetary easing, which has led to market expectations that the Bank of Japan may not hurry to hike interest rates. In addition, she has not directly called on the central bank to shift its policies since taking office last month, yet the yen remains weak against the dollar, recently trading near an eight-month low . This situation has sparked worries among individuals that, instead of a stronger demand, increased import charges from the weaker currency will drive inflation higher.

Coinbase Europe Fined By Irish Regulator On Thursday, the Central Bank of Ireland announced its first enforcement action against the crypto sector after fining Coinbase Europe Limited, the European arm of the US exchange, for multiple anti-money laundering monitoring failures over the past four years. According to the announcement, the Irish regulator and the crypto exchange settled on November 5, 2025, resulting in the $35.3 million (€30.6 million) penalty being reduced to $24.75 million after a 30% settlement scheme discount. Coinbase Europe has admitted the prescribed contraventions and has agreed to the undisputed facts as set out in the Settlement Notice (…). The sanctions have been accepted by Coinbase Europe. The sanctions are subject to confirmation by the High Court and will take effect once confirmed. Coinbase was fined for “faults in the configuration of their transaction monitoring system” that resulted in over 30 million transactions not being properly monitored over 12 months. As the Central Bank detailed, the value of these transactions amounted to €176 billion, approximately 31% of all Coinbase Europe transactions conducted in the period when the faults existed. As a registered Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in Ireland, the crypto exchange is required to monitor customer transactions and file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the national Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and Revenue Commissioners if it suspects that any given transaction is facilitating money laundering or terrorist financing. Nonetheless, Coinbase’s European arm took almost 3 years to fully complete monitoring of the over 30 million impacted transactions, which led to the reporting of 2,708 STRs to the FIU for analysis and potential investigation. The submitted STRs contained suspicions of serious criminal activities, the statement noted. Colm Kincaid, Deputy Governor of Consumer and Investor Protection, asserted that “to be effective in combatting financial crime, law enforcement agencies rely on regulated financial institutions to have systems in place to monitor transactions and report suspicions. The failure of such a system within any financial institution creates an opportunity for criminals to evade detection – and criminals will take that opportunity.” “Where system failures do occur, it is imperative that they are reported to the Central Bank without delay so that appropriate actions can be taken to manage and mitigate the risk,” he concluded. Coinbase Called ‘Corruption Factory’ Last week, Coinbase also faced scrutiny in the US, after Senator Chris Murphy accused the crypto exchange of participating in President Donald Trump’s alleged “corruption factory.” As reported by Bitcoinist, the Democratic Senator claimed that the crypto exchange’s donations to Trump’s presidential campaign were part of a political payoff that allegedly resulted in the dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s lawsuit against the exchange. Coinbase’s CLO, Paul Grewal, and CPO, Faryar Shirzad, refuted the claims, affirming that the Senator’s allegations were misinformed. Shirzad argued that the SEC lawsuits against the exchange and multiple other crypto companies “were part of a grotesque pattern of bullying and abuse of power by the previous chair.” Meanwhile, Grewal asserted that “What was corrupt was allowing us to go public ‘in the public interest’ and then suing us. What was corrupt was what the Third Circuit held was an arbitrary and capricious denial of our request to get basic rules for crypto.” It’s worth noting that Coinbase has openly criticized the previous administration’s crypto crackdown, asking for a more welcoming approach and clear regulations. Earlier this year, the exchange filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to seek information on the SEC’s spending on enforcement actions against crypto firms during the Biden Administration.",Crypto News|AML Anti-money laundering|AML Compliance|Central Bank of ireland|coinbase|Coinbase Europe|Coinbase settlement|crypto regulation|Irish regulator|total|total crypto market cap|US SEC,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 05:00:25

Here’s What It Means for Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-nears-death-cross-heres-what-it-means-for-price/,"XRP is facing renewed market pressure this week after a sharp decline brought its price to a low of $2.08. While the asset recovered slightly, it is still down 15.32% from last week. The recent drop has added weight to a new technical signal that could shape short-term sentiment for the asset. Coin Bureau posted on X that “XRP’s 50-day moving average (MA) is about to cross below its 200-day MA — a classic death cross pattern.” The accompanying chart highlights the potential crossover forming as XRP continues to lose momentum. The death cross is one of the most closely watched indicators in technical analysis. It occurs when the short-term moving average, in this case the 50-day MA, falls beneath the long-term 200-day MA, often signaling a transition from a bullish to a bearish trend. While such patterns do not always lead to extended declines, they are generally seen as warnings that downward pressure may persist. XRP NEARS DEATH CROSS XRP’s 50-day moving average (MA) is about to cross below its 200-day MA — a classic death cross pattern. Will $XRP fall deeper? pic.twitter.com/hv34jxo8oV — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) November 4, 2025 The Chart Reveals Growing Weakness Coin Bureau’s chart shows XRP struggling to maintain support after repeated attempts to reclaim levels above $2.6. The 50-day moving average, represented by the blue line, is trending downward and approaching an intersection with the 200-day MA, shown in yellow. The highlighted circle on the chart emphasizes the area where the two lines are set to meet, indicating the possible confirmation of the death cross in the coming days. This pattern follows weeks of uneven trading activity. After briefly recovering to the $2.7 range in late October, XRP has since retreated amid intensified selling pressure. The decline accelerated on November 3, bringing the asset below $2.3 and leaving it vulnerable to further losses if market sentiment fails to improve. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What the Signal Could Mean For Traders The death cross does not guarantee additional downside, but it often reinforces negative sentiment among traders and institutions. Historical data across major cryptocurrencies shows that the pattern tends to precede periods of price stagnation or correction, particularly when accompanied by reduced trading volume. For XRP, this could mean a prolonged consolidation phase unless strong buying interest returns. However, some analysts view the setup as an opportunity rather than a definitive bearish sign. XRP’s current price could be a major buying opportunity for investors interested in medium to long-term holding, as one well-respected analyst recently urged XRP holders to ignore the noise and prepare for a massive upward move.

Bitcoin Could Retest Active Realized Price Next In its latest weekly report, Glassnode has talked about how Bitcoin has dropped a notable distance below the short-term holder (STH) Realized Price. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain metric that tracks the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. To any investor, their break-even mark tends to be a level of particular importance, as retests of it can potentially flip their profit-loss situation. Due to this, Realized Price levels have often shown interactions with the asset’s price, as investors make moves to either exit with their money back or buy more to defend their cost basis. Related Reading: Cardano Retests Line That Has Triggered Strong Rebounds Since Nov 2024 A group that’s considered particularly sensitive to short-term volatility is the STH cohort, made up of the investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The Realized Price of the STHs generally provides support during bullish trends, but with the recent market crash, Bitcoin has plummeted under it. As displayed in the above chart, Bitcoin at its post-crash levels is trading significantly below the STH Realized Price located at $112,500. This means that members of the cohort are now notably underwater. “Historically, discounts with such depth from this level have increased the likelihood of further downside toward lower structural supports,” explained Glassnode. One such support is the Active Realized Price, corresponding to the cost basis of the “economically active” part of the BTC supply. A chunk of the cryptocurrency’s supply has been dormant for so long that it can safely be presumed lost. In other words, these tokens will never make their way back into circulation. Such coins have no effect on the market today, so the Active Realized Price excludes them from the data, labeling them “economically inactive.” The report noted that this level “has often served as a critical reference point during extended corrective phases in prior cycles.” At present, the indicator is sitting near $88,500. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Social Sentiment Collapses, But XRP Just Sees Disinterest The Bitcoin STH Realized Price isn’t the only level that the asset has lost recently. As on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has pointed out in an X post, the asset has also declined below the 365-day moving average (MA). CryptoQuant has described the line as “a key technical and psychological support level last broken at the start of the 2022 bear market.” Considering that Bitcoin has lost the STH Realized Price, and now, this level as well, it remains to be seen whether the asset will end up retesting the Active Realized Price and other lower support levels. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,300, down over 6% in the last seven days.

This dramatic reversal signals renewed institutional confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Drove the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Recovery? The sudden shift in sentiment for Bitcoin spot ETFs comes after nearly a week of consistent outflows. According to data from TraderT, the July 6 influx represents the first positive day for these investment vehicles since the outflow streak began. This development suggests that institutional investors are once again viewing Bitcoin as an attractive asset. The timing of this recovery is particularly significant. Many analysts had been watching the outflow trend closely, concerned about weakening institutional interest. However, the substantial $220.86 million inflow demonstrates that confidence in Bitcoin spot ETFs remains strong among major financial players. Which Bitcoin Spot ETFs Led the Charge? The inflow distribution reveals clear winners in the Bitcoin spot ETFs space. BlackRock’s IBIT emerged as the dominant player, attracting an impressive $93.28 million in net inflows. This substantial amount represents nearly half of the total daily inflow, highlighting BlackRock’s continued leadership in the cryptocurrency ETF market. Other major contributors included: Fidelity’s FBTC with $61.64 million Ark Invest’s ARKB with $60.44 million Bitwise’s BITB with $5.5 million Why Does This Matter for Bitcoin Investors? The resurgence in Bitcoin spot ETFs inflows carries important implications for both retail and institutional investors. First, it indicates that major financial institutions maintain their conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Second, the diverse participation across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs suggests broad-based interest rather than isolated institutional moves. Moreover, this development could signal a potential shift in market sentiment. When institutional money flows into Bitcoin spot ETFs, it often precedes increased retail interest and can contribute to positive price momentum. The timing of this inflow reversal might mark an important inflection point for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. What Challenges Remain for Bitcoin Spot ETFs? Despite the positive news, Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to face several challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a concern for some institutional investors. Additionally, market volatility can still trigger rapid shifts in inflow patterns. However, the strong performance of leading Bitcoin spot ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT demonstrates growing mainstream acceptance. The consistent interest in established Bitcoin spot ETFs also highlights the importance of trusted brand names in the cryptocurrency space. Investors appear to prefer products from well-known financial institutions, which could shape future development in the Bitcoin spot ETFs market. Actionable Insights from the Bitcoin Spot ETFs Inflow For investors monitoring Bitcoin spot ETFs, this development offers several key takeaways. The concentration of inflows in major players suggests that brand reputation matters significantly. Additionally, the sudden reversal after six days of outflows indicates that market sentiment can change rapidly. Investors should consider: Monitoring inflow patterns across different Bitcoin spot ETFs Watching for sustained positive momentum beyond single-day reversals Considering diversification across multiple Bitcoin spot ETFs Staying informed about regulatory developments affecting Bitcoin spot ETFs Conclusion: A Promising Turn for Bitcoin Spot ETFs The $220.86 million inflow represents more than just numbers—it signifies renewed confidence in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption story. As Bitcoin spot ETFs continue to attract significant capital, they reinforce cryptocurrency’s growing role in traditional finance. This development marks an encouraging step forward for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What are Bitcoin spot ETFs? Bitcoin spot ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly. Why did Bitcoin spot ETFs experience outflows for six days? The outflows likely resulted from profit-taking, market uncertainty, or temporary risk aversion among institutional investors before the recent reversal. Which Bitcoin spot ETF performed best in the recent inflow? BlackRock’s IBIT led with $93.28 million in net inflows, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark Invest’s ARKB.

This dramatic shift signals renewed institutional confidence in Ethereum-based investment products, marking a potential inflection point for the digital asset market. What Sparked the ETH ETFs Rebound? The sudden reversal in ETH ETFs flows caught many market observers by surprise. According to data from TraderT, this represents the first positive day after a week-long outflow streak that had investors concerned about institutional sentiment. The timing suggests that major financial players are seeing value in current Ethereum price levels. Market analysts point to several factors driving this change. First, improved regulatory clarity around cryptocurrency investments has provided more confidence. Second, the underlying Ethereum network continues to show strong development activity. Finally, the attractive entry points following recent price corrections may have triggered this institutional buying spree. Which ETH ETFs Led the Charge? The inflow distribution reveals clear winners in the ETH ETFs space. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) emerged as the dominant players, attracting substantial investments that drove the overall positive momentum. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) : $4.59 million inflow Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) : $4.95 million inflow Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW) : $3.08 million inflow These three products accounted for the majority of the day’s positive flows, demonstrating that established financial institutions continue to attract the bulk of institutional capital when it comes to ETH ETFs. Why Did Grayscale’s ETHE Buck the Trend? While most ETH ETFs enjoyed inflows, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) stood out for the wrong reasons. The fund experienced a $3.53 million outflow, continuing its pattern of being the exception in an otherwise positive day for ETH ETFs. This divergence highlights several important considerations for investors. Grayscale’s product carries higher fees compared to newer competitors, which may explain the continued outflows. Additionally, some investors might be rotating from Grayscale’s trust structure to the more tax-efficient ETF format offered by newer entrants. What Does This Mean for Ethereum Investors? The resurgence in ETH ETFs flows provides valuable insights for both retail and institutional investors. This development suggests that professional money managers see current levels as attractive entry points for Ethereum exposure. For long-term investors, the return of institutional interest in ETH ETFs could signal several positive developments. It indicates growing mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate asset class. Moreover, it suggests that sophisticated investors believe in Ethereum’s fundamental value proposition beyond short-term price fluctuations. How Can You Benefit from ETH ETFs Momentum? Understanding the flow patterns in ETH ETFs can help investors make more informed decisions. The current rebound presents opportunities for those looking to gain exposure to Ethereum through regulated, traditional investment vehicles. Diversification : ETH ETFs provide easy access to Ethereum without technical complexities Liquidity : Major ETH ETFs offer high trading volumes and tight spreads Security : Regulated structure provides investor protections Tax Efficiency : ETF structure offers potential tax advantages Conclusion: A New Chapter for ETH ETFs The $9.09 million inflow represents more than just a single day’s trading activity—it marks a potential turning point for ETH ETFs and institutional sentiment toward Ethereum. As major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity continue to attract capital, the legitimacy and maturity of Ethereum as an investment asset becomes increasingly evident. This development should encourage investors to monitor ETH ETFs flows closely, as they often serve as leading indicators of institutional sentiment. The breaking of the seven-day outflow streak suggests that professional investors are once again finding value in Ethereum at current levels, potentially setting the stage for renewed momentum in the weeks ahead. Frequently Asked Questions What are ETH ETFs? ETH ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the price of Ethereum, allowing investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without directly holding it. Why did ETH ETFs see outflows for seven consecutive days? The outflows were likely due to profit-taking, regulatory uncertainty, and broader market sentiment affecting cryptocurrency investments. Which ETH ETF performed best during the rebound? Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) led with $4.95 million in inflows, followed closely by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust with $4.59 million. Should I invest in ETH ETFs now? While the recent inflow is positive, investment decisions should be based on your risk tolerance, investment horizon, and overall portfolio strategy. How often are ETH ETFs flow data updated? Most providers update flow data daily, allowing investors to track institutional sentiment in near real-time. What makes ETH ETFs different from buying Ethereum directly? ETH ETFs offer regulated exposure, easier tax reporting, and integration with traditional brokerage accounts, but may have management fees. Found this analysis of ETH ETFs helpful?

The country’s largest crypto exchanges, Bithumb and Upbit, handled the highest volume of suspicious transfers. Bithumb facilitated about 12.4 billion won ($9 million) in transactions, while Upbit processed 366 million won ($271,000). The funds were sent to Huione Guarantee, a Cambodian online marketplace sanctioned by the U.S. and UK. Most of the transfers were made in USDT stablecoins. “Realistically, it’s extremely difficult to detect all suspicious transactions on Korean exchanges before they occur,” said Youchull Jung, an attorney specializing in white collar crime at Lee & Ko in South Korea. Jung said the movement of crypto from Korean to Cambodian exchanges reflect the cat-and-mouse dynamic in enforcement with reports filed and transactions blocked only after the money had already started to move. Korea’s offshore financial crime crisis Financial scams that funnel crypto to Cambodia has become a flashpoint in national politics. Lawmakers questioned the effectiveness and speed of regulators’ countermeasures at a parliamentary audit on October 27. Jung explained that increased enforcement in South Korea has driven fraudsters to operate from overseas hubs in Cambodia and the Philippines where they work with local criminal networks. Korea’s supercharged crypto market South Korea has emerged as the world’s second-largest market for digital assets behind the United States. The Bank of Korea said the country’s five main exchanges held a combined $73 billion in assets at the end of 2024, with crypto trading volumes surpassing the stock market. The boom led regulators to roll out a landmark digital asset law in 2024 that tightened oversight of exchanges and strengthened investor protections. The measure expanded the earlier AML Act in 2021 and introduced a Travel Rule requiring registered exchanges to share verified information on crypto transfers over one million won (approx. $800). Regulatory arbitrage While regulators have been busy building a framework for its domestic virtual asset space, criminal groups have exploited blind spots in cross border transfers, explained Jongbaek Park, an attorney specializing in digital assets at Bae, Kim, Lee law firm in South Korea. The Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, first enacted in 1999, remains the country’s primary law on cross border payments and remittances. But it predates the rise of digital assets and doesn’t clearly define cryptocurrencies as a legitimate “means of payment,” leaving regulators and users operating in a legal gray area. “Korea has very strict foreign exchange regulations. Under the current rules, anyone remitting securities must file a report with the Bank of Korea in advance,” said Park. “But it’s not clear whether crypto assets or blockchain tokens fall under that requirement.” According to Park, transferring digital tokens without notifying the Bank of Korea could be in breach of the law. High entry barrier for smaller exchanges The AML act reshaped Korea’s crypto landscape. Before it took effect there were roughly 60 exchanges operating nationwide. After enforcement, only five were able to secure the real-name verified bank account needed to offer Korean won trading. Tae Eon Koo, a fintech attorney at Lin Law Firm in South Korea, described the AML Act as both a strength and bottleneck. The real-name trading system is a major component of South Korea’s crypto AML and KYC regulations. It forces crypto exchanges to form an official partnership with a bank. “The requirement to secure a real-name verification partnership with a domestic bank is not written in law but enforced for AML reasons,” he said. “Without this, it makes it nearly impossible for new players seeking to compete with the established ‘Big 5’ exchanges, to enter the market. He said that current regulation has effectively turned banks into gatekeepers to the Korean won market. Attorney Jongbaek Park adds that regulators’ are “conservative” or ‘extremely selective’ when it comes to giving exchanges permission to directly convert cryptocurrency into fiat currency. “The Financial Services Commission, as its policy, does not want banks to give bank accounts to many crypto exchanges. At the moment each bank is only allowed to give one bank account to one exchange.” Breaking the crypto duopoly Binance has regained access to South Korea’s crypto market after winning regulatory approval to acquire a 67% stake in local exchange GOPAX. The clearance from the KoFIU, granted on October 16, marks the first major foreign exchange to enter the market since the introduction of the Travel Rule. Binance exited the country in 2021 when it failed to secure a banking partner. “Its re-entry is a big deal,” said Koo “Because it has the potential to break the current duopoly held by Upbit and Bithumb.” Reverse discrimination Some domestic exchanges have accused regulators of engaging in what they call “reverse discrimination,” where global giants such as Binance encounter fewer entry barriers by buying licensed local platforms in South Korea. Meanwhile, domestic exchanges say strict AML and banking rules continue to hold them back from expanding overseas. “The current market sentiment is that existing regulation is not protecting fair competition,” Koo said. “Instead it may be creating an unbalanced playing field.” But, he said Binance’s return could reshape that balance. “Binance brings massive capital, operational expertise, and, most importantly, deep liquidity,” Koo said. “But how much influence it has will depend on whether regulators allow GOPAX to share its order book with Binance’s global platform.” As global exchanges push in and local players push back, the long-term growth and credibility of its crypto market may hinge on how effectively South Korea can curb financial crime through digital channels.

The recent price action has traders questioning whether the crucial $2.2 support level will hold. This development comes after multiple failed attempts to break through key resistance levels, creating significant uncertainty in the market. What Does the XRP Downward Channel Mean for Investors? The XRP downward channel pattern emerged on the four-hour chart after the asset repeatedly failed to conquer the $2.4 resistance level. This failure triggered a decline below the $2.28 support line, confirming the bearish pattern. Technical analysts note that such channels typically indicate continued downward pressure until either support holds or resistance breaks. Market participants should understand that a downward channel doesn’t necessarily mean continuous selling. Instead, it represents a pattern where both highs and lows are trending downward. The key levels to watch now are: $2.2 support – The critical level that must hold $2.28 resistance – The level that could signal recovery $2.4 resistance – The major barrier that previously rejected price advances How Are Technical Indicators Supporting the XRP Downward Channel Analysis? Multiple technical indicators reinforce the XRP downward channel pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved from neutral territory into oversold conditions, suggesting potential for either a bounce or continued weakness. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed a death cross for the first time in two weeks, adding bearish confirmation. These indicators collectively suggest that selling pressure has intensified. However, oversold conditions could also present buying opportunities for contrarian traders. The current XRP downward channel situation requires careful monitoring of these technical signals for potential entry or exit points. What Are the Potential Scenarios for XRP Price Movement? Traders face two primary scenarios in this XRP downward channel situation. If the $2.2 support level holds firm, we could see consolidation followed by a potential rebound. A daily close above $2.28 would signal strength and possibly trigger a renewed attempt to break the $2.4 resistance. Conversely, if the XRP downward channel continues and $2.2 support breaks, the next significant support levels become: $2.15 – Minor historical support $2.05 – Strong previous resistance turned support $1.95 – Major psychological level The current XRP downward channel presents both risks and opportunities. Patient investors might find attractive entry points if support holds, while aggressive traders could short breakdowns. Why Should You Monitor the XRP Downward Channel Closely? Understanding the XRP downward channel dynamics is crucial because breakouts from such patterns often lead to significant price movements. A successful hold at $2.2 could spark a substantial rally, while a breakdown might accelerate selling pressure. The XRP downward channel represents a critical juncture that could determine short to medium-term price direction. Remember that technical patterns like the XRP downward channel work best when combined with fundamental analysis and market sentiment. Current regulatory developments and overall cryptocurrency market conditions will significantly influence whether support holds or breaks. Conclusion: Navigating the XRP Downward Channel Waters The XRP downward channel presents a clear technical picture with defined risk levels. The $2.2 support represents the line in the sand for bulls, while bears will target a breakdown below this level. Successful trading in this environment requires discipline, patience, and careful risk management. Whether you’re looking to buy the dip or short the breakdown, the XRP downward channel offers defined trade setups with clear invalidation points. Frequently Asked Questions What is a downward channel in technical analysis? A downward channel is a chart pattern where price moves between two descending parallel lines, with lower highs and lower lows indicating bearish momentum. How long do downward channels typically last? Downward channels can last from several days to several weeks, depending on the timeframe being analyzed and market conditions. What happens when XRP breaks out of the downward channel? A breakout above the upper channel line typically signals trend reversal and potential upward movement, while a breakdown below support suggests continued decline. Should I buy XRP during a downward channel? This depends on your risk tolerance and trading strategy. Some traders wait for confirmation of support holding, while others scale in gradually during declines. What other indicators should I watch with the XRP downward channel? Monitor volume patterns, Bollinger Bands, and key moving averages alongside the channel pattern for confirmation signals. Can fundamental news override the downward channel pattern? Yes, significant news events can override technical patterns, which is why traders should always consider both technical and fundamental factors. Found this XRP downward channel analysis helpful?

He noted they managed to reduce inflation without triggering a recession. His remarks come a week after the ECB held interest rates steady for the third consecutive meeting, confident that its policy stance is suitable for controlling inflation without hurting growth. At that time, Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, noted that the eurozone economy had made good progress, but they were navigating a period of uncertainty. She emphasized that the central bank works to maintain a strong position despite the ongoing global geopolitical tensions. Vujcic finds it worrying that retail finds are surpassing hedge funds With inflation at close to 2% and GDP growth stronger than expected for Q3, the deposit rate is unlikely to be cut anytime soon, standing at 2% after eight rounds of cuts. The ECB is set to present new quarterly estimates and provide more clarity on inflation at its December meeting. Still, a few officials worry that the projections could show readings below the target for the next three years. For analysts, a rate cut next month seems unlikely, but there is still a 40% chance of one by mid-2026. Vujcic pointed to potential threats to Europe’s economy, warning about fiscal discipline and signs of markets being overpriced, and noted that redemptions from retail funds outpacing those from hedge funds were especially worrying. He stated, “That’s usually a sign that something’s coming that’s not very good.” However, he insists the bank’s policy is “in a good place.” Speaking on Thursday, Luis de Guindos, the ECB’s Vice President, also argued that the bank is comfortable with existing rates and expects any decline in inflation below 2% to be short-lived. Inflation is forecast to drop below 2% next year. However, some policymakers worried this could anchor expectations at very low levels, similar to the pre-pandemic period. “If (undershooting) happens, it will be something that is going to be temporary. “We can be comfortable with the present level interest rates. I think that convergence to 2% without any overshooting or undershooting is now the main baseline scenario for projections,” de Guindos stated. He added that the recent economic readings have shown solid, if modest, growth of about 1%, in line with the bloc’s potential. As a result, policymakers are now “a bit” more optimistic and see the economy tracking the ECB’s forecasts. The ECB is still struggling to gain support for its digital euro project The ECB is facing difficulties in advancing its digital euro project, as the 2029 launch target is encountering mounting opposition from EU legislators and financial institutions. A consortium of 14 lenders, including Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, and ING, has warned that the digital euro could crowd out private payment systems. The banks have argued that the planned retail digital euro would serve the same purposes as existing private options but without providing added value for users. Fernando Navarrete, a Spanish conservative lawmaker overseeing the Parliament’s assessment of the digital euro, has pressed for a toned-down version of the plan. According to a report he published last week, Navarrete believes the digital euro should function primarily as an offline alternative to cash, rather than as a real-time digital payment system, as the ECB plans. He noted that incorporating online payment features risked setting up a rival payment ecosystem that could block private systems from achieving EU-wide reach. Navarrete argued that an online version of the digital euro should be introduced only if European payment firms fail to compete effectively with US giants. The ECB began exploring the idea of a digital euro in 2020. Last week, its Governing Council agreed to move forward with preparations to make issuance possible by 2029, with a pilot phase planned for 2027. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

She pointed out that dollar-pegged tokens are quickly becoming the preferred store of value in emerging markets facing inflation and currency instability. While Wood is still bullish on Bitcoin as a digital store of value similar to gold, she acknowledged that stablecoins are filling a growing need for liquidity and stability. Stablecoins Challenge Bitcoin Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, trimmed her long-term Bitcoin price forecast by $300,000, and pointed to the rapid rise of stablecoins in emerging markets as a major factor reshaping Bitcoin’s role in the global financial landscape. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Wood explained that she now expects Bitcoin to reach around $1.2 million by 2030, which is down from her earlier $1.5 million projection. She lowered her projection due to the growing dominance of stablecoins as a preferred store of value and medium of exchange in developing economies. “Stablecoins are usurping part of the role that we thought Bitcoin would play,” Wood said, and explained that dollar-pegged tokens are scaling faster than many analysts anticipated. Still, she reiterated her bullish outlook on Bitcoin, and described it as a “global monetary system” and a distinct form of digital gold, while stablecoins are “just cash tokenized on a blockchain.” Her comments were made during a broader trend where emerging market economies are turning to stablecoins to hedge against local currency instability, hyperinflation, and restrictive monetary policies. According to Standard Chartered, stablecoins could drain over $1 trillion from the traditional banking system in emerging markets by 2028, as residents opt for dollar-pegged digital assets over local fiat. Countries like Venezuela and Argentina have become hotspots for this shift. Venezuela is grappling with inflation rates as high as 269% in 2025, and saw widespread adoption of stablecoins like Tether’s USDT as an alternative to both the bolivar and physical US dollars. Meanwhile, strict currency controls and limited access to foreign exchange drive citizens to rely on blockchain-based assets for savings and international transactions. (Source: Chainalysis) Reports in 2024 even suggested that the Venezuelan government used stablecoins to circumvent US sanctions and conduct oil trades. Despite Bitcoin’s slightly lowered forecast, Wood’s stance proves that Bitcoin continues to hold its position as a store of value, while stablecoins increasingly fill the demand for stability and liquidity in regions that are most affected by economic volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 05:30:00

This emergency action comes directly after the devastating Stream Finance incident that resulted in massive financial losses. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges facing synthetic stablecoins in today’s volatile crypto market. Why did Elixir suspend deUSD support? The decision to suspend deUSD support stems from the catastrophic Stream Finance incident, which caused approximately $93 million in losses. Elixir Network, a modular blockchain specializing in decentralized order book liquidity, took immediate action to protect remaining assets and users. The platform recognized the severe implications of continuing operations while the stablecoin’s backing was compromised. Stream Finance’s collapse created an unsustainable situation for deUSD. With approximately 65% of deUSD’s reserve assets tied to the failed platform, the stablecoin faced immediate liquidity and solvency issues. This dependency created a domino effect that forced Elixir’s hand in making the suspension decision. What happened during the Stream Finance incident? The Stream Finance incident represents one of the most significant DeFi failures in recent months. The platform suffered a catastrophic loss that impacted numerous projects and users across the ecosystem. Key aspects of the incident include: $93 million total losses across affected platforms 65% of deUSD reserves were exposed to Stream Finance Immediate depegging of deUSD from the US dollar Price collapse to just 1.5 cents per deUSD token This chain of events demonstrates how interconnected the DeFi ecosystem has become and how quickly problems can spread between platforms. How is Elixir handling repayments to affected users? Elixir Network has taken proactive steps to address user concerns following the deUSD suspension. The platform has already completed repayments to 80% of deUSD holders, showing commitment to user protection despite the challenging circumstances. However, the remaining 20% of holders still await resolution, creating uncertainty within the community. The repayment process highlights both the platform’s responsiveness and the limitations of current DeFi insurance mechanisms. While Elixir moves quickly to address immediate concerns, the situation raises important questions about risk management in decentralized finance. What does deUSD’s depegging mean for synthetic stablecoins? The dramatic depegging of deUSD to just 1.5 cents represents a severe blow to confidence in synthetic stablecoins. This event serves as a stark reminder that algorithmic and synthetic stablecoins carry different risks compared to traditional fiat-backed stablecoins. The depegging occurred rapidly following the Stream Finance revelation, catching many investors off guard. This development forces the broader crypto community to reconsider: Risk assessment for synthetic asset investments Due diligence requirements for reserve backing Diversification strategies across different stablecoin types Emergency response plans for protocol failures What lessons can we learn from Elixir’s deUSD suspension? The Elixir suspends deUSD support situation provides valuable insights for both developers and investors in the DeFi space. The incident underscores the importance of transparent reserve management and the dangers of over-concentration in any single platform or asset. Projects must implement more robust risk management frameworks to prevent similar cascading failures. For investors, this event reinforces the need for thorough research into reserve compositions and dependency risks. The rapid spread of problems from Stream Finance to deUSD demonstrates how quickly value can evaporate in interconnected DeFi ecosystems. Conclusion: Navigating the aftermath of deUSD suspension The Elixir suspends deUSD support decision marks a pivotal moment for decentralized finance. While the immediate focus remains on user repayments and damage control, the long-term implications will shape how synthetic assets are structured and regulated. The incident serves as both a warning and learning opportunity for the entire crypto industry. As Elixir Network continues addressing the fallout, the community watches closely to see how recovery efforts progress. The platform’s handling of this crisis will likely influence future trust in similar DeFi projects and synthetic asset offerings. Frequently Asked Questions What is Elixir Network? Elixir Network is a modular blockchain designed specifically for decentralized order book liquidity, enabling more efficient trading in DeFi ecosystems. Why did deUSD lose its peg? deUSD lost its peg because 65% of its reserve assets were tied to Stream Finance, which suffered a $93 million collapse, destroying the stablecoin’s backing. Will Elixir resume deUSD support? Currently, Elixir has suspended deUSD support indefinitely. Future decisions will depend on the resolution of the Stream Finance situation and reassessment of synthetic asset risks. How much have users lost in this incident? The Stream Finance incident resulted in approximately $93 million in total losses, though Elixir has already repaid 80% of affected deUSD holders. What happens to my deUSD tokens now? deUSD tokens have depegged to approximately 1.5 cents. Elixir is processing repayments, with 80% of holders already compensated through their recovery program. Are other stablecoins at risk? While each stablecoin has different backing mechanisms, this incident highlights the importance of understanding reserve compositions and diversification across all synthetic assets.

Persistent bearish sentiment continues to weigh on the broader crypto market, even as technical indicators point to potential consolidation. BTC faced strong resistance around a previously broken trendline on Monday, triggering an 8.18% decline through Tuesday. The selloff pushed the asset to retest the 50% retracement level near $100,353, where it found short-term support. A modest 2.35% rebound on Wednesday briefly lifted prices, but gains were largely erased the following day. As of Friday, Bitcoin hovered around $102,200, with traders assessing whether the digital asset could stabilise above key technical levels after one of its steepest weekly drops since early autumn. JPMorgan predicts Bitcoin could climb to $170,000 Despite recent weakness, JPMorgan analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s medium-term outlook. In a new research note, the bank’s strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and his team said they expect Bitcoin to rise as high as $170,000 within the next 6 to 12 months, citing improving market structure and fading selling pressure. The team noted that the perpetual futures market, a key driver of short-term price swings, appears to have stabilized after weeks of forced liquidations. “The message from recent stabilisation is that deleveraging in perpetual futures is largely behind us,” the note said, suggesting a shift from correction to accumulation. JPMorgan’s price target is derived from a comparative valuation model that aligns Bitcoin’s performance with that of gold. The analysts said Bitcoin’s current valuation remains below its fair value when adjusted for risk relative to the precious metal, implying room for further upside as market conditions normalise. Ethereum and XRP find support after steep drops Ethereum (ETH) also showed signs of stabilisation following a sharp midweek decline. The cryptocurrency was trading around $3,300 on Friday after falling nearly 16% earlier in the week. ETH faced rejection at its 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $3,906 on Monday before sliding to test the 50% retracement level at $3,171. Although a mild rebound followed on Wednesday, the recovery stalled at a broken trendline the next day. Analysts said a sustained hold above $3,171 could open the door for a move toward the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around $3,593. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) continued to trade defensively near $2.22 after multiple failed attempts to break higher. The token fell 12% earlier in the week after being rejected near its 50-day EMA at $2.58. It recovered slightly midweek but again met resistance at $2.35, a key daily level. A close above $2.35 could allow XRP to retest the 50-day EMA near $2.58, though momentum remains fragile amid waning investor confidence across altcoins. Top gainers and losers Filecoin (FIL) rose about 55.96% in the past 24 hours to roughly $2.12, leading the list of top gainers. Internet Computer (ICP) gained about 27.70% over the same period, trading near $7.56 and ranking second among gainers. MYX Finance (MYX) advanced about 23.66% in 24 hours to around $2.46, placing third on the gainers’ board. Tezos (XTZ) increased about 21.88% to approximately $0.6480, taking the fourth spot among the top performers. Zcash (ZEC) climbed about 19.23% to around $597.11, rounding out the top five gainers. Among the day’s top losers, ZKsync (ZK) fell about 7.51% in 24 hours to roughly $0.06649, topping the list. Aster (ASTER) declined about 6.63% to near $1.02, ranking second among losers. DoubleZero (2Z) dropped about 6.14% to around $0.1651, placing third. OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) slid about 6.01% to $7.63, taking the fourth spot among decliners.

South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has announced a temporary suspension of ATOM deposits and withdrawals. This essential maintenance window begins at 9:00 a.m. UTC on November 10th to facilitate a crucial network upgrade for the Cosmos ecosystem. What Does the Upbit ATOM Suspension Mean for You?

According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the ETF adopts an approach that could automatically make it effective within twenty days if the US SEC doesn’t object. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention. 4:03 am · 7 Nov 2025 19 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies The move comes after Bitwise’s BSOL (Solana Staking ETF) started trading in late October, recording staggering $56M in trading volume and $69M inflows within the first 24 hours. Such developments reflect increasing demand from institutions and retailers interested in cryptocurrency exposure through compliant monetary vehicles. Bitwise has established itself as a pioneer of advanced cryptocurrency ETFs. As applicants move beyond the common Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds, the company wants to dominate meme crypto ETFs. Keep in mind that REX-Osprey’s Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) launched last month . Meanwhile, the 8(a) filing underscores Bitwise’s confidence as issuers use these filings when expecting minimal objections from regulators. While approval isn’t a guarantee, the automatic effectiveness phrase will likely pressure the SEC to respond faster. The 8(a) filing: what is it all about? Under the SEA (Securities Exchange Act) of 1934, 8(a) forms allow companies to apply for automatic registration of specific asset classes. For exchange-traded funds, the Trust can go live if the SEC doesn’t object or intervene within 20 days. The mechanism could prove crucial, especially after the new generic listing rules softened regulations. Meanwhile, Bitwise’s 8(a) spot DOGE ETF filing reflects the firm’s conviction in no major regulatory challenges or desire to push beyond the boundaries of existing policy. If the ETF launches without the SEC’s intervention, it might set the stage for similar applications in the coming times. An approved Dogecoin ETF would offer investors exposure to the meme without directly holding the tokens. The exchange-traded fund would keep DOGE in custody while tracking its real-time price movements. Dogecoin’s mainstream journey Dogecoin launched in 2013 as an internet joke. However, it has evolved into a financial giant with a nearly $25 billion market cap. While social media hype, especially on X, has fueled DOGE’s growth in recent years, the project has continued to shed its meme identity. Dogecoin is gaining real-world utility through cryptocurrency reserves and ETFs. For instance, CleanCore plans to accumulate up to 5% of DOGE’s supply. Spot Dogecoin ETFs mark a strategic step in transforming the altcoin from a meme token to a compliant fiscal asset. DOGE price outlook The original meme token has struggled lately, down 11% on the weekly timeframe. It is trading at $0.1642 after a brief decline over the past 24 hours. Chart by CoinMarketCap Bulls should reclaim the key level at $0.1884 to shift DOGE’s short-term trajectory to the upside. That’s a roughly 13% increase from the market price.

An Expert Analyst Responds,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-caused-bitcoins-recent-price-drop-an-expert-analyst-responds/,"The cryptocurrency market came under severe selling pressure in the first week of November, with the outlook weakening. As October's volatile run continues, Bitcoin fell nearly 21% from its recent high to $99,000 on Tuesday. While BTC soon returned above the psychological $100,000 threshold, experts believe the crypto market's extraordinary rally may be over for a while. The declines in Bitcoin and altcoins over the past week are particularly striking. Today, Bitcoin rebounded slightly to just below $101,000, but it's still down about 5% on a weekly basis. Ethereum fell 12% to below $3,372 during the same period, while Solana fell 19% to below $158. While Bitcoin advocates tout the asset as a “gold-like independent store of value,” its price movements are also aligned with global economic conditions. Last week's cryptocurrency market weakness coincided with uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future policy and a decline in the S&P 500. Related News: Surprising Statements from Ripple (XRP) CEO Brad Garlinghouse: “In 2026...” Jasper De Maere, OTC trader at Wintermute, noted that the current weakness is a “combination of the October 10 crash, a slightly more hawkish tone from the Fed, and a general risk-off trend.” Recent statements from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have also dampened the crypto market. Powell said the October interest rate cut could be the last of the year, noting that committee members have “differing views” on the future. Bitcoin and Ethereum retreated 1.6% and 2%, respectively, in the 24 hours following Powell's remarks. Some analysts believe the crypto market weakness could persist for some time. “Many long-term investors who believe in the four-year cycle theory are selling positions, convinced the cycle has peaked,” said James Butterfill, research director at CoinShares. *This is not investment advice.

The study notes that Polymarket was not itself responsible for wash trading, while the crypto-based structure could have enabled it. In 2024, concerns over wash trading and potential market manipulation plagued the decentralized prediction platform. At the time, researchers noted that a “significant portion” of the virtual market’s activity might stem from wash trading. Wash trading is a tactic where shares are repeatedly bought and sold to give the impression of higher trading volume. The volume of activity on Polymarket has been significantly inflated by so-called wash trading in which users rapidly buy and sell the same contracts, according to a new study by Columbia University researchers https://t.co/kWTEDPn6IS — Bloomberg (@business) November 7, 2025 Key Findings: Artificial Trading Skews Polymarket’s True Activity The study says that the phenomenon referred to as “artificial trading” has accounted for nearly 25% of all buy and sell transactions on Polymarket over the last three years. A Polymarket representative told Bloomberg on Friday that the predictions market is reviewing the study and has no immediate comment. Per the researchers’ algorithm split up, the prevalence of wash trade was found to be 45% of all-time volume in sports markets, 17% in election markets, 12% in politics markets, and 3% in crypto markets. “I’m hopeful that Polymarket will welcome the analysis in our paper,” Yash Kanoria, a professor at Columbia University’s business school and co-author, told Bloomberg . “Wash trading doesn’t add liquidity or information to the market, so it would seem valuable to distinguish authentic from inauthentic volume.” The prediction market hit record highs in October for volume, active traders, and new market launches, led by the native token launch . Polymarket trading volume reached an unprecedented $2.59 billion high in October. The platform recently announced securing $205 million across two previously undisclosed funding rounds, between 2024 and 2025, valuing the firm at $1.2 billion. Polymarket Accuracy and Indicators of Credibility According to independent tracking, Polymarket is more than 95% accurate in the closing hours of a market. In a detailed analysis , Cryptonews author Eric Huffman notes that Polymarket is legit and legal in many leading markets worldwide. The platform’s top rival Kalshi, achieved a monthly trading volume record, breaking above $4.39B in October. According to data collected by Dune Analytics , Kalshi and Polymarket saw notional trading volume rise above $2 billion for the first time during the week ending Oct. 19. In the U.S., the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) labeled Polymarket’s prediction markets as “binary options,” which can only be offered by a registered exchange. This resulted in a $1.4 million civil penalty for Polymarket and forced the platform to restrict access to U.S. users.

XRP Network Growth Metric Has Spiked Recently According to data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment , XRP has seen a huge spike in its Network Growth recently. This indicator keeps track of the daily total amount of addresses coming online on the blockchain for the first time. A wallet is “online” on the network when it participates in some kind of transaction activity. As such, the addresses coming online for the first time would be those making their first transaction. When the value of the Network Growth is high, it means a large number of addresses are joining the network. Such a trend can arise due to a number of reasons. New investors coming into the market and old ones who had sold earlier, making a return, both contribute to a rise in the metric. Similarly, existing users creating multiple wallets for a purpose like privacy also naturally contribute to the indicator’s growth. In general, an uptick in the metric involves all of these factors simultaneously to some degree, meaning that whenever its value is high, some net adoption of the asset can be assumed to be occurring. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Network Growth over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Network Growth has observed a huge spike recently, implying a large number of new addresses have been created on the blockchain. This uptick in wallet generation came alongside the crash in the asset’s price. In total, 21,595 new addresses made their first transaction for the first time in a 48-hour span, the highest level in 8 months. Given the timing of the spike, it’s possible that new investors are swooping in to buy the XRP dip. The last time retail adoption occurred at a similar rate was in July. Back then, retail FOMO coincided with a top in the cryptocurrency’s price. This time around, the asset has actually seen a rebound since the spike occurred, so it only remains to be seen whether the trend will continue. XRP Price Has Made Some Recovery Bearish winds have calmed a bit for XRP as its price has climbed back to the $2.3 level from its low on Tuesday. Though on the weekly timeframe, the coin is still down more than 10%. Interestingly, the low around $2 during the market crash was right at the lower level of the consolidation channel highlighted by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post . Sharing the chart, the analyst had noted that this $2 lower level could be where XRP can find support. So far, it appears that the line has been holding up.",XRP|XRP Addresses|XRP Adoption|XRP Network Growth|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 06:00:01

Crypto market expert Tara has emphasized that this ongoing retracement sets the foundation for Bitcoin’s next major bottom. Her analysis points to a potential Wave 5 correction that could drive the BTC price as low as $94,000 before the next major bullish trend begins. Bitcoin Price Eyes Recovery After Wave 5 Retracement In a technical analysis shared on X social media, Tara disclosed that Bitcoin’s latest price correction “is probably one of the most important retraces it will have in a long time.” She views the decline as an essential process that prepares the leading cryptocurrency for a strong rebound in the future. Based on her Elliott Wave analysis, there are only two waves left before the broader market shift begins. Related Reading: Analyst’s Full Market Breakdown Shows Why Bitcoin Price Is Headed For $120,000 The analyst notes that the primary reason the Bitcoin price crash is important is that it allows the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to recover, creating ideal conditions for a Bullish Divergence. Subsequently, this divergence could establish a solid bottom for BTC, which is a critical signal for the start of a renewed uptrend. In her chart, Tara identifies a key Fibonacci Retracement zone between $103,400 and $104,900 as the resistance range for its current wave. The 0.382 Fib level is located near $103,478, where the Bitcoin price intersects with the Moving Average (MA), while the 0.5 Fib level aligns with $104,943. The analyst notes that this range could act as a crucial pivot zone before BTC resumes its correction in the final Wave 5 down to $94,000. Additionally, the chart shows that Bitcoin is currently retracing from a previous low near the 0.618 Fibonacci Extension around $103,755.79. Trading volume has also declined by over 48% in the past 24 hours, while RSI remains weak at 33.96, signaling that the market is still oversold. Why The Path To $94,000 Matters For The Next Bull Cycle In responding to questions from crypto community members under her X post, Tara clarified that Bitcoin could first rise to $104,000, representing a 0.97% increase from current levels above $103,000, before crashing 9.6% to $94,000. She expects a price bottom to occur quickly and soon, whereas it may take longer for Bitcoin to build solid support before reversing into a new bullish phase. Related Reading: Here’s What Happened The Last Time The Bitcoin Price Closed October In The Red Tara stated that the ongoing retracement could peak around the day of her analysis, but the bottom might take a few more days to form. Despite the anticipated “pain,” she reassured market watchers that the correction is necessary for Bitcoin’s next leg higher. She also emphasized that the market may not feel bullish until mid-December 2025.

Speaking about conversations with enterprise clients, he explained that one executive admitted to being “too scared about crypto.” Ver Eecke said he responded by suggesting a product that could move money within minutes. The executive then noted he had subsidiaries in Europe holding $50 million in reserve due to settlement delays of several days, saying he could free that cash and generate yield if faster movement were possible. The @GTreasury CEO Renaat Ver Eecke at @ripple Swell says his clients have a problem. They need to be able to move $50 million+ in a fast and inexpensive way. They may want to put @bgarlinghouse best friend @arrington on the phone with them. XRP solves this. You know where… pic.twitter.com/VqOIVU22nu — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) November 5, 2025 XRP as a Solution for High-Value Transactions Digital Asset Investor attached a separate clip of Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital, discussing a prior transaction executed with XRP. Arrington recounted moving over $50 million with XRP in 2 seconds for $0.3 . He added that the process “fills a big need” for institutions and compared it to traditional financial systems that can take days and charge higher fees for similar transfers. His comments reinforced XRP’s established reputation for speed and low transaction cost, an aspect that continues to attract institutional interest. Arrington explained that when limited partners eventually request redemptions, “we just send it in XRP again,” emphasizing the efficiency of cross-border settlements without traditional wire delays. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Connecting Institutional Needs and Blockchain Efficiency Ver Eecke’s remarks aligned with a growing recognition among corporates that slow settlements limit access to liquidity. Many large organizations continue to hold substantial idle balances in different regions to mitigate payment delays, a practice that can reduce yield opportunities and tie up operational capital. The comments from the video highlighted a persistent issue in corporate treasury management, a liquidity trapped in waiting periods and settlement lags. GTreasury’s role in solving these inefficiencies has expanded since its planned $1 billion acquisition by Ripple, which aims to integrate blockchain technology with traditional treasury operations. For GTreasury, whose clients manage billions across multiple jurisdictions, the ability to move funds of $50 million or more within seconds would mark a significant shift from traditional payment rails. If Ripple’s integration with GTreasury’s systems succeeds, it could enable institutions to deploy cash more dynamically and introduce XRP as a solution to many financial problems worldwide.

Miran said neither an aggressive interest rate cut was necessary nor was there a need to make up for steps not taken in the past. Miran said, “There's no need for a 75 basis point interest rate cut. Similarly, I don't see a need to make up for the inadequacy of previous cuts.” Related News: Three Top-Level FED Officials Made Critical Statements About the US Economy Miran, noting that there are differing opinions within the Fed regarding the magnitude of interest rate cuts, stated that he wants to reach neutral interest rates with 50 basis point steps, while many of his colleagues prefer gradual cuts of 25 basis points. Miran used cautious language when stating that a rate cut in December was highly likely. Speaking to the Monetary Matters podcast, he said: “Unless there are any surprises, I expect we will cut interest rates in December. The distribution of votes on the table is actually different from the distribution of opinion.

The downturn was compounded by renewed geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, which further unsettled investor confidence across asset classes. Weak trade data from top consumer China also weighed on the sentiment. Gold prices rose to around $4,000 per ounce on Friday after soft labor data reinforced expectations of a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.48% to around 50,220 while the broader Topix Index lost 0.5% to 3,297 on Friday, erasing gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen traded near 153 on Friday, holding gains from the previous session as a broad risk-off wave, triggered by mounting concerns overstretched AI valuations, lifted demand for the safe-haven currency. Household spending in Japan rose 1.8% yoy in September 2025, missing market estimates of 2.5% and easing from a 2.3% growth in the prior month. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.21% toward 4,000 while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.2% to 13,430 on Friday, with mainland stocks snapping a two-day decline, and the offshore yuan weakened to around 7.12 per dollar on Friday, reversing gains from the previous session as China’s unexpected export contraction weighed on an economy facing a year-end slowdown. China's trade surplus narrowed significantly in October 2025 , falling to USD 90.07 billion. This figure was smaller than market expectations of USD 95.6 billion and marked a decrease from the USD 95.72 billion recorded in the same month last year. It represents the country's smallest trade surplus since February, driven by an unexpected decline in exports combined with a rise in imports. The U.S. is moving ahead with President Donald Trump’s plan to pause penalties targeting China’s shipbuilding industry, a key concession in his interim trade pact with President Xi Jinping, the office of the U.S. Trade representative announced on Thursday. Attention also turned to October Chinese CPI and PPI data due over the weekend, with deflation risks still a concern. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 1.17% to 26,282 in Friday’s morning session, retreating after their biggest one-day gain since mid-August amid caution ahead of China’s October trade data. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.39% to 82,794, hitting its lowest level since October 15 and marking a third consecutive session of losses. The Indian rupee traded around 88.6 per dollar, moving in a tight range, as the Reserve Bank continued its regular interventions to curb excessive volatility. India’s Securities and Exchange Board and the Reserve Bank of India are considering allowing commercial banks to trade in commodity derivatives to enhance market liquidity. India’s Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that talks are progressing rapidly between India and New Zealand, expressing hope that the free trade agreement will be finalized soon, according to news agency PTI. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.66% to around 8,827 in Friday morning trade, pausing the previous session’s advance, as losses in tech shares outweighed gains in energy and gold stocks. The Australian dollar depreciated below $0.650, hitting its lowest level in four weeks, as renewed risk-off sentiment swept across global markets. In the U.S. on Thursday, all three major indexes ended in red with the S&P 500 down 1%, the Nasdaq off 1.7%, and the Dow Jones slipping 317 points as renewed pressure on AI-linked and tech shares weighed on Wall Street. Concerns over lofty AI valuations resurfaced after mixed earnings. U.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday after a sharp selloff in the previous session, as renewed pressure on tech and AI-linked shares dragged Wall Street lower: Dow +0.25% ; S&P 500 +0.28% ; Nasdaq +0.35% .

The president noted that a plan B would be needed in case the trial “does not proceed smoothly,” adding, “We can do other things, but they will be slower in comparison.” Trump's comments come as the Supreme Court this week hears two separate legal challenges to the president's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for tariffs, particularly those against Canada, which are also under scrutiny. Related News: Three Top-Level FED Officials Made Critical Statements About the US Economy During the hearing, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court justices sharply questioned Trump's lawyer. Both liberal and conservative justices questioned why the president had invoked the national security law for the tariffs, and why the law in question didn't even mention the word “tariffs” or anything similar. Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, defended the tariffs as “extremely important.” The president said the court's decision was critical for the United States and that a negative ruling could be “devastating.” The Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision by June at the latest, but it is highly likely that the decision will come much earlier. *This is not investment advice.

54122849,623230,1762498800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54122849.jpeg,"Ripple CLO Sees ‘Skinny’ Fed Account As Solution To Banking Concerns, Touts Benefits",https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-skinny-fed-account-solution-to-banking/,"Blockchain payment company Ripple, expressed support for the concept of a “skinny” Federal Reserve (Fed) payments account tailored for non-banking entities through its chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty. This account could reportedly address concerns from traditional banks about financial stability and competitive risks. Ripple Seeks Fed Master Account In an interview with Reuters, Alderoty described the idea as “attractive” and suggested it could provide reassurance to conventional banks wary of increased competition from lightly-regulated non-banks. Ripple had previously applied for a Fed master account back in July of this year, which would enable the company to connect directly to the US central bank’s payment infrastructure, circumventing the need for intermediaries. The Federal Reserve has historically been cautious about granting access to its payment systems to less-regulated entities, partly due to concerns from banks regarding potential risks to the financial system. However, in a notable policy shift, Fed Governor Christopher Waller recently indicated that the central bank is considering a “skinny” master account. This account would allow firms to access Fed payment services without offering other key benefits, such as interest payments, overdraft privileges, or access to emergency lending. Even with these limitations, a “skinny” account could still facilitate Ripple’s ability to quickly convert reserves into its dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD . This direct access to the Fed’s services would streamline transactions and reduce costs associated with relying on bank intermediaries. Industry Leaders Weigh In Alderoty emphasized the importance of redeemability, stating that having access to a master account would provide the most efficient and transparent means to manage US dollar assets and Treasuries. Waller clarified that the concept remains a prototype and is subject to change. He noted that the intended use of such accounts would be limited, aiming to avoid encroaching on the traditional banking sector’s operations . Additionally, he mentioned that these “skinny” accounts could allow crypto institutions access to Fed payment rails on a “streamlined timeline,” albeit without certain advantages like interest on account balances or overdraft options. However, Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long, who is also founder and CEO of Custodia, a Wyoming-chartered crypto bank that has long sought a full-fledged master account, expressed caution on the idea of such concepts. She pointed out that Waller’s announcement specified that the Federal Reserve’s new program would apply only to “legally eligible entities,” highlighting the importance of the details in the implementation. At the time of writing, the firm’s associated cryptocurrency, XRP, was trading at $2.22, indicating significant losses in line with the broader crypto market’s current downturn. Over the last 24 hours and seven days, the altcoin has lost 6% and 8% in value, respectively.

Traders are watching closely as the price hovers above the rising 20-month EMA, a crucial line that could determine whether the next leg higher unfolds. XRP Maintains Bullish Structure Above $1.75 Support Providing an update on the XRP chart, More Crypto Online highlighted that the situation remains largely unchanged, with price action still developing within a broader bullish structure. The analyst emphasized that the ongoing movement continues to follow a pattern of three-wave pullbacks, suggesting that the uptrend remains intact as long as XRP holds above the critical $1.75 support level. Related Reading: Massive XRP Rally Ahead? Bold Forecast Calls For $100 Before 2030 According to his analysis, as long as buyers continue to defend this zone, the structure points toward an eventual continuation of the upward trend. The repeated three-wave corrections indicate that the market may still be in a controlled consolidation phase rather than a reversal. However, the analyst highlighted that a confirmed breakout has yet to occur. The key resistance zone between $2.69 and $2.84 continues to act as a ceiling, limiting XRP’s upward momentum. Until the price breaks above this range decisively, the broader market will likely remain in a phase of consolidation and uncertainty. More Crypto Online added that a five-wave breakout above the $2.84 level could signal renewed strength and open the door to higher targets. The next major objective in that case would be around $3.40, which could serve as a staging point for another push toward the $5 region. XRP’s 20-Month EMA Emerges As The Line Between Strength and Struggle In an XRP post, ChartNerd pointed out that the 20-month Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is positioned around $1.94 and is gradually climbing. This long-term moving average has historically served as a strong indicator of trend direction, and its current trajectory suggests that the broader bullish structure could still be intact. Related Reading: XRP Price Gains Traction — Buyers Pile In Ahead Of Key Technical Breakout ChartNerd emphasized that turning the 20-month EMA into solid support would be a significant confirmation of continued upside momentum, paving the way for XRP to push toward higher resistance zones in the coming sessions. The analyst remains optimistic that the EMA will act as a reliable foundation for further gains. However, ChartNerd also cautioned that a decisive drop below the $1.94 EMA could weaken the bullish outlook, triggering a deeper retracement. Still, he noted that “the boat is yet to raise its sails,” implying that XRP’s next major move has yet to unfold, and patience may be key as traders await confirmation of the next trend direction.

The document, shared by crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), outlines how Ripple’s balance sheet and new accounting standards could transform its financial reporting and elevate its standing among top digital asset companies. The report examined Ripple’s corporate structure as one built around its XRP holdings. It states that Ripple “appears to have no liabilities and two assets: cash or securities for $1 billion, and 46 billion XRP tokens .” This establishes that the majority of Ripple’s value depends on the price of XRP rather than traditional equity or cash reserves. The document compared different valuation scenarios, showing that the company’s implied value rises significantly as XRP’s price rises. RIPPLE’S IPO VALUE IS DIRECTLY TIED TO XRP’S MARKET PRICE + NEW ACCOUNTING RULES COULD MAKE IT ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES IN CRYPTO Few realize how deeply Ripple’s future IPO value depends on the price of XRP.

Based on that price, Ripple’s theoretical full value was listed at $28.6 billion. Secondary market estimates placed it at $4.5 billion, while a tender offer implied an $11.3 billion valuation. At the current XRP price of $2.35, Ripple’s theoretical full valuation would rise to roughly $112 billion, with corresponding adjustments suggesting secondary market and tender offer values near $17.6 billion and $44.3 billion, respectively. This would place Ripple above Coinbase and several major U.S. banks The document described an 84% discount in secondary markets and a 60% discount in tender offers. This shows how private market equity values diverged from the token-based valuation model.

With a large portion of Ripple’s holdings in digital form , traditional valuation methods struggle to capture the company’s full market potential. New Accounting Standards Tie Ripple’s Value to XRP Price The Financial Accounting Standards Board’s ASU 2023-8, released in December 2023, requires companies holding cryptocurrencies to report them at fair value. The report noted that this “could cause the financial statements for a potential IPO of Ripple to reflect the market price of the XRP token.” This change means Ripple’s future financial reports could adjust dynamically with XRP’s real-time market price. SMQKE emphasized that Ripple’s largest asset is its XRP holdings and that every increase in XRP’s price directly boosts Ripple’s reported value.

Long highlighted that Ripple is actively exploring enhancements aimed at solidifying the XRP Ledger as a leading platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. “Next up is a lending protocol,” Long announced, signaling one of the most anticipated features in the pipeline. This move advances Ripple’s strategy to expand the XRP Ledger beyond fast, scalable payments. By integrating a lending protocol, a key DeFi tool for borrowing and lending assets on-chain, XRPL could become a competitive hub for decentralized finance, attracting both retail and institutional users. Long highlighted Ripple’s substantial internal investment in expanding XRP Ledger’s capabilities. “There’s a lot of investment internally and just expanding the use cases and capabilities,” she noted. This underscores Ripple’s commitment to advancing technology while building a robust ecosystem around XRP. The proposed amendments and new features signal a strategic effort to make the ledger more versatile, secure, and appealing to developers creating innovative financial products. Amid fierce DeFi competition from Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche, Ripple’s introduction of a lending protocol signals its push to expand the XRPL’s utility and capture a larger share of the evolving blockchain finance market. As Ripple evolves the XRP Ledger, its upcoming lending protocol could bridge traditional finance with blockchain innovation. Under Monica Long, Ripple aims to position XRP beyond a fast payment token, as a core platform for a next-generation decentralized financial ecosystem. XRP Holds Key Support, Eyes Potential Rebound Toward $3 XRP buyers have successfully defended a critical suppor t zone between $2 and $2.20, according to market analyst Anasta, signaling that the cryptocurrency may be poised for a renewed upward move. This support level has historically acted as a strong floor, and its defense suggests that investor confidence remains intact amid broader market fluctuations. XRP’s current momentum remains subdued, reflecting cautious trader sentiment. Yet, according to Anasta, the market’s structure still supports a potential rebound. If buying pressure strengthens at the $2–$2.20 support zone, XRP could rally toward the $2.60–$3.00 range, signaling a notable upside opportunity from current levels. Technical indicators show XRP consolidating, a phase that often precedes major price moves. Holding above $2 has solidified a strong support zone and signaled potential accumulation. Analysts note that maintaining this level is crucial for a sustained bullish outlook, as a break below could trigger renewed selling pressure. What’s next? Well, Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic because despite subdued momentum, the current setup positions XRP for a potential breakout if demand strengthens, making the $2.20 support zone a key pivot for the next phase of price action as the altcoin hovers around $2.24. Conclusion With major upgrades on the horizon, most notably a lending protocol, Ripple is charting a bold course for the future of blockchain finance. By expanding the XRP Ledger’s functionality and driving broader adoption, the company aims to strengthen XRP’s utility and cement its role as a leading platform for decentralized innovation. Therefore, these developments could redefine how users and institutions engage with digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional finance and DeFi. On the other hand, XRP’s steady hold above the $2–$2.20 support zone highlights strong buyer conviction despite muted momentum. The structure points to underlying bullish pressure, with the next move hinging on renewed demand. Sustained buying could propel XRP toward $2.60–$3.00, signaling a potential bullish revival, while a breakdown below support may trigger a brief correction before recovery. For now, this key range remains the decisive battleground for XRP’s next major trend.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 07:04:33

Key Takeaways: Elixir halted support for its deUSD stablecoin following Stream Finance’s $93 million loss, which caused deUSD to crash to $0.015. Stream’s leveraged exposure, with $68 million owed to Elixir, triggered the 90% plunge of its own XUSD stablecoin. Balancer suffered a $128 million exploit but managed to recover $19 million. Elixir announced on X that it has already processed redemptions for 80% of all deUSD holders, which led the token to depeg to around $0.015, according to CoinGecko data. The move comes after Stream Finance froze withdrawals on Tuesday , revealing a major hit to its balance sheet and $285 million in debt, including $68 million owed to Elixir. Stream’s XUSD Crashes 90% as deUSD Exposure Triggers Stablecoin Contagion Stream had borrowed deUSD to back its own Staked Stream USD (XUSD) stablecoin, which plunged to $0.10 following the disclosure. Elixir’s deUSD, launched in July 2024, was seen as a challenger to Ethena’s USDe, with a market cap of about $150 million before the crash. Elixir said Stream holds around 90% of deUSD’s remaining supply, worth roughly $75 million, but has refused to repay or close its positions. The company is now coordinating with other DeFi protocols like Euler, Morpho, and Compound to fully compensate affected holders. “We still believe this will be honored 1 for 1,” Elixir stated, adding that it disabled withdrawals to prevent Stream from liquidating deUSD before settling its debt. Elixir has worked tirelessly over the previous 48 hours and has successfully processed redemptions of 80% of all deUSD holders thus far (not including Stream). As it stands now, Stream holds roughly 90% of the deUSD supply (~$75m), while Elixir holds a similar proportion of its… — Elixir (@elixir) November 6, 2025 Notably, on-chain analysts described the drop in XUSD as a crisis of confidence rather than a technical failure, noting that most of the trading originated from Arbitrum and that no smart contract exploit had been identified. Social media discussions intensified concerns about the project’s reserves, with some users alleging a $170 million asset base against $530 million in loans, suggesting heavy leverage. Stream, founded in early 2024, grew rapidly on a promise of capital-efficient DeFi strategies that blended traditional market tactics like hedged market making and yield farming. However, its dependence on external fund managers, meant to handle overflow beyond internal capacity, has now become the focus of scrutiny, raising questions about transparency and counterparty risk in its model. Balancer Suffers $128M Exploit, Recovers $19M Amid On-Chain Chase As reported, DeFi protocol Balancer suffered a massive breach on Monday targeting its V2 Composable Stable Pools, with estimated losses exceeding $128 million across multiple chains, according to PeckShieldAlert. The attacker exploited authorization and callback flaws to drain funds from interconnected pools in a matter of minutes. Analysts at Nansen and Cyvers Alerts tracked suspicious transfers of WETH, osETH, and wstETH, later identifying laundering activity through Tornado Cash. In a rare positive twist, on-chain analyst EmberCN reported that StakeWise successfully recovered 5,041 osETH (worth $19.3 million) via a contract call, reducing total stolen assets to around $98 million. Over half of the stolen funds have since been swapped to Ethereum, intensifying efforts to trace them. Balancer confirmed the issue was limited to V2 pools, assuring users that V3 and other pools remain unaffected. Meanwhile, one dormant whale withdrew $6.5 million following the hack, underscoring shaken investor confidence.

Binance CEO Richard Teng has issued an urgent warning about the alarming rise in WhatsApp impersonation scams targeting cryptocurrency users worldwide. These sophisticated phishing attempts are becoming increasingly common, putting unsuspecting investors at risk of significant financial losses. What Are These WhatsApp Impersonation Scams? WhatsApp impersonation scams involve fraudsters posing as legitimate cryptocurrency exchanges or their representatives. They create fake groups or send direct messages claiming to offer exclusive investment opportunities. However, Richard Teng has clarified that Binance never sends investment-related messages through group chats or unsolicited direct messages on any platform. These scammers use various tactics to appear genuine. They often use official-looking logos and create convincing profiles. Some even use social engineering techniques to gain your trust before making their move. The ultimate goal is always the same: to steal your cryptocurrency or personal information. How Can You Spot These Dangerous Scams? Recognizing WhatsApp impersonation scams early can save you from financial disaster. Here are the red flags to watch for: Unsolicited investment offers from unknown numbers Requests for private keys or seed phrases Pressure to act quickly on “limited-time opportunities” Links to fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges Promises of guaranteed returns or unrealistic profits Remember that legitimate companies like Binance have strict communication protocols. They will never ask for sensitive information through casual messaging platforms. Why Are WhatsApp Impersonation Scams So Effective? These WhatsApp impersonation scams work because they exploit human psychology and trust. Scammers leverage the platform’s group chat features to create false social proof. When you see multiple people in a group apparently benefiting from an opportunity, it feels more legitimate. Moreover, the personal nature of WhatsApp makes these scams particularly convincing. People tend to let their guard down on messaging platforms they use for personal communication. This makes WhatsApp impersonation scams especially dangerous for both new and experienced crypto users. What Protective Measures Should You Take? Protecting yourself from WhatsApp impersonation scams requires vigilance and knowledge. Always verify the identity of anyone claiming to represent a cryptocurrency exchange. Use official channels to confirm information rather than trusting unsolicited messages. Enable two-factor authentication on all your accounts. Be cautious about sharing your phone number in crypto-related forums or social media. Most importantly, remember that if an investment opportunity seems too good to be true, it probably is. What Should You Do If You Encounter a Scam? If you suspect you’ve encountered WhatsApp impersonation scams, take immediate action. Report the number to WhatsApp and block the contact. Notify the legitimate company being impersonated through their official channels. Warn your contacts about the scam to prevent others from falling victim. Never engage with scammers or try to outsmart them. The safest approach is to cut off communication immediately and report the incident to the appropriate authorities. Frequently Asked Questions How can I verify if a WhatsApp message is really from Binance? Binance never initiates investment conversations through WhatsApp group chats or unsolicited direct messages. Always verify through official Binance communication channels and their verified social media accounts. What information do these scammers typically ask for? Scammers often request private keys, seed phrases, login credentials, or direct cryptocurrency transfers. They may also ask for personal identification information that could be used for identity theft. Are new crypto users more vulnerable to these scams? While new users are often targeted, experienced investors can also fall victim to sophisticated WhatsApp impersonation scams. Everyone should remain vigilant regardless of their experience level. What should I do if I already shared information with a scammer? Immediately secure your accounts by changing passwords and enabling additional security measures. Contact the legitimate exchange’s support team and monitor your accounts for suspicious activity. Can these scams be reported to authorities? Yes, you should report WhatsApp impersonation scams to local law enforcement, financial regulatory authorities, and through official scam reporting platforms in your country. How are scammers getting my phone number? Scammers often obtain numbers from data breaches, public forums, social media profiles, or through phishing attacks on other platforms. Be cautious about where you share your contact information. Help protect the crypto community by sharing this important warning about WhatsApp impersonation scams.

According to the SlowMist security team’s post-incident analysis, the exploit stemmed from a precision loss flaw in the integer fixed-point arithmetic used to calculate scaling factors inside Composable Stable Pools, which are designed for near-parity asset pairs such as USDC/USDT or WETH/stETH. In the latest update, SlowMist confirmed that this flaw caused small but consistent price discrepancies during swaps, especially when attackers used the batch swap function to chain multiple operations within a single transaction. The attackers’ strategy was executed across several steps. SlowMist Postmortem The attacker swapped BPT for liquidity tokens to reduce the pool’s liquidity reserves, preparing for small-amount swaps. They performed swaps between liquidity tokens (osETH → WETH) to prepare for precise control of small-swap precision errors. They executed carefully controlled $osETH → swaps to accumulate precision errors. They swapped between liquidity tokens (WETH → osETH) to restore liquidity. They repeated steps 2-4 to amplify the error continuously. They swapped the liquidity tokens back into BPT to restore the pool balance. The attacker first swapped BPT for liquidity tokens to drain and reduce the pool’s liquidity reserves in a bid to prepare for small-amount swaps. They then conducted swaps between liquidity tokens (osETH → WETH) to set up control over small-swap precision errors. Next, they executed highly controlled osETH → WETH swaps to intentionally build up precision errors. Afterwards, the attacker swapped between liquidity tokens again (WETH → osETH) to restore enough liquidity. After repeating the steps 2-4 in loops to continuously expand the accumulated error, they finally swapped the liquidity tokens back into BPT to return the pool to a balanced state. Through repeatedly leveraging the precision flaw with small-sized swaps, the attacker pushed the system into settling a final “amountOut” that exceeded the true amountIn owed, and allowed them to pocket a massive profit. SlowMist managed to trace the attacker’s operations across addresses and multiple chains. It found initial funds were routed through Tornado Cash, then through intermediate nodes and cross-chain gas.zip usage, before being assembled on Ethereum-based addresses holding thousands of ETH and WETH. Remediation Efforts As part of the remediation efforts, CSPv6 pools across the affected network were paused, CSPv6 factory disabled was disabled, gauges were killed for affected pools, and major LPs safely withdrew, among other steps. The Balancer team coordinated with whitehats as well as cybersecurity partners and various networks to retrieve or freeze portions of the stolen funds. This included 5,041 StakeWise osETH worth about $19 million and 13,495 osGNO, estimated to be around $2 million. To project teams and auditors facing similar scenarios, SlowMist said that the focus should be on enhancing test coverage for extreme cases and boundary conditions. Additionally, the firm urged the projects to pay particular attention to precision handling strategies under low-liquidity conditions.

The company was founded by Daniel Roberts and Will Roberts, two former Macquarie Group bankers who took the firm public in November 2021 during the peak of the pandemic-driven crypto rush. When the Bitcoin market crashed the next year, the company’s shares fell 96%, leaving the brothers with almost nothing as the value of their stock dropped to the floor. Eighteen months ago, Daniel and Will changed direction. They stopped depending on Bitcoin mining and redirected the business to meet demand for AI computing and data centers. That decision changed everything. Shares of IREN, which was originally named Iris Energy, have risen more than 500% this year. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index now lists Daniel, age 41, and Will, age 35, with a combined net worth of $846 million for the first time. Microsoft signs long-term capacity contract The deal with Microsoft runs for five years and makes the tech giant the largest customer of IREN. The agreement gives Microsoft access to 10% of the company’s total computing capacity. That means IREN still has most of its platform available to secure more contracts and raise more revenue. The company owns data centers in Canada and the United States, and those facilities run on renewable energy. Daniel said about completing the agreement, “It’s been a big weekend and it’s fantastic to knock it off. But the reality here is, it’s back into the office, we’ve still got a big job to do.” IREN now operates in the same space as other AI computing providers such as CoreWeave, Nebius Group, and Crusoe. All of these companies once focused on Bitcoin mining and later moved to serving the demand for compute power from AI firms including OpenAI. Guojun He, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the agreement represents a turning point for the company’s identity. He said the brothers are now viewed more as builders of AI infrastructure than founders of a crypto venture. From Bitcoin mining to AI compute infrastructure For Daniel, moving from Bitcoin to AI was not random. He explained that both require huge amounts of physical data center space and steady power. He said the shift followed the same logic that led them to start mining in the first place. In early investor meetings, Daniel said they talked about films like The Matrix, Ready Player One, and Wreck-It Ralph to describe how more of everyday life is moving into digital environments. The message was that the world would need more compute, and demand would not slow down. The brothers grew up in Sydney and studied business at the University of Technology Sydney before working at Macquarie Group. Will was a vice president in the commodities and markets division, where he helped create the bank’s crypto team. Daniel became an executive director at Palisade Investment Partners, working with infrastructure funds. Daniel first got into Bitcoin around 2013, and the company website says he “bought high and sold low.” That experience, combined with the brothers’ background in financing and building infrastructure, led them to launch the company in 2018. “Bitcoin was a great way to monetize the compute and the data center platform,” Daniel said. “We did that for a number of years and like we always said, as soon as higher and better value use cases come along, we swapped it out.” Today, IREN has become part of the expanding AI computing race. The brothers’ strategy now centers on securing long-term clients and scaling the infrastructure platform. IREN remains positioned to negotiate additional contracts. For now, Microsoft remains the largest buyer. Meanwhile, the company’s operations stay anchored in Canada and the United States, with continued use of renewable energy to power every facility. The reshaped business keeps the structure that began in mining, but now applies it to AI. Daniel and Will share management of IREN and continue reviewing decisions together. Daniel said, “We challenge each other, we analyze things to the nth degree, and we’re not afraid to say that if we’re wrong, we’re wrong. Let’s change what we’re doing.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",Business|Bitcoin|BTC|iren|Microsoft,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-07 07:13:37

Key Takeaways: South Korea is weighing a review of its sanctions policy after the US linked North Korea’s crypto theft operations to weapons funding. The US Treasury targeted eight North Koreans and two entities, including KMCTC and Ryujong Credit Bank, for laundering stolen crypto. Pyongyang’s cyber tactics remain a major source of illicit financing for its weapons programs. In an interview with Yonhap News TV on Thursday , Second Vice Foreign Minister Kim Ji-na said Seoul could “review sanctions as a measure if they are really needed,” stressing close coordination with Washington to counter North Korea’s growing cyber and digital threats. “In cases of cryptocurrency theft by Pyongyang, coordination between South Korea and the US is important, as it can be used to fund North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs and pose a threat to our digital ecosystem,” Kim stated. US Targets North Korean Crypto Laundering Network Tied to Weapons Funding Her comments followed the US Treasury Department’s latest sanctions against eight North Korean nationals and two entities accused of laundering stolen cryptocurrency. Among them were the Korea Mangyongdae Computer Technology Company (KMCTC) and Ryujong Credit Bank, both alleged to have funneled illicit digital funds to finance weapons development. Treasury officials identified KMCTC president U Yong Su, as well as Jang Kuk Chol and Ho Jong Son, as central figures in laundering operations tied to ransomware and fraud schemes. The measures target DPRK-linked operatives in China and Russia who allegedly managed front companies and accounts used to repatriate proceeds from North Korean IT workers abroad. According to Ryan Yoon, senior analyst at Tiger Research, the move marks a continuation of sanctions that began after North Korea’s 2016 nuclear test. KIM JONG UN’S CRYPTO CRUSADE JUST BLEW UP HIS COVER Washington just hit Pyongyang with a fresh wave of sanctions – this time over crypto-fueled nuke money. Turns out North Korea’s been laundering billions through digital heists to bankroll its weapons program. Kim’s regime… https://t.co/UNoSx65c43 pic.twitter.com/prOWKy2R2o — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) November 6, 2025 “Since then, small-scale sanctions have continued to be imposed,” Yoon said, adding that while further actions are likely, their economic impact may remain limited. “This has been happening for decades,” he noted. The renewed scrutiny underscores Seoul’s intent to align with Washington on countering North Korea’s cyber operations, which remain a persistent source of illicit funding for its weapons ambitions. North Korea Linked to Major Crypto Hacks North Korea has also been linked to several other major crypto heists, including those targeting Bybit , the Ronin Bridge , Harmony, and various DeFi platforms. Global law enforcement is responding. The US Department of Justice recently moved to seize over $7.7 million in digital assets tied to North Korean IT workers embedded in blockchain firms. Meanwhile, the US and South Korea signed a bilateral agreement in 2023 to enhance their technical capabilities in detecting and countering DPRK cyber operations. North Korean cyber strategies continue to evolve. In April, Lazarus-linked operatives reportedly set up US-based shell companies to distribute malware to crypto developers. Kraken recently thwarted an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean posing as a job candidate.

Here's the Latest Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etf-outflows-end-heres-the-latest-data/,"Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded net inflows of $240 million, ending a six-day straight outflow trend, according to SoSoValue data. Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs Re-Entry Wave: $240 Million Net Inflow The bulk of the inflows came from the market's two largest fund providers. BlackRock's IBIT ETF saw net inflows of $112 million in a single day, while Fidelity's FBTC fund saw net inflows of $61.6 million. This recovery suggests investors are strengthening their long-term positions despite market volatility. According to recent data, the total assets under management (AUM) of Bitcoin ETFs has reached $135.4 billion, representing 6.73% of Bitcoin's total market capitalization. Experts say this increase, coupled with expectations of a US interest rate cut, has brought renewed confidence to the crypto markets. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs also ended a six-day outflow streak. The funds recorded net inflows of $12.51 million on November 6, indicating renewed investor interest. BlackRock's ETHA ETF and Fidelity's FETH ETF led the way with inflows of $8 million and $4.94 million, respectively. Grayscale's ETHE fund, on the other hand, saw outflows of $3.52 million on the same day. According to the latest data, the total asset value of Ethereum ETFs is $21.75 billion, which corresponds to 5.45% of the total market capitalization of ETH. *This is not investment advice.

The earnings report showed a sharp miss on both earnings per share and revenue, disappointing investors who had been expecting a much stronger performance by the Jack Dorsey-led company. Block’s adjusted EPS came in at $0.54, which far below the analyst consensus of $0.63, a 14% miss, while revenue came in at $6.11 billion, also far below the $6.33 billion predicted by LSEG analysts. The weaker results overshadowed what was otherwise solid operational growth across Block’s key ecosystems Cash App and Square, with gross profit on both increasing 18% year over year to $2.66 billion. Within that, Cash App produced $1.62 billion, up 24%, while Square contributed $1.02 billion, up 9%. Square’s Gross Payment Volume (GPV) also surged by 12%, and Cash App recorded 58 million monthly active users as of September. Jack said, “We had another strong quarter delivering for our customers with high quality and high velocity. Square GPV growth accelerated to 12%, and we gained profitable market share through product innovation and expanded distribution.” Block raises guidance after weak quarterly results Despite missing expectations, Block raised its 2025 full-year guidance, forecasting $10.24 billion in gross profit, which is over 15% year-over-year growth, and $2.06 billion in adjusted operating income at a 20% margin. For the Q4, Block expects gross profit of $2.76 billion, which is a 19% surge from last year. The earnings report also said that Block’s Proto ecosystem generated revenue for the first time last quarter, describing it as a potential “next major ecosystem” for Block, expanding beyond its established platforms. Alongside that, the company continues to embed AI across both Cash App and Square, with AI voice ordering and AI-powered procurement tools designed to help sellers operate faster and more efficiently. Jack shared Block’s long-term AI plans in a letter to shareholders, writing that:- “Our vertically integrated platform allows us to move quickly, and it gives us unique advantages in launching AI tools for sellers. Our engineering team has been on the frontier of AI for years, building internal tools like codename goose to ship features faster, reinvent interfaces, and pioneer new underwriting methods for credit products.” Jack also said that Square AI now helps sellers explore data and uncover insights, adding that soon it will proactively suggest actions to improve growth or efficiency, and execute them with a single tap. Capital allocation and financial outlook heading into 2026 By the end of September, Block had repurchased about $1.5 billion worth of stock, and the company said it plans to continue returning capital as it generates cash and will discuss its capital allocation strategy at the upcoming Investor Day, according to the earnings report. Looking ahead, Block projects fourth-quarter 2025 adjusted operating income of $560 million, an improvement on last year, alongside an expansion of operating margins to 20%. The company expects to be approaching the “rule of 40” as it heads into 2026, balancing growth and profitability. For the full year, gross profit is expected to reach $10.243 billion, reflecting more than 15% annual growth, while adjusted operating income should climb nearly 28%, despite increased spending on marketing and its Borrow and other lending products. Block also revealed new tax and expense guidance, projecting its 2025 and long-term tax rate to remain in the mid-20% range, consistent with earlier quarters, and net interest expense of around $45 million for Q4 due to higher benchmark rates and new debt issuance. The company said those figures are good representations of its long-term expectations across both financial lines.

It is recording a trade volume of $500 million with a market cap of $21 billion, but the RSI is at 39. Some hope is still left for it to correct if the support level at or around $0.60 is maintained with the upcoming Ouroboros Phalanx upgrade. While all others seem to be left behind, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) takes the lead at its current price of $0.035 to emerge as the top cryptocurrency to buy now to ensure sound profits. This defi cryptocurrency makes bold contrasts to lure investments away from dying altcoins. Cardano Latches On To Sell Pressure Traders observed Cardano going through a gradual fall during the previous week with selling pressure outpacing bids to drive it below critical levels. Substantial volumes did not trigger any buying pressure to sustain a rally. This leaves the bulls battling merely to support the price at $0.60. It appears unlikely for Cardano to recover anytime soon as maintaining a lowly RSI position at 39 indicates worse selling pressure to come. On the bright side, the Ouroboros Phalanx upgrade is imminent to bring improved scalability to the network. Even then, it rarely excites buying pressure in the market. Mutuum Finance Gathers Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going through the phases of its presale with measured intent and is currently at Phase 6 with 85% filled at a rate of $0.035 per token. Cumulatively since launch, the amount of funds garnered is at $18,450,000, and the total number of wallets is 17,790. This crypto to buy now provides a price appreciation target of 250% above Phase 1’s price of entry at $0.01. Launching at a price of $0.06 can generate 414% ROIs. Phase 6 is quickly approaching the stage of exhaustion. Others will soon be left to watch in disbelief as the distribution runs out. Current purchasers can acquire their tokens at this incomparable price, or they will have to pay 20% more during Phase 7 to buy at $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) breeds excitement every day with a new leaderboard on their dashboard that highlights the top 50 token holders. This leaderboard is refreshed every 24 hours at 00:00 UTC. The top leaderboard contributor receives a reward of 500 free MUTM tokens as soon as they participate in one trade. This not only gamifies participation in the project but ensures increased community ties. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensures a versatile loan framework is developed by harmonious liquid alternatives. Clients lock their funds in Peer-to-Contract pools with ETH or even USDT collateral. This generates interests as auto-loans are made. Peer-to-Peer interfaces follow with customized loans for specialized tokens. This makes it open to everyone. Stakeholders obtain mtTokens to confirm their stakes. These can be redeemed with extra interests attached. This is one of the top cryptos to buy because it sees users take congruent actions with organic growth. To celebrate the pace of the presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a giveaway of $100,000 in tokens of the MUTM token to 10 people at a price of $10,000 per individual. This increases the excitement of the Presale events. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also ensures credibility with a tough CertiK audit session with a score of 90 out of 100 on security. A similar bug bounty program with a prize money of $50,000 encourages top developers to test the platform for vulnerabilities with rewards of up to $2,000 per critical submission. This ensures a reliable model to attract risk-averse investors in the DeFi world of crypto. Shifting Tides Favor Emerging Strengths Compared to Cardano’s struggles, the future advancement of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in full motion. It is always important to note that the greatest crypto to buy at the current market is one that relies on execution. This defi crypto provides exactly that. To be part of the upward trajectory, secure your position during the presale.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-youll-regret-not-investing-in-xrp-heres-why/,"XRP advocate and market commentator Oscar Ramos has stated that investors who fail to make significant investments in XRP could later view it as one of their biggest financial regrets . His comments come amid a period of declining sentiment in the broader cryptocurrency market, where XRP has faced notable volatility. After briefly recovering to $2.55 on November 2, XRP’s price fell sharply by over 13% within two days, touching a low of $2.20 before a mild rebound on November 5. Despite this downturn, Ramos maintains a confident outlook, urging investors to adopt a long-term perspective on the asset’s potential. Missing Out Could Be a Lifelong Regret According to Ramos, XRP’s current market behavior should not deter investors from committing heavily to the token. He emphasized that avoiding a large position in XRP could prove to be a lasting mistake, given the token’s perceived long-term potential and the broader expectations of institutional adoption. NOT Going ALL IN on $XRP is a mistake you will REGRET for the rest of your life. — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) November 5, 2025 This viewpoint echoes a familiar pattern in the cryptocurrency industry, where early adopters of major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) realized exponential gains over time. For instance, a $10,000 investment in Bitcoin ten years ago, when the asset was valued at around $311, would now exceed $3.3 million, even after the most recent correction. Similarly, a $10,000 investment in XRP at its 2014 price of $0.00558 would today be valued at approximately $3.98 million. These historical comparisons, Ramos argues, highlight the tendency of investors to underestimate early opportunities, only to look back with regret when prices surge years later. Community Views on the Current Market Ramos’ position has fueled conversations within the XRP community, particularly as market volatility continues to unsettle investors. Many analysts have also described the current price decline as a possible accumulation phase rather than a long-term downturn. For instance, Coach JV, another market analyst, recently suggested that encountering XRP under $3 should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a cause for concern. Likewise, crypto strategist Income Sharks noted that investors who previously missed out on XRP below $2 may soon get another chance to buy at those levels. However, while these views are gaining attention among XRP enthusiasts, industry experts have cautioned that such perspectives should not be interpreted as investment advice. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Diverse Reactions from Investors Ramos’ recent statements have drawn mixed reactions. Some community members have expressed strong support, reaffirming their belief in XRP’s long-term utility and future price appreciation. One investor identified as Blueman said he remains invested in XRP but has diversified his portfolio to include other assets. Others have shared less optimistic reflections. Several long-term holders admitted that while they once believed XRP would outperform the broader market, prolonged stagnation has tested their confidence. The only segment of XRP investors currently seeing sustained losses is those who purchased near the 2018 market peak. Most earlier investors still retain substantial unrealized gains despite recent price fluctuations. Ramos and other XRP supporters maintain that the token remains undervalued relative to its potential use cases in global settlements and cross-border transactions. While opinions differ on the timeline for major growth, his argument reinforces a familiar theme in cryptocurrency investing, that hesitation during accumulation periods can often define whether investors later celebrate or regret their decisions.

The regulator on Friday said that it would provide support as the first project under the Payment Innovation Project (PIP). PIP is a newly established initiative by the regulator to promote innovation in the payment field. The FSA expressed clarity on the stablecoin pilot presentation, adding that the service is expected to “improve user convenience and corporate productivity in Japan.” Three Major Banks Develop Shared Framework for Stablecoin Issuance Three of Japan’s largest banks – Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, and Mizuho Financial Group, are working on a joint project to issue yen-backed stablecoins for Japanese users. Cryptonews reported last month that the lenders would promote settlements made with pegged cryptocurrencies. The move aims to challenge the dominance of dollar-backed USDT and USDC stablecoins. “The banks will build a structure for corporate clients to allow for stablecoins to be transferred between them along uniform standards, initially issuing a yen-pegged coin and potentially a dollar-pegged coin in the future,” Nikkei reported . However, there has been no official joint statement from the banks involved. In addition to the three major banks, Mitsubishi Corporation will serve as a business company, while Progmat will provide the issuance infrastructure. Besides, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation is expected to handle trust functions. The experiment is expected to start “from November 2025 for the foreseeable future.” Full-scale efforts will begin toward practical application within this fiscal year. The FSA said that the initiative “must be recognized as an innovative” effort. Japan Ramps Up Stablecoin Launch Last week, Japanese crypto exchanges and blockchain firms announced its intention to start “self-regulating” stablecoins. The body, named Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA), has been formalized by the FSA. Meanwhile, Japan launched its first yen-backed stablecoin last month, dubbed JPYC.

The exchange has secured major partnerships with Ondo Finance and xStocks to bring tokenized US equities like Tesla to crypto users. LBank Labs has $100M+ in assets under management (AUM), backing early-stage AI, DeFi, and RWA projects that offer long-term potential. Czhang says the exchanges that survive will be the ones that balance trust, compliance, and innovation. LBank’s Partner and Head of LBank Labs, Czhang, has spent nearly a decade proving that consistency beats hype. Under his leadership, the exchange has maintained a perfect security record while scaling globally across both retail and institutional markets. Since its launch, LBank has grown into one of the most trusted names in global trading. The exchange has operated without a single security breach for a full decade. In 2024 alone, LBank prevented more than $1.2B in potential security threats. LBank serves more than 20M registered users, and records over $10.5B in daily volume. Managing over $100M in assets through LBank Labs, Czhang puts all his focus on projects that offer long-term value and sustainability. In an exclusive interview, he detailed how the future of crypto exchanges balances on trust, compliance, and their ability to innovate alongside the market shifts. As Czhang puts it, the exchanges that survive are the ones that ‘can protect their foundation while exploring new possibilities, providing real value to users.’ As AI transforms trading and real-world assets move on-chain, LBank’s steady approach offers a glimpse of what sustainable growth in crypto looks like. The Logic of Long-Term Crypto Investing Czhang’s entry into crypto in 2017 marked a clean move away from traditional finance. He was drawn in by the structure, the idea that blockchain could become the new financial architecture. After leading investments in more than 100 Web3 projects, he learned that success rarely depends on the technology alone. Teams must be able to adapt quickly and execute to outlast those with a weaker focus. He puts it: ‘Many times, even a project with cutting-edge technology and an attractive concept can fail if the team lacks the ability to respond quickly to changes, isn’t cohesive, or cannot navigate regulatory and market shifts effectively.’ That belief has shaped how LBank Labs deploys its $100M fund today. The team backs founders who can build through bear markets and turn their ideas into sustainable ecosystems. As he likes to remind new founders, quoting Sun Tzu, there’s ‘opportunity in chaos.’ Security as a Culture: LBank’s Zero-Incident Record Security has become a defining feature of LBank. In an industry tarnished by hacks and exploits, the exchange has thrived for 10 years without a single breach. A record possible due to proactive defense and constant improvement. AI-driven monitoring helps to detect irregular activity in real time, while multi-layered protection covers everything from custody systems to user interfaces. LBank’s partnerships with CertiK Skynet and Elliptic have added automated audits, live risk detection, Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and Know Your Transaction (KYT) screening for added compliance. In 2024 alone, these systems helped prevent more than $1.2B in potential losses. With transparency and risk control embedded into its culture, LBank has managed to turn security from an operational cost into a lasting trust advantage over its competitors. Tokenized Stocks & Global Access Thanks to major partnerships with Ondo Finance and xStocks , LBank has brought traditional markets to Web3, offering users tokenized US equities on-chain. You can now buy fractional shares of companies like Tesla or Strategy directly on the LBank platform. This 24/7 accessibility overcomes the geographic and regulatory hurdles many users face. To help showcase the product, LBank has launched a $120K Tokenized Stock Contract Competition. This gives users a hands-on way to experience the new product while earning a share of rewards based on trading volume. Inside LBank’s AI Push: From Smarter Trading to Safer Markets LBank has long been closely following the AI sector. During the recent surge of the X402 trend, LBank has premiere listed several AI-related tokens, many of which achieved impressive growth. Notably, PAYAI soared by 875%, while PING reached a remarkable 989% increase. The exchange was one of the first to list top AI-related assets like $GOAT and $VIRTUAL in 2024, followed by $X402, $PAYAI, and $SORA in 2025. Behind the scenes, LBank is using AI to analyze on-chain activity, order books, and even social sentiment to predict market shifts and optimize its liquidity. Czhang explains: ‘By predicting price fluctuations and identifying abnormal trading behaviors, AI can alert potential risks in advance, helping users and the platform avoid unnecessary losses.’ How LBank Labs Competes With Traditional VCs While most VCs bring a lot of funding but little market experience, LBank Labs’ strength lies in being able to pick out the right early-stage Web3 investments. With over $100M in assets under management, the fund focuses on early-stage DeFi, Real World Assets (RWAs), AI, and even meme coin communities that show they have long-term cultural traction. Through its ‘invest + incubate’ model, LBank Labs works closely with founders to help develop marketing strategies and PR support, alongside the capital and exchange listings. Projects featured on its LBank Edge discovery platform have achieved an average ROI of 864.95%. This includes popular tokens like $FARTCOIN and $USELESS. Outlook: The Exchange of the Future Czhang firmly believes the next generation of exchanges, or those who will still be around, are those that focus on trust, compliance, and innovation. Without user trust, no amount of liquidity or branding can sustain a platform. Compliance, often seen as a burden, is now the foundation of global expansion. And innovation, well, without it, you can quickly become irrelevant in such a fast-paced industry. As AI, tokenization, and security become pivotal to the company, LBank continues to refine its model around trust, transparency, and long-term value. It’s a vision that keeps the exchange firmly ahead of the curve. This article does not constitute financial advice.

The initiative suggests that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might approve another spot DOGE ETF soon. Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg Intelligence revealed that the fund may start trading within the next 20 days. Bitwise’s recent filing comes as it has already successfully launched its staking Solana ETF, which has attracted over $500 million in assets. Bitwise’s DOGE ETF awaits SEC decision in 20 days Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention. pic.twitter.com/y8jyxbYKXQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 6, 2025 The SEC had put a hold on its decision on the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF application in June, less than a month after delaying the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust application. According to Bitwise’s S-1 and 19b-4 forms submitted to the regulator to create the DOGE fund, the fund will hold DOGE as its primary asset and leverage the CF Dogecoin-Dollar Settlement Price to determine the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV). The traditional ETF approval procedure typically involves extensive review periods by regulators and may even result in potential delays. However, Bitwise’s DOGE spot fund application bypasses much of that bureaucracy. Bitwise’s decision to utilize the SEC’s 8(a) procedure for their Dogecoin spot ETF application removes the delaying amendment from the S-1 application. The non-standard listing will also automatically become effective after 20 days unless the SEC takes separate action to delay it. “Looks like Bitwise is doing the 8(a) move for their spot Dogecoin ETF, which basically means they plan on going effective in 20 days barring an intervention.” – Eric Balchunas , Senior Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Bitwise’s filing comes as the U.S. is on the verge of its longest government shutdown in history. The shutdown has left the SEC operating under its own shutdown plan, which has significantly limited what staff can work on, as many are furloughed. Following the October 1 government shutdown, the regulator approved a flurry of listing standards, paving the way for dozens of crypto ETF applications to be processed quickly. The SEC also issued guidance a week after the shutdown, which clarified the processes for firms seeking to go public. The agency revealed that firms wanting to go public can file an S-1 registration statement without what’s called a delaying amendment. The delaying amendment allows ETFs to launch after 20 days, and also gives the SEC time to work through comments. Any changes made to filings may restart the clock for ETFs to take effect in 20 days. Once an ETF’s asset meets listing standards, the firm can potentially launch its crypto ETFs without the SEC’s sign-off. REX-Osprey establishes the first spot Dogecoin ETF The Bitwise DOGE fund will be the second ETF tracking the memecoin in the sector. The REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF (DOJE) also launched recently. DOJE was established under the Investment Company Act of 1933 and saw a rise in its daily volume and inflows. However, the ETF’s robust flows have reduced, moving from over $35 million to $27 million today. REX-Osprey Dogecoin ETF is the first U.S. spot ETF for DOGE, launched on September 18. The launch saw traders pile in, sending volumes soaring and surpassing $24 million in trading volume within the first few hours after launch. Balchunas acknowledged that the fund’s launch was far more than he had thought. He revealed that the surge was five times greater than any of the XRP futures ETFs achieved on day one, and DOJE accomplished it in only 90 minutes. The ETF analyst also noted that the REX-Osprey’s DOGE fund blew past expectations, surpassing his initial over/under benchmark of $2.5 million for opening-day volume. He called that target respectable and nothing too special, but DOJE crossed $6 million within the first hour. At the time of publication, DOGE is currently exchanging hands around $0.1660, up more than 1.7% in the last 24 hours. On-chain data also revealed that Dogecoin has dropped 3.75% in the last 7 days and nearly 20% in the last 30 days. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Why the Bitcoin Hyper Presale Is Pumping Right Now,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-rally-ride-the-hype-with-bitcoin-hyper/,"What to Know: $XRP shows signs of potential recovery after a recent 10.26% decline. A breakout above the $2.35 resistance level could trigger a surge toward $2.54–$2.80. If the price dips below the critical $2.27 support, a deeper pullback to $2.13 could unfold. As $XRP positions itself for recovery, traders are setting their sights on new opportunities like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). $HYPER tokens offer 45% staking rewards and a promising price forecast, with a potential high of $0.253 by 2030. All eyes are on $XRP at the moment as it experiences a price correction. While one of the market’s top cryptocurrencies has seen its value dip 10.26% over the past week, it remains a powerful contender in the altcoin space. But what does $XRP’s current movement mean for investors, and what could it signal for the future? Amidst XRP’s recent decline, there’s growing excitement about projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which is making waves in the crypto presale space. As XRP looks to recover, new opportunities in the market are presenting themselves, with Bitcoin Hyper offering a promising alternative to those looking for faster and more scalable solutions on the Bitcoin network. Let’s take a deeper dive into what might be ahead for both $XRP and the new kid on the block. $XRP: In a Dip But Poised for a Bounce-Back $XRP, currently priced at $2.22, has been facing downward pressure in the market, with its price declining 10.26% over the past week. Despite this, its market cap remains a whopping $133.75B, and the token’s liquidity continues to showcase its resilience. In addition, its NVT ratio is on a steady decline, which suggests that $XRP isn’t overbought, making it less vulnerable to further sharp declines. This puts it at an ideal position for recovery. Its STH-NUPL indicator also supports this potential for recovery, as each dip here has historically led to a bounce-back for $XRP. Looking at the price action, a breakout above the $2.35 resistance level could trigger a surge toward $2.54–$2.80. However, should the price dip below the critical $2.27 support, a deeper pullback to $2.13 could unfold, suggesting further caution. For those watching XRP’s next move, these technical indicators point toward a likely stabilization phase that could pave the way for a strong bullish reversal. This makes it an interesting time for investors keeping an eye on this altcoin’s potential. For investors looking to capitalize on potential altcoin movements, projects like Bitcoin Hyper offer a refreshing alternative that could complement a broader portfolio.

Jason said: “Simply going and spending five minutes looking at the products, you’ll see what I mean. It’s night and day. The amount of markets, even the pricing, isn’t something that I would view as competitive with what we do.” Jason explained that users who want to wager on sports outcomes still prefer the sportsbook format because that is where the volume, variety, and familiarity are. The DraftKings CEO pointed to the existing situation in the U.K. and Western Europe to support this point, saying that exchange-based betting only takes low to mid single-digit share where it is available alongside traditional books. Jason said this shows that there is no large migration away from sportsbooks, and that sports-betting is tied to how fans watch and follow live competition, and prediction markets handle broader non-sports events like elections, awards, and other outcomes. DraftKings enters prediction markets while defending sportsbook focus Even though Jason insisted sportsbooks are not threatened, DraftKings is still entering the prediction space. The company acquired RailBird last month, and it plans to release a mobile app that lets users place bets on outcomes in areas such as entertainment and finance. Jason told Jim this move is mainly strategic for states where online sports-betting is still illegal, including California and Texas. He said this allows the company to be active in those large markets while gaming laws continue to develop. Jason said, “I think the reality is that at least for the near term, it looks like the momentum is here. They’re here to stay. And so, I think with that in mind, we need to participate, and we should have the tools to win.” DraftKings also reported quarterly earnings Thursday after the market closed but lowered its full-year sales outlook, causing its stock to plunge by more than 5% in after-hours trading. In the last quarter, DraftKings saw $1,144 million in revenue ($49 million higher than a year ago), while revenue surged by 4%, supported by “strong customer engagement, efficient new customer acquisition, and a higher sportsbook hold rate,” which grew 17% year-over-year, said DraftKings. Jason said , “This is the most bullish I have ever felt about our future.” He noted that the company expects to launch DraftKings Predictions in the coming months, which he described as an incremental opportunity. The company’s CFO, Alan Ellingson, said the growth in handle and the increase in parlay activity are improving free cash flow. Alan also announced that DraftKings’ share repurchase program was expanded from $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. DraftKings’ monthly Unique Payers increased 2% to 3.6 million, supported by strong retention and new sign-ups. Without Jackpocket, growth would have been 6%. Average Revenue per MUP reached $106, up by 3% from the year before. DraftKings raised its 2025 revenue guidance to $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion, which is a 28% growth over 2024, according to the earnings report. DraftKings’ adjusted EBITDA guidance now stands between $450 million and $550 million.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $968. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and reach $1,000. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $935. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $968, as bulls target $991. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.55 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-07 07:57:48

The amendment, dated November 4, 2025, includes one key regulatory difference from earlier versions that would likely affect the approval process for the XRP ETF. What’s Different About Franklin Templeton’s New XRP ETF Filing ETF analyst James Seyffart shared the update on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the removal of the 8(a) delay clause, which typically gives the SEC control over when a filing becomes effective. Usually, when an issuing firm files for an ETF, it includes what’s called a “delaying amendment.” This clause grants the SEC the authority to determine the exact time the filing takes effect. Franklin Templeton employed that standard wording in its earlier filings, including the initial submission on March 11, 2025, and a subsequent amendment on August 22, 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Profit Just Crashed To A New 2025 Low – What This Means For Price The latest filing, however, shortens that delaying condition. Instead, it states that the registration “shall hereafter become effective in accordance with the provisions of section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.” Under this rule, the Franklin spot XRP ETF registration automatically becomes effective 20 days after filing, unless the SEC intervenes. The Franklin XRP Trust will primarily hold XRP as its primary asset and track the token’s market price, with Coinbase Custody managing asset storage and BNY Mellon overseeing cash holdings. The trust seeks a listing on the Cboe BZX Exchange, adopting a structure similar to other recently approved crypto ETFs. A Growing Trend Of Fast-Tracked Crypto ETF Filings Franklin Templeton’s update isn’t happening in isolation. Other asset managers, including Bitwise and Canary Funds, have also made similar changes to their S-1 filings for XRP ETFs in recent weeks, cutting back on the delay wording that typically allows the SEC to set the launch timeline. The growing series of S-1 changes demonstrates how these ETF issuers are reclaiming control over the timing of XRP ETF approvals. Journalist Eleanor Terrett highlighted this trend on X, noting that it has become more common since the US government shutdown in October. During that period, the SEC’s review process slowed, prompting many asset managers to use the timing rule to expedite their filings. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights Major Move For XRP And RLUSD, Will Price Follow? The issuing companies may also be using the same “fast-track” rule that helped other spot crypto ETFs such as Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) launch last month. By shortening the delay provision, Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF now follows the same accelerated path and may receive approval before the end of November. While the SEC can still intervene, this change indicates that XRP ETF issuers are gaining more control over approval timing by adopting faster pathways, signaling that this time, things could indeed be different.

ASIC Chairman: “Australia Will Be Left Behind If It Doesn't Rapidly Adapt to Tokenization” Longo emphasized that distributed ledger technology (DLT) is transforming capital markets worldwide, and tokenization, which separates assets into smaller, tradable units that enable instantaneous exchange, could trigger a structural revolution in capital markets, he said. However, Longo cautioned that other countries are rapidly advancing: “Switzerland’s digital securities exchange has issued over $3.1 billion in tokenized bonds since 2021. JP Morgan plans to fully tokenize its money market funds within the next two years. Nasdaq aims to launch 24-hour tokenized securities trading by 2026.” In response to these developments, Longo announced that ASIC will relaunch its Innovation Hub initiative. This hub will support financial innovation and provide guidance to entrepreneurs facing regulatory hurdles. ASIC also recently updated its guidance on digital assets, classifying stablecoins, wrapped tokens, and tokenized securities as financial products requiring a license. Companies have until June 2026 to comply. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Australian Securities Commission Chairman Issues Tokenization Warning!

The funding round included participation from Citadel Securities, Fortress Investment Group, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital. According to Arthur, investors did not purchase XRP tokens but rather acquired equity in Ripple. BREAKING — Wall Street just bet on Ripple. Citadel Securities. Fortress. Pantera.

Ripple isn’t knocking on Wall Street’s… pic.twitter.com/IKvr5i1IXt — Arthur (@XrpArthur) November 5, 2025 Ripple’s $500 Million Round Ripple’s new $500 million funding round marks one of the most significant private investments in the company’s history. The round reportedly values Ripple at $40 billion, with participation from Citadel Securities, Fortress Investment Group, Pantera Capital, and Galaxy Digital . These names represent some of the largest and most influential players in traditional and digital finance. The deal signals confidence in Ripple’s business model and its growing role in blockchain-based payments and settlement infrastructure. The deal involves investment in Ripple itself rather than buying XRP . This distinction is critical, as it demonstrates that institutional investors view Ripple’s technology and enterprise products as valuable assets, and this trust could increase XRP’s adoption in traditional financial circles. Ripple has expanded beyond cross-border payment solutions and now offers liquidity management tools, tokenization services , and works with a USD-backed stablecoin. The fresh capital is expected to strengthen these initiatives and expand Ripple’s global footprint. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What It Means for XRP While the investors did not buy XRP directly, their involvement has implications for the token’s future use. Ripple’s technology continues to rely on the XRP Ledger, which facilitates transactions using XRP as a bridge asset . If Ripple’s enterprise solutions gain wider adoption through new partnerships funded by this investment, XRP’s transaction volumes could rise as a result. That potential creates a direct line between Ripple’s success and XRP’s market value. Arthur later summarized the sentiment of the event by writing that “Ripple isn’t knocking on Wall Street’s door anymore. Wall Street just walked in.” His observation reflects the growing view that institutional validation could boost long-term confidence in XRP, thereby helping the asset’s price grow. The entry of firms such as Citadel Securities and Fortress may also encourage other financial institutions to explore XRP’s utility within Ripple’s ecosystem. This kind of credibility can attract both corporate clients and investors, fostering higher liquidity and potentially driving demand for the asset.

She emphasized that most of these funds could find their way to North Korea’s nuclear programs while threatening the world’s digital economy. The Second Vice Foreign Minister stressed that her country has been making efforts to combat fraudulent activities, and in that context, it is considering sanctions as a measure whenever necessary. Her remarks came after the U.S. imposed fresh sanctions on two North Korean entities and eight individuals suspected of laundering stolen funds, most of it in crypto. However, these sanctions do not appear to faze North Korea’s hackers yet. They are reportedly fast, decentralized, and invisible, making them a difficult target. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John Hurley said North Korean state-backed hackers steal and launder crypto assets to fund the regime’s nuclear programs. Meanwhile, the message from Washington to Pyongyang is clear — it urges the regime to stop treating blockchain like a bomb factory. Kim says South Korea is following the United States’ lead Second Vice Foreign Minister Kim disclosed that her country is awaiting clarification from the U.S. side regarding internal coordination. She added that Washington is currently working on reviewing and adjusting the wording of a joint fact sheet regarding the outcome of last week’s meeting between President Donald Trump and President Lee Jae Myung. The U.S. Treasury Department recently asserted that the North Korean government relies on several illegal activities, including cybercrime, and explicitly tasks its hackers to raise funds using these illicit means. It added that North Korea’s cybercriminals have so far stolen $3 billion, mainly in crypto, using social engineering and advanced malware. “By generating revenue for Pyongyang’s weapons development, these actors directly threaten U.S. and global security. Treasury will continue to pursue the facilitators and enablers behind these schemes to cut off the DPRK’s illicit revenue streams.” – John Hurley , Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence However, the U.S. Treasury Department pointed out that nabbing these North Korean malicious actors has become increasingly complex because they are scattered around the world under hidden identities. They also collaborate with non-North Korean freelancers on projects originally commissioned by the North Korean government, then split the income. The Department further stated that all properties or dealings with sanctioned individuals or entities are blocked and must be reported to OFAC (the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control). Meanwhile, North Korean President Kim Jong Un believes these measures are hostile. Ang says South Korea has considered sanctioning North Korea before Angela Ang, Head of Policy and Strategic Partnerships for Asia Pacific at TRM Labs, stated that this would not be the first time South Korea has considered sanctioning North Korea independently. She added that OFAC sanctions have far-reaching implications, as they cut off access to the global financial system, and South Korea’s sanctions would be seen as a reinforcement of these restrictions. Ryan Yoon, a Senior Analyst at Tiger Research, also acknowledged a high possibility of South Korea imposing more sanctions on North Korea. However, the impact may not be as significant. Yoon pointed out that the escalation between North and South Korea follows North Korea’s nuclear testing in 2016. Large-scale exchanges between the two countries were severed entirely during that time, and small-scale sanctions have continued to be imposed. Cryptopolitan previously reported that representative Lee Yang-soo of the ruling People Power Party has called on South Korea’s financial authorities to closely monitor crypto exchanges in the region. He added that, above all, they should accurately identify the true nature of these illicit actions and devise countermeasures.

The Rise of Private, Fast, and Borderless Gambling",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/11/what-is-a-no-kyc-crypto-casino-the-rise-of-private-fast-and-borderless-gambling,"Online casinos have changed dramatically in recent years. What once required endless verification steps—uploading IDs, utility bills, and waiting days for approval—has evolved into something faster and more private. That evolution is powered by no-KYC crypto casinos. These are platforms that let players deposit, play, and withdraw in cryptocurrency without ever submitting an ID. Your wallet is your identity, and the blockchain is your transaction record. They’re built for a Web3 world that values privacy, self-custody, and global accessibility. No KYC crypto casinos offer a fundamentally different experience from traditional gambling platforms. How No-KYC Crypto Casinos Work The process is simple. Instead of creating an account with personal data, you connect a non-custodial wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet — or sign up with just an email address. You then deposit crypto — typically Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, or another supported token. Transactions confirm in seconds, and your balance updates automatically. From there, you can explore thousands of games, from blackjack and roulette to slots, or crash games. Some platforms like Dexsport.io also provide sports betting options. Withdrawals are just as quick: winnings are sent straight back to your wallet, often within minutes. No verification queues. No document uploads. No gatekeepers. This way, the online gambling is streamlined for the blockchain age. Why Players Are Switching to No-KYC Casinos 1. True Privacy These casinos don’t ask for identification, banking information, or proof of address. That means no personal data leaks and no risk of identity theft. Your only “login” is your wallet connection. 2. Speed and Accessibility Without KYC delays, players can register and start playing in seconds. Withdrawals are equally fast — some complete within a single blockchain confirmation. 3. Global Inclusion Crypto allows anyone with internet access to participate, bypassing fiat restrictions and regional gambling barriers. 4. Financial Control Funds move directly between you and the platform. You control your assets, not a third-party payment processor. Dexsport: A Legitimate No-KYC Crypto Casino While many no-KYC casinos operate in regulatory gray zones, a few stand out for doing things the right way — combining privacy with provable transparency. At the top of that list is Dexsport. Dexsport is a fully decentralized casino and sportsbook hybrid, licensed under the Government of the Autonomous Island of Anjouan and audited by CertiK and Pessimistic, two of the most trusted blockchain security firms. Unlike most gambling platforms, Dexsport doesn’t require registration details at all — you can sign in instantly via your crypto wallet, email, or Telegram. From there, you gain access to more than 10,000 games, including slots, crash, roulette, and live dealer tables, along with an integrated sportsbook covering global events and esports. Every transaction happens on-chain, giving you full transparency into deposits, wagers, and payouts. The platform supports 38 cryptocurrencies across 20 networks, and withdrawals are processed almost instantly — with no KYC barriers or withdrawal limits. What makes Dexsport special is that it proves anonymity doesn’t have to mean insecurity. With its dual blockchain audits, on-chain transaction history, and responsible gaming features, Dexsport stands as the rare example of a no-KYC casino that is both anonymous and accountable. For players who want freedom without fear, Dexsport represents how no-KYC gambling can be done responsibly. What to Keep in Mind Before You Play No-KYC doesn’t mean “no rules.” It just means the rules are different. Most of these casinos operate under lighter offshore licenses. That’s not necessarily bad — but it means you should do your homework. Check for audits, payout transparency, and independent reviews before committing funds. Crypto volatility is another factor: your winnings may rise or fall with the market. Stablecoins can help, but managing your bankroll wisely is still essential. And finally, even if the casino doesn’t enforce KYC, your local laws might. Always make sure online gambling and crypto usage are allowed in your country. Tips for Safe, Private Gambling Start with a small deposit to test withdrawals. Use a dedicated wallet for gambling. Prefer casinos with audits or provably fair systems. Protect your wallet with hardware security or multi-signature setups. Always play responsibly — anonymity should never come at the cost of control. The Bottom Line No-KYC crypto casinos are more than a trend — they’re a sign of where online gambling is headed. Players want privacy, instant access, and full ownership of their funds. Platforms like Dexsport show that you can have all three without compromising on transparency or trust. For privacy-minded players, the future of gambling is blockchain-secured and wallet-connected. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 1. What does “no-KYC” mean in a crypto casino? “No-KYC” means no Know-Your-Customer verification.

Instead, you can create an account or connect your wallet and start playing instantly using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT. 2. Are no-KYC crypto casinos legal? It depends on where you live. Many operate under offshore gaming licenses in jurisdictions such as Curaçao or Anjouan. While they are legal in some regions, others restrict or ban online gambling altogether. Always check your local laws before playing. 3. Are no-KYC casinos safe? They can be — if you choose verified and reputable platforms. Look for casinos that are audited by trusted blockchain security firms or have transparent payout systems.For example, Dexsport stands out as a trusted, audited no-KYC casino licensed in Anjouan and verified by CertiK and Pessimistic, offering both privacy and proven security. 4.

Yes — but choose casinos that combine anonymity with verifiable transparency. Audited platforms like Dexsport prove that anonymity doesn’t have to mean risk. You remain private while still benefiting from on-chain accountability and provably fair gameplay. 7. What are the downsides of no-KYC crypto casinos? The main risks include limited legal protection, potential volatility in crypto value, and fewer safeguards if the platform isn’t reputable. That’s why due diligence is essential — research before depositing. 8. How do I find a trustworthy no-KYC casino? Look for: Valid license from a recognized jurisdiction. Audit certificates (like CertiK). Transparent smart-contract or provably fair systems. User reviews confirming timely payout. Dexsport is often cited as an example of a casino that meets all these standards.

Elixir’s dollar-pegged stablecoin lost 98% of its value and tanked to a low of $0.03 early Friday morning, according to blockchain security firm PeckShield. According to on-chain analysis by Nansen AI, Elixir had allocated roughly 65% of deUSD’s collateral to Stream Finance, which is around two-thirds of the stablecoin’s total backing. The loan to Stream DeFi left Elixir heavily dependent on the asset manager to maintain its dollar peg. deUSD drop was caused by Stream Finance exploit As reported by Cryptopolitan on Monday, Stream Finance admitted that a fund manager overseeing its investments lost approximately $93 million in user assets. The platform has since suspended all withdrawals and deposits while hiring attorneys from Perkins Coie LLP to investigate the loss. “Until we are able to fully assess the scope and causes of the loss, all withdrawals and deposits will be temporarily suspended,” Stream said in its official statement on X last Tuesday. The decision left Elixir unable to access the majority of its backing reserves, although the protocol claimed it retained redemption rights at $1 per token. Stream reportedly informed the company that no payouts could be processed until attorneys determined creditor priority, according to a report by DeFi research collective Yields and More (YAM). Technical flaws on Balancer prove costly to Stream Finance According to security auditing firm Decurity, there was a vulnerability within DeFi protocol Balancer , which is integrated into Stream’s liquidity strategy. PeckShield and Decurity confirmed a bug in Balancer’s internal swap logic, within its batchSwap function, allowed attackers to use a rounding-down flaw and drain funds. A faulty access control mechanism in Balancer’s manageUserBalance function compounded by a logic flaw in the validateUserBalanceOp process failed to verify message senders properly. This allowed unauthorized withdrawals through the UserBalanceOpKind.WITHDRAW_INTERNAL operation, giving attackers a direct route to siphon assets from Balancer’s vaults. The breach caused Staked Stream USD (xUSD), another Stream-linked asset, to depeg and plunge to $0.50 and later to $0.14 within a day, per CoinGecko’s records. Yields and More’s analysis identified nearly $285 million in direct debt exposure on lending protocols Euler, Morpho, Silo, and Gearbox. Creditors most affected include TelosC, Elixir, MEV Capital, and Varlamore, which all maintained significant collateral positions intertwined with Stream’s operations. Stream, which held nearly 90% of the loan positions tied to deUSD, could no longer repay Elixir or unwind collateral positions. This left Elixir facing a severe redemption crisis as users rushed to exit the stablecoin. Blockchain data on Wednesday revealed that Stream’s wallets began dumping large volumes of deUSD on decentralized exchanges. PeckShield traced one wallet, 0xcb4a7b790edb7fa3e2731efd7ed85275f92fc74a, as it sold huge chunks of deUSD against USDT in Curve Finance pools. The sell-off caused deUSD’s price to collapse from $1 to $0.40 first, before it briefly regained its peg back to $0.99. Subsequent liquidations then pushed it further down to $0.03, wiping out nearly all market value. Per the sentiments of zKPass contributor and ETH smart contract developer Param.eth, the Curve-based dumping is a desperate attempt by Stream or associated wallets to liquidate holdings before insolvency proceedings begin. Elixir responds to the community, claims ‘hands are tied’ In response to the 90% depeg in its stablecoin deUSD, Elixir wrote a statement on X late Thursday, insisting it had processed redemptions for around 80% of deUSD holders before the price collapse. The company mentioned it could not do anything further to solve the devaluation because Stream holds approximately 90% of the remaining supply, valued at roughly $75 million. “To protect the interest of these holders (and remove any risk of Stream liquidating deUSD before repaying their loan), a snapshot has been taken of all remaining deUSD and sdeUSD holder balances, and a claim page will go live later today,” the protocol stated . Elixir said it is collaborating with other decentralized lenders like Euler, Morpho, and Compound, to pay out users and restore partial stability to its ecosystem. “We still believe this will be honored 1 for 1,” Elixir wrote, confident that deUSD holders will eventually be compensated in full.

Some analysts are now suggesting that the altcoin’s correction is not yet complete. A Retest Of Key Fibonacci Level On The Horizon Market expert Casi Trades recently shared insights on social media site X (formerly Twitter), indicating that enthusiasm surrounding the recent partnership announcement with Mastercard may have been premature. During the Ripple Swell 2025 event in New York, the company unveiled a new collaboration with Mastercard, WebBank, and crypto exchange Gemini to test its RLUSD stablecoin as a means of settling credit card transactions. Related Reading: Weakness In Major Cryptos: What Key Technical Metrics Indicate For Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana The announcement initially propelled the XRP price toward the $2.41 mark. However, this surge was short-lived, and the price quickly retraced. It maintained its trajectory below the previous Fibonacci Wave 1 low, as seen in the chart below. Casi Trades noted that this price rejection reinforces the belief that the Wave 3 low at $2.05 has not been adequately tested. She anticipates that the XRP price will likely trend downward toward this Fibonacci level to complete the subwave 5 of Wave 3. Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) supports this bearish outlook, indicating a divergence at the recent price high and suggesting a retest of the lower trendline is imminent. XRP Price Poised For An Explosive 2,155% Increase? Despite the current bearish sentiment, some analysts maintain bullish projections for the XRP price. Egrag Crypto recently remarked that the ongoing price formation resembles a range rather than a straightforward ascending wedge or rectangle. Based on measured moves, projections suggest that the altcoin could reach a new all-time high around $10. If this is indeed Macro Wave 2, the anticipated Wave 3 could be 1.618 times the length of Wave 1, potentially placing targets between $14 and $25. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Needs To Reclaim This Key Level To Prevent Drop To $1,700 Moreover, the analyst pointed out the growing speculation that XRP will revisit its $0.77 wick on Binance. However, Egrag countered these discussions, noting that the altcoin could also reach the $50 “wick” observed on the Gemini crypto exchange. While some believe the Binance wick to $0.77 must be filled, Egrag argues that ignoring the potential for XRP to hit $50 is a mistake, especially if market symmetry comes into play. The analyst concluded his thesis by stating that this cycle could see the XRP price reaching that $50 level as the market undergoes its “final blow-off phase.” This would imply a major 2,155% uptrend ahead for the altcoin’s price. When writing, XRP trades at $2.22, still recording gains of 318% year-to-date, according to CoinGecko data.

Ramos connected the potential end of the shutdown to renewed confidence in broader markets, suggesting that reduced political uncertainty could support greater capital flow into digital assets. SHUTDOWN is coming to an END. $XRP Ready to EXPLODE Beyond $200,000,000,000 mc. pic.twitter.com/SF6vnH5EAp — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) November 6, 2025 Reference to the Letter from Democratic Leadership Ramos attached images of an official letter dated November 5, 2025, signed by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer. The letter was addressed to the President of the United States and called for a bipartisan meeting to resolve the shutdown and address the wider healthcare policy dispute at the center of the funding deadlock. The letter stated a readiness to meet face-to-face at any time and location to facilitate the reopening of government operations. The investor used the letter to reinforce his assertion that negotiations are entering a more direct stage. The correspondence reflects a clear invitation from Democratic leaders to engage in discussion with the executive branch, signaling potential movement after weeks of stalled legislative action. Ramos interpreted this as evidence that a pathway to restoration of government funding and agency operations could be forming. Market Valuation Claim and Investor Positioning In his post, Ramos stated that XRP could reach a market capitalization exceeding $200 billion once the shutdown ends. The claim was presented as a confident expectation rather than a prediction. Ramos framed the shutdown as a limiting factor on market participation, suggesting that resolution could support increased trading activity and capital rotation into assets such as XRP.

Instead, it says that political stabilization would correspond with upward market movement. Ramos’s statement highlights the intersection between federal policy conditions and asset market liquidity. Assessment The shutdown has already had measurable effects across federal services, including employees and reduced operational capacity in key sectors such as aviation oversight. A resolution would restore normal government function and reduce policy uncertainty affecting financial markets. In that environment, investors observing assets like XRP will be watching not only for political agreement but also for how quickly economic activity stabilizes once federal operations resume.

He spoke on Friday in Tainan, a city in southern Taiwan, where he made it clear the company is not preparing shipments and is not arranging any return to the Chinese market. “There’re no active discussions. Currently, we’re not planning to ship anything to China,” Jensen said. He added that it will depend on China to change its own position if the market wants the company’s hardware again. “It’s up to China when they would like Nvidia products to go back to serve the Chinese market. I look forward to them changing their policy.” Jensen flew into Taiwan ahead of meetings with TSMC, a long-time manufacturing partner. He is set to attend TSMC’s annual sports day event on Saturday. His visit to Taiwan is one more stop in a global tour. Last week, he held meetings in Washington and South Korea, where he met companies that want access to Nvidia’s artificial intelligence hardware expertise. The 62‑year‑old founder has been traveling as demand for advanced computing systems continues to build across industries and regions. Huang continues world tour as Nvidia leads AI race The company has added about $1 trillion to its market cap within a few months, becoming the first $5 trillion company in history. Even though the stock has lost momentum recently, Nvidia still ranks as the most valuable company in the world, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Jensen is working to widen the use of AI hardware and reduce fear that the current wave of investment might form a bubble. Many firms are building data centers and buying specialized chips, and Huang wants to show that the spending will produce real results. At the same time, competition is growing. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom are both developing their own hardware to profit from the AI boom. These companies are aiming at the same corporate buyers looking to deploy faster training systems and large‑scale computing clusters. Nvidia remains blocked from selling high‑end AI chips in China. A recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China did not include approval for Blackwell chip sales. Officials in the Trump administration have said that allowing such shipments is not being considered at this time. During an earnings call in August, Jensen explained that if the chips could be shipped into the Chinese market, the company could pursue a $50 billion opportunity. He said demand for AI computing in China is growing fast, at a rate of about 50% per year. The setback has led to concerns among investors on Wall Street. Some are worried that heavy spending on hardware, data centers, and AI infrastructure may not deliver new revenue large enough to justify the investments. They fear that the expectations placed on AI systems may be ahead of real commercial results, especially with major markets such as China not currently available for Nvidia’s strongest chips.

The exchange is sounding alarm bells about Elixir (ELX), urging extreme caution after observing dangerous market conditions. This Bithumb investment warning comes at a crucial time when investor protection matters more than ever. Why Did Bithumb Issue This Investment Warning? Bithumb’s decision to issue this urgent Bithumb investment warning stems from concerning developments within the Elixir ecosystem. The exchange specifically highlighted alarming price volatility in deUSD, the stablecoin issued by the Elixir project. Stablecoins are supposed to maintain consistent value, but deUSD has shown unpredictable swings that threaten investor funds. Moreover, the situation escalated when the Elixir team made a startling move. They completely suspended both issuance and redemption of deUSD. This action essentially traps investors’ funds without clear exit options. Therefore, Bithumb took proactive measures to protect its users from potential losses. What Does This Mean for ELX Investors? If you currently hold Elixir (ELX) tokens or deUSD stablecoins, this Bithumb investment warning demands your immediate attention. Here are the key risks you face: Liquidity crisis – Unable to convert deUSD to other assets Price instability – Extreme volatility in ELX token value Redemption uncertainty – No clear timeline for restoring services Regulatory scrutiny – Potential investigation into project operations The suspension of deUSD operations creates a domino effect that could impact the entire Elixir ecosystem. Investors should carefully assess their exposure and consider risk management strategies. How Should You Respond to This Warning? This Bithumb investment warning provides clear guidance for affected investors. First, immediately review your portfolio exposure to ELX and deUSD. Second, consider diversifying your holdings to reduce concentration risk. Third, monitor official announcements from both Bithumb and the Elixir team for updates. Remember that cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks. However, when a major exchange like Bithumb issues a specific warning, it signals genuine concerns that require careful attention. The exchange’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to investor protection. What Lessons Can We Learn? This situation reinforces several important investment principles. Always research projects thoroughly before investing. Understand the mechanisms behind stablecoins and their potential failure points. Most importantly, heed warnings from reputable exchanges like Bithumb when they identify red flags. The Bithumb investment warning serves as a reminder that even seemingly stable projects can encounter unexpected challenges. Diversification and risk management remain crucial strategies in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Frequently Asked Questions What triggered Bithumb’s investment warning for Elixir? Bithumb issued the warning after observing sharp price volatility in deUSD stablecoin and the project’s suspension of issuance and redemption services. Should I immediately sell my ELX tokens? While we cannot provide financial advice, the warning suggests carefully evaluating your risk exposure and considering appropriate risk management measures. Is my money safe on Bithumb exchange? Bithumb remains a regulated exchange, and this warning demonstrates their commitment to protecting investors by identifying potential risks early. How long might the deUSD suspension last? There is no official timeline provided by the Elixir team, which contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the project. Can other exchanges be affected by this situation? While Bithumb issued the warning, any exchange listing ELX or deUSD could potentially face similar challenges if the project’s issues persist. What should I do if I hold deUSD stablecoins? Monitor official communications from both Bithumb and the Elixir team for updates on when redemption services might resume.

He said trade talks are “going well” and used the moment to bring up his last trip to India, calling Modi “his friend” and a “great man.” This comes at a time when U. S. -India relations have been shaky. The connection between the two countries hit a wall in recent months, especially after a series of sharp disagreements over tariffs, visa fees, and Russia. Trump’s claim that he had brokered a peace deal between India and Pakistan didn’t help either, especially when India kept buying Russian crude. Experts said that the “missing chemistry” between the two leaders played a role in weakening the alliance. India faces heavy tariffs as trade talks inch forward India’s goods are currently slammed with 50% tariffs by the U. S. , that’s even worse than China’s 47% rate. Meanwhile, Indian professionals looking to work in the U. S. must cough up $100,000 for H1B visas. That number alone has created a major roadblock in bilateral cooperation. But now, negotiations are back on track, and according to Oxford Economics’ Alexandra Hermann, both sides believe a trade deal could land “by the end of the year, possibly even in the next few weeks.” If that happens, tariffs on Indian goods could drop to 20%, putting India on the same footing as countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. But don’t expect miracles. Hermann said the rate probably won’t go down to 15%, like Japan or South Korea, thanks to India’s continued ties with Russia, unresolved issues with agriculture, and its limited commitment to invest big in the U. S. On top of that, the U. S. slapped sanctions last month on Rosneft and Lukoil, two of Russia’s top oil firms. Those sanctions kick in on November 21, and they’re already having an effect. Indian and Chinese refiners have started cutting down imports of Russian oil. According to Reuters, the price gap between Russian oil and Brent is now at its widest in Asia in a year, as refiners from both countries scale back. Still, India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry didn’t respond to CNBC when asked if the government was officially reducing Russian oil purchases. And the bigger picture? It’s complicated. Prateek Pandey from Rystad Energy said straight up: “Over the long term, completely phasing out Russian oil isn’t realistic for India.” He pointed out that if Russian crude gets cheaper, India’s “economics first” strategy will be put to the test. Trump presses Orban on Hungary’s Russian oil use Trump isn’t just watching India. On Friday, he sat down with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to talk about Hungary’s dependency on Russian oil. It was their first one-on-one meeting since Trump got back to the White House in January, and Russia was front and center. Both leaders are loud about their anti-immigration views, but Orban’s oil ties to Moscow put him in a tight spot. Trump has been on a mission to pressure European countries to stop buying Russian oil to choke Moscow’s funding for its war in Ukraine. But Hungary hasn’t let go of Russian energy since the 2022 invasion, even with EU and NATO allies criticizing the move. Ahead of the meeting, Hungarian officials said Orban wanted to push for a U. S. -Russia dialogue and possibly get exemptions from U. S. energy sanctions. Trump had earlier said he’d meet Vladimir Putin in Budapest, but the Kremlin pulled back after rejecting a ceasefire. “All diplomatic negotiations are hard,” Orban told Hungarian state media, “but I expect a friendly and easy negotiation.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Economy|CNY|EUR|INR|RUB|TWD|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|COMMODITY|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-07 09:14:54

According to Citibank’s latest analysis, we’re witnessing a significant Bitcoin liquidity crunch that’s creating an unprecedented divergence from traditional markets. This development marks a crucial turning point for cryptocurrency investors and market watchers alike. What exactly is causing this Bitcoin liquidity crunch? Citibank’s research reveals that Bitcoin’s trading patterns have historically moved in close correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index. However, the current scenario shows Bitcoin trading below its 55-day moving average, indicating a severe Bitcoin liquidity crunch. Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market enjoys robust performance driven by artificial intelligence enthusiasm. This divergence highlights Bitcoin’s heightened sensitivity to liquidity conditions compared to traditional equities. How does the Bitcoin liquidity crunch affect your investments? The current Bitcoin liquidity crunch creates several important implications for investors. First, risk-adjusted returns for both Bitcoin and equities are deteriorating. Second, the correlation breakdown suggests cryptocurrency markets are reacting differently to economic conditions. Key factors to consider include: Bitcoin’s immediate sensitivity to liquidity changes Nasdaq’s resilience due to AI sector strength Historical correlation patterns breaking down Potential recovery signals to watch for Is there hope beyond the current Bitcoin liquidity crunch? Despite the challenging environment, Citibank concludes that upside potential remains for both Bitcoin and equities as liquidity shows signs of improvement. The current Bitcoin liquidity crunch represents a temporary phase rather than a permanent condition. Market participants should monitor: Federal Reserve policy changes Institutional adoption trends Technical indicator recoveries Global liquidity conditions What actionable insights can you take from this analysis? Understanding the Bitcoin liquidity crunch provides valuable opportunities for strategic positioning. Investors should consider diversifying across asset classes and maintaining awareness of liquidity indicators. The current situation emphasizes the importance of: Monitoring moving average crossovers Watching for liquidity improvement signals Balancing cryptocurrency and equity exposures Preparing for potential correlation restoration The Bitcoin liquidity crunch represents a pivotal moment in cryptocurrency market evolution. While current conditions present challenges, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains intact. As liquidity conditions normalize, both Bitcoin and traditional equities could see renewed momentum. The key takeaway is that market divergences create opportunities for informed investors who understand underlying liquidity dynamics. Frequently Asked Questions What causes a Bitcoin liquidity crunch? A Bitcoin liquidity crunch occurs when market conditions reduce the availability of capital for cryptocurrency trading, often due to tighter monetary policy or reduced investor participation. How long do Bitcoin liquidity crunches typically last? Duration varies based on market conditions, but historical patterns suggest these phases can last from several weeks to multiple months depending on economic factors. Does a liquidity crunch always mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While liquidity crunches often pressure prices, other factors like adoption trends and macroeconomic conditions can provide counterbalancing support. How can investors protect themselves during liquidity crunches? Diversification, position sizing, and focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term volatility can help navigate challenging market conditions. What signals indicate the end of a liquidity crunch? Improvements in trading volume, positive moving average crossovers, and broader market liquidity recovery often signal the end of liquidity constraints. Will Bitcoin’s correlation with Nasdaq return after the liquidity crunch? Historical patterns suggest correlations often re-establish once liquidity conditions normalize, though the strength may vary based on market dynamics.

The whole standoff has pushed Europe’s car factories to the edge, as chip shipments from China have been frozen for weeks, slashing the supply of basic but vital components used by companies like BMW and Volkswagen. The Dutch move would involve shelving a ministerial order that gave them the power to block or rewrite key decisions at Nexperia, a chipmaker based in Nijmegen but owned by Wingtech Technology, a company out of Shanghai. But this rollback won’t happen unless two things line up: one, China needs to resume shipping chips, and two, the money drama between Nexperia and its Chinese unit must get cleaned up. A few signs suggest movement; Wingtech’s stock shot up almost 10% in late trading in Shanghai just hours after Dutch officials hinted at a deal. Karremans signals chip supplies may resume soon Vincent Karremans, the Dutch Economic Affairs Minister, issued a statement late Thursday that added more fuel to the speculation. “Given the constructive nature of our talks with the Chinese authorities, the Netherlands trusts that the supply of chips from China to Europe and the rest of the world will reach Nexperia’s customers over the coming days,” he said . The trouble began back in September, when Dutch officials took control of Nexperia over fears that Wingtech’s founder, Zhang Xuezheng, was misusing company cash to enrich himself and funnel funds to his other companies in China. Those claims led to Zhang getting booted as CEO by a court in Amsterdam on October 7, after a petition from Nexperia’s management. Since then, Wingtech has denied every allegation and demanded that Zhang be brought back. That court-backed intervention gave the Dutch government a one-year window to block or override any executive changes, strategic relocations, or internal decisions. China didn’t take that lightly. In response, it slammed the brakes on Nexperia’s chip exports, creating a ripple effect that’s now messing with Europe’s entire car supply chain. By October 29, Nexperia was forced to alert clients that it had stopped sending wafers to its Chinese factory. That site alone used to process half of the company’s production volume before all hell broke loose. Without that supply, automakers in the region are stuck relying on their dwindling chip reserves. Some are even bracing for full shutdowns if deliveries don’t restart immediately, warned the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association. Nexperia accuses China unit of sabotage On October 13, Nexperia made it clear that it had lost all trust in its China-based factory, stating it could no longer guarantee the technology , intellectual property, or authenticity of the components being shipped from that plant. The company said, “We cannot oversee if and when products from our facility in China will be delivered,” blaming a total breakdown in transparency and oversight. Then came a stronger accusation. On Wednesday, Nexperia said its Chinese unit didn’t only refuse to pay for wafer deliveries, it also took actions that were completely out of line. The company said its official corporate seals were misused without valid explanation and that fake letters were sent to customers, subcontractors, and suppliers, all without approval. This isn’t being treated as a one-off, either. Nexperia called it part of a broader pattern of misconduct. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

MEXC, a global crypto exchange, is taking bold steps to address this issue by enhancing its risk management policy. This move aims to safeguard legitimate traders and ensure fair market practices. If you’ve ever worried about account security, this development could bring you peace of mind. Why is MEXC updating its risk management policy? MEXC recognized that some risk management rules were applied too strictly, leading to unnecessary account freezes. Therefore, the exchange is revising its procedures to prevent such cases. This proactive approach helps build trust with users who rely on the platform for their crypto transactions. Moreover, it aligns with industry best practices for security and user protection. How does the new appeal process work? To assist affected users, MEXC has established a dedicated support team and a separate review channel. This streamlined process allows for quicker resolution of unfreezing requests. Key features include: Direct access to specialized support staff Expedited review of individual cases Clear communication on decision outcomes By improving this aspect of its risk management policy, MEXC reduces wait times and enhances user satisfaction. What transparency measures is MEXC implementing? Transparency is crucial for user confidence. MEXC plans to regularly disclose details about its risk management policy and review results. This openness allows the community to understand how rules are enforced and what changes are made. Consequently, users can feel more secure knowing the exchange operates with accountability. What benefits does this bring to crypto traders? A robust risk management policy offers multiple advantages. It protects users from fraudulent activities and ensures a level playing field. For example, legitimate traders can operate without fear of arbitrary account locks. Additionally, these improvements may attract more users to the platform, boosting liquidity and market health. Are there challenges in implementing these changes? While the updates are positive, executing them smoothly requires careful planning. MEXC must balance security with accessibility to avoid overcorrecting. However, the exchange’s commitment to ongoing reviews suggests it will adapt based on user feedback and emerging threats. In summary, MEXC’s efforts to refine its risk management policy mark a significant step toward user-centric operations. By addressing past issues and promoting transparency, the exchange sets a higher standard for the crypto industry. These changes not only resolve immediate concerns but also foster long-term trust and engagement. Frequently Asked Questions Why was my MEXC account frozen? Accounts may be frozen due to suspicious activity triggers in the risk management policy, such as unusual login patterns or transaction anomalies. How long does the unfreezing process take? With the new dedicated team, MEXC aims to resolve appeals faster, though exact times depend on case complexity. Can I prevent my account from being frozen? Yes, use strong security practices like two-factor authentication and avoid activities that might flag the risk management system. Will MEXC notify users about policy changes? Yes, the exchange plans regular disclosures to keep users informed about its risk management policy updates. What if my appeal is denied?

According to a post by on-chain analyst EmberCN, Tether purchased 961 BTC (worth $97.18 million). Accordingly, Tether's BTC reserve wallet withdrew 961 BTC from Bitfinex. With this move, Tether saw an opportunity in the decline in Bitcoin and compensated for the decline. This acquisition was part of a consistent accumulation strategy implemented following the major $1 billion acquisition in September. Because Tether purchased approximately 8,889 Bitcoins (worth approximately $1 billion) on September 30. Tether's wallet in question has held BTC purchased with 15% of the company's profits since 2023, typically withdrawing only at the end of each quarter. The company has made it clear in past statements that it views Bitcoin as a key component of its reserve diversification strategy. The wallet in question currently holds 87,296 BTC worth $8.84 billion, making it the 6th largest BTC wallet. *This is not investment advice.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $8 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $4.24 Market cap $89.09M 24-hour trading volume $28.81M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $1.41 on Oct 11, 2025 24-hour high $4.32 24-hour low $3.90 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 17.86% 50-day SMA $6.65 200-day SMA $8.66 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) Fear and Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) ORDI price analysis On November 7, ORDI’s price rose by 5.62% in 24 hours but is down 47.14% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume grew by 17.20% showing trader conviction in the market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView The Ordinal daily chart indicates that ORDI trades below the Williams Alligator trendlines, signaling a potentially eventful market after the price dropped below support levels ($5.09 Fibonacci midpoint) and key moving averages. The coin has registered little momentum this week, forcing the coin’s drop to slow. The MACD and signal lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, signaling a bear market. At the same time, the relative strength index (RSI) is in neutral territory at 35.61. It is oversold when the RSI falls below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDIUSD chart by TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI is moving up at the $4.20 mark with MACD confirmation (0.053). The William Alligator trendlines show its volatility has fallen. The move comes following a sharp drop earlier this month when the price fell below $4.50. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 5.73 SELL SMA 5 5.11 SELL SMA 10 5.19 SELL SMA 21 5.23 SELL SMA 50 6.65 SELL SMA 100 7.99 SELL SMA 200 8.66 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 5.44 SELL EMA 5 6.19 SELL EMA 10 7.21 SELL EMA 21 8.08 SELL EMA 50 8.72 SELL EMA 100 9.13 SELL EMA 200 11.66 SELL What to expect from the ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index indicating an extreme fear sentiment among investors. Over the short term, ORDI remains correlated with Bitcoin, which is just above $101,000, following a brief recovery. Why is ORDI down? ORDI’s drop reflects technical triggers, Bitcoin-driven risk aversion, and technical overextension. Its status as a “Bitcoin beta” leaves it vulnerable during dominance rallies, while thin liquidity amplifies price movements. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history by CoinGecko According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May. In July, it was trading below $10. In October, it dropped $8 and assumed a bearish run; by November, it had reached $4.25.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-07 09:27:44

Its downfall, though, dragged most altcoins with it, and XRP is in fact one of the poorest performers daily, which is rather surprising given some of the positive developments around it in recent days. So why is that? Good Ripple News Aside from several acquisitions made this year, Ripple just held its annual Swell Conference, in which it announced another major milestone. Following a $500 million investment round, led by prominent names such as Fortress Investment Group, Marshall Wace, Citadel Securities, and Pantera Capital, the company’s valuation skyrocketed to a whopping $40 billion. The firm also partnered with Mastercard, WebBank, and emini to expand the use of its own stablecoin, RLUSD, on the XRP Ledger. The idea is to enable the stablecoin to be used for blockchain-based payments between Mastercard and WebBank. Another piece of bullish news came from the on-chain sector, which showed that 21,595 new XRP wallets were created in the span of just two days. This is the largest such increase in eight months. Additionally, the XRP Ledger continues to enjoy healthy engagement levels, as one of the native DEXes hit a new all-time high in terms of daily transactions of over 950,000. But Why Down, XRP? Perhaps the most evident reason behind the asset’s nosedive today is the overall negative market sentiment, as most cryptocurrencies are in the red daily and weekly. However, XRP has slipped by more than 4%, while the rest of the larger-cap digital assets are down by around 1%-1.5%. Whales’ behavior could be attributed to this downfall as they have been consistently selling off significant portions of the asset, including disposing of 900,000 tokens in just five days. Consequently, some analysts have turned bearish on XRP, at least for the short term. As reported on Tuesday, IncomeSharks warned that Ripple’s cross-border token could soon dip below $2 again, which could open the doors for a “buy-the-dip” opportunity. For now, XRP is fighting to stay above the $2.20 support following a massive 23% monthly decline. It also continues to fight off BNB for the fourth place in terms of market cap, and so far, it has the advantage, but it’s pretty narrow. XRPUSD.

This cryptocurrency indicates there is selling pressure among market institutions. Nonetheless, shrewd investors diversify to affordable alternatives with stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is identified as the top cryptocurrency to buy now with more than 17, 790 subscribers because of its current presale collection of $18,450,000. Prudent ones have identified it as the top cryptocurrency to buy now because they have escaped the volatile meme currency. Dogecoin Sees Intense Selling Pressures Dogecoin is still struggling because of the intense activities of whales that caused the price to drop. Whales offloaded enormous amounts of the cryptocurrency, leading to it falling below critical levels of $0.18. Volume increased by 426% against averages to validate bearish dominance. A total of $22.27 million in dogecoin left on-chain per day. The open interest in futures contracts decreased by 4% to $1.67 billion. This is a reflection of the vulnerabilities associated with meme-based cryptocurrencies. A revival is not guaranteed unless there is stabilization above $0.165. Key indicators are close to oversold. Mutuum Finance Pushes Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly pacing its presale to Phase 6, in which 85% of the tokens had been bought at just $0.035. This defi crypto reward price is well above 250% of Phase 1’s initial price of only $0.01. But more importantly, there had been just over 770 million tokens sold out during this promotion to encourage support. Phase 6 is quick to close with little time to get in at current prices before they increase. The next phase calls for nearly a 20% increase to a price of $0.04. Launch prices target $0.06 for 412% profit potential. Phase 6 is close to exhaustion, causing FOMO among those left out. All those holding back will miss the last chance with prices at $0.035. This defi crypto requires urgent attention to prevent remorse. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates engagement with a new dashboard that includes a leaderboard of top 50 token holders. A 24-hour leaderboard rewards those who contribute with the top contributor rewarded with $500 in MUTM every day if they have made at least one trade during that day. The leaderboard is reset at 00:00 UTC every day to spark another day of engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides two liquidity layers to maximize revenue. Peer-to-Contract markets allow users to aggregate their assets such as ETH or USDT to automatically generate revenue as borrowers borrow against the pooled assets. Also, Peer-to-Peer products support borrowing contracts for less liquid assets. For the deposited assets, users receive their equivalent value in mtTokens that can be redeemed in return with interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is utilizing a buy-and-distribute model with the help of protocol fees to buy tokens on open markets. This distribution is done to stakers of mtToken, leading to a direct relationship between usage and increased demand for tokens. This ensures that demand is always increasing. As part of the celebration of the presale of Mutuum Finance, the team announces a prize giveaway of a total of $100,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 winners with each prize amounting to $10,000. Mutuum Finance Builds Strong Foundations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a security audit rating 90/100 against token security. It also established a bug bounty reward of $50,000. It rewards up to a maximum of $2,000 for critical bugs. It is attractive to serious money looking for trustworthy defi cryptos. Dogecoin’s fall highlights the danger of investing in media-perpetuated alternative cryptocurrencies when there is transparent advancement and reward offered. The best cryptos to buy today have to offer not only accessibility to their users but also strong game mechanics.

South Korea’s leading exchange Bithumb has announced a temporary suspension of Injective (INJ) deposits and withdrawals. This crucial maintenance window begins at 3:00 a.m. UTC on November 11, directly supporting the upcoming Bithumb INJ suspension for network enhancements. But what does this mean for your trading strategy? Why is Bithumb suspending INJ transactions? The Bithumb INJ suspension serves a vital purpose: facilitating a seamless network upgrade for the Injective protocol. Network upgrades typically introduce: Enhanced security features Improved transaction speeds New protocol capabilities Better scalability solutions Exchanges often implement these temporary suspensions to ensure user funds remain secure during the transition period. This proactive approach prevents potential transaction conflicts or loss of assets. How will the Bithumb INJ suspension affect traders? During the Bithumb INJ suspension period, users cannot deposit or withdraw INJ tokens. However, trading activities within the exchange typically continue uninterrupted. Here’s what you need to know: Existing INJ balances remain safe and accessible for trading Spot trading pairs involving INJ usually continue operating Only deposit and withdrawal functions get temporarily disabled Normal operations resume once network stability confirms Therefore, plan your INJ movements before November 11 to avoid inconvenience. What makes network upgrades necessary? Blockchain networks evolve constantly to address emerging challenges and opportunities. The Bithumb INJ suspension enables these crucial improvements without compromising user assets. Network upgrades typically deliver: Enhanced performance metrics Strengthened security protocols Reduced transaction costs Expanded functionality These enhancements ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem, making temporary inconveniences worthwhile for long-term gains. When will normal INJ services resume? Bithumb hasn’t specified an exact completion time for the Bithumb INJ suspension . Network upgrades require careful monitoring and testing before restoring full functionality. The exchange will likely announce resumption through: Official website notifications Mobile app push alerts Social media announcements Email communications to registered users Monitor these channels closely for the latest updates regarding service restoration. What should INJ holders do during the suspension? While the Bithumb INJ suspension remains active, consider these strategic moves: Complete necessary INJ transfers before November 11 Monitor INJ price movements for potential opportunities Research the upgrade’s specific benefits for informed decisions Diversify activities to other available trading pairs Remember, temporary suspensions often precede positive network developments that could enhance token value. Conclusion: Turning temporary inconvenience into strategic advantage The Bithumb INJ suspension represents more than just service interruption—it signals progress. Network upgrades strengthen blockchain foundations, potentially increasing asset utility and value. While November 11 brings temporary limitations, the long-term benefits could significantly outweigh short-term inconveniences. Stay informed, plan ahead, and view this upgrade as a positive step toward enhanced blockchain performance. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade INJ on Bithumb during the suspension? Yes, typically trading continues normally. Only deposits and withdrawals get temporarily suspended. How long will the Bithumb INJ suspension last? Exact duration varies, but exchanges usually restore services within hours after confirming network stability. Are my INJ tokens safe during the upgrade? Yes, your tokens remain secure in your Bithumb wallet. Suspensions prevent movement during vulnerable transition periods. Will this affect INJ’s market price? Temporary suspensions rarely cause significant price impacts, especially when well-communicated in advance. Should I move my INJ tokens before November 11? Only if you need immediate access elsewhere. Otherwise, leaving tokens positioned for post-upgrade trading might be strategic. How can I stay updated about service restoration? Monitor Bithumb’s official announcements through their website, app notifications, and social media channels. Found this information helpful?

This week, short-term funding rates have leveled off, following jitters in late October that raised red flags within the financial system’s core operations. Just last week, the tri-party repo rate rose to levels not seen since 2020, despite the central bank’s confirmation that it will pause balance-sheet runoff on December 1. Now, tri-party repo rates have settled closer to the Fed’s rate on reserves, reflecting calmer market conditions. However, many still see the potential for renewed volatility in the weeks ahead. Deirdre Dunn, head of rates at Wall Street bank Citigroup , and chair of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, commented, “I don’t think it was a one-off anomaly of just a few days of volatility.” Analysts say the central bank may have to continue asset purchases Curvature Securities’ Scott Skyrm noted markets have “normalized” for now, as banks tapped a Fed facility to ease strain . Still, he cautioned that funding pressures will likely resurface at the turn of the month and again at year-end. Echoing those concerns, Samuel Earl, a US rate strategist at Barclays, emphasized that funding conditions remain vulnerable to change. Some analysts and policymakers believe the Fed may eventually need to resume asset purchases if the strain doesn’t subside. Lorie Logan, head of the Dallas Fed and a former market expert at the New York Fed, particularly noted that the central bank may need to consider asset purchases if repo rates remain elevated. Meanwhile, Dunn advocated that the central bank consider additional solutions. He remarked: “One could argue that we’re not in an ample reserve environment anymore and these events could continue to happen . . . It would be prudent for the Fed to think about what other tools they have in their back pocket.” Analysts warn of a possible credit crunch Some analysts have pointed to growing indicators of a potential global credit crunch, almost similar to the one that occurred in 2008. They argued that the central bank’s move to inject liquidity shows that market strains are building. On October 31, the Fed Reserve added an astounding $50.35 billion into the US financial system. Henry Jennings, a senior portfolio manager at Marcus Today, said the Fed was right to intervene, as liquidity had been draining from the US system and needed to be topped up. He added, “We need to keep an eye on further moves, but, for now, the market is more concerned with earnings than plumbing.” Likewise, RBA Governor Michele Bullock said she does not expect a credit crunch, noting that it is precisely what the Fed aims to prevent. Still, some analysts are uneasy that the Federal Reserve had to intervene at all. The US government is still issuing Treasuries to fund its expanding fiscal gap, something analysts believe is tightening liquidity worldwide and may explain the Fed’s decision to pause balance-sheet reductions. Analysts believe stress in global money markets may have influenced the Fed’s decision to stop QT. However, some argue the central bank acted too late, as secured borrowing rates in the US and UK have already surged to multi-year peaks. Investors worldwide are closely monitoring the situation as dollar funding costs set the tone for global liquidity. And the central banks of many emerging markets, which borrow in dollars to an extraordinary degree, may find credit conditions more constricting if short-term rates stay high in the United States.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $100,996.01 on the Binance USDT market, marking a concerning downturn for investors who had been watching the digital asset’s performance closely. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Decline? The sudden drop in Bitcoin price has left many traders wondering about the underlying causes. Market analysts point to several factors that could be contributing to this downward movement. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are naturally volatile, and price corrections are part of the normal market cycle. Key factors influencing the current Bitcoin price include: Market sentiment shifts among institutional investors Broader economic conditions affecting risk assets Technical resistance levels that Bitcoin price failed to break Profit-taking behavior from recent gains How Should Investors React to Bitcoin Price Movements? When the Bitcoin price experiences significant volatility, investors often face difficult decisions. The current situation below $101,000 presents both challenges and opportunities. Therefore, having a clear strategy is essential for navigating these market conditions successfully. Consider these approaches when dealing with Bitcoin price fluctuations: Dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risks Setting clear entry and exit points based on your risk tolerance Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin price exposure Monitoring market fundamentals rather than just price movements Historical Context of Bitcoin Price Corrections This isn’t the first time we’ve seen the Bitcoin price experience significant corrections. Throughout its history, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience after major price drops. Moreover, many analysts view these corrections as healthy market mechanisms that shake out weak hands and create buying opportunities for long-term investors. Remember that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but understanding historical Bitcoin price patterns can provide valuable perspective during turbulent times. What’s Next for Bitcoin Price Recovery? The crucial question on every investor’s mind is whether the Bitcoin price will recover from this downturn. While no one can predict the future with certainty, several indicators suggest potential recovery paths. The current Bitcoin price level around $100,996.01 may represent a key support zone that could determine the next major move. Market watchers are closely monitoring: Trading volume patterns during this Bitcoin price decline Institutional buying activity at lower price levels Macroeconomic factors that could influence cryptocurrency demand Technical analysis signals for potential reversal points Final Thoughts on the Bitcoin Price Situation The recent Bitcoin price movement below $101,000 serves as a powerful reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. While concerning in the short term, such corrections often create opportunities for strategic investors. The fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin remains unchanged, and many long-term holders view these dips as potential accumulation zones. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consider their financial goals before making any decisions based on Bitcoin price movements. The market’s journey continues, and today’s price action is just one chapter in Bitcoin’s ongoing story. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price drop below $101,000? The Bitcoin price decline likely resulted from a combination of profit-taking, changing market sentiment, and technical resistance levels. Cryptocurrency markets naturally experience periodic corrections as part of their normal cycle. Should I buy Bitcoin at the current price? Investment decisions should align with your financial goals and risk tolerance. While some investors see price dips as buying opportunities, others prefer to wait for clearer market direction. Always conduct thorough research before investing. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price bottoms is impossible. Market analysts watch key support levels, but cryptocurrency prices can be unpredictable. Focus on your investment strategy rather than trying to time the absolute bottom. Will Bitcoin price recover quickly? Recovery timelines vary widely in cryptocurrency markets. Some corrections resolve quickly, while others take longer. Historical patterns show Bitcoin has eventually recovered from previous major declines. What factors could help Bitcoin price recover? Positive developments like institutional adoption, favorable regulations, or improved market sentiment could support Bitcoin price recovery. However, multiple factors typically influence price movements. How does this Bitcoin price drop compare to historical corrections? Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections throughout its history, many more severe than the current movement. The asset has demonstrated remarkable resilience over the long term despite short-term volatility. Found this analysis helpful?

54127090,623428,1762508661,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54127090.jpeg,XRP’s Game-Changing Partnership: What It Means for Traders and Emerging Cryptos like Maxi Doge,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-partner-mastercard-maxi-doge-best-meme-coins/,"Quick Facts: XRP’s new Mastercard partnership signals strong potential for institutional adoption and future price rallies. $XRP is outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum in their market rebound, driven by the Mastercard partnership. Maxi Doge’s ($MAXI) presale has raised $3.9M, offering early investors 78% staking rewards, with a token price of $0.000267. Maxi Doge is positioned to become one of the best meme coins on the market thanks to its meme value and growth potential, which could see $MAXI deliver a five-year ROI of over 3.6K%. Recent developments in the cryptocurrency market are sparking excitement, particularly around $XRP, as the token’s potential for significant growth intensifies. A fresh partnership with Mastercard, announced in early November , has analysts predicting that XRP could see massive rallies, fueling a renewed interest in altcoins. Traders, many of whom are accustomed to the volatility of the market, are taking note of the conditions that could drive XRP’s ascent, with its use case poised to benefit from the Mastercard tie-up. While XRP’s rally hinges on this collaboration, it’s a broader market movement that could open up new opportunities for altcoin investors, especially in presale projects such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI) . For those seeking stable returns amidst the bullish sentiments, Maxi Doge presents an intriguing option. With its growing presale momentum, it’s carving out a unique spot in the market. In a market eager for the next big move, tokens like $MAXI could be well-positioned to capture the spotlight. XRP’s Mastercard Deal: A Bullish Signal for Crypto Traders XRP’s recent announcement of a strategic partnership with Mastercard is one of the most significant developments to hit the cryptocurrency space in months. This move has the potential to reshape the broader landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based payment systems. Mastercard’s global reach, combined with XRP’s advanced tech for seamless transactions, could make $XRP an even more valuable asset for investors watching the payment sector. Market analysts are already speculating that this partnership could provide the necessary catalyst to push $XRP into a major rally. The coin is already outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum in their market rebound, according to data from Coinglass. Traders and investors, always looking for the next move, are shifting their focus to projects that can thrive in a bullish altcoin environment – like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , which is riding the momentum of broader altcoin rallies. The strategic positioning of such projects offers high upside, especially when XRP is poised to make waves. Why Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Could Be the Next Big Thing Amidst the market’s growing optimism over XRP, new presale projects like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are getting attention for their early-stage design, which aims to capitalize on the shifting market landscape. The project’s presale has already raised $3.9M+, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. For traders and investors who are looking to diversify their portfolios beyond established tokens like $XRP, Maxi Doge offers a promising opportunity with a current entry price of just $0.000267. What stands out about Maxi Doge is not just its presale numbers but the project’s clear focus on long-term sustainability. Like many projects in the meme-coin space, Maxi Doge leans lean heavily on hype to amass a strong community. However, it’s staking model sets it apart by rewarding early holders with a relatively high ROI, currently at 78% APY. This could help Maxi Doge weather market volatility, making it a viable asset for both short-term traders and long-term investors. As a hype-driven token with plans to overthrow $DOGE as the top dog of the meme coin market, $MAXI has no real utility. Then again, neither did $DOGE – until it slowly started to become a valid payment option. That’s why a realistic price prediction for $MAXI puts it at $0.01 or higher by 2030. This translates to a 3,645% ROI if you invest today. Such a performance would paint $MAXI as one of the best meme coins the market has to offer. By integrating Maxi Doge into a diversified portfolio, traders can hedge against potential risks from larger market swings while benefiting from high staking rewards. If you want to participate in the crypto revolution, securing tokens early in presale rounds can offer significant advantages. Maxi Doge is one of the more promising options at the moment, with its low entry price and lucrative staking rewards, making it an appealing choice for savvy traders. Go to the official presale page and buy your $MAXI today before the next price increase. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only; it’s not financial advice.

Despite the slow altcoin and token performance, ICP joined the list of recently awakening assets. Internet Computer (ICP) rallied to a three-month high, breaking out to $8.60 from recent lows. The token was down to $2.92 at the end of October after the month’s deep correction. Over the past three months, ICP is up a net 51%, though still below its yearly peak from January at over $15.30. ICP reacted to the newly active AI narrative, causing a near-vertical price rally. ICP rallied to a three-month peak, boosted by increased derivative trading and a short squeeze. | Source: CoinGecko Internet Computer aimed to become one of the go-to chains, but was displaced by Solana and the new DeFi boom on Ethereum. Now, the token is trending along with a recovery for other AI tokens . As a whole, the AI token space expanded to a total valuation of $27B. The current ICP rally has been in the making for a few days, with mindshare growing by 191%. ICP is still far from the leading networks, as the platform did not carry the latest trends in DeFi and DEX trading. ICP rallies with inflow of derivative traders As with other mostly inactive tokens, ICP reawakened on a sudden growth of derivative trading. Open interest spiked overnight to $162M. The market is relatively small compared to other assets. Despite the delay of a real altcoin market, specific assets meet the conditions for strong directional moves. The widely available derivative markets take over, magnifying the rallies. For now, the fundamentals of ICP have not changed, but the token saw additional liquidity inflows. The Internet Computer chain only locks in around $23M in liquidity, with limited usage in app creation. At one point, Internet Computer had claims on challenging Solana and becoming the go-to chain for apps, but never managed to create the same community. ICP climb got a boost from a short squeeze Most of the additional open interest for ICP is on Binance , the token’s main trading venue. Unlike other tokens, in the case of ICP, only around 30% of positions are short. In the past day, around $5M in short positions were liquidated, leaving traders to rebuild. ICP rose on a mix of general AI hype and a short squeeze. After a long slide in the past months, ICP was attracting short traders. Since the end of October, it has become harder to hold short positions, as ICP saw consistent negative funding. The negative funding trend continued during the latest price rally, further challenging the holders of short positions. As of November 7, ICP already burned through most of the short liquidity. Despite this, the rally is expected to continue, copying the model of ZEC. Potentially, ICP is seen as reaching $20 in the case of an ongoing short squeeze and more active trading.

Unlike other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, they are backed by reserve assets, though the 1:1 peg to underlying reserve assets has some flexibility, like a currency board. Using FTSE Russell data, we find Stablecoins show a very stable return profile and low volatility versus other cryptocurrencies and financial assets, since 2020. Stablecoins backed by fiat currency cash and near-cash display lower volatility than those collateralised by cryptocurrencies, and low correlation to Bitcoin and Ethereum. By Robin Marshall, M.A., M.Phil, Director, Global Investment Research | Alex Nae, M.Sc, Quantitative Research Analyst, Global Investment Research Executive summary Stablecoins (SCs) have grown rapidly since Covid, as a blockchain-based money equivalent, with liquidity and cross-border transferability, and as a stable store of value. Their total market capitalisation is now close to $250bn. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), they are issued by private companies, and backed by reserve assets. This distinguishes them from central bank digital currencies, which are issued by central banks, and legal tender, unlike SCs. However, the 1:1 peg to underlying reserve assets has some flexibility, like a currency board arrangement. The collapse of Terra (2022) highlighted the importance of the arbitrage mechanism required to ensure SC stability. Using FTSE Russell Stablecoin index data, we find SCs do indeed show a very stable return profile and low volatility relative to other cryptocurrencies and traditional financial assets, since 2020. SCs backed by fiat currency cash and near-cash display lower volatility than those collateralized by cryptocurrencies, and also show low correlation to Bitcoin and Ethereum, while being less volatile than algorithmic SCs. Passage of the US GENIUS Act gives a more complete regulatory framework for SCs in US dollars, and there are some signs of convergence in regulatory approaches with the Eurozone’s framework. A clearer, and more complete global regulatory framework reduces financial instability risks emanating from SCs, which do not share the risks of fractional reserve banking systems or permit maturity transformation. US dollar SCs comprise 99% of global market capitalization, and may serve to reinforce the dollar’s transactional dominance in cross-border payments, trade invoicing and foreign exchange volumes. Introduction A key development in digital assets in recent years is the arrival of, and rapid growth in, stablecoins. A stablecoin (SC) is a type of cryptocurrency that aims to maintain a stable value versus a specified asset, or pool of assets. The attraction of a SC lies in being a blockchain-based money equivalent, with liquidity and cross-border transferability, and a stable store of value. The underlying reserve asset is often a fiat currency, like the US dollar, but the underlying asset can be another cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This is a key difference between SCs and other cryptocurrencies which are not collateralized. Indeed, one of the key drivers of their development has been a reaction to the high volatility in cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, even if Bitcoin volatility has fallen in 2024-25[1]. The other key difference with cryptocurrencies is that SCs are issued by private companies, with the backing of reserve assets, rather than issued by a computer code on a network, as is Bitcoin.[2] Also bear in mind, SCs differ from central bank digital currencies (CBDC). CBDC are effectively digital banknotes, legal tender and issued by central banks, whereas SCs are issued by private companies and not legal tender. The key questions about Stablecoins In this paper, we look at the recent growth in, and types of, SCs and assess their performance returns and correlations with traditional asset classes, using FTSE Russell digital and multi-asset index data. We seek to answer key questions about SCs, specifically, why have SCs grown so quickly in recent years? Are SCs stable stores of value, and particularly versus their collateral? Is their performance correlated to other cryptocurrencies? Will SCs boost the role of the dollar as a dominant global reserve currency, reduce US debt service costs and leave the euro marooned? Finally, is it hype to hazard[3], namely could widespread adoption of SCs pose risks to financial systems or stability, or might they actually reduce the risks inherent in fractional reserve banking systems? Why have Stablecoins grown so quickly in recent years? Rapid growth in SCs reflects concern about the stability of fiat currencies and banking systems, particularly in developing countries, slow and costly cross border payment systems and as a bridge between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Recent regulatory changes in the US, including the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or “Genius Act”, and the introduction of an over-arching market structure framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, are other important factors. Chart 1 illustrates the high growth rate in the market capitalization of SCs in recent years. Chart 1: Market capitalization of major Stablecoins Source: Contrecoup – Cryptocurrency Historical Data, Monthly data December 2021 to August 2025. How SCs work; interaction between primary and secondary markets preserves Stablecoin pegs Box 1 outlines the mechanics of SC and the process behind a retail or institutional investor purchase, or sale of SC. The creation or redemption of SCs is similar to an ETF, where authorized participants serve that purpose to keep the ETF price in line with underlying NAV[4]. Note that only institutional investors can directly access fiat-backed stablecoins in the primary market, retail investors must rely on secondary markets. Other SCs, like crypto-collateralized SCs, can include a much wider range of participants. Interaction between primary and secondary markets works to preserve the 1:1 peg between a SC and underlying reserve assets. SC investors tend to track the secondary market for price information, since issuers will always quote a 1:1 conversion rate in the primary market. Box 1: The mechanics of Stablecoins backed by fiat currencies Source: FTSE Russell, October 2025 Chart 1 shows the market capitalization of 4 major SCs, highlighting their rapid growth, and subsequent contraction during the inflation shock and period of macroeconomic stress. SCs are not immune to economic shocks and suffered some contractions in market capitalization during the 2022-2023 period of tightening financial conditions, with Tether’s market value falling 13% and USDC by nearly 38%, as redemptions reduced supply (USDD was not operating at that time). The collapse of Terra, with its algorithmic collateralization to the cryptocurrency Luna, was a factor in this. But we note other SC pegs to underlying reserve assets held, even if there were some strains. Furthermore, there appears to be a relationship between stablecoin market capitalization and the broader US money supply. Chart 2 illustrates the average change in stablecoin market capitalization across different monetary conditions. During periods of contraction or low growth in the money supply, stablecoins expanded only marginally, around 1% on average, with occasional reductions. By contrast, during phases of monetary expansion, stablecoins recorded growth between 15% and 26%. This suggests that increases in dollars in circulation are often accompanied by greater conversion of cash into stablecoins. The pattern is consistent with earlier FTSE Russell research, which found that Bitcoin and Ethereum tend to rise as risk appetite increases, demonstrating that when liquidity expands, demand for both stablecoins and risk assets strengthens. This dynamic can be partly attributed to stablecoins’ role as the primary medium of exchange between US dollars and crypto assets. Chart 2: Stablecoin market capitalization across monetary regimes Source: CoinCheckupm, FTSE Russell. Monthly data December 2021 to August 2025. What are the major types of Stablecoins? Table 1 shows the dominant SC category are SCs backed by fiat currencies, like the dollar or euro, which pay no interest. Variations on this theme include US Treasury bills as the underlying reserve asset, which do pay interest, (such as Ondo’s USDY and Hashnote’s USYC), crypto-backed SCs, and commodity-backed SCs, with gold or silver backing the SCs. These yield-bearing stablecoins are typically not available to retail investors and fall outside the scope of the US GENIUS Act, which regulates payment stablecoins. The distinction has been at the center of recent policy debates in Washington, particularly around the classification and risk treatment of yield-bearing SCs. Algorithmic SCs are the most complex version, with demand and supply adjusting automatically to maintain stability, via smart contracts, and often backed by an underlying crypto asset. Terra was the largest of these algorithmic SCs, and collateralized by the cryptocurrency asset, Luna. When demand for Terra SCs fell in 2022, the supply of Luna was increased to preserve the 1:1 peg with Terra, but this drove the value of Luna lower, causing holders to exit Terra as the value of the underlying reserve asset fell. This caused a further increase in the supply of Luna, and so on. Such death spirals make algorithmic SCs riskier than those backed by fiat currencies, since supply of the reserve asset is endogenous, or determined by demand for the SC.

To assess the stability of SCs and correlations with other cryptocurrencies and multi-asset classes, we looked at the volatility, performance and correlation of returns of SCs with selected major US asset classes for the period 2020 to 2025, using FTSE Russell multi-asset index data. This links to our research earlier this year on digital asset characteristics and correlations of returns[5]. We chose 4 major SCs for this analysis, and included both SCs backed by US dollar cash and near-cash (T-bills) and those backed by cryptocurrencies. Chart 3 shows the variation in volatility between SCs backed by US dollar cash and near-cash (Tether and USDC) and those backed by cryptocurrencies, like DAI, which is not backed by US dollars in a bank account, but by collateral from the issuer’s Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO’s) platform, which sits on the Ethereum network. This makes DAI vulnerable to price swings in Ethereum, with its high volatility, as the underlying collateral. Indeed, DAI has similar volatility to 7 to 10 year Treasuries and US credit. In contrast, Tether and USD coin show extremely low volatility, near zero in the same period, with the main reserve assets being dollar cash and short Treasuries. Chart 3: Volatility of Stablecoins and major US asset classes 2021 to 2025 Source: FTSE Russell. Monthly data December 2021 to August 2025. So the data confirms SCs are much more stable than Bitcoin or Ethereum in recent years, but that there are unstable SCs, and that users need to be fully aware of the differences in collateral and structure of the arbitrage mechanism. Stablecoins as stores of value and the 1:1 price link to underlying reserve assets This raises a more fundamental point on SCs and their role as stores of value. There is no mechanical 1:1 link between the SC and underlying asset in the secondary market, particularly in the case of SCs with less stable collateral, like DAI. Tether’s price deviation from the underlying US dollar reserves has fallen since migrating from Omni to the Ethereum blockchain in April 2019, with its greater number of investors, but it does still occur, with a maximum standard deviation of about 5%. The 1:1 link relies on either the issuer intervening to correct a price deviation from the peg – like a central bank pegging an exchange rate to another currency – or decentralized investor arbitrage. But unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), where authorized participants intervene to correct discrepancies between an ETF’s valuation and underlying net asset value[6], in the case of SCs there are no authorised participants. The arbitrage mechanism relies on full commitment from the issuer on the supply side, and/or active investor arbitrage from the demand side. The mechanism is similar to that of a currency board, like the Hong Kong dollar peg to the US dollar in place since 1983, which operates with a band around a central rate. Credibility ensures that investors will intervene to keep the HK dollar within the band. Efficiency in the arbitrage design process is even more important for SCs not backed by reserve currencies, which are exposed to bigger price swings in underlying collateral, and concerns about reserve quality. Apart from Terra’s collapse, the other major market stress event for SCs originated in the traditional financial system, due to USDC’s exposure to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse in March 2023. These SC failures have driven stronger regulation with both the US GENIUS Act, and the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, or MICA framework, in Europe. Performance returns tell a story of relative stability Turning to performance returns and correlation with other asset classes, price returns are close to zero in most SCs in the period 2021 to 2025, as Chart 2 shows, but given there is no interest paid on SCs by issuers, due to US regulation, this is predictable. However, there are intermediaries who hold SCs for retail investors, and then pay “rewards” on these holdings, i.e., Coinbase, offers 4.1% to USDC holders. It has been argued this may raise financial stability issues[7] if bank deposit holders were to switch large sums from bank deposits into seemingly stable SCs in the pursuit of higher return (see section below on financial stability). Chart 2 also shows that Tether, the largest SC by market capitalization, has delivered positive returns, however, reflecting the scale of its reserve holdings in US Treasury Bills (T-bills). Importantly, the performance returns observed in SCs are less a product of ongoing price appreciation, and more the outcome of temporary peg deviations during stress episodes. In normal conditions, returns hover near zero, consistent with their design. But in periods of market turmoil, such as sharp drawdowns in crypto assets or liquidity squeezes in Defi, small breaks in the peg can translate into measurable price returns. Chart 4: Annualized returns of Stablecoins and major US asset classes 2021 to 2025 Source: FTSE Russell. Monthly data December 2021 to August 2025. Correlations of returns show low Stablecoin correlations to traditional assets… Stablecoins show low correlation in returns to other asset classes, particularly gold, as Table 4 shows. In addition, despite the peg to the US dollar, SC returns show low correlation with the US dollar index, since dollar index returns reflects the dollar’s external value against other currencies. Tether’s higher correlation to Bitcoin, mainly due to the medium of exchange role Tether shows the highest correlation of returns with Bitcoin ((BTC))) and Ethereum (Ether) at around 0.4, which may be explained by Tether featuring in about 50% of BTC and Ether trades, as a means of payment for these cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, Tether shows higher correlations with other financial assets, notably US Treasuries and equities, than other SCs. There may be a collateral effect in this in short Treasuries, but it could be driven by Tether’s dominant market share in SCs, and greater linkages with the traditional financial system via DeFi, and US Treasury bill holdings. ...other Stablecoins show much lower correlation to Bitcoin and Ethereum Other SCs show much lower correlation of returns with BTC and Ether. This is likely due to the relative stability and much lower volatility of returns in SCs, as Chart 1 above shows, and the “safe haven” effect during crypto downturns. The correlation of DAI with Ether is more complex, since DAI is backed by Ethereum as collateral. Bull market runs in Ether may induce holders to close DAI-backed loans and switch into Ether, and vice versa during sell-offers in Ether, giving a negative correlation overall. Another complexity is Ether’s role as collateral for DAI, since a sharp drop in the value of Ether could reduce demand for DAI, offsetting the negative correlation.

Monthly data December 2021 to August 2025. While return correlations provide some insight, they may not be the most effective way to assess SC dynamics. By design, SCs should be stable, and trade with minimal deviation from their peg, meaning price returns are more a reflection of rare stress episodes than of ongoing market drivers. But correlations with other assets can highlight how SCs react to market shocks, liquidity and crypto events, where deviations from the peg may coincide with sharp moves in Bitcoin, Ethereum or risk assets more broadly. In this sense, market analysis should emphasize deviation from $1.00 and liquidity linkages, while using correlations selectively to reveal stress transmission mechanism channels. Different regulatory emphasis between the US and Eurozone… European authorities have shown more concern about financial stability in the regulation of SCs since 2020[8]. As a result, SC regulation includes strong capital buffers and tight operational controls in the Eurozone with strict prohibition of interest payment on SCs. Indeed, ECB President Lagarde recently raised the issue of global equivalence in SC regulation when stating “….in the event of a run (on SCs), investors would naturally prefer to redeem (SCs) in the jurisdiction with the strongest safeguards, which is likely to be the EU, where MICAR (Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation) also prohibits redemption fees…..But the reserves may not be sufficient to meet such concentrated demand.” European focus on financial stability and risks to monetary sovereignty contrasts with the lighter touch US approach, which allows smaller SCs, with less than $10 billion in outstanding issuance, to be regulated at state level. ...but the GENIUS Act shows some convergence? However, the recent US GENIUS Act suggests some regulatory convergence, and as Table 3 shows, permitted reserve assets for SCs under the US GENIUS Act can only consist of US currency, demand deposits, short-term Treasury securities with 93 days or less to maturity, overnight repurchase agreements backed by Treasuries, and specific money market funds. This may boost demand for US T-bills and very short-dated Treasuries and we note that Tether now owns $127bn in T-bills, as of May 2025 (US Treasury data), which is another example of the link between SCs and fiat currencies. Table 3: Permitted reserve assets for Stablecoins under the US GENIUS Act Asset class Notes US currency Notes and coins US T-bills and Treasuries with Includes T-bills, notes and bonds Deposits at Federal Reserve banks Includes foreign branches Demand deposits at insured depository institutions Overnight repos collateralized by US Treasuries Includes reverse repos Shares in registered government money market funds Also includes securities registered under 1940 Inv.Company Act Tokenized versions of the above assets If in compliance with applicable laws and regs. Source: Guaranteeing Essential National Infrastructure in US-Stablecoins Act, July 2025. Financial stability and parallels with 2008 to 2009 and the shadow banking system Despite a clearer regulatory framework emerging, financial stability concerns centred on SCs persist.[9] It may be that the systemic risks caused by the mis-valuation of underlying reserve assets in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) is part of this, and the related concern SC issuers might switch investment out of permitted reserve assets into higher yielding and higher risk alternatives. A collapse in the value of this collateral could then break the peg of the SC to the fiat currency, prompting capital flight and major losses. Stablecoins are designed to reduce the risks of fractional reserve systems… Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements ((BIS)) has highlighted the risk SCs pose to monetary sovereignty, transparency, capital flight risks in EM and from fragile pegs to underlying reserve assets[10]. The BIS also notes SCs may not have the unique characteristics required for money. These are defined as singleness (because the 1:1 peg might deviate from the fiat currency), no restriction to elasticity of supply (because SC issuers cannot expand their balance sheet freely) and integrity (because SCs can circulate freely across borders and may suffer from “KYC” and compliance issues). …from maturity transformation and lower quality reserve assets But fractional reserve banking systems, with greater elasticity of money supply and credit, carry their own risks and can be exposed to bank deposit runs, as the recent collapses of some US regional banks, Credit Suisse First Boston in 2023, and Northern Rock in the UK (2007) demonstrated[11]. In addition, maturity transformation, i.e. investing demand deposits in longer dated assets, and low quality reserve assets have played a part in recent banking collapses, including the GFC, but maturity transformation is not permitted, or minimal, for SC reserves. So criticism of SCs based on parallels with the GFC and the collapse in the shadow banking system are less obvious, since the underlying reserve assets in the GFC were mainly private, sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, and not US Treasury bills, or dollar cash, backed by the monetary authorities. Fully and properly-regulated SCs may well expedite faster cross-border payments, and serve as a successful bridge between crypto and fiat currencies. Stablecoins and the impact on reserve currencies... Fears of the dollar’s death exaggerated? Finally, given the regulatory backdrop, the US dollar’s dominance as a global reserve currency[12], and that SCs can be used as settlement assets, it is perhaps unsurprising US dollar SCs comprise about 99% of global market capitalization. This in itself poses a challenge to the Eurozone, since US dollar SCs could achieve a bigger market share in Europe, boosting the US dollar’s role further in cross-border payments. It would cast some doubt on the popular notion of de-dollarization, often linked to the (modest) decline in US dollar holdings in central bank foreign exchange reserves in recent years. This is because it might reinforce the transactional dominance of the dollar in foreign exchange volumes, trade invoicing, cross-border liabilities denomination and foreign currency debt issuance.

Maxi Doge’s presale has raised over $3.9 million, with just hours left before a price increase. Strong marketing and staking rewards (78% p.a.) ensure that Maxi Doge has a strong foundation for growth. The sentiment around Ethereum ($ETH) is shifting. While it has faced some volatility in recent days, signs of a potential rebound are emerging. For crypto traders, a bullish Ethereum could have widespread implications, particularly for Ethereum-based tokens. Maxi Doge ($MAXI), which is currently in its presale phase, has raised over $3.9M, reflecting growing interest in the project. With a token price of $0.000267 and less than three days left before its next price increase, the project is gathering momentum. Ethereum’s Volatility and the Potential for a Rebound Ethereum’s market behavior over the past week has been a rollercoaster. Currently trading at around $3,325.60, $ETH has experienced a significant drop from its ATH of $4,953.73 in August. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that Ethereum’s price has dropped about 14% over the past week. Ethereum’s rebound near $3,500 yesterday sparked bullishness among traders. But crypto research firm Santiment added that the true buy signal could be when traders ‘slow their expectations of a quick return to $4K,’ and when ‘bullish sentiment calms down again.’ Despite the dip, the long-term prospects of the market’s second-largest crypto remain bullish. When $ETH does finally make a comeback, it would positively impact tokens built on its network, including Maxi Doge. The reason is that a stronger $ETH price signals overall market confidence, which can translate into increased interest in Ethereum-based projects like Maxi Doge. Maxi Doge’s Presale Gains Traction, Nears $4M Raised Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has quickly become a notable player in the meme coin market, raising over $3.9M in its presale. With less than three days before the next price increase, investors are clearly feeling the pressure to secure their $MAXI tokens at the current price of $0.000267. 💡 Want to grab $MAXI tokens?

This dollar strength comes at a critical juncture for forex trading enthusiasts who need to understand how economic indicators are reshaping currency markets worldwide. What’s Driving the Dollar Strength in Current Markets? The greenback’s recent upward trajectory reflects growing market anticipation around key labor market data releases. Currency markets are particularly sensitive to employment figures because they directly influence Federal Reserve policy decisions. The current dollar strength suggests traders are positioning for potentially hawkish signals from upcoming economic indicators. Why Labor Market Data Matters for Forex Trading Labor market data serves as one of the most reliable economic indicators for currency direction. Strong employment numbers typically boost the dollar by increasing the likelihood of interest rate hikes. Here’s what every forex trader should watch: Non-farm payroll numbers and revisions Unemployment rate trends Average hourly earnings growth Labor force participation rates Key Economic Indicators Shaping Currency Markets Beyond labor statistics, several other economic indicators are influencing dollar movements. Inflation data, GDP growth figures, and manufacturing indexes all contribute to the complex puzzle of currency valuation. The interplay between these factors creates both challenges and opportunities in forex trading. Indicator Current Impact Market Expectation Non-Farm Payrolls High 200K+ jobs added Unemployment Rate Medium-High 3.6-3.8% range Wage Growth High 4.3% year-over-year How Forex Trading Strategies Adapt to Data Releases Successful forex trading during data-heavy periods requires careful risk management and strategic positioning. The volatility surrounding labor market data releases can create significant profit opportunities but also substantial risks. Traders should consider position sizing, stop-loss orders, and diversification across currency pairs. What Does This Mean for Global Currency Markets? The dollar strength we’re witnessing has ripple effects across all major currency pairs. EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY are particularly sensitive to US economic data surprises. As labor market data takes center stage, traders should monitor correlations and prepare for potential breakout scenarios. The convergence of dollar strength and critical labor market data creates a pivotal moment for currency markets. Understanding these economic indicators and their impact on forex trading is essential for navigating the current volatility. The coming data releases will likely determine whether the dollar’s upward momentum continues or faces significant resistance. Frequently Asked Questions Which organizations release key labor market data? The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases monthly employment reports, while the Federal Reserve analyzes this data for monetary policy decisions. How does Jerome Powell view labor market data? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell frequently emphasizes the importance of labor market conditions in setting interest rate policy. Which major banks provide forex trading analysis? Institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase regularly publish research on how economic data affects currency markets.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading that shift, preparing for a synchronized platform launch and token listing. This dual rollout will introduce a working DeFi platform right from the start — a rare move in today’s market. Many presale projects promise future use cases, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to deliver functionality and liquidity together. With its hybrid lending structure, stablecoin innovation, and buyback-backed staking model, it stands as one of the strongest DeFi launches in 2025. This foundation is why investors are already calling MUTM the next crypto to hit $1 after its debut. Presale Momentum and the Road to Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, and demand keeps rising. The total token supply stands at four billion, with $18.5 million already raised. The current phase is priced at $0.035 and is 87% sold out from its 170 million allocation. The next stage will lift the price to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. Over 17,800 holders have joined the presale so far, showing strong community traction before the official launch. Phase 6 is closing fast, and this will be the last discounted entry at this certain price before the token begins trading on exchanges. Large investors are already securing positions, knowing that both the protocol launch and the listing will happen side by side. Direct card payments are now active, allowing instant confirmation and unlimited purchases — a move that simplifies participation for retail and institutional buyers alike. Mutuum’s ability to blend accessibility with strong fundamentals makes it one of the most promising defi crypto projects of this year. The Power Behind Mutuum’s V1 Protocol What makes Mutuum stand out is its dual lending design. It combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending for mainstream tokens like BTC, and USDT, with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending for higher-risk or emerging tokens. P2C provides predictable returns through variable interest rates tied to pool activity, while P2P offers flexible agreements for borrowers and lenders. Every loan will be overcollateralized and tracked using Chainlink-based oracles to ensure accurate pricing and liquidation safety. This combination delivers both stability and adaptability — a structure built to serve whales, institutions, and individual users alike. The V1 rollout of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet, planned for Q4 2025, will introduce real functionality from day one. It will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, Debt Tokens, Liquidator Bot, and a live analytics dashboard. Lending and borrowing will begin with ETH and USDT as base assets, setting up the platform for fast expansion across chains. This launch strategy will make sure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the market with a functioning product — not a waiting period. Analysts expect this approach to attract immediate Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchange interest since exchanges favor tokens with working ecosystems and active liquidity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to use its protocol-generated revenue to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. The repurchased tokens will be redistributed to mtToken stakers as periodic rewards. The more lending and borrowing occur on the platform, the greater the reward cycles will become. This buy-and-distribute system aligns user earnings directly with actual platform activity, ensuring that growth benefits the entire community. The Final Call Before Momentum Takes Over Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not chasing attention — it is building functionality that investors can see and use. With its verified audits, working protocol, and synchronized launch strategy, it is set to emerge as a serious contender among top DeFi crypto platforms. Phase 6 is already 87% complete, and the next stage will raise the entry price by 15%. Smart investors have already started accumulating MUTM tokens as wait may cost you around 15%. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway will reward ten early participants with $10,000 each in MUTM tokens, celebrating the project’s growing global support. Every sign points toward a strong debut. Forget SHIB — the DeFi spotlight is shifting toward projects that deliver utility and sustainable yield. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to become the next crypto to hit $1, setting a new benchmark for value-driven innovation.

54127625,623304,1762509640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54127625.jpeg,Is A Ripple IPO Coming? Garlinghouse Shares New Insights,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ipo-coming-garlinghouse-new-insights/,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse used an on-stage conversation with Dan Morehead at Pantera’s Blockchain Summit 2025 to push back—again—on the notion that Ripple needs to list anytime soon, even as the company leans into aggressive buybacks, fresh capital, and M&A. The recording of the discussion was posted by Pantera on X on November 6. Is A Ripple IPO Coming? Pressed by Pantera on shareholder liquidity and tender offers, Garlinghouse disclosed the scale and cadence of Ripple’s private-market strategy. “We’ve actually repurchased over 25 percent of the company. We’ve spent $4 billion buying shares back from our shareholders,” he said, adding that “just yesterday [we] closed another billion dollar tender offer, valuing Ripple at about 40 billion dollars.” He framed the approach as deliberately avoiding the need for a listing: “We haven’t needed to go public, and so we haven’t prioritized that… the way we kind of solve the shareholder liquidity problem is by just buying back shares at increasingly higher prices. I mean, to some degree, SpaceX has been doing that.” The $40 billion private valuation Garlinghouse cited lines up with recent disclosures around Ripple’s capital moves this week. On November 5, Ripple disclosed a new $500 million investment at a $40 billion valuation and referenced the earlier $1 billion tender at the same mark—underscoring that private bids are coalescing near that level. Garlinghouse also argued that public markets have become more receptive to crypto issuers, calling Circle’s 2025 listing a watershed moment. “Obviously, the window’s open. I will say as a very positive thing, I think a watershed moment for the crypto industry was the Circle IPO . People were worried about how that was going because it was during the tariff liberation day event, and the public markets weren’t sure, and to see how oversubscribed it was and see how, and even now, I think it’s a $35 billion company. I think that is phenomenal for crypto broadly,” Garlinghouse said. Meanwhile, he acknowledged that not every crypto IPO will get the same traction. “Obviously, some of the other ones have gone public, whether it’s Bullish or Gemini, you know, haven’t gone quite as, I mean, they’ve done well, but not quite as well.” The CEO’s message on Ripple’s own path was unequivocal: “We’re not in a hurry [to go public]… today we have, you know, just shy of $4 billion on the balance sheet. And so we’re not in a hurry to go public. And we feel like we can play offense from an M&A point of view and continue to stay private… At some point, I would imagine we’ll knock on the public market’s door, but that’s not today.” Conviction Compounds. @Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse joined @dan_pantera at Pantera Blockchain Summit 2025 to reflect on crypto’s beginnings and how the industry adapted through every cycle. 00:10 Crypto’s First Decade02:17 Contrasting Money over IP and Voice over IP04:19 XRP ≠… pic.twitter.com/SwMbeKnid8 — Pantera Capital (@PanteraCapital) November 6, 2025 If the CEO’s posture leaves little oxygen for IPO speculation, Ripple’s president Monica Long removed any ambiguity during Swell in New York. Speaking to Bloomberg, Long said: “We do not have an IPO timeline. No plan, no timeline.” In a separate CNBC interview, she framed the rationale in balance-sheet terms: “We are not focused on an IPO right now. We have the balance sheet, the liquidity to be growing and making moves on M&A and other big strategic partnerships.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.22.",XRP|ripple|Ripple IPO news|ripple news|XRP price,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 10:00:40

Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers appeared in a federal appeals court in New York on Tuesday to appeal the ex-FTX head’s 2023 conviction on seven criminal charges, including fraud and conspiracy tied to the collapse of his crypto empire. Attorney Alexandra Shapiro, representing the 33-year-old former crypto executive, argued before a three-judge panel at the 2nd Circuit US Court of Appeals that Bankman-Fried’s trial was “fundamentally unfair.” Shapiro claimed that presiding judge Lewis Kaplan, “repeatedly put a thumb on the scale to help the government and thwart the defense.” Late Thursday, the handler of Bankman-Fried’s official X account published a statement quoting the disgraced crypto founder’s response to paraphrased comments made by FTX’s current CEO, John J. Ray III. “I’m not saying FTX’s solvency or the Debtors’ mismanagement are the reasons I’m innocent (although it’s a piece of the story!). But the Debtors are still withholding funds—see, e.g., Mr. Ji’s fight for Chinese creditors, and this needs more attention,” Bankman-Fried was quoted saying. [SBF says:] I don't quite agree with every point—but, yeah, this is basically what happened. I'm not saying FTX's solvency or the Debtors' mismanagement are the reasons I'm innocent (although it's a piece of the story!). But the Debtors are still withholding funds—see, e.g.,… https://t.co/MGcqjebNpz — SBF (@SBF_FTX) November 6, 2025 Responding to the ex-FTX head’s commentary, blockchain security sleuth ZachXBT replied : “Riddle me about the $40M transfer to Chinese authorities you hid from the public?” He attached an X post from 2023 that linked one of FTX’s wallets to a $40 million transaction purportedly used to bribe Chinese officials. ZachXBT queries SBF on $40 million bribe allegations The 2D investigator’s post referenced findings of crypto trader and on-chain analyst DefiSquared, who said he had traced suspicious transfers involving FTX-linked wallets. “Was looking into the Multichain exploiter address tonight and following the money trail,” he wrote in August 2023. “Where did it lead me? To the $40 million bribe that SBF is accused of bribing the Chinese government with.” Defisquared’s X thread noted that the tagged Multichain exploiter address, 0x622e5, had sent over 1,000 WBTC to a new wallet, 0x3c74b, which later converted the funds to USDT through Gate.io. Okay, here's some *wild* onchain investigation. Was looking into the Multichain exploiter address tonight and following the money trail. Where did it lead me? To the $40 million bribe that SBF is accused of bribing the Chinese government with 🤯 Check it out: To start, the… pic.twitter.com/SebSnxUWmE — DeFi^2 (@DefiSquared) August 1, 2023 The wallet reportedly used deposit address 0x96345 to launder the funds, receiving inflows from several addresses including 0x24f42, which in November 2021 had received a $40 million USDT transfer from FTX. “Weird transaction, right? Well, not when you remember that SBF is currently being accused of bribing the Chinese Government exactly $40 million ‘in or around November 2021.’” During Bankman-Fried’s 2023 trial, US federal prosecutors alleged that the FTX founder and his associates arranged the multimillion-dollar payment to unfreeze accounts belonging to Alameda Research on Chinese exchanges. The accounts reportedly contained around $1 billion worth of crypto that had been locked as a result of an ongoing investigation in China. According to the indictment, Bankman-Fried and his team “considered and tried numerous methods to unfreeze the accounts,” including legal appeals and personal outreach. When those efforts failed, he “agreed to and directed a multimillion-dollar bribe” to Chinese officials to regain access to the funds. Prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried of siphoning billions of dollars in customer funds from FTX to prop up Alameda Research. A Manhattan jury found him guilty after less than five hours of deliberation, which made defense lawyers adamant that the decision was hurried. Despite testifying in his own defense, Bankman-Fried was convicted on all seven counts. SBF attorneys ask for a second chance in appeals court Bankman-Fried’s lawyers insist the trial’s atmosphere and Kaplan’s conduct deprived him of due process. They contend that prosecutors presented oversimplified evidence that unfairly made their client appear “intentionally deceitful.” Shapiro, his lead attorney, said in court that the government’s case “relied heavily on emotion rather than evidence,” propounding that Bankman-Fried’s decisions were “the product of chaos, not corruption.” According to the appeal brief, Bankman-Fried’s team is asking for a new trial before a different judge because Kaplan’s conduct during proceedings prejudiced the jury. The defense cited instances where Kaplan “ridiculed Bankman-Fried and referred to the former FTX executive’s claim that he no longer ran Alameda Research after stepping down as CEO as “a joke.” Claim your free seat in an exclusive crypto trading community - limited to 1,000 members.",News|Alameda Research|Binance|CNY|FTX|USD,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ZRX|RESEARCH|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-07 10:00:43

Related Reading: Web3 Verifiable Settlement Protocol To Bring ‘Internet-Speed’ Payments With New Upgrade Stablecoins Overtake Part Of BTC’s Role On Thursday, Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, joined CNBC’s “Squawk Box” to discuss Bitcoin’s price, her thoughts on stablecoins’ growth, and how her previous bullish forecast for the flagship crypto has evolved over the past year. In the interview, Wood underscored that the rapid rise of stablecoins is taking on a role she thought BTC would handle, leading to a 20% reduction of her $1.5 million prediction by 2030. It’s worth noting that the investment management firm has previously affirmed that the leading cryptocurrency could serve as a store of value and a global settlement system. “Stablecoins are usurping part of the role that we thought bitcoin would play,” Wood affirmed on Thursday morning. “Given what’s happening to stablecoins, which are serving emerging markets in a way that we thought bitcoin would, I think we could take maybe $300,000 off of that bullish case just for stablecoins.” “Emerging markets are huge in this regard,” she said, adding that “we’re starting to see institutions in the United States focused on new payment rails, with stablecoins at the core. So very interesting movement.” Notably, the sector has seen rapid adoption following the enactment of the GENIUS Act in the US, with other leading jurisdictions, including the UK and South Korea, pushing to establish their own regulatory framework in the coming months. Similarly, multiple leading companies in the traditional payment system are preparing strategic moves into the stablecoin sector. Last week, the global financial services company Western Union announced its plan to launch the US Dollar Payment Token (USDPT) on the Solana blockchain. To Wood, “Stablecoins are scaling here much faster than anyone would have expected,” making it a space to watch in the future. Wood Is Still Bullish On Bitcoin Despite recalibrating her 2030 bull case, Ark Invest’s CEO emphasized that she remains bullish on Bitcoin, noting that growing institutional adoption will be a powerful driver for long-term value. Currently, the flagship cryptocurrency has declined 20% from its October 6 all-time high (ATH) of $126,000, briefly falling below the $100,000 mark earlier this week. Nonetheless, most market analysts and investors remain bullish on BTC’s long-term performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes ‘Moment Of Truth’ As Price Retests $100,000 Support – Is The Rally Over? Wood highlighted that “Bitcoin is a global monetary system, it is the lead in a new asset class, and it’s a technology, all wrapped in one.” She added that institutional participation in the sector has only begun, stating, “Institutions really have just dipped their toes into this space. We have just started, so we have a long way to go.” The CEO closed her observations by affirming that the broader crypto ecosystem is expanding, not contracting. “I think the whole space gets bigger,” she concluded.

This point was presented in the latest SBI Group results materials, shared and examined by crypto researcher SMQKE. The documents emphasize that Ripple’s valuation remains off-book in certain segments of SBI’s reporting until a definitive corporate valuation is clarified. SBI: XRP’S TRUE VALUE WILL BE REVEALED AFTER THE RIPPLE IPO https://t.co/RBxgDaIzDm pic.twitter.com/8WPf6oYq1h — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 5, 2025 Ripple’s Business Activities and RLUSD Development The presentation reiterates Ripple’s role in international payments, including the use of XRP within remittance corridors and financial institutions that have adopted the solution across multiple regions. SBI highlights previous collaborative developments, such as SBI Ripple Asia and the introduction of domestic remittance services in Japan using XRP in 2021. The materials also reference RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin issued under a trust license. SBI indicates that RLUSD is intended to be used as collateral and within various financial applications, including integrations under discussion with SBI VC Trade. The presentation includes a chart of XRP’s price increase over the past year. However, SBI clarifies that the unrealized valuation of the Ripple stake, which includes XRP held in escrow by Ripple Labs Inc. , will not be recognized in current financial statements until an IPO or other formal valuation event occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reactions from Commentators Responses to SMQKE’s post reflect differing viewpoints regarding the prospect of Ripple pursuing a public listing. One user, Evolve Religion, argues that Ripple does not require an IPO and that remaining private would allow the company to maintain tighter control without external shareholder influence. Another user, Art Work, noted that XRP was not created by Ripple and referenced past comments from leadership indicating that Ripple did not need to pursue a public listing. Context on IPO Statements While speculation around a Ripple IPO has circulated for several years, it remains a subject of public interest. In a Times Tabloid report dated April 19, 2025, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated at the CfC St. Moritz conference that Ripple has no plans to pursue an IPO in 2025. His remarks align with previous messaging that the company is not dependent on public-market fundraising to support its operations or strategic activities. SBI’s presentation reinforces the position that the financial impact of its Ripple stake may remain understated until Ripple undergoes a valuation-defining event. The documents, however, do not confirm that such an event is planned. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here Are the Details…,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-probable-launch-date-for-spot-dogecoin-doge-etfs-has-been-announced-here-are-the-details/,"A landmark event occurred in the US last week. While there was no explicit SEC approval at this point, the Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs began trading. While Solana has had a good run, the performance of the LTC and HBAR ETFs has paled in comparison to the SOL ETF. Although the government shutdown in the US lasts longer than expected, it is stated that the next ETFs to start trading will be XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE). At this point, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that Bitwise has filed an 8(a) form for its Spot Dogecoin ETF. Form 8(a) is an automatic validation application filed with U.S. securities exchanges that automatically grants approval for listing of an ETF unless the SEC intervenes within 20 days, i.e., explicitly delays/denies it. Accordingly, Eric Balchunas said that the Bitwise Dogecoin spot ETF could start trading within 20 days. “Bitwise appears to be conducting an '8(a) procedure' for its spot Dogecoin ETF. This means it will come into effect in approximately 20 days unless there is a separate intervention.” As you may recall, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg also recently pointed to next week for the launch of XRP ETFs. “We are ready to launch the XRP ETF next week,” said the famous CEO.

This innovative upgrade represents a significant leap forward for DeFi enthusiasts seeking to maximize their crypto assets while maintaining security and earning potential. What Makes Smart Lending 2.0 So Revolutionary? Lista DAO’s latest innovation transforms how users interact with decentralized finance. The Smart Lending 2.0 protocol introduces a multi-functional approach that lets you leverage your collateral in unprecedented ways. Instead of letting your assets sit idle, this system activates them across multiple revenue streams simultaneously. The protocol’s core functionality centers around three key benefits. First, users can secure immediate liquidity on various decentralized exchanges. Second, the system supports loan operations without compromising asset security. Third, participants automatically generate swap fees through integrated mechanisms. How Does Smart Lending 2.0 Actually Work? Imagine your collateral working overtime for you. The Smart Lending 2.0 system creates a seamless ecosystem where your locked assets serve multiple purposes at once. Your collateral becomes an active participant in the DeFi space rather than just sitting in a vault. Multi-purpose collateral utilization – Your assets secure loans while generating additional income Automatic fee generation – Earn swap fees without manual intervention Enhanced liquidity access – Instant access to funds across multiple DEX platforms Why Should DeFi Users Care About This Upgrade? The introduction of Smart Lending 2.0 addresses several pain points that have long challenged DeFi participants. Traditional lending protocols often force users to choose between security and profitability. This new approach eliminates that compromise by integrating both aspects seamlessly. Moreover, the system’s design prioritizes user experience. Complex financial operations happen automatically in the background. This means even newcomers to decentralized finance can benefit from advanced strategies that were previously accessible only to experienced traders. What Challenges Does Smart Lending 2.0 Solve? Previous DeFi lending models often suffered from capital inefficiency. Assets remained underutilized while locked as collateral. The Smart Lending 2.0 protocol changes this dynamic completely by activating dormant value within the ecosystem. Another significant improvement involves risk management. The over-collateralized nature of lisUSD stablecoin provides inherent security, while the new features add revenue-generating capabilities. This combination creates a more robust financial environment for all participants. Real-World Applications of Smart Lending 2.0 Consider a cryptocurrency holder who wants to access liquidity without selling their assets. With Smart Lending 2.0, they can use their holdings as collateral, obtain liquidity for other investments, and simultaneously earn fees from swap operations. This creates a virtuous cycle of asset utilization. The protocol also benefits liquidity providers and traders who need flexible access to funds. By integrating multiple DeFi functions into a single platform, users save time and reduce transaction costs associated with moving between different protocols. The Future Impact on DeFi Ecosystem Lista DAO’s Smart Lending 2.0 launch signals a new era for decentralized finance. As more protocols adopt similar multi-functional approaches, we can expect increased capital efficiency across the entire ecosystem. This innovation could set new standards for how DeFi platforms operate. The integration of lending, liquidity provision, and fee generation within a single protocol demonstrates the maturing nature of decentralized finance. Such developments make DeFi more accessible and profitable for mainstream adoption. Conclusion: A New Chapter in DeFi Innovation Smart Lending 2.0 represents a significant milestone in decentralized finance evolution. By combining multiple revenue streams with enhanced security features, Lista DAO has created a protocol that benefits both novice and experienced DeFi users. The ability to leverage collateral for liquidity while earning additional income marks a substantial improvement over traditional lending models. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, innovations like Smart Lending 2.0 will likely become standard features across platforms. This launch not only benefits current Lista DAO users but also pushes the entire industry toward more efficient and user-friendly solutions. Frequently Asked Questions What is Smart Lending 2.0? Smart Lending 2.0 is Lista DAO’s upgraded protocol that allows users to use collateral for multiple purposes simultaneously, including securing liquidity, supporting loans, and generating swap fees. How does Smart Lending 2.0 differ from traditional DeFi lending? Unlike traditional models where collateral remains inactive, Smart Lending 2.0 activates your assets across multiple revenue streams while maintaining security through over-collateralization. Is Smart Lending 2.0 safe to use? The protocol maintains security through over-collateralization of the lisUSD stablecoin, providing a safety buffer while enabling additional functionality. Can beginners use Smart Lending 2.0 effectively? Yes, the system automates complex operations, making advanced DeFi strategies accessible to users with varying experience levels. What assets can I use as collateral? The protocol supports various cryptocurrencies that can be used as collateral, though specific supported assets may vary based on platform requirements. How quickly can I access liquidity through Smart Lending 2.0? The system provides immediate liquidity access on integrated decentralized exchanges once collateral is properly configured.

54129439,623707,1762514008,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54129439.jpeg,Cathie Wood Says Stablecoins Are on the Rise: Best Wallet Token Could Be the Best Crypto to Watch,https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-stablecoins-rise-best-wallet-token-best-crypto-to-watch/,"Quick Facts: Stablecoins are emerging as a reliable on-ramp for investors seeking the benefits of crypto without the volatility typically associated with traditional assets. The rise of stablecoins signals a broader shift toward mainstream adoption of digital assets. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) taps into this demand by offering a user-friendly platform that simplifies crypto onboarding. With its presale raising over $16.87M, $BEST has already captured strong investor interest in this promising solution. Cathie Wood recently adjusted her Bitcoin price prediction for 2030, signaling a shift in long-term cryptocurrency outlooks. The ARK Invest CEO recently revised her bull-case price target for Bitcoin in 2030 down from about $1.5M to $1.2M, a reduction of ~$300K. Stablecoins are taking center stage, Wood told CNBC , and explained that the change stems from the rapid rise of stablecoins in emerging markets. Such assets are now taking on roles like unit of account or store of value, which she previously assumed Bitcoin would fulfil. In other words, while Bitcoin continues to be the ‘digital gold,’ its upside is being tempered by competition from other assets. This trend could redefine the crypto landscape for both long-term investors and new entrants. While Bitcoin’s short-term price trajectory remains uncertain, stablecoins are drawing attention as a cornerstone for mainstream adoption. The stability they offer, particularly in comparison to the volatility of traditional cryptocurrencies, is a trend that emerging utility projects with user-friendly onramps and wallets stand to benefit from. In fact, solutions like Best Wallet are already building tools to capitalize on the increasing demand for secure, accessible crypto services. With the Best Wallet Token presale raising over $16.87M, this project is positioning itself as a major player in this emerging market niche, offering a unique gateway for both crypto novices and seasoned traders alike. And with analysts pointing to altcoins as a smart potential buy in recent months, Best Wallet Token could join the crowd as one of the best coins to watch . Stablecoins and the Crypto Shift: Best Wallet Builds for a New Era Cathie Wood’s new Bitcoin prediction highlights a broader market trend where the hype around $BTC, although still significant, faces increased competition from alternative assets like stablecoins. These digital currencies, pegged to traditional fiat currencies, offer the best of both worlds: the security of traditional money and the flexibility of blockchain technology. As the crypto market pivots in this direction while onboarding new users, analysts are turning their attention to solutions that offer stability while still enabling people to tap into the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi). Stablecoins, which represent a significant portion of the overall crypto market, offer a way to hedge against the high volatility seen in assets like Bitcoin. This is a dynamic change that could appeal to a new wave of investors who are cautious but still want exposure to crypto tech. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is among the emerging projects capitalizing on this shift. This is a utility token with an app designed to onboard users into the crypto ecosystem while giving a user-friendly experience and effortless secret key security from Fireblocks . Its Best Wallet app has successfully onboarded close to 1M people across Android and iOS devices since launching in 2024. Throughout 2025, the development team behind the app has expanded blockchain support to Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BSC, Base, and Polygon, making Best Wallet a multi-chain hub that supports hundreds of crypto assets and major stablecoins. Today, the app makes crypto easy and convenient for new adopters, with a convenient on/offramp system to buy crypto directly from the wallet, and additional DeFi features like DEX swaps and a presale launchpad to navigate the decentralized crypto market. Looking ahead, future project goals include the integration of 50+ more blockchains, NFT management, a staking aggregator, and the launch of a crypto debit card to use for regular purchases. This crypto guide to Best Wallet Token covers the roadmap and project features in more detail. See Best Wallet’s project on its website. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Revolutionizing the Crypto Gateway Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers the Best Wallet app and ecosystem, which makes it an integral to the growing world of stablecoin transactions. Although currently on presale, this coin isn’t simply fundraising for the wallet’s development. It will give real utility to holders by reducing in-app fees, granting governance rights, and enabling higher staking yield and cashback rewards for Best card users. The presale’s performance is proof enough that investors are here for the project. With over $16.87M raised to date and several whale buys (like this $70.2K transaction ), we see growing confidence and demand for Best Wallet’s innovative approach to crypto onboarding. At a current price of $0.025905, the token presents an accessible entry point for early adopters looking to get full ecosystem perks. Price scenarios for $BEST token also show considerable upside potential in late 2025. This includes a 177% potential peak following the end of the presale on November 28. As the wallet continues to add major blockchains and introduce new DeFi features, $BEST’s utility and value could increase significantly alongside its ecosystem. With analysts increasingly pointing to altcoins as potential growth assets, Best Wallet’s position as a user-centric solution within the stablecoin and DeFi spaces further enhances its long-term price potential. Given the increasing adoption of stablecoins and the wallet’s roadmap, $BEST could emerge as a key player following its token listing and roadmap progress. Check $BEST token before the presale ends.

In a statement, Yasuyuki Fukuda, the chief portfolio manager of Nomura Asset Management’s Japanese Information Electronics equity fund, confirmed that the AI market is just entering its second act and is not in a bubble stage. Still, concerns have been raised about the increased adoption of AI globally, which has pushed Nvidia’s market value to surpass the $5 trillion mark. This is the highest level any company has ever reached in history. Notably, Nvidia is a significant US-based chip firm. On the other hand, with seven big tech firms now accounting for more than one-third of the S&P 500 index, investors are questioning whether this indicates overheating and suggests a possible burst of an asset bubble. Fukuda asserts that the AI market is not in a bubble stage Still, Fukuda maintains that the AI sector is not exhibiting bubble-like behavior. Under his leadership , the Nomura fund has performed exceptionally well, achieving a total return of approximately 49% as of November 6. Contrastingly, the Topix index achieved a total return of 22%, while the Topix Electric Appliances Index returned 30% during the same period. Interestingly, sources noted that the fund’s performance surpassed that of the US Nasdaq Composite Index. Following this accomplishment, Fukuda commented on the matter. He acknowledged that the current technology stock environment differs from the dot-com crash 25 years ago, when he examined tech stocks from Europe and America. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that firms that invested in telecommunications network infrastructure in the past were mainly startups that were not generating profits or cash flow. This situation made it difficult for such firms to raise funds, leading to a market crash. In contrast to the past, the present-day world enables large companies with substantial financial resources, such as Google, Amazon, and Meta, to invest in the sector. As a result, these companies help to establish a more stable infrastructure. Regarding AI growth, Fukuda revealed that investing in cloud computing systems and data centers marks the “first act” of a great story about the growth of AI. Therefore, according to him, the next phase will occur because traditional infrastructure companies, such as those in the power utilities and telecommunications sectors, will invest more. Analysts noted that this trend will greatly benefit Japanese firms that manufacture electronic components, such as Furukawa Electric Co. On the other hand, since managing the portfolio in April 2011, Fukuda has increased the fund’s assets from ¥7.2 billion to ¥83.3 billion by the end of October. His efforts have positioned the fund as Japan’s largest electronics-focused investment fund. Fukuda raises concerns about Japan’s recent performance In September, top holdings included Fujikura Ltd., Sony Group Corp., SoftBank Group Corp. , Tokyo Electron Ltd, and Furukawa Electric Co. Fukuda admitted that among the best moves he made was to increase the fund’s stake in SoftBank Group in May 2024, when the share price was under ¥10,000. He explained that the stock hit an all-time closing high of more than ¥27,000 on October 29 but dropped to ¥21,300. SoftBank Group holds a significant stake in Arm Holdings Plc, a UK-based semiconductor design company that develops processors for AI computing. Moreover, the company is involved in OpenAI’s Stargate initiative and plans to invest as much as $550 billion into the US as part of a trade deal with Donald Trump. However, Fukuda warned that while a broad rally across the stock market would be beneficial, if gains come from just a few stocks, such as those in the US S&P 500 Index, they could be at risk. He also pointed out that Japan’s recent performance has been troubling, noting that a few companies, such as SoftBank Group Inc., Advantest Corp., and Fast Retailing Co., were responsible for the majority of the increases in the Nikkei 225 over the past few months.

This remarkable price movement raises questions about whether ZEC is entering a new phase of heightened interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Could this be the beginning of a broader trend? The article explores which other coins might be poised for growth in the evolving crypto landscape. Zcash Surges as Bulls Eye New Peaks Source: tradingview Zcash is catching eyes with an impressive rally, showcasing strong upward momentum. Its price has jumped by more than 80% in just a week, skyrocketing nearly 400% over the month. Currently, Zcash fluctuates between around $330 and $480. If bullish trends continue, it could test a resistance level at approximately $540, marking a potential climb nearing 13%. Longer term, a drive beyond $690 isn’t off the table, which would represent a significant percentage leap. With Zcash's recent performance and current bullish indicators, the crypto is positioned for possible continued growth, albeit with some volatility given past swings. Conclusion ZEC's recent surge past $600 signals a potential revival in interest around privacy-focused coins. This milestone, the first since 2018, suggests growing confidence in privacy technologies. As more users and investors prioritize transaction privacy, ZEC might see continued attention. The coin's performance may inspire renewed interest in other privacy coins, highlighting a key emerging theme in the market. This surge could mark the beginning of a new cycle, positioning ZEC as a notable contender once again. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Fetch.AI (FET) has surged by 22% this week, sparking curiosity and hope. Could this be a sign of the artificial intelligence narrative making a comeback? This article explores whether FET's rise is a fleeting anomaly or the start of a broader AI-driven trend. FET Shows Promise Amidst Price Rebound in the Crypto Market Source: tradingview The crypto coin Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) is currently trading between 22 to 28 cents. After a notable decline of over 54% in the past month, it has seen a minor rebound this week, edging up by about 6.6%. If FET breaks the 30-cent resistance mark, it may aim for the next target at 36 cents, which would be over a 28% potential increase from current levels. Strong support exists around 20 cents, shielding against significant drops. With the Simple Moving Average indicating stability and the RSI nearing overbought levels, FET's upward movement hints at optimism, but maintaining its momentum is crucial for long-term growth. Conclusion FET has surged by 22% this week, while other altcoins struggle. This performance may hint at a renewed interest in AI-related projects. The focus on AI advancements could be driving this growth. Investors might see potential in FET due to its unique positioning in the market. The recent gains could encourage more attention towards AI-themed assets, underscoring their possible relevance in the future of the crypto space.

Institutional interest in Bitcoin is also on the rise, which could drive higher prices and demand for related projects. Bitcoin Hyper offers a promising Bitcoin Layer 2 project and a token with a low entry price of just $0.013235. Bitcoin Hyper’s strong presale and strategic vision make it a promising crypto in the current market. In a moment that could prove pivotal for Bitcoin’s trajectory, more than 4.65M $BTC have recently changed hands, entering the portfolios of new holders. This shift has sparked a fresh wave of excitement across the crypto market, especially for Bitcoin, the OG crypto. This surge in activity has analysts speculating about the potential for price increases, especially as new holders begin to drive demand. With institutional interest growing at the same time and Bitcoin’s resilience on full display, some believe the asset is on the cusp of another major rally. As Bitcoin’s supply becomes increasingly concentrated in fewer hands, the question remains: can this momentum sustain itself, or is this simply the early stages of a larger bull run? Either way, the current environment is ripe for investors to explore promising projects within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. One such project that aligns with these shifting market conditions is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a presale that has captured attention due to its innovative Bitcoin Layer 2 solution and strong potential for growth. Read on to learn what Bitcoin Hyper is about . Bitcoin’s Changing Hands: A Sign of Things to Come? A recent post from analyst Checkmate on X has highlighted that 4.65M Bitcoin were sold to new holders , an indicator of renewed investor enthusiasm in the market. This shift is significant, not just because it represents a substantial volume of Bitcoin moving between addresses, but because it signals a new class of holders entering the scene. Dormant Bitcoin has essentially been brought back to life, and market participants are closely watching this liquidity shift. The effects of this movement are already being felt in the broader market. Historically, large shifts in Bitcoin’s holdings often precede significant price movements, whether up or down. The increased participation of fresh holders indicates a shift in the broader market’s appetite for crypto, which could mean higher demand for Bitcoin and related assets. One of the key drivers behind new retail buyers rushing in is the asset’s growing legitimacy, backed by interest from institutional investors who are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as both a store of value and a potential inflation hedge. Just look at Saylor’s Strategy – it has 641,205 Bitcoin , so around $64B in $BTC at the current market price. And Strategy is known for hoarding Bitcoin, but it’s far from the only company to do so. Currently, over 4.05M Bitcoin is in the treasuries of 100 top companies. This institutional demand, coupled with renewed enthusiasm among individual investors, could set the stage for Bitcoin to surpass its previous price highs, particularly as its supply becomes more concentrated. Against this backdrop, newer projects like Bitcoin Hyper may take advantage of the rising interest in Bitcoin and crypto as a whole, capitalizing on the growing investor attention. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Promising New Entrant Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an exciting project with a unique value proposition to investors: a full-blown Bitcoin-centered DeFi ecosystem, housed on a new Layer 2 (L2) chain. As a presale token, $HYPER has already raised an impressive $26.1M, signaling a strong level of confidence in its potential. The presale price is set at $0.013235, making it an affordable entry point for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Additionally, Bitcoin Hyper is offering staking rewards of 45%, which adds another layer of incentive for early investors. What sets Bitcoin Hyper apart is its innovative approach to upscaling Bitcoin with dApps, smart contracts, and vastly higher transaction speed. It uses a Canonical Bridge and a Solana Virtual machine to provide smart contracts and effortless programmability. By banking on these two tools, Bitcoin could finally get Solana-level speed and a playground to build NFT marketplaces, DAOs, DeFi protocls, and much more. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale presents a unique opportunity for early investors to get involved at a ground level, with the potential for substantial returns as the project continues to evolve. This $HYPER price prediction estimates a potential increase of 1,400% by the end of 2026, from the current $0.013235 to a $0.2 price point. If you’d like to join the presale, here’s how to buy $HYPER . Overall, Bitcoin Hyper is perfectly positioned to become the main narrative in Bitcoin’s future, especially as Bitcoin receives more attention from retail and institutional investors and network demands rise. A project that reduces the main network’s load and provides additional utility is one of the best bets moving forward. Join the $HYPER presale now.

The campaign is simple to participate in, with exceptional discounts and no entry requirements. Users who complete KYC verification and take margin loans or collateral swaps will enjoy real, tangible savings. Let us dive into the campaign for details. https://www.htx.com/support/35016819991657 Event 1: Enjoy Up to 30% Interest Rebate on USDT Loans To meet strong demand for stablecoin borrowing during market swings, HTX is launching tiered rebates for USDT loans. During the event, users who borrow USDT via HTX Margin or Collateral Swap (formerly Crypto Loans) will receive a rebate of up to 30% of the actual interest paid, based on cumulative borrowing volume. The specific rules are as follows: Borrow ≥10,000 USDT to receive a 10% rebate; Borrow ≥100,000 USDT to receive a 20% rebate; Borrow ≥1,000,000 USDT to win a 30% rebate. The more you borrow, the more you can save. With interest discounts of up to 30%, every loan becomes a low-cost opportunity to capture profits amid market volatility.

While there was a major crash in BTC and altcoins on October 11, this downward trend continues in November. Analysts are divided on their BTC predictions. Bitcoin’s ongoing correction has led to divided market predictions, with analysts predicting a drop to $56,000 while others see it as a healthy consolidation. At this point, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, claimed that Bitcoin’s recovery to the $100,000 level could be a sign of a significant correction towards $56,000. McGlone said historical chart patterns show that Bitcoin typically returns to its 48-month moving average after a rally. According to the analyst, if this trend repeats, BTC could drop to $56,000. While McGlone argued that Bitcoin could experience a deep correction, Glassnode argued that on-chain data points to a healthy correction rather than panic. Glassnode said it would be useful to look at the Relative Unrealized Loss metric, which currently measures total unrealized losses in US dollars relative to market capitalization. “Unlike the 2022-2023 bear market, the Relative Unrealized Loss metric is at 3.1%. This reading also suggests only moderate stress. This is similar to the medium-term corrections in Q3 and Q4 2024 and Q2 2025. As long as the rate remains below the 5% threshold, we believe there is no need to panic. As long as unrealized losses remain within this range, the market can be interpreted as going through a healthy correction rather than panic.” *This is not investment advice.

Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stated on November 7 that there is momentum to support digital payments in a country where credit cards and cash remain popular. FSA’s Katayama disclosed after a regular cabinet meeting that the banking arms of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), and Mizuho Financial Group (MFG) will jointly issue stablecoins . He pointed out that the stablecoins will be tested for cross-border payments after the FSA’s assessment and approval. The agency wants to confirm whether the service can be carried out legally and in an appropriate manner. The three megabanks, which reportedly have over 300,000 major business partners, unveiled their stablecoin ambition almost three weeks ago. They emphasized that the collaboration will help popularize stablecoins in Japan and create a common standard for cross-border payments and corporate clients. The Mitsubishi Corporation will pilot the first application. Megabanks prepare for yen-pegged stablecoin launch The three major banks have announced that they will soon launch a Japanese yen-backed stablecoin. The megabanks also disclosed that the stablecoin will maintain a 1:1 value redemption ratio. Meanwhile, they are considering a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin to help streamline international transactions. Japan recently revised its Payment Services Act, allowing licensed banks and trust companies to issue stablecoins fully backed by fiat currency. MUFG is expected to utilize its Progmat platform as the foundational building block for the issuance and management of the proposed stablecoin. Progmat was developed to support tokenized securities, but has since been enhanced to include stablecoin issuance features that align with Japan’s tight compliance standards. “Each country makes its own financial system resilient for its own sake…it is also in every country’s interest for other financial systems to remain resilient.” – Himino Ryozo , Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan The MUFG reportedly expects early adoption to focus on corporate clients, particularly exporters. Multinational supply chains and financial institutions with regular high-value transfers were also identified as early adopters. If successful, the technology could be expanded to wholesale lending markets and trade finance. The proposed stablecoin will function either as a complementary or parallel service, depending on the direction Japan’s future policy takes. Startup JPYC launches first-ever yen-backed stablecoin Startup JPYC launched the world’s first yen-pegged stablecoin last week, and it has backed it with domestic savings and Japanese government bonds. JPYC’s CEO, Noritaka Okabe, said his company aims to spur innovation by providing startups with access to low settlement and transaction fees. However, former Bank of Japan (BOJ) executive Tomoyuki Shimoda believes yen stablecoins will not enjoy the same momentum as those pegged to the U.S. dollar. Meanwhile, Japan’s market is reportedly attracting new stablecoin entrants as rules are clarified. SBI and Ripple are targeting the roll-out of RLUSD in Japan in early 2026. Japan Post Bank also announced plans to roll out a tokenized yen deposit, DCJPY, by fiscal 2026. The BOJ previously called for the adoption of stablecoins, emphasizing that these tokens can improve the cost and speed of payments. The BOJ also stated that stablecoins can reshape payments because they can transfer value at any time, almost instantly, and at a lower cost. However, the BOJ’s Deputy Governor Ryozo previously argued that global rules should welcome safe versions of these stablecoins and ensure risks are mitigated appropriately. He further cautioned that rules must keep pace with changes, adding that supervision must adapt as more non-bank players enter the financial space. Ryozo also emphasized that stablecoins may emerge as crucial in the global payments landscape, partially replacing the role of bank deposits. He added that regulators are doing a lot in these spheres, especially considering that political momentum has an expiry date. The deputy BOJ governor further believes that national authorities should show why implementing regulatory standards is in the best interest of the country. He said shortcutting domestic persuasion by justification based solely on commitments from the international community will not work. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

But fresh data suggest that when ETH nearly rebounded to $3,500 on Thursday, the crowd interpreted the move as a confirmation that the asset was “back in business.” ETH Trader FOMO Santiment warned that this sudden pivot is similar to the same pattern seen earlier in the week, when retail panic selling actually contributed to the rebound. Now, the rapid return of FOMO could similarly stall further upside. According to the analytics platform, prices have shown a tendency to move in the opposite direction of the crowd, and that more neutral sentiment phases have proven to be stronger buy signal environments than euphoric ones. Crypto trader Ted Pillows also noted that even though the altcoin is showing some rebound after this week’s sharp decline, the recovery lacks conviction. According to Pillows, the current move higher, though modest, is being driven largely by short positions being closed rather than new spot buyers stepping in. He added that Ethereum needs to reclaim the $3,600-$3,700 price range with meaningful inflows to establish strength and dismiss the risk of further downside. Without that confirmation, Pillows believes the odds still favor lower prices from here. Despite the near-term uncertainty, some traders say the bigger picture is still pointing toward a substantial upside scenario. For instance, crypto trader “Trader Tradigrade” said that ETH’s monthly chart is currently developing what he describes as a massive Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, with a potential price target of $14,000 once confirmed . “Wet Blanket” Phase As the crypto market remains sluggish, Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz believes that this could be due to long-term holders rebalancing their net worths and diversifying away from massive concentrated holdings after a very long bull market. Novogratz deems this to be a healthy sign in the medium and long term as these positions get distributed. In the short run, however, he said that “it’s a proverbial wet blanket” and has weighed on prices. He went on to add, “I do not think we have seen cycle highs.

Quick cross-border payment solutions drove adoption. Today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.035 mirrors exactly the above-mentioned sentiment with its organized DeFi lending strategy to attract 17,790 subscribers with a total raise of 18,450,000. This next crypto to explode combines the strength of momentum with the rewards of innovation, challenging traders to look for connections before takeoff. As the top crypto to invest in, it readies itself for large profitability with market changes. Historical Price Explosion Dominates Ripple News Traders can still vividly remember how XRP allowed them to turn small investments into enormous profits during the 2017 price explosion. Prices had dropped to just above $0.0063 at the beginning of 2017 before exploding to above $0.40 in May. The price topped at a staggering $3.40 in December. First movers made 53,800% profits. It did not take long to see if the high could be sustained as prices cooled to below $0.36 at the close of 2018. Mutuum Finance Increases Presale Campaign Pace Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves its presale to Phase 6 with 85% occupancy at a price of $0.035 per token. This crypto is up 250% from Phase 1’s price of $0.01 to match XRP’s launch trajectory. More than 770 million tokens are in circulation among supporters. Launch plan is to reach $0.06 with 414% ROI potential at the current investment price. Phase 6 barrels towards closeout, and trailblazers will soon experience the pain of exclusion as inventory dwindles. The image of catching tokens at this gateway price is short-lived as Phase 7 boosts 20% to $0.04—a painful price to pay for those who held back. Demand goes ballistic as spectators turn winners. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ignites participation with a dynamic leaderboard that tracks the top 50 holder participation. Daily leaderboard refreshes at 00:00 UTC ensure that scores remain new every day. Also, to add rivalry to this community initiative, the top participant receives $500 in MUTM rewards immediately after their first valid deal. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses double liquidity flows to generate seamless yields. Peer-to-Contract channels accept ETH or USDT deposits, auto-rewarding with interests as loans trigger. To add to this is the Peer-to-Peer corridors, which form specialized terms for less liquid assets. MT-tokens come out as reward coupons that can be claimed back with the capital. Thus, the next crypto to explode syncs deposits with growth. To fuel the pre-sale buzz, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced a giveaway prize of $100,000 , distributing awards of $10,000 to 10 lucky contestants through simple tasks. This is just another way to fuel participation rates because rewards trigger high engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also secures itself with a CertiK audit, garnering 90/100 on security measures. A $50,000 bug bounty hunt rewards $200 to $2,000 per discovered bug, adding layers to security before launch. This is what pulls the discerning funds to such initiatives. The 2017 explosion of XRP serves as a gentle nudge to not forget that the strongest crypto to invest in is one that is ignited by the promise of usage, and this is exactly what Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting with their lending innovations. The earliest actions bear the largest harvests. Invest in the next crypto to explode today.

On-chain data is showing that these long-term BTC holders are still experiencing notable gains from their positions . Long-Term BTC Holders’ Profit Margins Stay Impressive With volatility heightening across the broader crypto market, Bitcoin appears to be heading for another retest of the $100,000 price mark. Despite Bitcoin’s recent downward price action, one group remains firmly in the green zone. Specifically, the steady downward movement in the price of BTC has failed to shake long-term holders’ gains. In a recent X post, Darkfost, a CryptoQuant author and market expert, highlighted that long-term holders’ profit margins are still at a significant level. After examining the Bitcoin long-term Holders Realized Profit and Loss, the expert revealed that these key investors are currently realizing an average profit of about 188%. This tenacity highlights a well-known pattern in Bitcoin market cycles where seasoned holders typically accumulate during downturns, handle declines calmly, and frequently reap a profit during the following significant rise. On the other hand, Darkfost highlighted that this figure has been dropping and could encourage long-term holders to limit their selling in the hope of acquiring better gains in the future. The metric shows that these investors’ realized price is currently sitting just above the $35,000 mark. Darkfost has made a comparison between the market cycle and the past cycles . In contrast, data show that the realized earnings from the last two market peaks were 296% and 346%, respectively. Currently, the market appears to be far from these levels of profitability, which suggests that the bull cycle may still have room for growth. A Selling Pressure From Short-Term BTC Holders While long-term holders’ profitability still stands firm, short-term holders are now being forced to offload their holdings. As reported by Darkfost, these key investors appear to have gone on a selling spree following the ongoing market whirlwind. This behavior is displayed by the recent drop in the BTC Short-Term Holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metric . Data from the metric reveals a decline below 0.995, which signals that STHs are selling at a loss, reflecting growing fear and capitulation among recent BTC buyers. Although this action from STHs, which indicates a broadening shift in market sentiment, may appear as a negative development, there is also a positive side to these investors’ move. Darkfost noted that when short-term BTC holders start to capitulate , this is the time when good opportunities usually present themselves. The purpose of this preset alert is to find profitable BTC entry points, particularly for DCA tactics. However, the expert stated that the alert is also working effectively for short-term trading without providing exit indications. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price was hovering close to $102,000, demonstrating a nearly 2% decline in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has slightly recovered, as evidenced by a more than 15% increase within the same timeframe.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin long-term Holders Realized Profit and Loss|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin short-term holder SOPR|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|DCA|Spent Output Profit Ratio,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 11:30:48

Built on the Sui ecosystem, DeAgentAI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing artificial intelligence (AI) projects in the Web3 space, giving developers tools to deploy autonomous on-chain agents for decentralized automation. A breakout fueled by utility and speculation The explosive surge in DeAgentAI (AIA) price comes as traders pile into AI tokens despite a broader market downturn. Its partnership with Pieverse’s Timestamping Alliance allows AIA to be used for verifiable on-chain invoice payments, offering a tangible use case that boosts the token’s real-world relevance. The integration with Binance Wallet further strengthens accessibility, enabling seamless transactions and expanding AIA’s adoption base. These developments have created a wave of speculative demand, drawing both retail and institutional attention. Market data shows that AIA’s trading volume spiked 452% to over $262 million as the token hit an all-time high of $16.50. The surge also pushed its market capitalization to around $1.97 billion, placing it among the most-watched AI-driven cryptocurrencies of the week. Technical breakout and overheating signals The technical setup behind AIA’s rally has been equally dramatic. The token broke above key Fibonacci resistance levels, notably surpassing the 161.8% extension at $13.59 — a signal that often triggers algorithmic buying. The momentum carried prices past multiple resistance zones before peaking above $16, just below the $20 psychological barrier. However, the indicators suggest a potential cooldown ahead. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart spiked above 95, indicating extreme overbought conditions. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram remained firmly bullish at +0.43, confirming buyer dominance but also flashing warnings of overheating momentum. DeAgentAI price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap Adding to this, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator reveals slowing outflows but limited inflows, suggesting that while selling pressure has eased, strong capital inflows have yet to solidify. This lack of deep liquidity raises the risk of sharp corrections if momentum wanes. Can the DeAgentAI (AIA) price hold its gains? The next few days will be critical for DeAgentAI (AIA) price stability. Sustained momentum will depend on fresh inflows, growing on-chain activity, and measurable adoption from the Pieverse ecosystem. The combination of real-world utility, Binance Wallet integration, and sector-wide enthusiasm for AI-driven blockchain projects has positioned AIA as one of the most closely watched tokens in November 2025. Despite the crypto market’s fear gauge reading of 21, investor optimism around artificial intelligence (AI) and Web3 tokens has propelled AIA’s rally. Unlike many altcoins that move in sync with Bitcoin (BTC) , AIA has maintained a negative 0.60 correlation with BTC. This rare divergence allows it to perform independently, but also makes it prone to volatility without the stabilizing influence of Bitcoin’s liquidity cycles. If AIA sustains price action above $13.59, bulls could aim for the next resistance at $16.75, followed by potential extensions to $19.93 and even $30 in highly optimistic scenarios. However, a failure to hold above the $10.73 support zone could trigger a steep retracement, potentially sending prices toward $8.58 or even $5.00 as profit-taking intensifies.

Speaking to Bloomberg on Wednesday, Long reckoned that Ripple does not have an IPO roadmap and has no short-term intention to join other crypto companies going public. “We do not have an IPO timeline, no plan, no timeline,” she told the news publication during the company’s annual Swell conference in New York on Thursday. No IPO in the foreseeable future for Ripple, Long says Long reiterated that the San Francisco-based company is in a “fortunate position” to fund its operations and expansion internally. “We’ve been able to be very well capitalized and fund all of our organic growth, inorganic growth, strategic partnerships, anything we want to do,” she concluded. Ripple Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse has previously issued the same sentiments, repeating that the company has been flirting with the idea of a potential IPO, but has decided not to seek external investment. Yet, Cryptopolitan reported on Wednesday that Ripple had raised $500 million in a funding round valuing it at $40 billion. The round was led by Fortress Investment Group and Citadel Securities, together with Pantera Capital, Galaxy Digital, Brevan Howard, and Marshall Wace. Despite the sizable funding, Long made clear that Ripple is not under any financial pressure to pursue a listing. She declined to reveal 2024 revenue figures but said Ripple’s customer base doubled quarter over quarter, while Garlinghouse said the new funding was just a “cherry on top of a mountain of good news.” In 2022, the company’s chief executive had alluded that it might consider going public once its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came to a close. However, after the cross-border payment company made a settlement with the SEC, the CEO told reporters that listing on public markets was not a current priority. The 2012-founded San Francisco financial firm grew from a base blockchain payments startup to a global financial technology and stablecoin issuing company with services such as payment processing and asset custody to fintechs and large corporate clients. Ripple launched its own stablecoin RLUSD in December 2024, which has a nominal market capitalization of just above $1 billion. The company’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, is the fourth-largest digital asset in circulation, with a market value of roughly $133 billion. In the fiscal year 2025, the company acquired several business entities including prime broker Hidden Road for $1.25 billion, corporate treasury management platform GTreasury for $1 billion, and stablecoin infrastructure provider Rail for $200 million. “As we continue to build solutions towards enabling an Internet of Value, I’m reminding you all that XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does. Lock in,” wrote CEO Garlinghouse in an October update of the company’s operations on X. Crypto companies pursuing IPOs Several crypto firms have rushed to capitalize on the law changes made globally to support the digital asset service provision industry. Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, digital exchanges Bullish and Gemini, and blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions all completed public offerings this year. Kraken , one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, is also preparing to go public. Figure, co-founded in 2018 by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, completed its Nasdaq debut on September 11 under the ticker FIGR. The stock is trading at $35 a pop, 28.5% lower than its all-time high level $49, reached in early October. The New York-based firm reported $29.1 million in net income on $190.6 million in revenue in the first half of 2025, compared with a $15.6 million loss on $156 million revenue a year earlier. The blockchain-based credit technology developer has facilitated over $16 billion in loans since its debut in public exchanges. ConsenSys, the parent company of Ethereum wallet MetaMask, is also reportedly preparing an IPO. Sources told news publication Axios that the firm enlisted JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to lead the offering and has already raised more than $725 million in six funding rounds. Investors include SoftBank, BlackRock, Temasek, Mastercard, Coinbase, and HSBC.

This has prompted even some of the most optimistic analysts to change their tune on bitcoin, including Merlijn The Trader, who outlined a crucial warning sign that has led to numerous rejections in the past or even the start of a subsequent bear market. IT’S OVER FOR BITCOIN. SEE YOU ALL IN 4 YEARS. Same line. Same rejection. Every cycle looks unstoppable… until this line kills the momentum. This isn’t a breakdown yet.

The asset managed to remain within a six-digit price territory on Thursday, but it gave in minutes ago and dipped to $99,700 (on Bitstamp). This is the second such decline below the coveted $100,000 line this week after the Tuesday crash that pushed it to a five-month low of $99,000. Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the matter as well, suggesting that if the $100,000 support fails to hold, the cryptocurrency could probably go to [the] low $90ks minimium.” Naturally, the altcoins have followed suit with notable price declines. Ethereum is down by over 5% in the past day and is close to breaking below $3,200 once again. XRP has plunged beneath the $2.20 support after a similar daily drop. SOL, WBT, and HYPE have experienced identical corrections. These volatile price moves have harmed over-leveraged traders once again.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $99,971.32 on the Binance USDT market, marking a significant moment for digital asset investors worldwide. What Caused the Bitcoin Price Drop? The sudden decline in Bitcoin price has left many investors wondering about the underlying factors. Market analysts point to several potential triggers that could explain this downward movement. However, it’s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are naturally volatile, and price corrections are part of the normal market cycle. Several factors typically influence Bitcoin price movements: Market sentiment and investor psychology Regulatory developments worldwide Institutional investment flows Global economic conditions Technical trading patterns How Significant is the $100,000 Bitcoin Price Level? The $100,000 mark represents more than just a number for Bitcoin price enthusiasts. This psychological barrier has been closely watched by traders and analysts alike. Breaking below this level could trigger additional selling pressure as automated trading systems and stop-loss orders activate. However, experienced cryptocurrency investors understand that short-term Bitcoin price fluctuations don’t necessarily reflect long-term value. The fundamental technology behind Bitcoin remains unchanged, and adoption continues to grow globally. What Should Investors Do About the Falling Bitcoin Price? When facing a declining Bitcoin price, investors have several options to consider. First, avoid making panic-driven decisions. Historical data shows that emotional trading often leads to poor outcomes. Instead, focus on your original investment strategy and risk tolerance. Consider these approaches during Bitcoin price volatility: Dollar-cost averaging to reduce timing risk Rebalancing your portfolio according to your strategy Setting clear entry and exit points in advance Diversifying across different assets to manage risk Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? Many seasoned investors view price corrections as potential buying opportunities. The current Bitcoin price level might present an attractive entry point for those who believe in the long-term potential of cryptocurrency. However, always conduct thorough research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong despite short-term Bitcoin price movements. Increasing institutional adoption, growing recognition as a store of value, and limited supply continue to support the long-term thesis for many investors. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin Price Volatility The recent Bitcoin price drop below $100,000 serves as a reminder of cryptocurrency market volatility. While concerning for short-term traders, long-term investors might see this as part of the normal market cycle. The key is maintaining perspective, sticking to your investment strategy, and making informed decisions based on research rather than emotion. Frequently Asked Questions Why did Bitcoin price fall below $100,000? Bitcoin price movements can be influenced by multiple factors including market sentiment, regulatory news, large investor transactions, and broader economic conditions. The exact combination of factors varies with each price movement. Should I sell my Bitcoin after this price drop? This depends on your investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Many investors recommend against making emotional decisions during price volatility and suggest sticking to your predetermined investment plan. How low could Bitcoin price go? Predicting exact price levels is impossible, as cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile. Historical patterns show that Bitcoin has experienced significant corrections before reaching new highs, but past performance doesn’t guarantee future results. Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin? Some investors view price drops as buying opportunities, while others prefer to wait for stability. Consider your investment strategy, conduct thorough research, and only invest what you can afford to lose. How often does Bitcoin experience major price corrections? Bitcoin has historically experienced regular price corrections of 20-30% even during bull markets. These are considered normal in the volatile cryptocurrency space. What support levels should I watch for Bitcoin price? Traders typically watch previous resistance-turned-support levels, moving averages, and Fibonacci retracement levels. However, technical analysis should be combined with fundamental research. Found this analysis helpful?

According to curb.sol data, Solana ETFs attracted over $29 million in inflows today, bringing total inflows for the past eight days to more than $323 million. The consistent inflows suggest that institutional investors are accumulating Solana despite current price weakness. Solana ETFs Defy Broader Market Sentiment Data from SolanaFloor revealed that Bitwise’s BSOL fund added $29.2 million in inflows today, pushing total capital since its launch last week beyond $300 million. This steady demand comes even as broader crypto markets remain uncertain. Analysts suggest that such resilience reflects growing institutional confidence in Solana’s ecosystem, driven by its efficiency, strong developer activity, and expanding DeFi presence. Solana’s price, however, has experienced short-term weakness. The token is trading at $154.52 , down 2.79% in the last 24 hours and nearly 17% over the past week. Despite the decline, Solana maintains a market capitalization of $85.6 billion with a circulating supply of 550 million tokens. Analysts View Current Range as Key Accumulation Zone Source: X Analyst AltcoinGordon described the sub-$160 zone as an “exceptional accumulation opportunity,” citing Solana’s long-term uptrend and historical breakout patterns. The daily chart shows the asset forming consistent higher lows along a rising trendline near $150, signaling structural strength. After its last rebound from this region, SOL moved above $200 and briefly tested the $270–$290 zone before retracing. This correction, according to market observers, marks a typical consolidation phase in an ongoing uptrend. The support areas near $200 and $230 remain important zones for future rebounds. A sustained move above $290 could confirm the next phase of bullish continuation. Technical Range Points to Potential Reversal Source: X Analyst CryptoPulse noted that Solana is currently consolidating within a reversal range between $145 and $155. The pattern reflects a cooling-off period as volatility decreases and sellers lose momentum. A sideways structure in this region could precede a new rally, with $184 as the first resistance level to reclaim. Consequently, if buyers maintain control above $145, the next upside target sits around $200. However, a breakdown below that support could lead to another test near $138.

The analyst focuses on a billboard placed in New York during the event and interprets it as an operational signal rather than standard marketing. The comments were shared through a video captioned to his post, where he breaks down what he believes the message represents for banking institutions, market participants, and the broader direction of XRP adoption. JUST DROPPED: The Ripple SWELL Message No One Caught. $XRP pic.twitter.com/FBrWKtfw3E — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) November 4, 2025 The Billboard and Its Intended Meaning The analyst points to a large Ripple-branded billboard that reads, according to him, “It’s happening to banking. It’s not coming. It is happening right now.” He argues this message was not meant to attract general public interest but to act as confirmation of progress already underway. He states that the message indicates that the company has left the stage of being categorized as a startup and has transitioned into a structural layer used by financial institutions. Furthermore, the analyst frames the billboard as a signal to those within the banking sector, rather than retail market observers, suggesting that the system it supports is already moving forward. Transition to Institutional Infrastructure Within the video, the analyst claims that major banks are quietly onboarding and integrating the technology behind the scenes. According to him, this onboarding is not being announced publicly in detail, but the positioning at SWELL and the messaging presented show that activation is occurring. He states that the significance of the content shown during SWELL is not about unveiling new products or services, but about the network shift from preparation to function. In his view, the event marked the operational stage rather than an introductory or exploratory stage. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 ETF Activity and Market Volume The analyst further connects recent increases in trading volume and rising ETF-related attention surrounding XRP to the same broader movement. He argues that the heightened volume levels and renewed institutional commentary are not coincidental, but part of coordinated timing among key industry participants. He notes that major figures attended and contributed to SWELL presentations this year, which he views as consistent with the market phase and banking system activation that he describes. Message to Traditional Banking Toward the end of the video, the analyst states that the billboard served as a direct message to established financial institutions: adjust to the new settlement framework or face decline. He concludes that the development is already underway and that the visible messaging in New York was intended to signal this transition. The claims reflect the analyst’s interpretation of promotional materials, market conditions, and institutional involvement at SWELL. Verification of the extent of behind-the-scenes integration will depend on future disclosures and operational evidence.

The move pushes Polymarket into the mainstream and adds more legitimacy to the crypto market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has raised over $16.8 million in its presale, showing strong demand for its integrated wallet solution. The growing need for crypto wallets globally suggests significant future demand for $BEST, which could produce a 3K% ROI by 2030. The cryptocurrency landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, and recent developments suggest a further legitimization of digital assets in mainstream culture. As Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, prepares to be featured in Google’s search results , it is clear that blockchain technology is becoming an integral part of everyday life. Polymarket isn’t the only prediction market Google is teaming up with. It will also roll out Kalshi prediction market data in its search results , enabling users to ‘questions about future market events and harness the wisdom of the crowds.’ Google’s move signals a major shift in how the tech giant views crypto and prediction markets. Traditionally, platforms like Polymarket have existed outside of mainstream finance, largely due to regulatory uncertainties and the volatility of digital assets. Kalshi, however, is federally regulated and operates under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The integration of prediction markets with platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi aligns with broader trends in crypto adoption, and this growing acceptance could soon pivot around the need for effective crypto wallets, like Best Wallet . Best Wallet: A Solution to the Growing Need for Crypto Wallets As decentralized finance continues to capture investor attention, wallets that facilitate these activities, such as the non-custodial Best Wallet app , are poised to play a central role. The Best Wallet ecosystem – including its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – is positioning itself to cater to a burgeoning market that is becoming more integrated with traditional finance and user-centric blockchain applications. When it comes to utility, both Best Wallet and $BEST are packed to the hilt. This comprehensive Web3 wallet solution aims to serve as a hub for crypto asset management – and then some. As the world increasingly adopts crypto – thanks in part to wider visibility of prediction markets – users will need wallets that can securely manage both everyday transactions and their funds. Best Wallet is positioning itself to meet this need, offering advanced features like multi-layer security, decentralized identity verification, and seamless cross-platform integration. Discover more in our comprehensive Best Wallet review. $BEST – The Driving Force Behind A $16.8M Fundraise $BEST fuels the non-custodial Best Wallet ecosystem, which offers decentralization, no-KYC registration, multi-level security, and early access to a multitude of upcoming features. These include market insights, which gauges market trends and sentiment, a DEX aggregator, offering access to 60+ chains and over 200 DEXs, and the Best Card, allowing you to spend crypto everywhere fiat currency goes. That’s why the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale comes at a perfect time, tapping into the demand for integrated digital asset-management solutions. Holding $BEST comes with definitive perks, including higher staking rewards, lower transaction fees, governance rights, and – uniquely – access to the the top presales, each of which have been vetted for legitimacy.

With $BEST currently priced at just $0.025905, the project offers investors an opportunity to enter at an attractive price point before the token gains broader adoption post-listing. Moreover, the project offers 78% staking rewards, which incentivizes token holders to lock up their assets and support the growth of the network. This high yield is an attractive proposition for long-term investors looking to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Check out our step-by-step guide to buying $BEST. As the decentralized prediction markets gain traction, the need for robust wallet solutions becomes even more apparent. In the coming months, wallets will likely become one of the central narratives in the evolving crypto ecosystem, especially as more people participate in prediction markets and DeFi. For Best Wallet Token, this trend presents a significant growth opportunity. By focusing on both utility and security, the project is positioning itself as a go-to solution for managing assets in the fast-evolving world of digital markets. That’s why our price prediction for $BEST puts the token at a potential $0.82 by 2030, depending on the socio-economic context and Best Wallet’s growth. The possibility of bagging a 3,065% five-year ROI is enough of an incentive for opportunistic investors. There’s a caveat though – the Best Wallet Token presale is coming to an end in exactly three weeks. Once listed, there’s a good chance the token price will surge. That’s why now’s the time to invest in $BEST if you want to secure it at its current early-bird price. Buy your $BEST right now on the official presale page while you still can.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and one of the most closely watched voices in crypto macro-analysis, has argued that the next altcoin bull run will be driven by utility, users, and paying customers, not hype. That’s a distinct shift from the way things have been so far, where projects rely on hype and momentum to build up enough of a user base to establish themselves. Hayes highlights that those days are coming to an end – and the next crypto to explode could be poised to take advantage. Hayes Emphasizes New Altcoin Cycle In his recent remarks , Hayes said the era of projects thriving solely on token hype and venture backing is coming to an end. Instead, projects with real users, paying clients, and sustainable value-sharing models will shape the new cycle. That’s distinct from previous cycles, where projects launched innovative projects – but never had a good market fit, never retained customers, and never generated the revenue they needed to stay alive. Historically, altcoin seasons have come in waves, from the ICO mania of 2017 to DeFi Summer in 2020 and meme-coin explosions in 2023–24. Each cycle brought new innovation, but many tokens eventually faded once hype outpaced product-market fit. Now, the emphasis is shifting. Projects capable of generating cash flow, measurable on-chain activity, or user-driven rewards are gaining traction. This aligns with a maturing investor base seeking sustainable growth rather than pure speculation. Amidst this shift, one new presale – PepeNode – is gaining attention. Though it carries a playful meme aesthetic, it’s designed around an actual mine-to-earn virtual node ecosystem, directly appealing to the ‘utility + user’ vision Hayes outlined. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – Virtual Miner Nodes and Gamified Meme Utility At its core, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) transforms the familiar meme-coin playbook into a gamified virtual mining experience, where users deploy digital nodes, upgrade facilities, and earn $PEPENODE rewards – all without real-world hardware or energy costs. The presale offers $PEPENODE at $0.0011363 per token, with a total supply of 210 billion tokens minted on the Ethereum network (ERC-20 standard). Early participants can purchase via ETH, USDT, BNB, or even credit/debit cards and stake $PEPENODE tokens for 621% dynamic APY; you can learn more about how to buy $PEPENODE with our guide . The platform’s signature feature – Virtual Miner Nodes – allows users to participate in simulated mining cycles that yield token rewards over time. These nodes can be upgraded and expanded to boost mining efficiency and overall returns. The approach introduces a ‘mine-to-earn’ structure designed for accessibility and engagement. It’s a gamified approach to meme coin mining, delivering meme coin rewards without any of the technical and energy barriers typical of Proof-of-Work mining. Key functional elements include: Gamified participation: Players purchase and manage virtual nodes, building a digital mining operation that grows in productivity. Dynamic rewards: Tiered mining bonuses incentivize early participation and consistent engagement. Simple accessibility: Users need no hardware or coding, just a connected wallet and $PEPENODE tokens. Ecosystem expansion: The roadmap includes integrations for DeFi yield partnerships, NFT node utilities, and future cross-chain scalability. The presale’s appeal lies in its blend of meme familiarity with functional engagement, offering something to do, not just to hold. As Hayes noted, the market is turning toward projects that give users tangible reasons to participate. Our own price prediction sees $PEPENODE reaching $0.0072 from its current price by 2026, delivering 533% rewards to early participants. As Hayes heralds a new era for the best altcoins , PepeNode joins the running as a project delivering utility and a genuine use case – not just hype. Start mining meme coins.

The report explores how investors are assessing labor market conditions amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, focusing on how private data is being used to fill the gap left by suspended official statistics. Key Highlights: Private Compiled Data: With U.S. labor statistics halted during the government shutdown, private data sources such as Bloomberg’s reconstructed unemployment figures show a modest decline in initial jobless claims, suggesting tentative stabilization. Continuing Claims: Benefit claims have edged higher to 1.95 million, indicating slower workforce re-entry and highlighting the continued strain on federal employees. ADP, Job Postings, and Wage Trends: Private-sector employment data and online job postings point to renewed hiring momentum, while wage trends and consumer sentiment offer additional insight into labor market resilience. The report highlights that market participants have turned to alternative indicators such as Bloomberg’s reconstructed unemployment statistics and ADP’s newly introduced weekly payroll data to gauge labor market health. Bloomberg’s analysis estimates that initial jobless claims fell to around 218,000 for the week ending October 25, down from 231,000 the previous week. While this suggests gradual improvement, gaps in state-level reporting introduce some uncertainty. Continuing claims have risen slightly to 1.95 million, signaling that re-entry into the workforce remains slow. Federal employees are disproportionately affected, with unemployment claims under the federal program reaching their highest level since the previous shutdown. Meanwhile, ADP’s private-sector data shows steady job creation, averaging 14,250 new positions per week—a rebound from September’s job losses. Market sentiment points toward stabilization, though persistent benefit claims and limited hiring momentum underline the economy’s fragility.

Bitcoin cenšas atgūties no šonedēļ sākušās krīzes, kas pirmo reizi kopš jūlija pazemināja cenu zem 100 000 ASV dolāru. Bitcoin sasniedza visu laiku augstāko līmeni oktobra sākumā, kad pieauga tirgotāju pozīcijas ar kredītplecu. Tomēr tas neturpinājās ilgi, jo 19 miljardi dolāru pozīcijās ar kredītplecu tika iznīcināti, satricinot investoru uzticību. Tirgus joprojām nav pilnībā atguvies no šī pēkšņā krituma. Šī masveida pārdošana notiek, jo Federālā rezervju sistēma signalizē par piesardzību saistībā ar gaidāmo procentu likmju samazināšanu, mudinot daudzus ilgtermiņa turētājus izņemt savas kriptovalūtas un nodrošināt peļņu. Tomēr eksperti uzskata, ka Bitcoin jau ir sasniedzis spēcīgu atbalsta līmeni un drīz varētu mēģināt veikt atgriezenisko revanšu. Kamēr Bitcoin piedzīvo globālu investoru izpārdošanu, no aizkulisēm parādās tumšais zirgs: Bitcoin Hyper. Projekts, kas jau izraisījis ažiotāžu ar savu revolucionāro 2. slāni, augstajām likmēm un ātri izpārdotajām iepriekšpārdošanas akcijām, pozicionējas kā viens no labākajiem utilitātes risinājumiem 2025. gadā. Turpiniet lasīt šo rakstu, lai uzzinātu par jaunākajām tendencēm saistībā ar Bitcoin un Bitcoin Hyper. Ilgtermiņa Bitcoin turētāji izpārdod savas monētas cenu krituma laikā Šo ievērojamo cenu kritumu, iespējams, izraisīja piespiedu pārdošana, bet pašreizējo kritumu atbalsta daži lieli tirgus dalībnieki. Pēdējā mēneša laikā ilgtermiņa Bitcoin investori ir pārdevuši aptuveni 400 000 monētu, kuru vērtība ir gandrīz 45 miljardi dolāru . K33 pētniecības vadītājs Vetle Lunde teica: “Pēdējā mēneša laikā ir reaktivizēti vairāk nekā 319 000 Bitcoin, galvenokārt no monētām, kas tika turētas sešus līdz divpadsmit mēnešus, kas liecina par ievērojamu peļņas gūšanu kopš jūlija vidus.” Viņš piebilda: “Lai gan daļa reaktivizācijas ir saistīta ar iekšējiem pārvedumiem, daudz kas atspoguļo reālu pārdošanu.” Kriptovalūtu ETF arī piedzīvo masīvu pārdošanas spiedienu. Bitcoin un Ethereum ETF sešas dienas pēc kārtas piedzīvoja investoru atkāpšanos, kopējam līdzekļu izplūdumam pārsniedzot 2,6 miljardus dolāru. Lielākais trieciens nāca no BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), kas vienā dienā zaudēja vairāk nekā 375 miljonus dolāru. Bitcoin cenas prognoze: vai atgūšanās ir tuvu? Otrdien Bitcoin cena nokritās zem 100 000 dolāru atzīmes pirmo reizi četros mēnešos, sasniedzot jaunu zemāko līmeni 98 892 dolāri. Šis solis seko makroekonomiskajai nenoteiktībai un ilgstošai korekcijai. Turklāt pirmo reizi kopš 2018. gada Bitcoin ir noslēdzis oktobra negatīvā teritorijā, norādot uz investoru intereses samazināšanos. Tehniskā līmenī Bitcoin cena saskaras ar ievērojamu pretestības kopumu 104 000 dolāru līmenī, kas ietver 10 un 20 dienu vienkāršos vidējos rādītājus (SMA). Spēcīga izlaušanās virs šī līmeņa varētu pavērt ceļu uz psiholoģisko 105 000 dolāru barjeru. Kā novērots nesen, BTC tiek tirgots 100 000–105 000 ASV dolāru diapazonā, kas izraisījis 1,70 % samazinājumu pēdējo 24 stundu laikā. MACD indikators paliek nemainīgs, šķērsojot gan signālu, gan bāzes līniju. Turklāt BTC dienas apjoms sasniedza 67,23 miljardus dolāru, norādot uz ievērojamu impulsu izlaušanās virzienā. Tomēr, ja tas nespēs izkļūt no pašreizējā diapazona, tas var izraisīt pagaidu kritumu. Bitcoin Hyper iepriekšpārdošanas impulss norāda uz iespēju agrīnā stadijā Bitcoin Hyper ir 2. slāņa kriptovalūtas projekts, kuram ir potenciāls sasniegt 10 reizes lielāku vērtību, kad žetons tiks kotēts galvenajās biržās. Neskatoties uz plašāku tirgus vājumu, projekts jau ir piesaistījis vairāk nekā 26 miljonus dolāru un pārdevis vairāk nekā 600 miljonus tokenu, kas ir ievērojams pievilcības līmenis agrīnās stadijas investoriem. Bitcoin Hyper ir 2. slāņa tīkls, kas izstrādāts, lai uzlabotu Bitcoin ātrumu un mērogojamību. Tas ir līdzīgi tam, ko ERC-20 izdarīja ar Ethereum. Tā vietā, lai apstrādei paļautos uz Bitcoin lēno galveno tīklu (5–7 TPS), Bitcoin Hyper izmanto ātrāku sistēmu, ko darbina Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) un kas var vienlaikus apstrādāt vairākus darījumus. Mehānisms ir vienkāršs: lietotāji pārvieto savu BTC caur drošu tiltu Bitcoin galvenajā tīklā. BTC tur tiek bloķēts, un Bitcoin Hyper tiek izdots vienāds daudzums Wrapped BTC. Šajā 2. slānī darījumi notiek daudz ātrāk un tiek efektīvi pārbaudīti ar SVM palīdzību, nodrošinot Bitcoin vienmērīgāku un plašāk pielāgojamu darījumu pieredzi. Projekta galvenie atskaites punkti: Iepriekšpārdošanā piesaistīti vairāk nekā 26 miljoni ASV dolāru Masveida 45 % APY staking ICO investoriem Pārdots vairāk nekā 655 miljoni žetoni un ir vairāk nekā 120 000 unikālu turētāju Stingras drošības pārbaudes, ko veic Coinsult un Spywolf Atlaide pašreizējā iepriekšpārdošanā – 0,013235 $ par vienu žetonu Labākās iepriekšpārdošanas, piemēram, Bitcoin Hyper , ir saglabājušas impulsu pat vājos tirgus apstākļos. Pašreizējā iepriekšpārdošanā projekts piedāvā piekļuvi daudzsološiem žetoniem ar atlaidi agrīniem lietotājiem. Kriptovalūtu tirgum atgūstoties, Bitcoin Hyper ir labākā kriptovalūta, ko iegādāties, lai gūtu peļņu nākotnē.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-has-entered-a-consolidation-phase-according-to-the-latest-report-from-analysis-firm-matrixport-here-are-the-details/,"According to Matrixport's post, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase due to macroeconomic pressures and resistances in the market structure. Matrixport: Bitcoin in Consolidation Phase, Current Situation Not a Structural Peak The report cited the cautious stance of the US Federal Reserve and the low probability of easing monetary policy in the near term as key factors supporting the general stagnation in the markets. Moreover, the recovery of the dollar from the mid-summer low and the gradual tightening of liquidity increased the pressure on crypto assets. Matrixport analysts say spot demand is weakening as the impact of early capital flows into ETFs fades. However, profit-taking by some large investors and cautious investor positioning following recent liquidation events have led to a noticeable cooling in market participation. Bitcoin's recent decline below some key cost moving averages suggests that its price action is currently undergoing a correction. The report emphasizes that the current situation is not a “structural peak,” but rather a natural correction seen in the late phase of the cycle. Matrixport notes that this process could pave the way for more attractive entry opportunities in the future, predicting that Bitcoin could enter a new uptrend in 2026 if liquidity conditions improve or monetary policy loosens. However, it's also stated that investors should be patient in the short term. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume stands at $180.4 billion, showing active participation despite broader weakness. TLDR: Global crypto market cap slipped 0.7% to $3.49T, with 24h volume at $180.4B; BTC fell 0.2% ($101,553), ETH dropped 0.1% ($3,336); Asian equities mirrored Wall Street losses after AI stock selloffs and weak US job data; Institutional demand for BTC slowed as treasuries and ETFs showed cooling inflows; Fear & Greed Index fell to 21 (Fear) from 24 yesterday and 62 a month ago; BTC ETFs rebounded with $240M inflows; ETH ETFs added $12.5M; Traders remain cautious amid the U.S. government shutdown, Fed rate-cut speculation. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, most leading cryptocurrencies are down over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $101,553, down 0.2%, with a $2.02 trillion market capitalization. Ethereum (ETH) fell 0.1% to $3,336, while BNB (BNB) edged up 0.4% to $964.83. XRP (XRP) climbed 4.5% to $2.22, standing out as one of the few top gainers. Solana (SOL) slipped 1.2% to $157.21, while Cardano (ADA) rose 1.8% to $0.5455. Dogecoin (DOGE) gained 1.6%, now trading at $0.1663. Despite the overall decline, a few altcoins posted notable gains. DeAgentAI (DAI) surged 618.7%, Internet Computer (ICP) rose 4.4%, and Zcash (ZEC) gained 19.5% in the past 24 hours. Top gainers also include sudeng (+248.4%) and DUSK (+59.5%), signaling renewed speculative activity across smaller-cap tokens. Trending coins on CoinMarketCap are DeAgentAI , Internet Computer , and Zcash , reflecting rising investor interest in AI-linked and privacy-focused projects amid a cautious trading environment. Crypto and Asian Markets Fall as Investors Turn Risk-Averse Amid Weak Data and ETF Outflows Asian markets opened lower on Friday, extending a global risk-off sentiment that weighed on both equities and cryptocurrencies . Bitcoin and other digital assets slipped further after data showed weakening demand and reduced treasury inflows from large holders. The total crypto market cap fell around 2% to $3.47 trillion, with Bitcoin down 1.5% to $101,545 and Ether down 2.5% to $3,320. Regional equity benchmarks mirrored the downturn, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropping 1.75% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index falling 0.74%. The declines followed Wall Street’s overnight selloff led by tech and AI-linked stocks. The Nasdaq fell 1.9%, driven by profit-taking after months of AI-fueled gains. Fresh labor data showing 153,074 job cuts in October, nearly triple last year’s total, added to concerns about an economic slowdown. Really feels like equities are cooked, and if equities are cooked, then our coins are about to get smacked — Flood (@ThinkingUSD) November 6, 2025 Analysts said the losses highlight investors’ cautious positioning as the earnings season ends and the US government shutdown continues to cloud visibility on official economic indicators. Meanwhile, institutional appetite for Bitcoin is showing signs of cooling. Kraken economist Thomas Perfumo said demand from major treasuries like MicroStrategy has slowed, while crypto ETFs have seen notable outflows. Despite weaker sentiment, analysts maintain that markets remain orderly, with traders watching for potential Federal Reserve support if funding stress increases. Treasury yields stayed firm, while the dollar slipped 0.4%, and the euro rose to $1.1547, signaling growing expectations for another Fed rate cut later this year. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $101,440, up 0.15% on the day. The coin remains under pressure after repeated failed attempts to reclaim the $103,000 zone. Its intraday range sits between $100,800 and $102,300, reflecting cautious sentiment and low trading volume following this week’s market-wide decline. A strong daily close above $103,000 could open the path toward $105,000–$107,000, where previous resistance levels remain intact. On the downside, losing $100,000 support risks deeper retracements toward $98,500 and $96,800, key zones where buyers previously stepped in. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $3,337, gaining 0.72% over the past 24 hours. Despite the small rebound, ETH continues to hover near monthly lows after a steep correction earlier this week. A recovery above $3,400 could pave the way toward $3,600–$3,750, while failure to hold above $3,300 may expose the token to a further drop toward $3,150 or even $3,000. Traders are watching macroeconomic cues, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and Fed rate expectations, as potential catalysts that could shape short-term momentum in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Meanwhile, market sentiment continues to deteriorate , with the CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index dropping to 21, signaling “Fear.” The index stood at 24 yesterday, 31 last week, and 62 a month ago, marking a sharp shift from a previously “Greedy” environment to deep caution. The US Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a strong rebound on November 6, recording $240.03 million in total net inflows, according to data from SoSoValue. Cumulative inflows across all Bitcoin ETFs now stand at $60.52 billion, with total net assets reaching $135.43 billion, representing 6.73% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The total trading volume for the day came in at $4.77 billion, reflecting steady institutional participation despite recent market volatility. Among individual funds, BlackRock’s IBIT led the day’s inflows with $112.44 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $61.64 million and Ark & 21Shares’ ARKB adding $60.44 million. Bitwise’s BITB also posted $5.5 million in net inflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC remained flat for the day. Likewise, spot Ethereum ETFs saw moderate inflows on November 6. Among individual funds, BlackRock’s ETHA led the inflows with $8.01 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH with $4.95 million and Bitwise’s ETHW adding $3.08 million. Cumulative net inflows now stand at $13.91 billion, with total net assets reaching $21.75 billion, representing 5.45% of Ethereum’s total market capitalization. The day’s total trading volume came in at $1.62 billion, reflecting steady participation across major issuers.

The network has 39 validators, with up to 50 allowed to propose blocks. The validators give access to 58,000 delegators with staked SEI. SEI is a growing chain with around $260M in value locked and $113M in stablecoin liquidity. Apps on SEI produce around $55,000 in daily fees. The chain also aims to expand its activity to tap more Web3 apps and DeFi liquidity . Binance to power SEI expansion SEI launched as a new L1 chain for high-frequency apps. The project has already attracted tokenized funds from BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Apollo. The chain’s apps and assets are also integrated into the infrastructure of major crypto partners like Circle, MetaMask , Securitize, KAIO, and Ondo. The adoption has followed SEI’s general proven reliability. The L1 SEI network is the fastest EVM-compatible chain to date, with fast finality and consensus. Binance as a validator will participate in the upcoming Giga update, expanding the chain’s capacity to 200,000 transactions per second. SEI still seeks market recovery The native SEI token is trading at around $0.16, near its all-time lows. Despite the chain’s development, the native token has not regained previous peaks. SEI has been pressured by unlocks, with around 24% of the supply remaining to be released. The token is represented on Coinbase and Binance, but has lagged behind hotter assets. SEI open interest shows lowered enthusiasm for trading and sits at just $54M. Despite its low price, SEI set up expectations for a recovery to $0.70 . The token is outside the top 100 of all crypto assets, but is seen as one of the potential candidates for a recovery. The network recently tapped perpetual futures trading, achieving $38.7B in volumes since the summer months. The other boost for SEI may come from an eventual ETF approval , though the process still has no clear deadline. For now, traders and investors remain skeptical, as they want to avoid having funds in a project that may lag other assets and take months to make a real recovery. The L1 narrative is no longer a leading price indicator, as most of the market is led by derivative positions and speculation. The asset is also not represented on Hyperliquid, where additional whale speculation could draw attention. The mindshare for SEI is also flat, signaling no special interest from influencers, despite Binance’s involvement.

These have become quite popular due to their success rates during this time. As such, the Coinglass website collates all of these to form a progress chart that could tell when the Bitcoin price is nearing its peak. This progress chart is barely halfway gone, but the Bitcoin price is seeing major crashes, so what’s going on? Bull Market Peak Indicators Remain Untriggered A total of 30 Bitcoin bull market peak indicators are being tracked on the Coinglass website, and so far, not a single one has been triggered. This means that none of these 30 indicators point to the Bitcoin price already reaching its peak. This suggests that there is still more runway for the digital asset before it hits the cycle peak and begins the next decline into the bear market; thus, the tracker remains firmly in “Hold” territory. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $87,000 If This Happens For example, the Bitcoin Dominance indicator is very high, sitting at 92.76%, very close to being triggered, but remains untouched. This comes while the Bitcoin dominance over the rest of the altcoin market remains high above 60%, but still below the 65% score required for the indicator to be triggered.. Another major indicator is the Bitcoin long-term holder supply, which tracks the rate at which long-term holders are dumping BTC. This indicator is often triggered when long-term holder supply falls below 13.5 million BTC, but at the time of this report, it is still sitting above 15 million BTC. Short-term holder supply is another indicator that also remains relatively low at this point. For this indicator to be triggered, the short-term holder supply needs to rise above 30% of the supply. However, it is sitting at less than 25%, suggesting that Bitcoin long-term holders are still dominating the market. Sell-Offs Are Dominating Bitcoin While the Bitcoin peak indicators remain untriggered and point toward a time to hold, it has not stopped the massive sell-offs that have been rocking the cryptocurrency. Over the last few weeks, reports have emerged of early Bitcoin whales dumping billions of dollars of BTC on the market. Related Reading: Here’s Why Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Prices Are Crashing, Is A Recovery Possible? Bitcoinist reported that between October and November, two early Bitcoin whales had sold more than $1.7 billion worth of BTC in a matter of weeks. These sell-offs had added to the initial bearish pressure that pushed the Bitcoin price down toward $100,000. Then, earlier this week, reports emerged of another OG whale who dumped 10,000 BTC, worth over $1 billion on the market. Given these, it seems that Bitcoin is not waiting for the cycle peak indicators to trigger before rallying. The whales are already pushing what looks to be a premature bear market with the massive sell-offs.

Is it now time for the Bitcoin/gold ratio to move back in Bitcoin’s favour? Gold hits support, but there is probably more downside to come Source: TradingView While the Bitcoin price has continued to bleed after reaching its all-time high, the gold price looks as though it may have arrested its own slide, and this is at the $4,000 horizontal support. That said, the 2-week chart above reveals that the Stochastic RSI indicators are just coming down from the top. This might suggest that the correction is not over yet. The ascending trendline could be a healthier retracement for the gold price, and this would see the price come down to around $3,600. BTC/XAU ratio falls through ascending trendline Source: TradingView The weekly chart for BTC/XAU illustrates an interesting perspective. While the ratio has dipped below the ascending trendline again it has still to confirm a breakdown. This trendline stretches all the way back to the beginning of 2023 so it’s no small matter if this becomes a confirmed breakdown. On the other side of the coin, the price is finding strong support at the 0.5 Fibonacci level, which matches up with the 25 ounces horizontal level. Furthermore, at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom and are currently angled back to the upside. Next bounce in favour of BTC could take BTC/XAU ratio to new all-time high Source: TradingView The 2-week chart gives a very similar perspective. Although it can be seen that the 2 week period is due to finish at the end of play on Friday. This probably means that a new candle will open well below the ascending trendline, but as long as the current candle closes above the 25 ounces support level, a bounce-back can begin. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom, and this is even the case in the monthly time frame. Would this not suggest that this next bounce in favour of Bitcoin has the potential to go much higher than the 41 ounces all-time high?

Many mistakenly treat them as the same. In truth, each plays a unique role in the digital asset ecosystem. Understanding their distinctions is key to grasping how Ripple’s technology powers real-world financial innovation. Vet’s post on X provided a clear explanation that helps to settle this long-standing mix-up. According to Vet, Ripple is the technology company, XRP is the digital asset , and the XRP Ledger is the blockchain network that supports them both. This clarification is now more relevant than ever, as global institutions increasingly integrate Ripple’s technology for payments and settlement. Ripple: The Enterprise Blockchain Company Ripple is a San Francisco-based financial technology company focused on transforming cross-border payments. It develops enterprise blockchain solutions that use the XRP Ledger, XRP, RLUSD, and other digital assets. Ripple builds software and infrastructure that enable banks, fintechs, and payment providers to move money faster and cheaper across borders. The difference between Ripple, XRP and the XRP Ledger. pic.twitter.com/gQCSSOzgIC — Vet (@Vet_X0) November 6, 2025 The company is one of many developers contributing to the XRP Ledger’s open-source ecosystem. Ripple also holds a significant amount of XRP but operates independently from the network’s governance. Its focus is on real-world adoption—making blockchain technology useful for institutions that handle everyday payments. XRP: The Native Token of the XRP Ledger XRP is the native digital asset of the XRP Ledger , similar to how ETH serves the Ethereum network or BTC powers Bitcoin. It acts as a bridge currency that connects different fiat and crypto assets on the ledger’s decentralized exchange. Every transaction on the XRPL requires a small amount of XRP as a fee. This design prevents spam and ensures network stability. XRP’s supply is fixed at 100 billion coins, with a large portion already in circulation. It serves a functional role rather than a speculative one, enabling efficient, low-cost liquidity between currencies.

Crypto X now seems divided, with some envisioning a strong rebound in the short term, while others predict a further crash. Contrary to the overall market pullback, Zcash (ZEC) and Internet Computer (ICP) continue to post new impressive gains. We will touch upon their performance and outline some extremely bullish forecasts. XRP at a Crossroads Over the past several days, Ripple made the headlines by completing a $500 million investment round and partnering with Mastercard. XRP’s price reacted with a brief uptick to the news, spiking to almost $2.40 on November 6 but retracing substantially after that. Currently, it hovers at around $2.20, representing a 12% decline on a weekly scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Some of the factors that may have negatively impacted the performance include the correction of the broader crypto market and the mass sell-off by whales who offloaded 900,000 XRP in the span of just five days. X user IncomeSharks recently warned that a more significant drop could be on the horizon, suggesting that investors waiting for a sub-$2 entry might soon get their chance. Others like Mikybull Crypto and Kamran Asghar are much more optimistic. The former envisioned the ascent to $8-$10, while the latter claimed that XRP is currently in “the best buy-zone in months.” ZEC on the Run ZEC has been on a massive upward trend as of late, despite the wobbly crypto market. Just a few hours ago, its price reached $630, representing a staggering 350% increase on a monthly scale. ZEC Price, Source: CoinGecko Its market capitalization exceeded $10 billion, making it the 19th-biggest digital asset and flipping popular altcoins like Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar (XLM), and Sui (SUI). X user Ali Martinez set the next big test for ZEC at $750, whereas Crypto Tony assumed that a rise beyond $1,000 is also on the way. Meanwhile, the co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, forecasted a rally to the eye-popping $10,000, which, for now, seems quite implausible. ICP Jumps, too Internet Computer (ICP) is another top performer, with its valuation skyrocketing by 170% over the past week. Earlier today (November 7), it neared $9, whereas it currently trades at around $7.90 (according to CoinGecko’s data). ICP Price, Source: CoinGecko Its uptick was potentially driven by DFINITY Foundation (the creator and main contributor behind the Internet Computer blockchain), which recently introduced the AI platform called “Caffeine” that allows users to build applications. Crypto X is buzzing with optimism, with many expecting ICP to continue flying. The user with the moniker CRYPTOKSA believes the price may soon reach $10, while others, like JAVON MARKS, predict a potential 10x increase from the recent levels.

The stablecoin issuer now controls 87,296 BTC worth approximately $8.9 billion. The company has transferred the funds from Bitfinex's hot wallets to its dedicated Bitcoin reserve address. Arkham Intelligence monitored the movements, which occurred in two stages. The first transaction involved the transfer of 961 BTC, valued at $97.18 million. A subsequent transfer brought 8,888 BTC, worth roughly $1 billion, into Tether's reserves. Source: Arkham Intelligence The timing proves notable. Tether usually transfers Bitcoin to its reserve wallet at the end of every quarter. This mid-quarter acquisition is an indication of strategic opportunism. Bitcoin has fallen below the $ 100,000 price after consistent outflows from BTC and ETH exchange-traded funds. The token is currently trading at around $100,784 at press time, indicating a 2% decline over the last 24 hours. BTC Price, Source: CoinMarketCap Strategic Reserve Accumulation Shows Long-Term Conviction In 2023, Tether implemented a systematic strategy of acquiring Bitcoin. The company allocates 15% of its net profits to developing its BTC reserves. This is a two-fold strategy to hedge against inflation and also to improve the balance sheet in support of USDT. The reserve plan places Tether alongside high-ranking corporate Bitcoin holders. Strategy is on top with 641,205 BTC, worth $65.39 billion, or 3.053% of Bitcoin's total supply. Other exchange-linked cold wallets, such as Galaxy Digital, are also among the major institutional holders. Tether ranks in sixth position globally among all entities holding Bitcoin . In the case of private companies, only Block.one holds more than Tether, with 140,000 BTC. In the meantime, exchange-traded funds have the highest concentration and manage approximately 1,534,219 BTC, or 7 percent of the total supply. The company's Bitcoin holdings have resulted in a high unrealized profit. On-chain analysis reveals that the average acquisition cost of BTC is $ 49,121 per BTC, in addition to the reserve portfolio. Tether has over $4.55 billion in unrealized profits at the prevailing market values. Dominant Stablecoin Position Funds Bitcoin Accumulation The capacity of Tether to accumulate Bitcoin reserves is due to its dominant market position. USDT has a market capitalization of $183.3 billion, significantly surpassing that of other stablecoins . USDC comes second with a market cap of $75 billion. The USDT distribution focuses on two major blockchains. Ethereum holds 47.92% of the aggregate supply, and Tron holds 42.08%. The presence of such a diverse range of chains solidifies the utility of USDT across various ecosystems. Recent financial disclosures highlight Tether's profitability.

The arrival of October and November, known as historically bullish months, didn't help; on the contrary, October saw the biggest crash in recent years. However, there are some altcoins that, instead of being negatively affected by this decline, continued their rise and positively diverged from the market. One of these is undoubtedly Zcash (ZEC), the most talked-about altcoin of recent days. Grayscale, highlighting ZEC's rise, analyzed the driving forces behind the rise in its latest report. On this point, Grayscale noted that while the overall cryptocurrency market faced a decline in October, ZEC was a notable exception. ZEC has been on an unstoppable rise over the past few months, and while the market was in a bloodbath in October, it gained 248% during the month, reaching a market capitalization of approximately $6.5 billion. Zcash is a decentralized digital currency like Bitcoin, but includes optional privacy features through shielded accounts and transactions. At this point, Grayscale stated that the demand for these features has increased significantly, which is reflected positively in the ZEC price. Grayscale added that they expect ZEC and more institutional investment in this category, along with demand for privacy-related technologies, as public blockchains become more deeply integrated into mainstream finance. Grayscale Backs Zcash (ZEC)! Market experts, however, point out that Grayscale is the key driver behind ZEC’s rise, as Grayscale opened its Grayscale Zcash Trust to eligible accredited investors last month. Related News: Grayscale Announces Long-Territorial Altcoin's Price Skyrocket! Becomes Today's Highest-Rising Altcoin! Will the Rise Continue? He noted that ZEC is similar in design to Bitcoin, but uses privacy technology that allows users to protect their assets. In highlighting ZEC, Grayscale said the Trust is the only U.S. public fund offering exposure to the privacy-focused cryptocurrency through select brokerage accounts. *This is not investment advice.

Whale Alert just dropped a bombshell report that 250 million USDC has been minted at the USDC Treasury, sending ripples through the crypto community. This substantial USDC minted event represents one of the largest stablecoin creations we’ve seen recently, and it’s crucial to understand what this means for the broader market. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When we talk about USDC being minted, we’re referring to the creation of new stablecoin tokens. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that require mining, stablecoins like USDC are created by the issuing company when demand increases. Each USDC token is backed by real US dollars held in reserve, making this recent USDC minted event a strong indicator of growing institutional interest and capital flowing into the crypto space. This massive USDC minted operation typically signals one of several scenarios: Increased institutional demand for stablecoin exposure Preparation for major market moves by large investors Growing adoption of USDC for payments and settlements Market liquidity expansion ahead of potential volatility Why Should Crypto Investors Care About This USDC Minted Event? Large-scale stablecoin minting often precedes significant market activity. When substantial amounts of USDC get minted, it usually means that major players are positioning themselves for upcoming moves. This particular USDC minted event could indicate that institutional investors are preparing to: Enter new positions in Bitcoin or Ethereum Provide liquidity for upcoming token launches Facilitate large cross-border transactions Hedge against market volatility The timing of this USDC minted announcement is particularly interesting given current market conditions. With cryptocurrency adoption growing globally, stablecoins like USDC play an increasingly vital role in bridging traditional finance with digital assets. How Does USDC Minting Impact the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? Every time USDC gets minted, it represents more than just new tokens entering circulation. This process directly affects market dynamics in several ways. The recent USDC minted creation adds substantial liquidity to decentralized exchanges and lending protocols, potentially lowering borrowing costs and improving trading efficiency across the ecosystem. Moreover, this USDC minted event demonstrates the growing trust in regulated stablecoins. As more institutions embrace digital assets, properly backed stablecoins become essential infrastructure components. The fact that 250 million USDC was minted suggests that traditional finance players are becoming more comfortable with crypto-native solutions. What’s Next After This Major USDC Minted Announcement? Historically, large stablecoin minting events have often preceded periods of increased market activity. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the pattern of USDC being minted in large quantities has frequently correlated with: Increased trading volume across major exchanges Potential price movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum Growing DeFi protocol utilization rates Enhanced cross-chain bridge activity The market will closely watch where this newly minted USDC flows. Will it primarily support institutional trading, fuel DeFi lending, or facilitate corporate treasury operations? The destination of these funds will provide valuable insights into current market sentiment and institutional priorities. Frequently Asked Questions What does it mean when USDC is minted? When USDC is minted, new tokens are created by the issuer and added to circulation. Each token is backed by equivalent US dollars held in reserve accounts. Why would someone mint 250 million USDC? Such large minting typically indicates institutional demand, preparation for major transactions, or the need to increase market liquidity for upcoming trading activity. Is USDC minting a bullish signal for crypto? Large USDC minting often suggests growing institutional interest and can be interpreted as a positive indicator for market liquidity and potential price movement. How is USDC different from other stablecoins? USDC is known for its regulatory compliance, transparent reserves, and backing from established financial companies, making it a preferred choice for institutions. Can anyone mint USDC? No, only authorized institutions can directly mint USDC through Circle, the primary issuer, though anyone can acquire USDC through exchanges. Where can I track USDC minting events?

The recent minting of 250 million USDC has sent ripples through the digital asset space, signaling significant market movements ahead. This substantial USDC minted event, reported by Whale Alert, represents one of the largest stablecoin injections we’ve seen this quarter. What Does 250 Million USDC Minted Actually Mean? When the USDC Treasury mints new tokens, it essentially creates fresh digital dollars backed by real-world assets. This particular USDC minted transaction indicates strong demand for stablecoin liquidity. The process involves depositing equivalent U.S. dollars into reserved accounts, then creating corresponding digital tokens on the blockchain. Major USDC minted events typically precede significant market activity. Institutional players often accumulate stablecoins before making large purchases across various cryptocurrencies. Therefore, this massive USDC minted operation could signal upcoming bullish movements in the market. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About USDC Minting? The timing and scale of this USDC minted transaction provide valuable insights for savvy investors. Here’s what makes this development crucial: Market Liquidity Indicator: Large USDC minted events often correlate with increased trading volume Institutional Interest: Significant USDC minted amounts typically involve institutional players Price Impact: Fresh USDC minted can influence cryptocurrency prices through increased buying pressure Market Confidence: Growing USDC minted volumes reflect trust in stablecoin ecosystems How Does USDC Minting Affect Your Crypto Strategy? Understanding USDC minted patterns can dramatically improve your investment decisions. When substantial amounts of USDC get minted, it often creates opportunities for strategic positioning. Many traders monitor these events to anticipate market trends and adjust their portfolios accordingly. The recent 250 million USDC minted transaction suggests that major market participants are preparing for significant moves. This could mean anything from large-scale acquisitions to hedging strategies against market volatility. Either way, keeping tabs on USDC minted activities provides an edge in navigating crypto markets. What Makes This USDC Minted Event Different? While USDC minted transactions occur regularly, this particular event stands out for several reasons. The sheer scale of 250 million USDC minted in a single transaction indicates coordinated institutional action. Moreover, the timing coincides with broader market developments that could amplify its impact. This USDC minted operation follows recent regulatory clarity around stablecoins, potentially signaling renewed confidence in the sector. The transparent nature of USDC minted transactions, backed by verified reserves, adds credibility to this development compared to other stablecoin activities. Conclusion: The Ripple Effect of Massive USDC Minting The 250 million USDC minted event represents more than just numbers on a blockchain – it’s a powerful indicator of market sentiment and upcoming trends. As stablecoins continue bridging traditional finance with digital assets, monitoring USDC minted activities becomes increasingly vital for informed decision-making. This development underscores the growing maturity of cryptocurrency markets and the strategic importance of stablecoin movements. Frequently Asked Questions What does USDC minted mean? USDC minted refers to the creation of new USD Coin tokens by the issuing authority, backed by equivalent U.S. dollar reserves held in regulated financial institutions. Why do companies mint large amounts of USDC? Institutions typically mint large USDC amounts to facilitate major trades, provide liquidity, or position themselves for anticipated market movements without price volatility. How does USDC minting affect cryptocurrency prices? Substantial USDC minting often precedes increased buying activity, which can create upward pressure on cryptocurrency prices as these stablecoins get deployed into various digital assets. Is USDC minting a bullish signal? While not guaranteed, large USDC minting events frequently correlate with bullish market sentiment as they indicate prepared capital waiting to enter cryptocurrency markets. How can I track USDC minting activities? You can monitor USDC minting through blockchain explorers, cryptocurrency analytics platforms, and alert services like Whale Alert that report major transactions.

Strategy announces pricing of its Stream Perpetual Preferred Stock ($STRE) Offering and upsizes the deal from €350 Million to €620 Million. $MSTR https://t.co/AyN67dQ1jy — Michael Saylor (@saylor) November 7, 2025 The offering, initially planned at €350 million, was upsized due to strong investor demand and is set to close on November 13, 2025, pending customary approvals. €620 Million Raised to Fund Expansion and Bitcoin Purchases The offering consists of 7.75 million shares priced at €80 each, bringing in approximately €608.8 million (€702.2 million) in net proceeds after fees and expenses. Strategy stated that the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, including acquiring more bitcoin and supporting its ongoing operational and growth initiatives. The announcement underscores Strategy’s continued confidence in bitcoin as a reserve asset and part of its broader treasury management strategy. The company has been one of the largest corporate holders of bitcoin and continues to build investment products around digital assets, positioning itself as a hybrid between a tech-driven financial firm and a bitcoin-focused enterprise. 10% Dividend With Quarterly Payouts Each share of STRE carries a 10% annual dividend, equivalent to €10 per €100 of stated value, paid quarterly in cash on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, starting December 31, 2025. If Strategy misses a payment, interest on the unpaid amount compounds quarterly, increasing by 1% each period up to a maximum rate of 18%. This structure provides investors with a stable, high-yield return, while allowing Strategy flexibility if cash flow timing issues arise. The company can also redeem all shares at any time once less than 25% of the original issue remains or in the event of specific tax-related circumstances. Investor Protections and Redemption Rights In the event of a “fundamental change”—such as a merger, restructuring, or ownership shift—holders of the STRE stock can request that Strategy buy back their shares for €100 each, plus any unpaid dividends. Each share also has a liquidation preference of €100, meaning investors would be repaid that amount before common shareholders in the unlikely event of a wind-down. The liquidation value adjusts daily based on recent market prices, ensuring that the preferred stock reflects fair value if actively traded. Led by Top Global Banks The offering is being managed by a group of leading financial institutions, including Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Moelis & Company, Société Générale, TD Securities, Canaccord Genuity, and StoneX Financial. Their involvement highlights strong institutional confidence in Strategy’s business model and its growing role in connecting traditional finance with the digital asset economy. By blending traditional yield instruments with crypto-linked growth potential, Strategy’s latest move reinforces its dual identity — as both a financial innovator and a pioneer in bitcoin-backed corporate finance.

The coin minting vehicle was eventually located using a quadrocopter equipped with a thermal camera, revealed officials from the power utility in Dagestan. Dagestan deploys drones in war against rogue miners Russia is now resorting to modern technologies, such as those seen on the battlefields of Ukraine, to identify makeshift mining facilities in regions where they are causing energy shortages, breakdowns and financial losses by illegally connecting to the grid. The new approach in the intensifying crackdown on unauthorized crypto mining has been implemented in one of its republics in the North Caucasus, where the minting of digital currencies outside the law has become almost a national sport. It took employees of Dagestan’s energy distribution company three months to track down an improvised crypto farm on wheels, announced Magomedshapi Shapiev, acting director of Dagenergo, the local branch of the Rosseti transmission network operator. The mining hardware was installed in the cargo bay of a Gazelle van, owned by a resident of the village of Tashkapur, Levashinsky district. The man placed 72 mining rigs in the back of the converted vehicle, the official detailed, quoted by RBC Crypto and Life.ru. Shapiev also said this is not the first time the authorities have dealt with the same person, who had a similar installation seized only about a year ago. He elaborated: “It’s worth noting that the mining farm was discovered with the same consumer who had a similar mining farm liquidated and equipment confiscated during a control operation last year.” Preliminary estimates suggest financial damages resulting from the clandestine mining undertaking amount to around 1.5 million Russian rubles (roughly $18,500). The utility admitted that the van had been running on power supplied through an electricity meter, which recorded over 152,000 kWh of consumption. However, following a careful inspection, electrical engineers suspect it may have been tampered with, leading to false readings. The fascinating part of the story is that the mining farm was discovered using a drone with night vision capabilities. The Novye Izvestia daily posted a video. Shapiev’s subordinates started using such gadgets in the summer of this year. The cameras on the UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) allow them to detect mining devices running and emitting heat in attics, basements, and other places where miners hide crypto-extracting machinery. All evidence collected from the mining Gazelle has been examined by technicians and handed over to law enforcement officers for forensic analysis. Russia serious about ending illegal crypto mining Magomedshapi Shapiev explicitly emphasized that the offense is aggravated by the fact that mining has been officially banned in Dagestan since the beginning of the year. The republic is one of about a dozen Russian regions that have partially or fully prohibited mining after it became the first relatively well-regulated crypto activity in the country. Russia legalized mining in 2024, requiring miners burning more than 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly to register with the state and pay taxes. However, low, often subsidized electricity rates in some parts of the country attracted significant numbers of miners – legal, amateur or illegal – causing headaches for local authorities and other consumers in terms of power deficits. Officials in these territories, from Siberia to the Caucasus, initially introduced seasonal and later permanent restrictions on mining, with the approval of the federal government in Moscow. Two more regions may soon be added to the list, as recently reported by Cryptopolitan. According to one estimate, the Russian state is losing over $120 million a year in budget revenues from the industry, as less than a third of mining businesses have so far registered with the Federal Tax Service ( FNS ). Rogue miners have been threatened with fines and seizure of illegally minted cryptocurrency. The confiscation of the mobile farm in Dagestan comes after the authorities in Irkutsk, dubbed the mining capital of Russia, dismantled one of the largest unlicensed mining installations discovered in recent months in mid-October.

It suggests that there is renewed investor confidence despite recent macroeconomic uncertainty. Ethereum ETFs also showed signs of stabilization after similar losses, while Solana ETFs continued to attract steady inflows since their launch. Meanwhile, a new Schwab Asset Management report revealed that almost half of US ETF investors plan to buy crypto ETFs, with Millennials leading the charge. Bitcoin ETFs Rally After Steep Pullback United States spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) broke a six-day streak of outflows on Thursday after recording a collective net inflow of $239.9 million. This happened after almost $1.4 billion was drained from the market over the past week. The turnaround now suggests that there is some renewed investor confidence after a period of macroeconomic uncertainty and widespread profit-taking that weighed heavily on institutional Bitcoin investment vehicles. According to data from Farside Investors , BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the recovery, pulling in $112.4 million in new capital. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed closely with $61.6 million in inflows, while the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) added another $60.4 million. Grayscale’s flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has struggled with consistent outflows since mid-October, saw no change during the rebound. Bitcoin ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the renewed optimism, the six-day sell-off that preceded Thursday’s inflows was one of the sharpest pullbacks since spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading earlier last year, thanks to the continued sensitivity of crypto markets to macroeconomic conditions. Similar trends were observed across Ethereum-based ETFs , which also endured a six-day streak of outflows totaling around $837 million. However, those losses were partially offset on Thursday, when spot Ethereum ETFs recorded modest inflows of $12.51 million, hinting at a potential stabilization in investor sentiment. Meanwhile, newly launched Solana ETFs outperformed expectations since debuting on Oct. 28 by attracting roughly $322 million in inflows without registering a single day of outflows so far. This is certainly a sign that there is strong and sustained interest in the Solana ecosystem. Solana ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) Crypto market maker Wintermute pointed to ETFs as one of the three key pillars driving liquidity across the digital asset market, alongside stablecoins and digital asset treasuries. In a recent blog post, the firm explained that liquidity is a more powerful force in shaping crypto cycles than even technological innovation. Investors Eye Crypto ETFs Almost half of all ETF investors in the United States are actually planning to buy a crypto ETF, matching the number of those who intend to invest in bond ETFs. This is according to a new report from Schwab Asset Management. The findings were released on Thursday in Schwab’s ETFs and Beyond report, and they suggest that investor appetite for digital assets is rapidly approaching parity with traditional investment instruments like bonds. The survey revealed that 52% of respondents plan to invest in a US equities-tracking ETF, while 45% expressed interest in crypto ETFs — tying them with bond ETFs for second place. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the results as “shocking,” especially when considering the relatively small size of the crypto ETF market compared to bonds, which make up 17% of total ETF assets under management, while crypto represents just 1%. Schwab’s survey included 2,000 individual investors aged between 25 and 75, all with at least $25,000 in investable assets and some ETF trading experience in the past two years. The report also revealed a clear generational divide in investor interest. Millennials — those born between 1981 and 1996 — showed the strongest enthusiasm for crypto ETFs, with 57% indicating plans to invest in them. In contrast, only 41% of Gen X respondents and just 15% of Baby Boomers reported similar intentions. (Source: Schwab Asset Management) Balchunas said the survey reflected a “super-optimistic” outlook for ETFs overall, particularly among younger investors who are embracing these investment vehicles as accessible and cost-efficient options. Cost and accessibility were mentioned as key reasons driving ETF adoption. An overwhelming 94% of respondents said ETFs help reduce costs in their portfolios, while about half agreed that ETFs allow them to diversify into niche strategies and alternative asset classes beyond traditional holdings. Schwab’s managing director, David Botset, shared that the investment landscape is quickly evolving as individual investors gain access to a much broader range of asset classes and products. He noticed that ETF investors are now leading this transformation, using ETFs not only as low-cost core portfolio tools but also as gateways to emerging investment opportunities like cryptocurrencies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 13:30:00

While Nvidia sits at the top of the food chain, selling its GPUs to just about every major tech company on earth, Google has been busy designing its own weapons; chips it never intended to sell, but instead uses to power everything behind its AI stack. And now, with demand for compute at an all-time high, that in-house silicon is finally showing its value. On Thursday, Google confirmed that Ironwood, the latest generation of its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), will be available in the coming weeks. It’s the company’s seventh-gen chip, built to handle everything from training huge models to running real-time AI agents and chatbots. Ironwood, Google says, is over four times faster than the last TPU. One customer, Anthropic, is planning to deploy up to 1 million of them to power its Claude model. Google builds, others catch up Even though Google continues to stockpile Nvidia GPUs, it’s not just sitting around relying on other people’s chips. TPUs have been in development for over ten years and first became available to cloud customers back in 2018. Originally used only for internal workloads, they’re now a central part of Google’s public Cloud AI infrastructure. Analyst Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein said, “Of the ASIC players, Google’s the only one that’s really deployed this stuff in huge volumes.” At the moment, Google doesn’t sell TPUs as physical hardware. Instead, customers rent access through Google Cloud, which has become one of the company’s biggest revenue engines. Last quarter, Alphabet reported $15.15 billion in cloud revenue, up 34% from the previous year. Sundar Pichai, the company’s CEO, told investors: “We are seeing substantial demand for our AI infrastructure products, including TPU-based and GPU-based solutions.” Deals, satellites, and space-bound chips With the pressure mounting across tech to get access to compute, Google is locking in monster partnerships. Last month, the company expanded its partnership with Anthropic in a deal reportedly worth tens of billions. That agreement will give Anthropic access to more than a gigawatt of AI compute capacity by 2026. Google has invested $3 billion in Anthropic so far. Even though Amazon remains the company’s main cloud partner, Google is now providing the main infrastructure for future Claude models. Anthropic’s Chief Product Officer, Mike Krieger, said: “There is such demand for our models that I think the only way we would have been able to serve as much as we’ve been able to this year is this multi-chip strategy.” That strategy includes TPUs, Trainium, and Nvidia GPUs, and it’s built for performance, cost, and backup. Krieger added that his team had done early prep work to make sure Claude could run smoothly across all major chip types. “I’ve seen that investment pay off now that we’re able to come online with these massive data centers and meet customers where they are,” he said. Two months before the Anthropic deal, Google signed a six-year, $10 billion+ cloud contract with Meta . The company also got a piece of OpenAI’s business as it diversifies away from Microsoft. OpenAI confirmed to Reuters that it’s using Google Cloud but isn’t deploying GPUs there. This week, Google revealed a new project called Suncatcher, aimed at launching solar-powered satellites equipped with TPUs. The goal is to build a system that harnesses solar energy in space to power compute-intensive AI tasks. The company said it plans to launch two prototypes by early 2027, calling the experiment a way to minimize pressure on Earth’s resources while preparing for large-scale computation in orbit. Money flows, demand rises, Nvidia watches Anat Ashkenazi, Alphabet’s CFO, said the Google owner’s momentum is coming from massive enterprise demand for its full AI stack, including both TPUs and GPUs. Alphabet now reports that it signed more billion-dollar cloud contracts in the first nine months of 2025 than it did in the previous two years combined. Meanwhile, Amazon’s cloud unit grew 20% last quarter. AWS CEO Matt Garman said, “Every Trainium 2 chip we land in our data centers today is getting sold and used.” He added that Trainium 3 would bring even more gains in performance and power efficiency. Still, Google is going all in. It raised its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 to $93 billion, up from $85 billion, with even more spending lined up for 2026. Its stock has jumped 38% in Q3 and another 17% in Q4, its strongest stretch in two decades. Analysts at Mizuho pointed to the cost and performance advantage of TPUs, noting that although they were originally for internal use, Google is now getting real traction with outside customers. Morgan Stanley also said in a June report that TPU familiarity among developers could be a major boost to Google Cloud growth. And in a September report, analysts at D.A. Davidson wrote, “We continue to believe that Google’s TPUs remain the best alternative to Nvidia, with the gap between the two closing significantly over the past 9-12 months.” They also mentioned increasing positive sentiment among developers and suggested Google could even start selling TPU systems directly to AI labs.

After spending much of 2024 below $50, the privacy-focused cryptocurrency exploded to more than $620 in early November — a staggering 1,487% rise over three months. The move has lifted its market capitalization beyond $10 billion, solidifying ZEC’s comeback among the top altcoins by size. According to CoinCodex’s Zcash price data, the rally began quietly in mid-August before accelerating sharply in October. Momentum has since gone parabolic, with daily trading volumes surpassing $5 billion as traders pile into what many see as the most compelling privacy-coin resurgence since 2021. Zcash price performance over the past 90 days. Source: CoinCodex ZEC leads the privacy-coin resurgence Analysts attribute Zcash’s sudden rise to a mix of renewed institutional attention and a broader revival in privacy-oriented crypto projects. Comments from industry figures like Arthur Hayes, who recently described privacy coins as “the next major rotation” , have reignited interest in legacy projects such as ZEC and Monero. The timing aligns with a growing market narrative around user sovereignty and financial privacy. With regulatory debates heating up, investors appear to be hedging exposure to assets that can function outside centralized oversight. ZEC’s unique shielded-transaction model gives it an edge in that narrative. Technical momentum and on-chain strength From a market-structure perspective, ZEC has completed what analysts call a “compressed accumulation breakout.” The daily chart shows a clean parabolic pattern, with higher highs forming consistently since early September. Trading volumes have spiked across major exchanges, confirming strong participation behind the move. On-chain data adds another layer of confirmation: active addresses and wallet inflows have risen sharply, while supply on exchanges has declined — typically a sign of long-term accumulation. Forecast: room for more upside, but volatility ahead The Zcash price prediction model from CoinCodex projects that ZEC could extend its rally into early 2026. By February 5, 2026, the forecast places ZEC between $621 and $1,016, with an average target near $986 — roughly a 63.5% upside from current levels. Breaking down the next few months: November 2025: Average price near $713, with highs up to $878. December 2025: Gradual climb toward $946 average and $979 peak. January 2026: Predicted range of $940 to $1,018 as ZEC approaches four-figure territory. Three-month Zcash price forecast. Source: CoinCodex Despite these bullish projections, traders caution that the speed of the ascent leaves ZEC vulnerable to sharp retracements. A sustained move below $500 could trigger profit-taking, while maintaining support above $600 would strengthen the case for a continued rally. Market sentiment and long-term outlook Sentiment across crypto communities remains broadly optimistic. Zcash’s fundamentals — low circulating supply, a proven privacy framework, and historical resilience — are fueling renewed conviction that the coin could reclaim a permanent spot among major Layer-1 assets. Institutional products such as the Grayscale Zcash Trust are also seeing renewed activity, a signal that larger investors may be rotating back into niche, undervalued sectors. Should this trend hold, ZEC’s market cap could challenge mid-tier players like Avalanche or Tron within the next year. The bottom line Zcash’s 10× rally from $50 to $600 marks one of 2025’s most dramatic price surges. With its market cap now above $10 billion and forecasts calling for further upside into 2026, the project’s comeback underscores growing confidence in privacy-focused crypto. While short-term volatility is likely, the broader trend points toward a re-rating of ZEC’s long-term value — signaling that one of crypto’s original privacy coins is not just back in the conversation, but leading it once again.

The latest news comes from Solana (SOL) and a group of crypto companies. According to the statement, the Solana Foundation and six other major crypto organizations announced the establishment of the Blockchain Payments Consortium (BPC) to standardize payment transactions. According to Coindesk, seven organizations, including the Solana Foundation, Fireblocks, TON Foundation, Polygon Labs, Stellar Development Foundation, Mysten Labs, and Monad Foundation, have launched the Blockchain Payments Consortium. In its statement, BPC said that they aim to increase the efficiency of blockchain payments by providing traditional payment convenience and creating a common framework between traditional payments and crypto. “Our goal is to increase blockchain payment efficiency by creating a common framework that meets traditional payment data requirements. Blockchain payment networks are reshaping the global payments market, but the lack of connectivity with existing financial systems is causing fragmentation and inconsistency for users and institutions.” The volume of on-chain payments will reach approximately $20 trillion by 2024, surpassing the combined volume of Visa and Mastercard transactions. However, the situation remains uncertain because blockchain networks have different technical and compliance standards. BPC recently stated that the consortium will aim to integrate blockchain-based, low-cost, high-speed cross-border remittances and regulatory-friendly payment infrastructure. BCP noted that they will act as a bridge connecting the blockchain ecosystem, regulators, and traditional financial institutions, adding, “we will create cross-border compatible compliance standards.” *This is not investment advice.

For instance, just last week, the US Federal Reserve cut the interest rates by another 25 bps, which is typically regarded as a bullish move for risk-on assets. A day later, Washington and Beijing made significant progress in their trade war, which was followed by a trade deal. And yet, neither of those benefited BTC. Just the opposite, its correction started after the two announcements with a price dip to $106,500 last Thursday. Nevertheless, the asset bounced by the weekend and stood mostly at around $111,000. The worst, though, was yet to take place. As the new business week began, bitcoin went on another downfall and dropped to $105,000 on Monday. Its correction intensified on Tuesday, and it plunged below $100,000 for the first time in nearly five months. Its bottom, at the time, came at $99,000. The bulls tried to intercept the move and help the asset recover. They were successful at first as BTC quickly rebounded to over $104,000. However, this was a short-lived rally that was halted in its tracks. Earlier today, the cryptocurrency dipped below $100,000 once again and now fights to stay above that crucial level. Even more painful weekly declines come from the likes of ETH, which dumped to $3,200, XRP, which is close to breaking below $2.20, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK, BCH, and many others. In contrast, ZEC and ICP have stolen the show with price pumps of 73% and 163%, respectively. Market Data Weekly Market Overview: Source: QuantifyCrypto Market Cap: $3.430T | 24H Vol: $198B | BTC Dominance: 58.2% BTC: $100,160 (-8.6%) | ETH: $3,230 (-15.7%) | XRP: $2.19 (-12.7%) This Week’s Crypto Headlines You Can’t Miss All the Bullish Narratives Are Still There: So Why Is Bitcoin (BTC) Breaking Down? As mentioned above, the bullish narratives and developments continue in the cryptocurrency markets, but the ongoing correction is quite painful. However, analysts outlined some of the reasons behind the current crash, which include weak sentiment and deteriorating fundamentals. OG DeFi Giant Balancer Exploited for $128M: Forks Are Now Bleeding Out Too . One of the oldest and largest names in the DeFi sphere, Balancer, was hit with a massive $128 million hack this week. According to industry experts, the culprit for the painful exploit was a faulty smart contract check. Ethereum Traders Just Flipped Bullish, But History Says This Is a Major Red Flag . Following ETH’s bounce from under $3,200 to $3,500, investors turned bullish on social media, which is typically a bearish sign, according to data from Santiment. Interestingly, the asset indeed tumbled in the following days to $3,200 as of press time. Arthur Hayes Ties Next Bitcoin Rally to End of U.S. Government Shutdown . When it comes down to BTC’s correction to under $100,000, market observers and commentators speculate that the main reason is the economic uncertainty in the US due to the government shutdown, which set a new record earlier this week. Arthur Hayes believes that once that is resolved, BTC will be ready to rip. Interestingly, Raoul Pal had a somewhat similar idea, but he also included the end of QT. After Pardoning CZ, Trump Insists He Doesn’t Know the Man . Last week, the POTUS pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, who spent four months in prison and had to pay a $50 million penalty in 2024. In an interview conducted just days after the pardoning, Trump said he didn’t even know the man and admitted that his sons were behind the decision. Brad Garlinghouse: Here’s Ripple’s Valuation Post–$500M Capital Injection . Ripple had a big week, which included a $500 million funding round led by Pantera Capital, Citadel Securities, and other big names. It put the company’s valuation at a whopping $40 billion, said CEO Garlinghouse. Additionally, the firm acquired a digital asset wallet and custody provider called Palisade.

With institutional demand rising and on-chain activity expanding rapidly, Solana is positioning itself as a leader in scalability and performance—sparking bold forecasts of a $500 price target by the peak of the 2025 bull market. But while Solana’s forecast has investors excited, the most talked-about prediction of the year isn’t about an established altcoin at all—it’s about Ozak AI, the emerging AI-powered blockchain project analysts say could 100× by 2026. Currently priced at just $0.0014 in Stage 5 of the OZ presale , Ozak AI has already raised over $4.4 million and sold more than 1 billion tokens—and it’s capturing massive investor attention for its fusion of artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and blockchain utility. Solana’s $500 Forecast Strengthens as Ecosystem Grows Solana, currently trading close to $150, remains one of the most resilient and promising Layer-1 blockchains within the marketplace. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low fees, and growing developer environment have made it the go-to preference for DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi packages. Major institutional players and developers keep emigrating to Solana for its overall performance advantages, positioning it for a widespread rally as liquidity returns to the market. From a technical angle, Solana faces resistance round $165, $182, and $198, whilst support sits near $140, $126, and $114. A sustained breakout above $182 should cause the following principal uptrend, probably sending Solana in the direction of the long-term $500 goal projected by using analysts. However, while Solana’s fundamentals are among the strongest in crypto, its large market cap limits its upside potential. Analysts suggest Solana could deliver a 3× to 5× return, impressive for a potential crypto—but small compared to the asymmetric upside potential of Ozak AI, a project still in its early stages with significant room for exponential growth. Ozak AI: The Rising Star With 100× Potential Where Solana represents scalability, Ozak AI represents intelligence. Ozak AI is building an AI-powered blockchain ecosystem designed to revolutionize predictive analytics and decision-making in the crypto world. Its AI prediction agents use machine learning to analyze real-time blockchain data, sentiment, and trading patterns—helping traders and developers identify opportunities before they become mainstream. What makes Ozak AI so appealing is its foundation of real-world partnerships and verified credibility. The project has formed alliances with Perceptron Network, HIVE, and SINT, giving it access to over 700,000 decentralized AI nodes that enhance speed, scalability, and intelligence processing. It has also been audited by CertiK and Sherlock, establishing it as a secure, transparent, and compliant project—a rarity among early-stage crypto startups. At a presale price of $0.0014, the growth potential is massive. A modest $2,000 investment today would buy roughly 1.43 million tokens, which could be worth $1.43 million if Ozak AI reaches $1—a plausible scenario given its technological depth and AI-market alignment. Why Analysts Are More Excited About Ozak AI Than Solana While Solana’s growth narrative revolves around blockchain performance, Ozak AI’s story is about AI-powered innovation—the next megatrend in both tech and crypto. Artificial intelligence has already reshaped industries from finance to marketing, and now Ozak AI is bringing it on-chain, creating an intelligent ecosystem where predictive analytics meet decentralized infrastructure. Analysts believe this crossover between AI and blockchain could define the next five years of technological growth. Unlike many AI-themed crypto projects that rely solely on branding, Ozak AI delivers functional, autonomous AI agents capable of evolving alongside market data—an innovation that could make it a leader in both sectors. As one analyst put it, “Solana will scale blockchain—Ozak AI will make it smart.” That distinction is why investors are quietly rotating profits from established assets like SOL and ETH into early-stage gems like Ozak AI ahead of its next presale stage. Solana Brings Strength—Ozak AI Brings Scale and Intelligence Solana’s $500 forecast proves its long-term dominance in the Layer-1 race, and investors see it as a core portfolio asset for the 2025 bull run. Its speed, stability, and developer community ensure it remains a leading blockchain player. However, Ozak AI is quickly emerging as the dark horse of the next cycle—a project combining early-stage entry with revolutionary AI-driven utility. With a presale still at $0.0014, verified audits, and cutting-edge partnerships, Ozak AI offers the rare chance for 100× or greater returns that could outpace every top altcoin in 2025. Solana may be the network of speed — but Ozak AI is the network of intelligence. And in the next evolution of crypto, intelligence could be the most valuable asset of all.

Both projects showcase distinct paths in the blockchain evolution, each promising substantial returns for informed investors. A Closer Look at Solana's Growth Trajectory Solana has cemented itself as a formidable player in the blockchain space. Known for its high-speed transactions and scalability, Solana has attracted a significant number of developers and institutional backers. The platform's robust ecosystem supports various applications, including DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi, making it a preferred choice for many looking for performance and speed. Despite its large market cap, which might limit its percentage gains compared to smaller projects, Solana's projections of hitting a $500 mark by 2025 illustrate its strong market confidence and potential for significant growth. The Revolutionary Promise of Ozak AI While Solana focuses on enhancing blockchain's infrastructure and performance, Ozak AI's approach integrates artificial intelligence to transform predictive analytics and decision-making processes in crypto trading. At just $0.0014 per token during its Stage 5 presale, Ozak AI is drawing significant attention with its potential for drastic valuation increases. The project blends AI capabilities with real-world applications, providing innovative tools for traders and developers. Investor Sentiment and Market Projections Investors are increasingly weighing the potential returns from both platforms. While Solana offers a more established track with a clear path to growth, Ozak AI presents a high-risk, high-reward situation that could potentially lead to outsized gains. The choice between investing in the rapid scaling and development of Solana or the innovative, AI-driven solutions of Ozak AI depends on individual investment strategies and risk appetites.

The listing is only a preparatory step and does not indicate approval or active trading start. The DTCC website is a database that lists the names of live exchange-traded funds and those in the pre-launch phase, but it only does so as a formality and does not track the likelihood of approvals ahead of their official market debut. Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ listed on DTCC post-S-1 filing amendment Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart had reported on Tuesday that Franklin Templeton submitted an amended Form S-1 registration statement for the XRP fund. The changes made include the shortened “8(a)” language, a legal “loophole” that allows the registration to automatically take effect after 20 days without a direct US Securities and Exchange (SEC) sign-off, unless the agency intervenes. The updated prospectus sent to the regulator on Tuesday specifies that the Franklin XRP Trust will hold XRP tokens as its primary asset and will track the digital asset’s market performance. Once approved, the ETF is expected to list on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Franklin Templeton’s filing is among several similar ETF submissions and proposed filing changes made in early November. Bitwise and Canary Capital filed amendments last week, removing the traditional “delaying amendment” clause to limit the SEC’s ability to control the timeline of approval. Grayscale Investments also lodged its second amendment (Amendment No. 2) to its own XRP-related Form S-1 on Monday. Crypto In America podcast host and former FOX News correspondent Eleanor Terrett said Canary Capital could see its XRP ETF approved by November 13, pending final clearance from Nasdaq through its 8-A filing, and whether the government shutdown ends sooner. “The government reopening could affect the timing, potentially moving it up if the filing is complete and the SEC is satisfied, or back if staff propose additional comments,” she wrote on X in late October. The strategy deployed by Franklin Templeton copies that of issuers behind Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs, which successfully launched under similar automatic-effect rules last month. Just before the 38-day-long and counting US government shutdown began, these ETFs managed to clear the regulatory process and list without formal SEC approval delays. Bitwise’s BSOL ETF recorded an impressive $56 million in first-day trading volume, the highest debut among more than 850 ETFs launched to date. Franklin Templeton ‘optimistic’ on digital asset market products Franklin Templeton, the seven-decade-old financial firm that manages over $1.5 trillion in global assets, is among the most active traditional finance entities to launch crypto-based investment vehicles. Earlier this year, it debuted spot EZBC (Bitcoin) and EZET (Ethereum) funds, which collectively attracted over $500 million in institutional capital within their first quarter. The New York-based company has also started a blockchain-based project in Hong Kong , launching the region’s first tokenized money-market fund together with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) under its new Fintech 2030 roadmap . The Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund is registered in Luxembourg and backed by short-term US Treasuries, using blockchain tokens in place of investor shares. Working with HSBC and OSL Group, one of Hong Kong’s 11 licensed virtual-asset platforms, Franklin Templeton is testing instant settlements through Project Ensemble, an HKMA sandbox for tokenized deposits. HSBC executives believe the tokenized platform could help bump fund flows and improve cross-system interoperability, which could later influence ETF operations in tokenized form. XRP ETF crosses $100 million in AUM after weeks of trading Away from pending ETF approvals, the live REX-Osprey XRP ETF (XRPR), launched on September 18, surpassed $100 million in assets under management (AUM) within just five weeks, according to the issuer’s report in late October. Outside US markets, the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP ETF (XRPH11), the world’s first spot XRP ETF, listed in Brazil, has accumulated approximately 7.17 billion Brazilian reais (around $1.33 billion) in total assets from over 300,000 investors, per statistics shared by the ETF provider’s website.

While many of the leading altcoins are also in red territory, there are some, like DeAgentAI (AIA), that have posted more than impressive gains. The Massive Green Candle AIA is the native cryptocurrency of the blockchain project DeAgentAI that builds infrastructure for autonomous AI agents to trade and collaborate directly on-chain without human intervention. The token began trading in mid-September but remained outside the spotlight for the next several weeks. Over the past 24 hours, however, its price has exploded by a whopping 730% to reach $28, while its market capitalization has soared to almost $3 billion. This means that AIA is the 54th-biggest cryptocurrency, surpassing well-known altcoins that have been on the market for years, such as OKB (OKB), Aptos (APT), Filecoin (FIL), Arbitrum (ARB), and many more. AIA Price, Source: CoinGecko Crypto X is now filled with analysts discussing AIA’s performance and wondering what led to that rally. Among the possible reasons is the recent collaboration between DeAgentAIA and the Web3 project Pieverse, which was officially announced earlier this week. Specifically, the partnership allows AIA to be used for verifiable on-chain invoices and receipts. Another factor that may have contributed to the rise is the support from crypto exchange GroveX, which listed the AIA/USDT trading pair. X user Zygfrid analyzed the asset’s latest performance and described the uptick as “a diabolical candle.” The market observer did not mention any potential catalysts behind the pump, jokingly asking whether the president of the United States, Donald Trump, has secretly invested in AIA. Trytex chipped in, too, saying they have opened a long position on the coin to follow the trend. The analyst claimed that AIA works similarly to MYX and COAI, which both recorded explosive (yet short-lived) gains earlier this year. Beware the Risks At the same time, some X users warned investors to stay away from AIA, describing it as a scam that can result in substantial losses. Additionally, there is limited information available about the token, which, combined with the fact that most leading crypto exchanges have not yet embraced it, should serve as another warning. That said, users should tread carefully, conduct thorough research before jumping on the bandwagon, and invest only as much as they are willing to part with.

XRP Tundra has released multiple independent certifications covering audits, liquidity protection, and team KYC, setting a benchmark that few other presales can match. Security has become the defining issue of the 2025 presale market. As investors navigate hundreds of emerging tokens, only projects with transparent validation have earned serious attention. XRP Tundra’s records are fully public, traceable, and verifiable, providing the kind of evidence that turns claims into compliance. The Multi-Layer Security Model The foundation of XRP Tundra’s credibility lies in its verified audit network. SolidProof conducted a comprehensive review and assigned a 95% security score, identifying zero critical or medium-severity issues. The report confirms that ownership rights have been renounced, contract upgrades are disabled, and fee mechanisms are capped to protect user funds. Cyberscope performed an additional assessment on the Solana-based TUNDRA-S token, verifying a 95% security rating and confirming that mint, freeze, and update authorities were revoked. The independent FreshCoins verification added another layer of confidence, certifying XRP Tundra as a compliant and active project within its monitored audit registry. The project’s fifth verification point comes from Vital Block KYC , which validated the identities of the development team. This certificate, publicly hosted on GitHub, demonstrates documented accountability that extends beyond technical verification. Independent analyst Ben Crypto recently reviewed the reports, calling XRP Tundra’s documentation “one of the most comprehensive multi-audit frameworks in current DeFi.” Few presales in 2025 can demonstrate an equally diverse verification stack covering contract code, liquidity behavior, and team validation. Transparent Math and a Dual-Token Structure Beyond audits, XRP Tundra’s architecture supports verifiable participation through its dual-token model. TUNDRA-S, built on Solana, functions as the project’s utility and yield token, powering staking within Cryo Vaults. TUNDRA-X, hosted on the XRP Ledger, carries governance and reserve utility. The ongoing Phase 10 presale lists TUNDRA-S at $0.158 with a 10% bonus, while TUNDRA-X holds a $0.079 reference value distributed free alongside each S-token purchase. Both tokens are scheduled to list at $2.5 and $1.25, respectively, reflecting the project’s transparent valuation and predictable tokenomics. Over $2 million has already been raised, with $32,000 distributed in verifiable Arctic Spinner rewards — all on-chain and auditable through Solana and XRPL explorers. Each transaction is logged in the presale contract, allowing buyers to trace token issuance in real time. This model offers a practical demonstration of transparency rather than a theoretical one, and it directly addresses market concerns over hidden token minting or allocation shifts. Liquidity Protection Through DAMM v2 Technology XRP Tundra has incorporated Meteora’s DAMM v2 — Dynamic Automated Market Maker technology — to secure its liquidity environment. This mechanism introduces adjustable trading fees that begin high during the initial post-launch period and gradually normalize as market activity stabilizes. High initial fees deter automated bots and large early sell-offs, allowing natural price formation without aggressive volatility. Once stability is achieved, fees reduce to standard levels, preserving long-term liquidity efficiency. This structure has become a model for sustainable token launches, reducing the pressure points that typically destabilize new assets. “Traditional” liquidity pools rely on static fees and open vulnerability to manipulation. DAMM v2 introduces responsive economics that react to trading behavior, creating a built-in safeguard against early exploitation. The feature aligns with XRP Tundra’s philosophy of mechanical, not manual, control — letting smart contracts maintain equilibrium instead of relying on discretionary management. Verified Identity and Accountability in DeFi Transparency extends to the team’s verification. Critics who equate operational anonymity with risk overlook the documented evidence that XRP Tundra has made public. The Vital Block KYC certificate confirms that all major contributors have undergone independent identity verification. Maintaining selective anonymity can be necessary in blockchain development for security reasons, but verifiable KYC ensures accountability remains intact. This dual approach — privacy with proof — has become an emerging standard in compliant DeFi operations. Every key action taken by the development group is accompanied by timestamped updates and signed audit confirmations, creating a continuous record of operational integrity. Regulatory alignment further reinforces the project’s legitimacy. Disclosures, audit records, and presale mechanics have been designed to meet professional standards rather than depend on speculative marketing. The question often raised in forums — is XRP Tundra legit — is answered in detail through these documents, each hosted on publicly accessible platforms. Evidence as the New Benchmark The presale market has long struggled with credibility gaps caused by limited auditing and opaque team structures. XRP Tundra has responded with a verification-first approach that makes every layer of its operation testable. Five independent certifications cover code, liquidity, and identity. Transparent presale contracts track every allocation on-chain. The public can access audits, KYC records, and community analytics in full. Security is measurable here, not implied. XRP Tundra demonstrates how transparency and documentation now define leadership in decentralized finance. Review every audit and verify the records yourself — the evidence defines the benchmark.

Some warn of a deep pullback while onchain trackers point to a mild correction that could already be ending.

He called a fall from recent highs a possible “Speed Bump Toward $56,000,” and said that past rallies often reverted toward the 48-month moving average, now near $56,000. That view implies the potential for a sharp drop — almost 50% from recent peaks — if the current downtrend keeps going. Short, stark statements from established market commentators have pushed concern among some investors. Onchain Signals Point To A Milder Decline Reports have disclosed data from Glassnode and XWIN Research Japan that paint a different picture. Bitcoin slipped to $99,000 on Nov. 4, the first time in over four months it fell below the $100,000 mark, but it later recovered to around $101,500, according to Coingecko. $100,000 Bitcoin – a Speed Bump Toward $56,000? “Look at the chart” has been a mantra from Bitcoin bulls, but the market gods can refresh humility when prices stretch too far.

Glassnode highlighted the Relative Unrealized Loss metric, which currently sits at 3.1%. Readings at this level have historically matched mid-cycle corrections rather than full-blown bear markets. The firm noted losses under a 5% threshold have tended to be orderly revaluations, not panic-driven sell-offs. Bitcoin: Long-Term Forecasts Are Being Recalibrated Based on reports from ARK Invest, Cathie Wood trimmed her long-term Bitcoin projection by $300,000. She had earlier predicted a $1.5 million top by 2030; the cut implies a new peak target around $1.2 million. Wood said competition from stablecoins in emerging markets is reducing some demand for Bitcoin as a store of value. The move shows that even long-term bulls are adjusting assumptions as the market shifts.

Data reveals that 21,595 new XRP wallets were created within a 48-hour period, marking the highest growth level in eight months. This spike in wallet creation suggests renewed interest in XRP and may indicate increasing adoption among retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. New wallet creation is a key on-chain indicator of rising user engagement. While wallet numbers don’t directly track trading volume or price, they reflect growing network participation. Santiment’s data shows this recent surge in XRP wallets surpasses the year-long average, hinting at a potential shift in investor sentiment toward XRP. Wallet growth often signals broader market trends. Historically, spikes in XRP Ledger wallet creation have aligned with higher transactional activity and occasional bullish momentum. The current surge, amid XRP’s steady recovery from consolidation, intensifies speculation about near-term price upside. Ongoing XRP ecosystem developments, spanning strategic partnerships, enterprise adoption, and expanding DeFi applications, are drawing new participants to the network. At the same time, broader crypto market trends, often shaped by Bitcoin and Ethereum, are prompting investors to diversify into established altcoins like XRP. Senate Committee Prepares to Vote on CLARITY Act Before Thanksgiving Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman announced that the long-awaited CLARITY Act, co-sponsored by Sen. Cory Booker, will be voted on in committee before Thanksgiving to take place on November 27. The bill seeks to provide a clear regulatory framework for digital assets classified as commodities, offering critical guidance to the crypto market. “We’re going to get it done this year,” Boozman stated, underscoring the urgency of the effort despite the backdrop of a prolonged government shutdown. The CLARITY Act represents a rare moment of bipartisan collaboration on Capitol Hill, reflecting growing recognition that comprehensive regulation is essential to fostering innovation while protecting investors. The bill aims to resolve long-standing uncertainty in the U.S. digital asset market by clearly defining which cryptocurrencies fall under Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) oversight, removing regulatory gray areas that have hindered institutional adoption. Senators Boozman and Booker are reportedly working daily to finalize their sections, signaling a focused push for timely passage. Therefore, the CLARITY Act could unlock stronger U.S. crypto infrastructure, expand trading platforms and derivatives, and align the country with evolving global standards. Interestingly, bipartisan backing of the CLARITY Act underscores growing political recognition of cryptocurrency’s economic significance. Unlike past stalled efforts, this momentum reflects an urgent push to modernize U.S. financial regulations for blockchain and digital finance. If cleared by committee before Thanksgiving, the bill will advance toward full Senate consideration, providing a decisive framework for U.S. digital asset regulation. Conclusion The creation of 21,595 XRP wallets in 48 hours signals a surge of interest in the XRP Ledger, reflecting growing engagement from retail and institutional investors. While not a guarantee of price moves, it highlights accelerating adoption across the network. Meanwhile, if the CLARITY Act clears the Senate committee before Thanksgiving, it could be a turning point for the U.S. crypto market, providing the legal clarity investors and institutions have long sought. By defining a clear framework for digital assets classified as commodities, the bill aims to boost innovation, stabilize markets, and reinforce bipartisan confidence, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in a secure and transparent crypto ecosystem.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 14:01:15

Here’s What It Means",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-to-xrp-holders-the-longer-the-base-the-bigger-the-breakout-heres-what-it-means/,"Markets often move in silence before making their loudest statements. For nearly a year, XRP has remained trapped within a tight range. Its price has hovered around the $2.21 mark, frustrating impatient traders but intriguing experienced analysts. Prolonged consolidation is rarely meaningless— it often hints at the buildup of momentum waiting to explode. Analyst Spots a Familiar Pattern Renowned crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO recently shared a chart on X suggesting that XRP’s quiet phase may be far from ordinary. According to his analysis, XRP is forming one of its longest consolidation bases in years. He compared the current 348-day sideways stretch to previous bases that preceded massive upward surges. In each historical case, XRP’s extended base led to a breakout of substantial magnitude. $XRP has been moving sideways for almost a year now. The longer the base, the bigger the breakout! pic.twitter.com/zt8UrU1JZ4 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 6, 2025 Historical Patterns of XRP Consolidation Steph’s chart referenced earlier consolidation periods lasting 476 days in 2016, 216 in 2017, 404 in 2021, and 500 in 2024. Each of those bases occurred before a sharp rally. This recurring pattern suggests that long consolidations allow markets to reset, absorb liquidity, and prepare for the next major price cycle. XRP appears to be following that same script again. The Technical Significance of a Long Base From a technical perspective, a long base represents a period of accumulation. Sellers gradually exit, and long-term holders absorb supply. As selling pressure dries up, volatility compresses, and trading volume declines. When a catalyst emerges—be it macroeconomic or fundamental—the price often bursts out of the range with speed and strength. Steph emphasized that the “longer the base, the bigger the breakout,” a principle seen repeatedly in technical analysis. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Market Context While chart structures are crucial, they do not exist in isolation. XRP’s stability comes amid renewed interest in Ripple’s payment infrastructure and its growing ecosystem. The XRP Ledger continues to expand its use cases, and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin is now integrated into multiple payment solutions. Combined with a favorable macro environment and declining exchange reserves, XRP’s supply dynamics appear increasingly bullish. Potential Scenarios Ahead If XRP breaks decisively above the $2.40 resistance zone, technical traders may interpret it as the start of a new impulse wave. Such a move could echo prior breakouts that followed extended consolidation phases. However, if the price slips below $2.00, it would challenge the bullish thesis and possibly extend the sideways range. In conclusion, Steph’s analysis captures an essential truth about markets—time builds structure. XRP’s nearly year-long base is not just a period of stagnation but a potential springboard for its next major rally. History does not guarantee repetition , yet the rhythm of accumulation and expansion has rarely failed to leave its mark. For XRP holders, patience during this quiet stretch could soon be rewarded if the long base once again delivers a powerful breakout.

This move highlights the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market and raises questions about the future of institutional crypto investments. Founded by Tara Mac Aulay, a co-founder of Alameda Research, the fund once managed over $600 million in assets. Let’s dive into what led to this decision and its broader implications. Why is this crypto hedge fund winding down? Lantern Ventures is winding down due to a combination of market pressures and strategic reassessments. Reports from CoinDesk indicate the firm is negotiating potential sales and may transition into a family office. This shift reflects the challenges faced by many crypto hedge funds in maintaining profitability amid regulatory uncertainties and market fluctuations. Therefore, investors are closely watching how this impacts their portfolios. What does this mean for the crypto investment landscape? The closure of a major player like this crypto hedge fund signals a potential consolidation in the industry. Key points to consider include: Increased caution among institutional investors Potential opportunities for buyers acquiring distressed assets Lessons learned about risk management in volatile markets Moreover, this event could prompt other funds to reevaluate their strategies, ensuring they adapt to evolving market conditions. How can investors protect themselves in such situations? Investors should diversify their holdings and conduct thorough due diligence before committing to any crypto hedge fund. By understanding the fund’s management team, track record, and risk exposure, they can mitigate potential losses. Additionally, staying informed about market trends and regulatory changes is crucial for making sound investment decisions. What’s next for Lantern Ventures and its team? As Lantern Ventures winds down, the focus shifts to its future plans. The firm is exploring a sale to interested parties and might pivot to a family office model, concentrating on private investments. This transition could offer a more controlled environment for managing remaining assets. However, the exact outcome depends on negotiations and market reception. In summary, the winding down of Lantern Ventures serves as a stark reminder of the crypto market’s unpredictability. While it may cause short-term concerns, it also opens doors for innovation and more resilient investment models. Investors and industry players must learn from this experience to build a stronger financial ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What is a crypto hedge fund? A crypto hedge fund is an investment fund that pools capital to trade cryptocurrencies and related assets, aiming for high returns through various strategies. Why did Lantern Ventures decide to wind down? The decision stems from market challenges, including volatility and regulatory hurdles, leading the firm to return capital and explore new directions like a family office. How will investors be affected? Investors will receive their capital back, but they may face delays or reduced returns depending on the fund’s asset liquidation process. What is a family office in crypto? A family office manages investments for a single wealthy family, often focusing on long-term, private assets, which could provide more stability than a hedge fund. Are other crypto hedge funds at risk? While not all are at immediate risk, this event highlights the need for robust risk management and adaptability in the rapidly changing crypto landscape. Can investors still trust crypto hedge funds? Yes, but they should prioritize funds with transparent operations, experienced management, and a proven track record to minimize risks.

With the launch of RLUSD stablecoin support and the expansion of accepted collateral to include XRP, Bitnomial is setting a new standard for digital asset trading and capital efficiency. Building on its pioneering launch of crypto margin deposits in September 2025, Bitnomial now offers RLUSD and XRP margin for institutional clients trading leveraged perpetuals, futures, and options. Retail investors will soon access these features via Botanical, extending advanced trading flexibility to all users. Introducing RLUSD as margin collateral gives traders a USD-pegged stablecoin option, enabling efficient capital use, improved liquidity, and reduced exposure to crypto volatility, all while benefiting from the transparency and security of blockchain-native settlement. Expanding support to XRP underscores Bitnomial’s commitment to accommodating a broader spectrum of digital assets. XRP has long been recognized for its fast settlement times and low transaction costs, making it a natural choice for margin trading. By incorporating XRP as a collateral option, Bitnomial offers traders more flexibility in leveraging their digital portfolios and accessing liquidity, further enhancing the trading ecosystem. Therefore, Bitnomial’s innovative approach reflects a growing trend in the cryptocurrency market: the integration of stablecoins and leading digital assets as collateral for derivatives trading. This development not only improves capital efficiency but also signals increasing regulatory confidence in the use of stablecoins within U.S. financial markets. Kraken Co-CEO Predicts RLUSD as the Stablecoin of Choice at Ripple Swell 2025 At the recent Ripple Swell 2025 , Kraken Co-CEO David Ripley predicted a potential shift in digital finance: RLUSD is set to become the global settlement currency of choice, signaling a new era for companies and investors alike. “Every company will be settling with RLUSD,” Ripley stated confidently, highlighting the stablecoin’s growing adoption and credibility. This announcement underscores RLUSD’s emerging role not just as a medium of exchange, but as a foundational tool in corporate treasury management and cross-border payments. RLUSD stands out for its stability, transparency, and regulatory compliance, offering businesses a reliable alternative to fiat. Pegged to a trusted asset and backed by rigorous audits, it ensures predictable, cost-efficient, and fast transactions, ideal for global commerce. Therefore, Ripley’s statement reflects broader trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where companies increasingly seek stable, blockchain-based solutions for operational efficiency. With major exchanges like Bitnomial already accepting RLUSD as margin collateral, the stablecoin’s utility is expanding beyond simple transfers. It now serves as a strategic financial instrument, enabling businesses to optimize liquidity, reduce counterparty risk, and streamline digital asset operations. Meanwhile, RLUSD recently surged past the $1 billion market valuation, signalling its ascent amid a wave of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. Conclusion With RLUSD and XRP as margin collateral, Bitnomial boosts trading flexibility and capital efficiency, setting a new standard for U.S.-regulated crypto exchanges while empowering both institutional and retail traders in a maturing digital asset market. On the other hand, David Ripley’s endorsement of RLUSD at Ripple Swell 2025 marks a turning point for stablecoins. As businesses seek faster, transparent digital settlement, RLUSD is emerging as the go-to solution, signaling rising institutional confidence and a shift toward a blockchain-driven global economy where stablecoins may become the standard for corporate and cross-border transactions.",News|Crypto|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 15:07:07

At this point, the latest news came from Kazakhstan. According to Bloomberg, Kazakhstan is preparing to establish a national cryptocurrency reserve fund worth between $500 million and $1 billion. The fund's capital will come from assets seized or repatriated by the government from abroad and profits from state-supported mining operations. The fund in question avoids direct exposure to cryptocurrencies but will invest in ETFs and crypto-related companies. The fund is expected to become operational in early 2026. The fund will invest in ETFs and shares of crypto-focused companies, not directly in Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies, Timur Suleymanov, Governor of the Central Bank of Kazakhstan, told Bloomberg in an interview in London. “We will be very careful about direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. “I think we will have the fund operational by the end of the year, which is January of next year. Everyone is ready.” As you may recall, Kazakhstan announced plans for a state-managed cryptocurrency reserve in mid-2024. Last June, Kazakhstan announced the signing of a significant agreement with the Solana (SOL) Foundation. Accordingly, the Foundation announced its partnership with Kazakhstan to establish Central Asia's first Blockchain Economic Zone. This initiative aims to establish Kazakhstan as a regional blockchain hub, promote Web3 technologies, and attract global talent. *This is not investment advice.

This move comes during a period of declining price action, with ADA down over 10% in the last seven days. Despite a brief 24-hour price bounce, the broader trend remains under pressure. Whales Reduce Holdings as Price Drops Wallets holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 ADA have reduced their positions sharply since late October, which lines up with a fall in the asset’s price from above $0.60 to around $0.53. Whales have offloaded more than 4 million Cardano $ADA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/KsiZgNX1Jw — Ali (@ali_charts) November 7, 2025 This shift is visible in on-chain data showing lower aggregate holdings from this group. The selling adds to existing pressure on ADA’s price, which has already been falling over the past week. CryptoPotato reported that large holders have been slowly reducing their ADA exposure over the past few weeks. Without strong buying interest to absorb this supply, price levels may continue to face pressure. Sentiment Weak, But Early Buy Signal Appears Social and market sentiment around ADA is negative. Market Prophit posted : “CROWD = Bearish , MP = Bearish ,” showing both retail and model-based signals are tilted to the downside. However, Ali Martinez pointed to a possible shift, noting that the TD Sequential indicator on the 3-day chart has signaled a potential buying opportunity for ADA. The pattern printed a red “9” candle, which is often seen near the end of a downward move. While this does not confirm a reversal, it may indicate that the recent sell-off is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, technical indicators show that ADA is nearing oversold levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is now at 34.62. This number is close to the common oversold marker of 30. Levels in this range have previously aligned with short-term bounces. Source: TradingView ADA is still trading below the 9-day Exponential Moving Average, which is now at $0.57. It would need to reclaim this level to signal any shift in short-term momentum. Until then, the trend remains weak. Technical Support Zones in Focus Technical charts from Lucky show ADA holding at a key trendline near $0.50, inside a demand zone that has supported the price in the past. CryptoPotato also noted that this area has seen buying interest before. A breakout from this zone could open the door to higher targets, including a move back to $1.30.

A recent Bloomberg investigation reveals some troubling news about Polymarket trading volume that every crypto enthusiast should know about. What’s Really Happening with Polymarket Trading Volume? Researchers from Columbia University discovered that the Polymarket trading volume has been artificially inflated. This practice, known as wash trading, involves traders buying and selling from themselves to create false activity. The study found that nearly half of all trading volume on the platform might not represent genuine market interest. Why does this matter? Artificial inflation can mislead investors and participants about the platform’s actual popularity and liquidity. When you see high Polymarket trading volume , you might assume there’s strong market participation, but the reality could be quite different. How Does Wash Trading Affect Prediction Markets? Wash trading creates several problems for prediction markets: It distorts price discovery mechanisms It creates false confidence in market liquidity It can manipulate market sentiment It undermines trust in the entire ecosystem The Columbia researchers analyzed millions of transactions to identify patterns typical of wash trading. They found that certain accounts were consistently trading with themselves, creating the illusion of high Polymarket trading volume without actual market participation. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? This revelation about Polymarket trading volume highlights the importance of due diligence in cryptocurrency investments. While prediction markets offer exciting opportunities, investors should: Look beyond surface-level metrics like trading volume Research the underlying market mechanics Consider multiple data points before making decisions Stay informed about platform transparency The artificial inflation of Polymarket trading volume serves as a reminder that not all crypto metrics tell the complete story. Savvy investors need to dig deeper to understand what’s really happening behind the numbers. How Can We Identify Artificial Trading Activity? Spotting artificial Polymarket trading volume requires careful analysis. Look for these red flags: Consistent round-number trades Rapid buy-sell patterns between the same accounts Trading activity that doesn’t correlate with market events Unusual trading hours or patterns The Columbia University methodology provides a framework for identifying these patterns. Their research shows that artificial Polymarket trading volume often follows predictable patterns that sophisticated analysis can detect. The Future of Prediction Market Transparency This revelation about Polymarket trading volume could actually benefit the entire prediction market ecosystem. It highlights the need for: Better regulatory oversight Improved transparency measures Enhanced detection algorithms Industry-wide standards As the market matures, we can expect more sophisticated tools to detect and prevent artificial Polymarket trading volume inflation. This will ultimately lead to healthier, more reliable prediction markets. Frequently Asked Questions What is wash trading? Wash trading occurs when traders buy and sell assets to themselves, creating artificial trading volume without changing their market position. How does artificial volume affect prediction markets? Artificial volume can mislead participants about market liquidity, manipulate prices, and create false confidence in the platform’s activity levels. Can regular users detect wash trading? While sophisticated analysis is needed for definitive detection, users can look for unusual trading patterns and inconsistent volume metrics. What is Polymarket doing about this issue? While Polymarket hasn’t issued an official statement, the Bloomberg report will likely pressure the platform to address these concerns. Are other prediction markets affected? Wash trading can occur in any trading platform, though the extent varies. The Columbia study specifically examined Polymarket trading volume. How can I protect myself from manipulated markets? Diversify your investments, research platforms thoroughly, and use multiple data sources before making trading decisions. Found this investigation into Polymarket trading volume revealing?

This remarkable concession represents one of the most significant bipartisan breakthroughs in recent memory. What Does Senate GOP Leader Thune’s Announcement Mean? The statement from Senate GOP Leader Thune signals a dramatic shift in political strategy. After weeks of gridlock, the Republican leader has essentially thrown open the doors to Democratic priorities. This move comes as a new bill to resolve the government shutdown is scheduled for a vote later today. Political analysts are calling this unprecedented. The willingness of Senate GOP Leader Thune to accommodate Democratic demands suggests several key developments: Growing pressure to end the government shutdown immediately Recognition that compromise is necessary for governance Potential internal party divisions requiring strategic repositioning Why Would Senate GOP Leader Thune Make Such a Concession? The decision by Senate GOP Leader Thune to essentially surrender negotiating leverage raises important questions about the current political landscape. Several factors likely influenced this surprising move. First, the economic consequences of prolonged government shutdowns have become increasingly apparent. Second, public opinion has been turning against partisan gridlock. Third, Senate GOP Leader Thune may be calculating that this goodwill gesture could pay dividends in future negotiations. Moreover, the timing suggests strategic considerations. By making this move now, Senate GOP Leader Thune positions his party as reasonable compromisers while potentially putting Democrats in a difficult position if they don’t reciprocate. How Will This Impact the Government Shutdown Resolution? The announcement from Senate GOP Leader Thune fundamentally changes the dynamics of the shutdown negotiations. With Republicans essentially removing their objections, the path to resolution becomes much clearer. Key implications include: Faster resolution of the government shutdown Potential for smoother legislative process moving forward Changed public perception of both parties’ willingness to govern Possible backlash from conservative factions within the GOP The bill scheduled for vote today now faces dramatically different prospects. What seemed like another partisan standoff has transformed into potential bipartisan cooperation, thanks to Senate GOP Leader Thune’s unexpected position. What Are the Long-Term Political Consequences? The move by Senate GOP Leader Thune could reshape political relationships for months to come. While it immediately addresses the government shutdown crisis, the long-term effects merit careful consideration. This decision might: Establish new patterns of bipartisan cooperation Alter power dynamics within both parties Change how future negotiations are approached Impact election strategies and voter perceptions The bold stance taken by Senate GOP Leader Thune demonstrates that sometimes breaking political norms can create new opportunities for progress. However, it also carries significant risks for party unity and leadership authority. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Political Compromise The announcement from Senate GOP Leader Thune represents a watershed moment in American politics. By offering Democrats everything they want, he has fundamentally altered the shutdown negotiation landscape and potentially set a new precedent for bipartisan cooperation. This surprising development shows that even in deeply divided times, political leaders can choose cooperation over conflict. The decision by Senate GOP Leader Thune may well be remembered as a turning point in how Washington approaches governance challenges. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly did Senate GOP Leader Thune announce? Senate GOP Leader Thune announced his party’s willingness to give Democrats everything they want in negotiations to end the government shutdown, along with scheduling a new bill vote for later today. Why is this announcement so significant? This represents a major departure from typical political negotiations where parties usually maintain some bargaining leverage rather than conceding completely to opposition demands. How will this affect the government shutdown? The announcement significantly increases the likelihood of a swift resolution since Republican objections have been removed from the negotiation process. What motivated Senate GOP Leader Thune’s decision? While not explicitly stated, factors likely include economic pressure, public opinion against gridlock, and strategic political calculations about future negotiations. Could this decision hurt Senator Thune politically? It potentially risks backlash from conservative party members while potentially gaining support from moderates and independents who value compromise and governance. What happens next in the legislative process? The scheduled bill vote will proceed, but with dramatically changed dynamics since Republican opposition has been withdrawn.

Once considered a lagging altcoin, Filecoin (FIL) has now re-emerged as a leader in the Decentralised Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) and artificial intelligence (AI) storage narrative, reclaiming key technical levels and drawing institutional attention. Buyers regain control amid short squeeze and technical breakout After months of stagnation, Filecoin has burst back to life, climbing from $1.30 to above $2.18 in less than two days. Notably, the price surge comes with a wave of short liquidations and spot buying, signalling that traders are regaining confidence in the asset. The rally has flipped short-term sentiment bullish for the first time since August, with the Filecoin price breaking above its 20 and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) around $1.89. FIL’s price has also cleared a major resistance at $1.93, pushing toward the 200-day EMA currently near $2.39. Filecoin price chart | Source: CoinMarketCap A decisive close above the 200-day EMA would confirm a structural breakout, potentially opening the door to $2.80 and $3.00. Analysts warn , however, that a failure to hold above $1.98 could return FIL to its previous range between $1.40 and $1.70. DePIN and AI fuel a powerful narrative shift The rally comes ahead of the highly anticipated DePIN Day on November 18 in Buenos Aires, co-hosted by the Filecoin Foundation. DEPIN DAY & DEPINED PODCAST @depinday · Follow 🇦🇷 DePIN Day lands in Buenos Aires — right in the heart of @EFDevcon Week!🗓️ November 18, 2025 — the 13th edition of our global conference series dedicated to Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks organized by @fluence_project & co-hosted by @FilFoundation 🌞🤝🏻 In 5:57 pm · 20 Oct 2025 66 Reply Copy link Read 23 replies The event has become a catalyst for speculation that new partnerships or protocol upgrades could be announced. The broader DePIN sector — focused on decentralised physical infrastructure — has surged 11% even as the rest of the crypto market declined, with Filecoin leading the charge. Beyond the hype, real adoption is giving weight to the optimism. Filecoin has expanded its role in AI projects such as SingularityNET and AethirCloud, which use its decentralised storage for handling large datasets and training models. According to Messari’s Q1 2025 report, over 800 enterprise clients now store more than 1,000 terabytes each on the Filecoin network. Reduced gas fees and new collaborations with institutions like the Smithsonian, MIT, and Solana have also strengthened the project’s fundamentals. Institutional interest reinforces the rally Adding to the bullish tone, Grayscale Investments recently increased its Filecoin holdings to a record 2.2 million tokens, highlighting growing institutional confidence. The Grayscale Filecoin Trust now trades above $3 per share — at a premium to its net asset value — showing that investors are willing to pay extra for exposure. Historical data suggests that each time FIL’s daily trading volume exceeds $1 billion, strong rallies tend to follow. November’s volume of over $1.8 billion marks the highest in nearly a year, reflecting renewed enthusiasm from both retail and institutional players. Can the Filecoin price sustain the recovery? Whether the current momentum can translate into a longer-term trend will depend on what follows DePIN Day and how effectively Filecoin converts attention into adoption. For now, analysts caution that the FIL price remains nearly overbought, with the relative strength index hovering around 65. While the momentum appears strong, some short-term cooling is possible before the next leg higher. Key support sits near $2.15, and holding that level could confirm a healthy consolidation phase.

Bitcoin currently trades near $101,000, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The bank’s strategists, led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, noted in a Wednesday report that crypto markets corrected nearly 20% from recent peaks following record liquidations in perpetual futures on October 10 , the largest in crypto history, followed by smaller liquidations on November 3, triggered by the $128 million Balancer exploit .

The ratio of open interest in bitcoin perpetual futures to market capitalization fell from above-average levels back to historical norms within weeks, with similar patterns visible in Ethereum markets, though less pronounced there. “ Overall, we believe that perpetual futures are the most important instruments to watch in the current juncture, and the message from the recent stabilization is that deleveraging in perpetual futures is likely behind us, ” the analysts wrote. They added that while exchange-traded funds saw modest redemptions recently, these paled compared with inflows during the weeks ending October 3 and October 10. The analysts also observed opposite dynamics in CME futures, where Ethereum experienced more liquidations than Bitcoin futures. Their analysis points to perpetual futures as the critical barometer for current market conditions rather than traditional futures or ETF flows. Gold Volatility Makes Bitcoin More Attractive Rising gold volatility has enhanced Bitcoin’s appeal to investors on a risk-adjusted basis , according to JPMorgan’s analysis. The bitcoin-to-gold volatility ratio drifted below 2.0, implying Bitcoin currently consumes about 1.8 times more risk capital than gold. Source: NewHedge Based on this relationship, the analysts calculated that Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of approximately $2.1 trillion would need to rise by nearly 67%. This implies a theoretical price of around $170,000, to match the roughly $6.2 trillion in total private-sector investment in gold through ETFs and physical holdings. Bitcoin currently trades about $68,000 below JPMorgan’s volatility-adjusted fair value relative to gold. “ This mechanical exercise thus implies significant upside for bitcoin over the next 6-12 months ,” the analysts stated. The projection represents JPMorgan’s latest in a series of bullish forecasts, following similar analyses in October that estimated potential upside toward $165,000 by year-end and August projections of $126,000, a level Bitcoin surpassed when it reached an all-time high above $126,200 on October 6. Major Institutions Signal Growing Bitcoin Adoption Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster recently announced the $11.6 trillion firm will begin offering Bitcoin trading in the first half of 2026. “ We’re having a lot of success in the crypto space ,” Wurster said in a CNBC interview. “ Our clients actually own 20% of them and our clients are coming to our research site 90% more than they were last year .” JUST IN: $11.6 trillion Charles Schwab CEO says they will begin offering #Bitcoin trading in 2026 ""We're having a lot of success in the crypto space"" pic.twitter.com/P9qctpYwwD — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) November 6, 2025 Wurster explained that most investors prefer exchange-traded products as “ a safe and comfortable way for them to invest ” rather than interacting directly with blockchain networks. “ We have lots of clients who have the vast majority of their assets at Schwab but are holding some at digitally native firms and keep asking us to launch this so they can bring their crypto assets to us, ” he added. Bitcoin Bulls Point to Historic Cycle Patterns Fundstrat Global Advisors’ CIO, Tom Lee, has also recently characterized recent market weakness as liquidity-driven rather than fundamental. “ The bitcoin dip wasn’t about fundamentals—it was liquidity plus shutdown plus funding stress plus the October 10th deleveraging ,” Lee said, adding that confidence needs “ a couple more weeks to rebuild” but there’s “no systemic damage and no FTX-style contagion this time. “ THE BULL MARKET DIDN’T END — IT JUST RESTARTED Tom Lee just laid it out clearly that the #Bitcoin dip wasn’t about fundamentals — it was liquidity + shutdown + funding stress + the October 10th deleveraging.

This development signals potential progress for XRP investors who have been eagerly awaiting mainstream financial products for the digital asset. What Does the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF Listing Mean? The appearance of the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation website under ticker XRPZ represents a significant step forward. However, investors should understand that this listing doesn’t guarantee SEC approval. The DTCC processes these listings independently from regulatory reviews. This development follows Franklin Templeton’s growing interest in digital assets. The asset management giant has been exploring cryptocurrency opportunities, making this Franklin Templeton XRP ETF listing particularly noteworthy for market observers. Why is the DTCC Listing Important for the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF? The DTCC serves as the backbone of U.S. financial markets, handling securities settlement and clearing. A listing here means the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF has progressed through initial administrative steps. This includes: Assignment of the official ticker symbol XRPZ Initial system integration preparation Infrastructure setup for potential trading However, the critical SEC approval remains pending. The regulatory body must still review and approve the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF before any trading can begin. What Challenges Does the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF Face? The path to approval for any cryptocurrency ETF, including the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF, involves navigating complex regulatory requirements. The SEC has historically been cautious about crypto-based financial products, particularly those involving assets like XRP that have faced legal scrutiny. Market participants should monitor several key factors that could influence the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF’s approval chances: Regulatory clarity around XRP’s classification Market manipulation concerns and how they’re addressed Custody solutions for the underlying asset Investor protection measures in the proposal How Could the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF Impact Investors? If approved, the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF would provide traditional investors with regulated exposure to XRP. This represents a major milestone for cryptocurrency adoption in mainstream finance. The Franklin Templeton XRP ETF could potentially: Offer easier access to XRP exposure Provide institutional-grade custody solutions Create new arbitrage opportunities Increase overall market liquidity The Franklin Templeton XRP ETF listing on DTCC shows the asset manager’s commitment to navigating the regulatory landscape. Their established reputation in traditional finance could work in favor of eventual approval. What’s Next for the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF? While the DTCC listing generates optimism, the SEC review process will determine the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF’s fate. Investors should watch for official SEC filings and public comments. The regulatory timeline can be unpredictable, but this development suggests progress behind the scenes. The appearance of the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF on DTCC represents hope for broader cryptocurrency acceptance in regulated markets. However, patience remains essential as the regulatory process unfolds. Frequently Asked Questions What is the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF? The Franklin Templeton XRP ETF is a proposed exchange-traded fund that would track the price of XRP, providing investors with regulated exposure to the cryptocurrency. Does the DTCC listing mean the ETF is approved? No, the DTCC listing is an administrative step that occurs independently of SEC approval. It prepares the infrastructure but doesn’t guarantee regulatory clearance. What ticker symbol would the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF use? The proposed ticker symbol appearing on the DTCC website is XRPZ. When might the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF begin trading? There’s no confirmed timeline. Trading can only begin after SEC approval, which could take months or longer depending on regulatory considerations. How does this affect current XRP investors? The DTCC listing generates positive sentiment but doesn’t immediately impact existing XRP holdings. Approval could bring increased institutional interest and liquidity. What makes Franklin Templeton’s approach different? Franklin Templeton brings established traditional finance expertise and resources, potentially helping navigate regulatory challenges more effectively. Found this information valuable?

The flagship cryptocurrency is down 1.41% during the ongoing session, trading around $99,854. Bitcoin (BTC) Struggles As Markets Turn Red Bitcoin joined US stocks on a downward trajectory as markets remain jittery about US economic cues. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% and has slipped below the $100,000 mark. Markets reacted adversely to news of job cuts and rising US household debt. A Challenger, Gray & Christmas report confirmed the economy lost 153,000 jobs last month, the highest since 2003. “October’s pace of job cutting was much higher than average for the month. ”The lack of official employment data due to the ongoing government shutdown has also left markets uncertain, with the report resonating with several participants. Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter suggested that the US economy may need more interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. “BREAKING: US employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October, marking a +175% surge and the highest for any October since 2003, per Challenger Gray. Employers cite cost-cutting and AI as the primary drivers of these cuts. We need more rate cuts.” However, trading company QCP Capital noted that a rate cut in December was not guaranteed. “Markets are now pricing 60–65% odds of a follow-up move, but the longer the blackout drags on, the more comfortable policymakers may become with pausing, which in turn keeps the dollar firm and credit conditions tight.” Bitcoin ETFs Extend Losing Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs have reported net outflows for six consecutive days after reporting $137 million in net outflows on November 5, according to data from SoSoValue. The total net outflows over the past six days currently stand at over $2 billion, further pressuring price action. However, trading activity was muted, with only half of the twelve US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs registering investor activity. Fidelity’s FBTC reported $113 million in net inflows, and Ark 21Shares registered $83 million in net inflows. Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck ETFs also reported inflows. However, these inflows were more than offset by BlackRock’s IBIT, which registered $375 million in outflows. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) briefly fell below $100,000 during the ongoing session, dropping to a low of $99,170 before reclaiming $100,000 and moving to its current level. According to Thomas Perfumo, global economist at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, demand for BTC from digital asset treasuries such as MicroStrategy has dropped significantly. Strategy’s regular BTC purchases were a key driver behind the flagship cryptocurrency’s stunning price increase. “Crypto ETFs have also experienced significant outflows, despite skewing bullish during prior months of choppy price action. While the market was stabilizing after the Oct. 10 liquidation event, this latest ‘reset’ event certainly reduced short-term risk tolerance further. This is evident by the continued retreat in altcoins in favor of assets like Bitcoin, whose market cap dominance ticked higher yet again.” BTC started the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising 0.84% on Friday and 0.56% on Saturday to settle at $111,666. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose nearly 3% to cross $114,000 and settle at $114,548. BTC reached an intraday high of $116,410 on Monday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $114,087, ultimately dropping 0.40%. Selling pressure and volatility persisted on Tuesday as the price fell 1.03% to $112,906. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC fell 2.55% and settled at $110.032. Source: TradingView Volatility and selling pressure persisted on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $111,629, fell to an intraday low of $106,279, and settled at $108,308. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC returned to positive territory on Friday, rising 1.15% and settling at $108,555. Price action remained positive over the weekend, with BTC increasing 0.45% on Saturday and 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $110,536. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC fell nearly 4% and settled at $106,557. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the flagship cryptocurrency slipped below $100,000, falling to a low of $98,892 before settling at $101,468. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising over 2% and settling at $103,869 despite selling pressure. BTC returned to bearish territory on Thursday, dropping 2.48% to a low of $100,235 before settling at $101,290.

This massive wipeout serves as a stark reminder of the extreme volatility that can strike crypto markets without warning, leaving traders scrambling to protect their positions. What Does $105 Million in Futures Liquidated Actually Mean? When we talk about futures liquidated, we’re referring to the forced closure of leveraged trading positions. This happens when traders can’t meet margin requirements during sharp price movements. The recent $105 million in futures liquidated represents real money lost by traders who bet wrong on market direction. This massive liquidation event occurred within a single hour, highlighting how quickly conditions can change in crypto markets. Moreover, the damage extends beyond that brutal sixty minutes – over $766 million in futures have been liquidated during the past 24 hours. Why Are So Many Futures Being Liquidated Now? Several factors typically trigger these cascade effects: Extreme volatility causing rapid price swings Over-leveraged positions that can’t withstand minor corrections Market sentiment shifts that catch traders off guard Cascade effects where one liquidation triggers others The scale of futures liquidated in such a short time suggests many traders were caught using excessive leverage. When prices move against these positions, exchanges automatically close them to prevent further losses. How Can Traders Protect Against Future Liquidations? Surviving these volatile periods requires smart risk management strategies. First, always use proper position sizing and avoid over-leveraging. Second, set stop-loss orders at reasonable levels. Third, maintain adequate margin reserves for unexpected moves. Remember that when markets turn volatile, the number of futures liquidated can spike dramatically. Staying disciplined with risk management helps prevent becoming another statistic in these liquidation reports. The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Crypto Markets While $105 million in futures liquidated sounds alarming, it’s important to view this in context. The cryptocurrency market has weathered much larger liquidation events in the past. However, this recent activity signals increased volatility that could continue in the short term. Traders should watch for patterns in futures liquidated data, as these often precede larger market moves. The high volume suggests significant repositioning is occurring across the market. Key Takeaways From This Liquidation Event This dramatic hour of trading offers valuable lessons for every crypto participant. The massive amount of futures liquidated demonstrates why risk management remains crucial in volatile markets. It also shows how quickly conditions can change, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance. Most importantly, this event reinforces that leverage works both ways – it can amplify gains but also accelerate losses when markets move against you. Frequently Asked Questions What causes futures to be liquidated? Futures get liquidated when traders can’t maintain the required margin for their leveraged positions during price movements against their bets. How does $105 million in liquidations compare to historical events? While significant, this is smaller than major historical liquidation events that have seen billions wiped out in single days during extreme market conditions. Can I prevent my positions from being liquidated? Yes, by using proper risk management, avoiding excessive leverage, maintaining adequate margin, and setting strategic stop-loss orders. Which exchanges saw the most liquidations? Major exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit typically see the highest liquidation volumes during market volatility events. Do liquidations affect spot market prices? Yes, large liquidations can create selling pressure that impacts spot prices, especially when cascading liquidations occur. How often do these large liquidation events happen? Significant liquidation clusters occur during periods of high volatility, which can happen multiple times per year in crypto markets.

A new study by researchers at Columbia University suggests that trading volume on Polymarket, one of the world’s most popular prediction platforms, may be significantly exaggerated due to wash trading. The report comes as Polymarket plans to re-enter the U.S. market with the acquisition of a sports prediction platform, QCX. Columbia researchers find traces of inflated trading on Polymarket According to the research paper, which was published Thursday on the open-access platform SSRN, around 25% of all buying and selling on Polymarket over the past three years appears to be a result of artificial trading. Wash trading occurs when the same users rapidly buy and sell identical contracts to one another. It creates the illusion of heavy market activity without taking on real risk. The study was co-authored by Yash Kanoria and Hongyao Ma from Columbia Business School, Rajiv Sethi of Barnard College, and Allen Sirolly, a Columbia doctoral student. The research was conducted on blockchain data from Polygon, where Polymarket transactions are recorded. The four authors clarified that their results are estimates rather than definitive proof, but they believe the evidence shows a clear pattern of inflated activity. They also suggested that much of the wash trading may have been conducted by users of the platform rather than the company itself. Some traders, they note, may have inflated their activity in hopes of qualifying for a potential token airdrop . Polymarket’s founder hinted at a possible token launch on social media in early October. According to Sirolly, “peaks in organic trading are tied to real events, while peaks in wash trading tend to align with rumors about token issuance.” “Wash trading doesn’t add liquidity or information to the market,” said Kanoria in an email. “It would be valuable to distinguish authentic from inauthentic volume.” The study does not directly accuse Polymarket of anything, but it does highlight several design features on the platform that make wash trading possible, like the lack of transaction fees, the use of stablecoins, and the ability for users to create multiple anonymous blockchain wallets. Wash trading is not new to crypto markets. A 2022 report found that up to 70% of activity on unregulated exchanges was artificial. Wash trading and its effect on the market The researchers identified signs of wash trading in 14% of the 1.26 million wallets active on Polymarket. These accounts often traded among themselves and rarely interacted with other sides of the market. Wash trades made up roughly 60% of total volume last December, fell to about 5% in May 2025, and then rose again to around 20% in early October, according to the study. In regulated markets, wash trading practices are generally considered a form of manipulation because they mislead investors about genuine demand. Interest in prediction markets has been surging due to platforms like Polymarket and its U.S. rival Kalshi Inc., allowing users to bet on real-world events. The researchers warn that inflated figures may affect how investors and analysts view Polymarket’s strength in relation to its competitors. There’s also the question of whether its odds truly reflect public sentiment. Polymarket is currently preparing to re-enter the U.S. market after settling a $1.4 million case with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) from 2022 for operating an unregistered exchange. In July, the CFTC and the U.S. Department of Justice concluded separate investigations into whether the firm continued allowing U.S. traders afterward. Polymarket intends to come back through its acquisition of QCX, a CFTC-regulated platform focused on sports prediction markets.

This breakthrough signals growing institutional confidence and mainstream adoption. Several key factors are contributing to this impressive performance: Increased institutional investment from major financial players Growing acceptance as a hedge against inflation Technical breakthroughs in blockchain scalability Regulatory clarity in major markets worldwide How Does This BTC Price Compare to Historical Performance?

This represents a substantial increase from previous resistance levels and demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s resilience. The market has shown consistent upward momentum despite occasional corrections, proving Bitcoin’s staying power in the digital asset space. Moreover, the sustained BTC price above six figures indicates maturing market dynamics. Unlike previous volatile spikes, this achievement appears supported by fundamental factors rather than speculative frenzy. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? For current investors, the BTC price breakthrough brings both excitement and important considerations. While celebrating gains is natural, understanding market cycles remains crucial. The current BTC price level offers opportunities for: Portfolio rebalancing to maintain risk management Strategic profit-taking for long-term holders Dollar-cost averaging for new entrants Diversification into other promising assets Can the BTC Price Maintain This Momentum? The critical question facing every market participant is whether the BTC price can sustain these levels.

Several factors will determine future BTC price direction: Global economic conditions and monetary policy Adoption rates among retail and institutional investors Technological developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem Regulatory developments across key jurisdictions Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin The BTC price reaching $101,000 marks a transformative moment in cryptocurrency history. This achievement validates Bitcoin’s position as a serious financial asset while opening new possibilities for global finance.

Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin at this price? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, many analysts believe Bitcoin still has long-term growth potential. However, investors should only commit funds they can afford to lose and consider dollar-cost averaging strategies. How does this price compare to Bitcoin’s all-time high? The $101,000 level represents a new all-time high for Bitcoin, significantly surpassing previous records and demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s growing maturity and acceptance. What are the risks at this price level? Key risks include price volatility, regulatory changes, market corrections, and technological challenges.

Według analityków strach jest jednak przesadzony,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-moze-zaliczyc-50-spadek/,"Ostatnie wahania kursu Bitcoina znów podzieliły rynek. Część ekspertów ostrzega przed możliwą głęboką korektą, inni jednak wskazują, że obecne osłabienie to tylko krótkotrwały oddech przed kolejnym ruchem wzrostowym. Choć rynek reaguje emocjonalnie, dane on-chain sugerują, że nie ma powodu do paniki. Czy Bitcoin może zaliczyć 50% spadek? Tradycyjna analiza ostrzega przed ryzykiem Według analityka Bloomberga, Mike’a McGlone’a, obecne spadki mogą się jeszcze nie skończyć. W swoim wpisie na platformie X stwierdził, że ruch poniżej 100 000 dolarów może być tylko etapem większej korekty. Analityk stwierdził, że aktualne wydarzenia to możliwy próg zwalniający w kierunku 56 000 dolarów. McGlone przypomniał, że wcześniejsze wzrosty Bitcoina często kończyły się powrotem w okolice 48-miesięcznej średniej kroczącej, która obecnie znajduje się właśnie w rejonie 56 000 dolarów. Ta prognoza sugeruje potencjalny spadek nawet o prawie 50% od ostatnich szczytów. Tego typu ostrzeżenia, zwłaszcza gdy pochodzą od uznanych analityków, szybko rozpalają wyobraźnię inwestorów i powodują zwiększoną ostrożność na rynku. Dane on-chain pokazują łagodniejszy obraz Z kolei dane z Glassnode i XWIN Research Japan wskazują, że obecna korekta może być już bliska końca. 4 listopada Bitcoin spadł do poziomu 99 000 dolarów, po raz pierwszy od ponad czterech miesięcy schodząc poniżej psychologicznej bariery 100 000 USD. Jednak wkrótce potem odbił do około 101 500 dolarów, jak wynika z danych Coingecko. Kluczowy wskaźnik on-chain, Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) , zniżkował do poziomów, które w przeszłości sygnalizowały lokalne dołki. Glassnode zwrócił uwagę także na Relative Unrealized Loss , który obecnie wynosi 3,1%. Odczyty na tym poziomie historycznie pokrywały się z korektami w połowie cyklu, a nie z pełnowymiarowymi rynkami niedźwiedzia – podkreśla firma. Glassnode dodał również, że straty poniżej progu 5% miały w przeszłości charakter uporządkowanej wyceny, a nie panicznej wyprzedaży. W praktyce oznacza to, że choć rynek jest nerwowy, struktura korekty nie przypomina scenariusza z lat, w których Bitcoin wchodził w długie bessy. $100,000 Bitcoin – a Speed Bump Toward $56,000?“Look at the chart” has been a mantra from Bitcoin bulls, but the market gods can refresh humility when prices stretch too far. Synonymous with humility is mean reversion, and my look at the chart shows how normal it’s been for the… pic.twitter.com/ijzJ8L4SjT — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) November 6, 2025 Długoterminowe prognozy weryfikowane Nawet najbardziej znane postacie świata inwestycji dostosowują dziś swoje przewidywania. Cathie Wood z ARK Invest obniżyła swoją długoterminową prognozę ceny Bitcoina o 300 000 dolarów. Wcześniej spodziewała się, że do 2030 roku BTC osiągnie poziom 1,5 miliona dolarów , teraz jej szacunki wskazują raczej na 1,2 miliona . Wood tłumaczyła, że rosnąca popularność stablecoinów na rynkach wschodzących ogranicza częściowo popyt na Bitcoina jako magazyn wartości. Konkurencja ze strony stablecoinów zmniejsza część popytu na Bitcoina w krajach rozwijających się – powiedziała. To pokazuje, że nawet długoterminowi optymiści dostrzegają zmianę dynamiki rynku i dostosowują swoje założenia. Sentymen rynkowy na rozdrożu Nastroje inwestorów testowane są zarówno przez dane, jak i narrację. Krótkoterminowe wahania cen pozostają duże, ale kluczowe wskaźniki on-chain wciąż utrzymują się w przedziałach, które nie wskazują na ekstremalne napięcie. Niektórzy analitycy i liderzy funduszy venture wciąż ostrzegają przed możliwymi głębszymi spadkami. Inwestorzy muszą więc ważyć między analizą techniczną, sygnałami z blockchaina a zmieniającymi się trendami w wykorzystaniu Bitcoina i innych cyfrowych aktywów. Nowe technologie zmieniają krajobraz Bitcoina – nadchodzi Bitcoin Hyper Właśnie w tym kontekście coraz częściej mówi się o projektach, które mają wzmocnić fundamenty ekosystemu BTC. Jednym z najbardziej obiecujących jest Bitcoin Hyper , czyli pierwsze w historii rozwiązanie warstwy drugiej dla Bitcoina. Jego celem jest usprawnienie sieci i wprowadzenie funkcji, których Bitcoin do tej pory nie oferował. Chodzi przede wszystkim o błyskawiczne transakcje, wsparcie smart kontraktów , zdecentralizowanych aplikacji czy nawet memecoinów . Bitcoin Hyper działa równolegle z głównym łańcuchem Bitcoina, korzystając z Solana Virtual Machine i dowodów wiedzy zerowej . Pozwala to na skalowalność i bezpieczeństwo transakcji. Ogromne zainteresowanie inwestorów Potencjał projektu dostrzegli już inwestorzy. W przedsprzedaży Bitcoin Hyper zebrano ponad 26 milionów dolarów , a cena tokena $HYPER wynosi obecnie $0,013235. To dowód, że rynek szuka innowacji, które nie tylko zwiększą funkcjonalność Bitcoina, ale też otworzą nowe możliwości dla świata DeFi , NFT i gier blockchainowych. Token $HYPER służy nie tylko do opłat transakcyjnych, ale też do stakingu i uczestnictwa w zarządzaniu siecią. Co więcej, projekt zarezerwował aż 30% całkowitej podaży na dalszy rozwój, co wskazuje na długofalowe ambicje zespołu. Dlaczego Bitcoin Hyper może być ważny w okresach korekt W czasie, gdy część rynku obawia się dalszych spadków, projekty takie jak Bitcoin Hyper mogą odegrać kluczową rolę w dywersyfikacji i zwiększeniu użyteczności Bitcoina . Wprowadzenie warstwy 2 może poprawić przepustowość, obniżyć opłaty transakcyjne. Może uczynić to Bitcoina bardziej konkurencyjnym wobec innych ekosystemów, takich jak Ethereum czy Solana. Dla inwestorów szukających kryptowaluty do inwestycji , $HYPER może być ciekawą opcją, nie jako alternatywa dla Bitcoina, ale jako jego rozszerzenie, wzmacniające możliwości całej sieci. Rynek szuka równowagi Rynek kryptowalut znajduje się w punkcie zwrotnym. Z jednej strony wciąż pojawiają się głosy ostrzegające przed spadkiem BTC nawet o połowę. Z drugiej jednak dane i rozwój technologiczny pokazują, że fundamenty ekosystemu są silniejsze niż kiedykolwiek. Dziś, gdy coraz więcej osób poszukuje najlepszej giełdy kryptowalut do zakupu aktywów cyfrowych, warto pamiętać, że nie liczy się tylko cena, ale też to, jak dane projekty realnie wpływają na przyszłość technologii blockchain.",Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-07 15:40:10

ICP price has surged more than 180% in just one week, even as most of the market remains quiet. ICP recorded over $1.31 billion in trading volume within 24 hours, making it the eighth most traded crypto asset excluding stablecoins. That kind of volume is wild, especially considering ICP was being called “dead” just a week ago. What’s clear now is that some altcoins are running their own bull markets, regardless of the broader trend. Zcash and ICP are perfect examples. Zcash led the privacy sector, and now ICP is taking the lead in the AI space. Investor sentiment has turned sharply positive. CoinGecko data shows that around 86% of traders are bullish on ICP. As one investor put it, “It’s the only blockchain that can run end-to-end internet services fully on-chain.” That explains why smart money is still getting involved, even after such a big run-up. Why Exactly Is ICP Crypto Pumping? The DFINITY Foundation just launched Caffeine, a major upgrade to its AI platform that now supports text, images, and even code prompts. It allows developers to create AI-powered apps on the chain using plain language instead of complicated coding. https://t.co/c91gCXdahA builders grow in number every day They 1) aren't using Caffeine to speculate on tokens, 2) don't care their secure apps run on a blockchain/just want to create great apps Crazy: the Internet Computer (ICP) just delivered Web3 its 1st true breakout — dom williams.icp ∞ (@dominic_w) October 29, 2025 Every app that runs on Caffeine burns what ICP calls “cycles,” which are basically its version of gas fees. The more apps built and used, the more cycles are burned. That reduces the overall token supply over time, which could help push the price higher in the long run. What makes Caffeine stand out is that it runs completely on-chain without depending on big cloud providers like Amazon or Google. That makes it more secure, truly decentralized, and positions ICP as a strong player in the growing decentralized AI space. Internet Computer Price Prediction: Will ICP Stop at $10? Probably not, because if it’s following the pattern it’s currently making, it might just break out. Since the start of the run, it’s been moving the same way: accumulation, big breakout, then accumulation again. Source: ICPUSD / TradingView Looking at the chart, ICP seems to be setting up for the next leg higher. It’s consolidating nicely around that $8–$10 range, right where previous runs paused before blasting upward. The RSI hovering near 60 means momentum’s cooling off just enough for buyers to reload. If price keeps respecting that $7.20 support, it could easily be another textbook accumulation before the next impulse wave. A clean break above $10.50 would likely confirm it, opening the door for a run toward the $13–$15 zone, right in line with how it’s been playing this cycle so far. PepeNode: The Virtual Mining Game That Could Mint the Next Generation of Crypto Millionaires While ICP is making waves in the AI space, another project is quietly gaining serious traction in the crypto gaming scene, PepeNode . It takes the old-school idea of crypto mining and flips it into a virtual game anyone can join, no hardware or power bills needed. In PepeNode, players build and upgrade digital mining rigs, buy nodes, and grow their setups to earn PEPENODE tokens. The cooler part is that these tokens can also earn rewards in top meme coins like PEPE and others, giving it a fun and rewarding twist. What really makes PepeNode stand out is its token system. Around 70 percent of all tokens used for upgrades are burned forever, keeping supply tight and helping long-term value. On top of that, players can already stake their tokens for a huge 621% APY before the game even officially launches. It captures that early Bitcoin mining vibe, but this time it’s virtual, easy to get into, and open to everyone. PepeNode has already raised more than 2.07 million dollars , and you can join using ETH, BNB, USDT, or even a credit card.

While Ethereum and most altcoins accompanied this decline, some altcoins became the stars of the day with their rise. At the top of these altcoins was Filecoin (FIL), a very surprising name. Filecoin has staged one of the biggest retracements of the year, rising over 50% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This surge has seen FIL climb from $1.38 to over $2. While this sharp rise surprised everyone, experts shared their predictions about why the Filecoin price rose so much today. Accordingly, the biggest reason was cited as the approaching DePIN Day on November 18, a key event for the decentralized infrastructure sector, and the Filecoin Developer Summit (November 13-15). Some experts, however, argued that Filecoin may soon announce significant updates or partnerships. Experts noted that Filecoin closed trading above $2, confirming the robustness of its medium-term uptrend. They added that Filecoin's surge wasn't simply a short-term recovery, but rather demonstrated that the decentralized infrastructure sector is generating independent momentum within the market. Filecoin rose the most, ranking first, followed by Near, FET, ZEC, and ICP. According to CoinMarketCap data, FIL topped the list with a surge of more than 50% in the last 24 hours. FIL was followed by NEAR with a 21% increase, FET with a 19.7% increase, ZCash (ZEC) with a 16% increase, and Internet Computer with a 15% increase. On the other hand, according to Coinmarketcap data, the biggest losers in the last 24 hours were as follows: Decred (DCR) in first place with a 30.9% loss, Dash (DASH) in second place with a 14.4% loss, ZKsync (ZK) in third place with an 11.2% loss and SPX in fourth place with an 8% loss. *This is not investment advice.

Together with Mantle and Bybit, we’re building the onchain economy to not only absorb capital markets but improve them.” Driving Mantle’s Broader RWA Momentum This collaboration builds on Bybit’s continued support for Mantle’s expanding RWA ecosystem , following recent initiatives such as: Anchorage integration , providing institutional-grade custody for $MNT to expand global access.

The change is part of a broader Google Finance update that the company announced in a recent release . The new feature will display forecast probabilities directly in search results. Users asking questions such as “What will GDP growth be in 2025?” or “What will the Fed’s interest rate decision be in December?” will see predictions sourced from Polymarket and Kalshi, showing the likelihood of each potential outcome. Although the terms of the partnership have not been disclosed, the addition of probability metrics represents a major step toward bridging prediction data with traditional finance analytics. Google Expands Finance Search With AI and Market Insights The probability data will appear alongside other finance tools, as Google rolls out a redesigned interface featuring AI-powered search answers, an updated layout for corporate earnings reports, and integrated data visualization tools for large companies. At launch, the upgraded Google Finance experience will be available only in India and the United States, with other markets gaining access later. Earlier this year, Polymarket announced plans to return to the U.S. market by November 2025, while Kalshi already operates domestically as a licensed derivatives exchange. The new collaboration provides both platforms with a chance to expand their reach, while Google continues its push to embed AI and live data across its ecosystem. Most recently, Google added Gemini chatbot integration to Maps, strengthening its move toward intelligent, predictive services. “The world of financial information is changing fast — and Google clearly wants to lead that transformation,” said one industry analyst familiar with the update.",News|Announcements,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-07 15:49:29

At one point, the share price dropped by almost a third, which is a heavy blow for a business that has long been seen in the city as predictable, steady, and fairly dull. The company now expects operating profit to rise by between 3% and 5% in 2026, which is far lower than the around 9% increase it expects for the current year. Rightmove’s share drop set a new yearly low The firm says the difference is almost completely down to how much it is putting into new systems, much of it linked to artificial intelligence . Rightmove is reworking the tools that estate agents pay to use and reshaping parts of the main consumer app and website. The firm is also looking at tools that could help agents work faster or respond to buyers more quickly. The sharp share slide set a new yearly low for Rightmove, though the losses later eased when some bargain hunters stepped in. Several analysts tried to calm nerves, though it did not fully land. UBS said the scale of the shift has raised questions that the market cannot yet answer. The bank cut its rating and its price target on the stock while it waits for more details. In a note to clients, the bank said the guidance could trim forecasts for operating profit in 2028 by anything between 5% and 19% based on what analysts had pencilled in. All of this is happening in a wider environment in which investors are starting to ask themselves if everyone has become too carried away with the AI story. US technology shares had already been sliding the day before. Markets in Asia and Europe followed the mood during their sessions before later recovering some of those losses. UBS strategist Kiran Ganesh told CNBC that investors had enjoyed a smooth rally in AI-related shares even though there is no clear way of knowing how big the returns will be and how long it will take before the spending turns into real money. In other words, there is a risk that everyone got caught up in the moment. The Rightmove news then arrived at a time when nerves were already a little stretched. Rightmove insists the spending is the correct call. The firm expects operating profit to bounce back after 2028 and is targeting yearly increases of about 12% by 2030 once the heavy building work is done. The chief executive, Johan Svanstrom , said the company is rethinking nearly every aspect of how it works. He said artificial intelligence now sits at the centre of how the business plans for the future. “AI is now becoming absolutely central to how we run our business and plan for the future.” Svanstrom. “We are already working on a wide range of exciting AI-enabled innovations to benefit our partners and consumers, and see vast potential in utilising our leading reach and connected data,” added Svanstrom in an update. He also said the company is confident that the upgrades will create a stronger digital platform over time. The City will debate that for a while. In the meantime, the market reaction shows how fragile sentiment is whenever a firm links a slowdown to artificial intelligence spending. There is still faith in the tech theme, but there is also a sense that the easy money phase has passed and companies are now being asked to prove real outcomes rather than simply talk about potential.

According to reports, JPMorgan analysts have issued a surprisingly bullish outlook for Bitcoin, forecasting a potential surge to $170,000 in the near future. The bullish prediction has caught the attention of the broader crypto market, especially as volatility and liquidations continue to test investor sentiment and push prices down. JPMorgan Maintains Bullish Bitcoin Price Outlook Eric Balchunas, a Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, recently shared insights from JPMorgan’s analysts, led by Managing Director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who presents a compelling bullish case for the Bitcoin price. In one of their research notes, the bank’s analysts argue that Bitcoin’s current market value is significantly undervalued compared to gold. They suggest that once leverage conditions normalize, the leading cryptocurrency could climb toward $170,000. Notably, they expect BTC to reach this bullish target within the next 6-12 months, representing a 65.9% increase from its current price level of just over $102,400. Related Reading: New XRP ETF Just Dropped, But Will Anything Be Different This Time? The analysts emphasized that the broader crypto market has already undergone a near 20% correction from previous highs, primarily driven by massive liquidations in perpetual futures contracts. The largest wave was observed on October 10, following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of aggressive tariffs against China, which triggered record liquidations that wiped out billions of dollars in leveraged positions across exchanges—the largest such event in the history of crypto. Leaving the crypto market with no room for a recovery, another devastating liquidation event occurred on November 3, deepening the correction after a $120 million exploit on Market Maker Balancer reignited fears over DeFi protocol security. However, despite this widespread volatility and market downturn, JPMorgan analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin, likely viewing these liquidation events as necessary purges that have flushed out excessive speculation. The analysts believe that perpetual deleveraging has finally come to an end, opening a potential path for more stable institutional accumulation. They suggest that Bitcoin’s value could recover and strengthen considerably from now to October 2026, supporting the bullish projection of a possible rally to a new all-time high. Market Analysts Share Similar Optimistic Predictions Crypto market analyst Sulianto Indria Putra’s latest technical analysis echoes bullish optimism for Bitcoin’s price outlook. He highlights that the cryptocurrency’s weekly chart shows the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continuing to act as a strong cyclical support level. Each time BTC has touched this EMA in past bull cycles, it has historically rebounded with strong upward momentum. Related Reading: Pundit Highlights Major Move For XRP And RLUSD, Will Price Follow? Based on the analyst’s chart, Bitcoin trades around $102,400, just above the 50-week EMA at approximately $100,900, where price action shows consolidation rather than breakdown. Putra argues that this positioning indicates that the market is forming a higher low within an ongoing bull trend. Despite widespread bearish sentiment and price declines, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin could still rally significantly to $150,000 between late 2025 and early 2026.

The event, which brought together major banks, fintech innovators, and blockchain leaders, showcased how far Ripple has come since its early days as a disruptor challenging traditional finance. XtinaRP shared a video clip of Garlinghouse’s closing remarks on X, giving the XRP community a firsthand look at his reflections and announcement. The Ripple chief revisited Swell’s humble beginnings, celebrated its global evolution, and revealed major plans for the next chapter. From Rejection to Revolution Garlinghouse opened his speech with a story that underlined Ripple’s spirit of resilience. “The concept of Swell popped up in 2017,” he recalled. “It was the reaction to Swift not letting us attend Sibos . A true story.” . @Ripple Swell has officially wrapped up and @bgarlinghouse closed it out with some news! pic.twitter.com/2hofhn1M4f — XtinaRP (@xtina_george) November 5, 2025 Denied access to the global banking summit, Ripple hosted its own event just down the street. “We couldn’t get a booth at Sibos, so we decided to host our own event,” Garlinghouse said. “It wasn’t nearly what we have today, but it was anchored by speakers like Ben Bernanke.” That early defiance planted the seed for what would become Ripple Swell — now one of the most recognized blockchain conferences worldwide. A New Financial Era Reflecting on the event’s transformation, Garlinghouse said, “Nine years later, the world looks profoundly different.” He noted that the same financial institutions that once ignored crypto are now active participants . “Crypto and blockchain have moved from being taboo words to being part of the fabric of society,” he declared. The Ripple CEO emphasized the magnitude of this shift, describing it as “a rewiring of financial infrastructure.” He told the audience, “We are witnessing things that were simply not possible before. It’s an amazing time to be alive.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Leading From the Front Garlinghouse highlighted Ripple’s decade-long commitment to compliance and transparency, stressing that the company has led not just through innovation but through integrity. “I’m extremely proud that Ripple has been leading from the front,” he said. “For over a decade, we have been leading with a compliance-first posture and championing not just XRP but the entire industry.” The Big Announcement: Swell 2026 As the crowd awaited his closing words, Garlinghouse delivered a surprise announcement that thrilled the XRP Army. “Our 10th Swell is going to be a little bit different,” he revealed. “We are excited to expand Swell to include not just financial institutions, payment providers, or asset managers, but also developers, investors, researchers, and academics.” He confirmed that the next Swell will return to New York City next fall. “This is going to be one single beacon event,” he said, promising a larger, more inclusive platform that unites the institutional and developer sides of the XRP ecosystem. A Unified Future Garlinghouse ended with gratitude and inspiration. “You are all parts of this movement,” he told attendees. “The work is nowhere near done, but if the conversations over the last two days have proven anything, it’s that we’re just getting started.” Ripple Swell 2025 may be over, but with next year’s expanded event on the horizon, Garlinghouse made one thing clear — the XRP community’s journey has only just begun.

This massive $343 million investment signals a major shift in how traditional financial institutions view digital assets. But what does this mean for the future of cryptocurrency adoption? Why Are JPMorgan’s IBIT Holdings So Important? The recent filing reveals JPMorgan now holds 5,284,190 shares of BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, valued at approximately $343 million.

The initiative marks one of Central Asia’s boldest steps toward integrating digital assets into a state-managed investment portfolio—though authorities say the fund will take a cautious approach, avoiding direct exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Fund Backed by Repatriated Assets and Mining Revenues The fund will be seeded with assets seized or repatriated from abroad, alongside proceeds from state-backed crypto mining operations, Bloomberg reported. These sources are part of a broader effort by Kazakhstan to recover capital and modernize its financial reserves. Central Bank Governor Timur Suleimenov said in an interview in London that the fund’s investments will include exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and shares of companies tied to digital currencies. “We will be very careful about direct exposure to cryptocurrencies,” he emphasized, suggesting that Kazakhstan seeks to capture the industry’s upside while limiting volatility risks associated with token holdings. JUST IN: Kazakhstan to create a $1 BILLION Bitcoin and crypto reserve They are considering converting gold and foreign currencies into Bitcoin HUGE pic.twitter.com/HkvRL3Iw94 — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) November 7, 2025 Managed Through Astana Financial Hub The program will reportedly be managed by a state investment vehicle and operate under the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC)—Kazakhstan’s flagship hub for blockchain, fintech, and regulatory innovation. The AIFC has already attracted several international crypto firms since the country legalized and regulated certain aspects of digital asset trading and mining in 2022. According to Bloomberg, the government may bring in foreign partners to co-manage or co-invest in the fund once it becomes operational. While no specific asset managers have been named, officials said the fund will follow “professional investment standards” and work within existing financial laws to ensure transparency and oversight. Balancing Innovation and Financial Stability Kazakhstan has emerged as a key player in the global crypto economy since 2021, when it became one of the world’s top destinations for Bitcoin mining following China’s crackdown. However, the country has also faced energy shortages, regulatory hurdles, and environmental scrutiny linked to mining activity. By channeling profits from crypto-related operations into a managed reserve fund, Kazakhstan seeks to stabilize returns and reduce reliance on raw commodity exports. The move indicates the government’s intent to use digital finance strategically—as both an economic diversification tool and a platform for global financial partnerships. Kazakhstan Seizes $16.7M from Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges In October, Kazakhstan shut down 130 illegal crypto exchanges suspected of laundering criminal proceeds and seized virtual assets worth $16.7 million. According to a report by The Times of Central Asia , only crypto exchanges licensed by the Astana Financial Services Authority and integrated with local banks are permitted to operate in accordance with the Law on Digital Assets. Platforms operating without such authorization are deemed illegal and targeted for termination. The crackdown extends beyond exchanges, with authorities uncovering 81 shadow cash-out groups, which had a combined turnover of 24 billion KZT ($43 million) in 2024. A Controlled Leap Into the Crypto Future While the fund stops short of holding cryptocurrencies directly, its creation reflects growing state-level confidence in the long-term potential of blockchain and digital finance. If launched as planned in early 2026, Kazakhstan’s crypto reserve fund could set a precedent for other emerging markets looking to integrate digital assets into sovereign investment strategies—carefully, but ambitiously.
