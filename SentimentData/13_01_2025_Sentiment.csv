Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:04:00

The response came after a user claimed that Litecoin's emergence and Charlie Lee's actions represented an early example of a pump-and-dump scheme. The user compared the project negatively to Solana, claiming that Charlie Lee founded Litecoin, set aside a significant amount of supply for himself, and sold it at the height of the 2017 bull run. The comment accused the Litecoin founder of using the project for personal gain and argued that Solana deserves more respect for his contributions to the crypto space. In response, the Litecoin team issued a detailed refutation, defending the project’s transparency, decentralization, and longevity since its inception in 2011. The team noted that Charlie Lee publicly announced Litecoin ahead of its launch, allowing the community to determine the launch date. Unlike many modern projects, Litecoin had no pre-mined supply, no initial coin offering (ICO), and no venture capital funding. Charlie Lee, like other participants, mined and purchased Litecoin and did not maintain a “founders stash.” He later sold his holdings in 2017 to avoid a conflict of interest while continuing to develop and defend the project. Contrary to claims, the team noted that Lee sold his Litecoin at an average price of $205, below the peak of the 2017 bull market. Related News: Famous ETF Expert Made 10 Predictions for the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 - “XRP, Solana...” The response detailed Charlie Lee’s ongoing financial and technical support for Litecoin: He has invested millions in Litecoin through the Litecoin Foundation and partnerships. He has supported marketing campaigns including collaborations with the Miami Dolphins, UFC and others. It holds its annual Litecoin Summit, costing $250,000 and up per event. He actively contributed to Litecoin's core code and encouraged its adoption among businesses and regulators. The team rejected comparisons to Solana and other projects, stating that Litecoin remains unique in its decentralization, lack of founder-controlled reserves, and lack of venture capital influence. They noted that Litecoin has consistently ranked in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap for over 13 years, despite market volatility and the collapse of thousands of other projects. In their closing remarks, the team questioned Solana’s main use cases and claimed that its ecosystem is frequently used to create tokens that are involved in scams and fraud. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s administration is promising to turn it into a cornerstone of US economic strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the same company holding over half a million Bitcoins valued at $52.81 billion through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has its own battles to fight — with regulators breathing down its neck. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) isn’t cutting BlackRock any slack. And Trump’s big Bitcoin plans? Let’s just say they don’t make things any easier for Mr. Larry Fink. But hey, at least BlackRock’s a Bitcoin whale now. BlackRock vs. FDIC Here’s what is going down with the FDIC. BlackRock was supposed to meet a January 10 deadline to address concerns about its influence on US banks. However, It didn’t. Instead, it asked for more time—until March 31—to review a proposed agreement, claiming it needed at least two more months. The FDIC wasn’t buying it. The agency not only rejected the extension but also added more demands. They want more transparency about how BlackRock makes decisions and details about its bank-related holdings. If BlackRock doesn’t act fast, things could get worse, and fast too. Sources familiar with the matter say the FDIC might issue subpoenas or take other mandatory actions to force the firm’s compliance. This isn’t a minor dispute. BlackRock’s sheer size, combined with its massive stakes in banks, has some regulators worried it could have too much control over the financial system. Jonathan McKernan, a Republican FDIC board member, and Rohit Chopra, the Democratic head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have both called for tighter oversight of big asset managers. Their main argument is that BlackRock could sway how banks operate, making them less independent. BlackRock’s defense has so far been calling the FDIC’s demands disruptive, arguing that new rules could wreck index funds—one of its flagship offerings—and make it harder for banks to raise cash. The company also says the FDIC needs to coordinate its efforts with the Federal Reserve, which already oversees its operations through a passivity agreement. Trump’s Bitcoin play Trump, along with Bitcoin-friendly figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis, is pushing for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Here’s the plan: Senator Lummis has introduced a bill proposing the US Treasury and Federal Reserve acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years. That’s 200,000 Bitcoins a year, adding up to about 5% of the total global supply. The goal? To reduce America’s reliance on traditional financial systems and keep up with rivals like China and Russia. Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the Satoshi Act Fund, spilled the details. The reserve would partly come from Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, giving the government a head start. Trump’s team believes this reserve could help stabilize the dollar while tackling the US’s enormous $36 trillion national debt. BlackRock, despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, isn’t on the same page. The firm has been making headlines for other reasons, like its withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). BlackRock pulled out of NZAMI on January 11, under pressure from Republican-led states that weren’t happy with its climate-focused investments. The company insists it will continue to consider climate risks in its investment strategies, but the decision shows how political tensions are forcing it to adapt.

On January 11, Mango Markets shared on its X account: “We are shutting down. It’s time for users to close their positions.” The decision follows governance proposals that unanimously supported adjustments to interest rates and collateral requirements, effectively terminating borrowing and lending services. These changes will take effect on January 13. SEC Settlement The shutdown comes after a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On September 27, 2024, the SEC filed charges against Mango DAO and the Blockworks Foundation for selling unregistered securities. According to the SEC, Mango raised over $70 million in August 2021 by selling MNGO governance tokens in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also accused Mango Labs of operating as an unregistered broker, breaching the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of the settlement, Mango DAO agreed to pay $700,000 in penalties, destroy its MNGO tokens, and request the delisting of these tokens from exchanges. “Since the inception of our crypto enforcement program, our view has been that the label ‘DAO’ does not change the reality of who is behind a project,” said Jorge Tenreiro, chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. Legal and Financial Struggles Mango Markets’ difficulties date back to an October 2022 exploit by crypto trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who drained over $100 million from the platform. Although Eisenberg returned $67 million as part of a governance vote, he kept $40 million. US authorities arrested Eisenberg in December 2022, charging him with fraud and market manipulation. He faces up to 20 years in prison, with his sentencing delayed multiple times due to legal complexities. Mango Markets was launched in August 2021, offering fast and affordable trading and lending services using its MNGO governance token. At the time of writing, the platform holds $9 million in total value locked, a sharp decline from its $210 million peak in November 2021, according to DefiLlama.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:24:01

Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-350000-top-crypto-influencer-makes-bold-prediction/,"Jeremie Davinci, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency domain, has garnered attention with his audacious forecast that Bitcoin may attain an extraordinary value of $350,000. This forecast, lately disseminated on social media, is predicated on historical trends and the present dynamics of Bitcoin mining expenses. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path The current expense for miners to generate one Bitcoin is approximately $70,000. Davinci indicates that historically, under positive market conditions, Bitcoin has frequently surpassed its mining cost by a ratio of five. This association indicates that, if historical trends persist, a price of $350,000 is feasible. The Cost Factor Of Mining The basis of Davinci’s approach is the relationship between mining costs and market price of Bitcoin. The mining process requires electricity and advanced technology among other resources. These costs build the basis for Bitcoin’s value as they rise. Currently spending over $70,000 to extract one BTC, miners may open the path for significant price increases in the future, claims Davinci. It costs miners about $70k to produce 1 #Bitcoin now, less with better hardware or cheap energy. In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has hit over 5x the mining cost. Huge potential ahead! — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 11, 2025 He underscores that this forecast lacks a defined timescale and instead embodies an optimistic perspective grounded in historical performance. He asserted, “Significant potential lies ahead!” in reference to Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bitcoin: Institutional Impact And Market Forces Davinci’s prognosis is set against a landscape of growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Prominent corporations have commenced the acquisition of substantial quantities of BTC, indicating assurance in its long-term growth prospects. Companies such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have made substantial investments in Bitcoin, contributing to the optimistic feeling around the cryptocurrency. In addition, the recent halving event in April 2024 cut the block payment for miners to 3.125 BTC. This made it harder for new coins to enter the market. Around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 2 million to be made. This could cause prices to rise as long as people want them. A Prudent Optimism Although Davinci’s projection is undeniably ambitious, it is crucial to regard such forecasts with prudence. The bitcoin market is famously unstable and can undergo significant fluctuations in value. Analysts have observed that although Bitcoin may realize considerable increases over time, it has also had huge corrections in previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead As we approach 2025 and beyond, numerous investors are closely observing how these dynamics will develop. The interplay between mining expenses, institutional acceptance, and market mood will be a major determining factor in ascertaining the feasibility of Davinci’s prediction. Bold predictions like Jeremie Davinci’s are being debated as the crypto market continues to evolve. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $350,000 reflects both reliance on historical trends and a sense of optimism.

From being a fun and quirky joke coin, Dogecoin quickly rose to fame, attracting an army of passionate holders and garnering massive attention from celebrities and influencers alike. The ICO was priced so low that it was a goldmine for early investors, with some even making millions from what was once just a silly meme coin. With Dogecoin currently holding a place as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in the world, its price has seen explosive growth over the years, and its future seems to be filled with even more promise. But for those who regret not getting in at the right time, there’s still hope. Enter BTFD Coin—a new player in the meme coin world that’s making waves with its exciting presale numbers and its standout feature: a jaw-dropping 90% APY on staking ! The Missed Opportunity: Dogecoin’s ICO and Rise to Fame Let’s talk numbers. When Dogecoin first hit the market in 2013, its initial price was virtually pennies—$0.0002047 per coin. Early investors, especially those who believed in the coin’s fun-loving culture, watched their investments grow exponentially as Dogecoin became more mainstream. In fact, as of 2025, Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70 per coin. That’s a massive jump for a coin that started as a joke. With over $49 billion in market cap, Dogecoin’s growth has solidified its place in meme coin history. And while Dogecoin’s story is one for the books, many missed out on that golden opportunity. Investors who saw its potential too late are left with nothing but “what ifs” and “could’ve, should’ve, would’ve” thoughts. But don’t sweat it!

At the same time, Foresight Ventures’ X account was hacked, linked to $500,000 raised through 15 compromised accounts, showing rising security risks. Crypto hacks happen, but the market bounces back There has been so much hacking from the Mt. Gox hack in 2014 up to hacks on Litecoin and Foresight Ventures’ X accounts in 2025. Each hack is similar; it starts with chaos, breaking trust, and lowering the market prices. Time heals most wounds as prices tend to bounce back usually stronger than before. Litecoin’s official X account was hacked on January 11, 2025. An attacker released a fake token based on the Solana network, named using the ticker LTC, via the said account. Litecoin's X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published. These were live only for a matter of seconds before being deleted. We're still investigating the issue, but immediately found a delegated account that was compromised and removed… — Litecoin (@litecoin) January 11, 2025 A post including a Solana contract address and a scam link briefly propelled the fake token’s market cap to $27,000. The value of the token, however, cratered to $3,400 after a scam alert was published. The Litecoin team regained control, deleted the post, and removed the hacked delegated account. They assured users that investigations are currently being done on the issue. At the same time, hackers accessed Foresight Ventures’ X account. It was used for promoting fraudulent activity with cryptocurrencies tied to AI. Such a hack was alarming, as Foresight Ventures has close ties to blockchain and AI projects. Yet, the team acted fast: it issued warnings and solved the problem. At the end of December 2024, hackers broke into the Cardano Foundation’s X account. They falsely claimed a lawsuit with the SEC and sold a scam token called “ADAsol.” It has been reported that one hacker managed to raise $500,000 by exploiting more than 15 hacked X accounts for meme coin scams during late 2024 and early 2025. These hacks are often phishing emails masquerading as legitimate messages, tricking victims into sharing their credentials. Hacks have been a bane in the crypto industry for years. In 2014, the Mt. Gox hack resulted in over $450 million worth of Bitcoin being stolen, causing the collapse of what was then the largest exchange. The Bitfinex hack in 2016 led to the loss of 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time. In 2018, $530 million in NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck. Such occurrences demonstrate the impact hacks can have on the crypto market. In the case of 2020, hackers hijacked the Twitter accounts of influential people such as Elon Musk and Joe Biden, displaying them with fake Bitcoin giveaways. Although the financial loss was not too massive, it highlighted the need to protect influential accounts. In 2022, the hack of the Ronin Network targeting Axie Infinity stole $625 million and marked one of the biggest crypto robberies ever; it was said to question a centralized blockchain gaming ecosystem. The WazirX hack in 2024 joined the list of concerns regarding centralized exchanges. From hacks to altseason Most hacks lead to short-term market drops due to users panicking and withdrawing funds. These, however, happen at the worst time when the crypto market prepares for an altseason in which altcoins tend to do way better than Bitcoin. This might, therefore, be an opportunity for the market to get over such shocks and enjoy substantial growth. The attacks that Litecoin and Foresight Ventures experienced may be minor in comparison but show a possibility of going wrong in the crypto space. However, growth in the market may still be true, especially around the time of altseason and with bettering security in security. There is a bright long-term future for the crypto market. Whether hacks would be in the way of problems or growth will depend on whether these incidents can be studied and leveraged to improve security.

SUI ATH & ETC Poised for Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/get-6-on-every-purchase-with-blockdags-affiliate-program-sui-ath-etc-poised-for-growth/,"As we step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is teeming with potential. Key highlights include the anticipated rise in Ethereum Classic (ETC) price to $49.07 and SUI nearing a peak at $5.35, coupled with robust investor interest. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a notable layer-1 blockchain entity, rolls out its referral program, offering up to 10% in USDT rewards, significantly fueling the demand for its tokens. Here’s an analysis of these pivotal market elements to gauge the top crypto gem for 2025. Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Targeting $49 in 2025! Forecasting a significant upturn, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is predicted to escalate to a peak of $49.07 by 2025. Investors need a thorough technical analysis to navigate this potential. Currently, ETC is trading at $25.28, with market reactions mixed and a transaction volume of $326.06 million in the last 24 hours. Analysis of the weekly trends shows a bullish reversal, hinting at lucrative opportunities ahead. The coin might retest its highest resistance at $167, potentially triggering a bullish trend. Predictions suggest ETC’s price could oscillate between $22.38 and $49.07, averaging around $44.74. Will SUI Achieve a New ATH as TVL Soars? The SUI token recently marked a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.35, propelled by an upsurge across the market. Despite a significant rally of 10.39% and reaching new highs, SUI has since corrected to $4.59. Closing 2024 with a robust increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) from $1.75 billion to more than $2.6 billion in early 2025, SUI continues to draw attention. Initiatives like DeepBook V3 and Sui Bridge, along with institutional backing, have spurred this growth. The continued DeFi boom and SUI’s ATH underscore its strong market stance. BlockDAG’s Innovative Affiliate Program: Turn $30 into Significant Gains! BlockDAG’s latest initiative offers a compelling referral program that rewards users with up to 10% cashback in USDT for purchases made through shared referral links.

This program is designed for broad participation, with a minimal purchase requirement of $30, allowing widespread entry and benefit from the BlockDAG ecosystem. Its simplicity and attractive rewards make this program a key growth driver for BlockDAG, positioning it as a top contender for 2025’s best cryptocurrency. As of January 2025, BlockDAG’s presale has amassed over $180 million, selling more than 17.8 billion coins at $0.0248 each in its 27th batch, marking a substantial 2380% ROI since the first batch priced at $0.001. BlockDAG’s affiliate program not only offers simple, significant earning opportunities but also plays a crucial role in the platform’s expansion and prominence in the cryptocurrency world. Anticipating the Top Crypto Gems for 2025 With a landscape ripe with opportunities, Ethereum Classic, SUI, and BlockDAG stand out in the 2025 crypto market. Ethereum Classic’s projection of reaching $49.07 is backed by positive market trends, while SUI’s recent ATH at $5.35 highlights its increasing influence in DeFi. BlockDAG capitalizes on these trends with its user-centric referral program, promising significant USDT rewards and a notable return for its early adopters.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 22:01:00

These Bitcoin mining devices aim to simplify cryptocurrency mining for individuals while incorporating unique dual-purpose functionality. According to the official press release , the Avalon Mini 3 combines high-performance Bitcoin mining with home heating, boasting a hash rate of 37.5Th/s and a user-friendly app-controlled interface. Meanwhile, the Avalon Nano 3S is an upgraded version of the popular Nano 3 which features a hash rate of 6Th/s and is being marketed as a beginner-friendly entry point into Bitcoin mining . Key advantages of the products include a plug-and-play setup for ease of use and a focus on energy efficiency. The Avalon Mini 3 addresses environmental concerns by recycling computational energy into home heating, allowing users to offset energy costs while minimizing waste. Canaan CEO NG Zhang spoke about the company’s vision of combining practicality with sustainability and added, “The Avalon Mini 3 and Avalon 3S represent our vision of user-friendly, practical mining solutions for the modern individual. We’re reimagining how technology can create value while minimizing environmental waste. The Avalon Mini 3’s ability to generate cryptocurrency while heating your home is a perfect example of our vision for sustainable, multi-purpose technology.”​​​​​​​ Transforming cryptocurrency mining rigs into household devices is not a new concept. Back in 2017, Avi Aisenberg, who operated South Florida Distillers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, created a heating system that used ASIC miners to mine crypto while accelerating the rum-distillation process. In 2018, the French start-up Qarnot introduced the QC-1, a heater designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining. More recently, companies like Heatbit and D-Central have entered the market with products that combine heating capabilities with crypto mining.

The most recent rejection came last week when the price peaked at $102,000 on Monday, only to reverse sharply and fall to $92,000 by Thursday. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead This continued tug-of-war has brought the bearish case for BTC into sharper focus, with technical analysis highlighting a 50/50 chance of a further drop or a bounce. $90,000: A Pivotal Support Zone Under Threat Recent Bitcoin price action has significantly put the $90,000 price point as the most notable support level for the bulls. Although the crypto has largely held above the $90,000 support level even during the recent corrections, the bearish outlook hinges on its ability to defend this level. According to technical analysis by crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has made five different attempts to test a support trendline around $90,000, which further reveals the importance of the level. This repeated retest increases the chance of weakening the support strength and is gradually making Bitcoin more vulnerable to a sharp decline. With this in mind, the major task for Bitcoin bulls would be to hold above the $90,000 and break resistance levels above $100,000 in order to invalidate a bearish outlook. Should Bitcoin fall below $90,000, it could cascade to a further price drop to the $87,000 range or even lower. A fall below $87,000 could, in turn, cause a quick fall through a $12,000 gap to reach $75,000. Resistance Levels To Break: $103,000 To $108,500 As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin could continue to pose a bearish threat until it closes above a few resistance levels. These resistance levels are situated at $103,000, $106,400, and $108,500, and consistent daily closes above these thresholds are required to confirm a bullish trend. The third resistance of $108,500 is the most notable, as a break above it would see Bitcoin trading at new all-time highs. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, current technical indicators suggest that the chances of a pump are low at the moment. For instance, Bitcoin has now lost the support of the 21 EMA on the daily candlestick timeframe, and sentiment is now in a neutral zone on the Fear and Greed Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, the biggest factor that could see bullish momentum return to Bitcoin is the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th and the anticipated crypto-positive policies that during the new administration. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the event could either trigger a short-term rally or exacerbate the ongoing decline. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400.

Recently, FTX unveiled new details about its $16 billion creditor repayment plan , offering some clarity to those affected by its collapse. The plan prioritizes smaller creditors, with the first payments soon scheduled. This update marks the beginning of financial relief for many, causing anticipation to build among creditors and the broader crypto community. However, the challenges, such as phishing scams and unresolved legal disputes, still loom large. Small Creditors to Get Early Relief FTX’s bankruptcy reorganization plan emphasizes fairness, starting with creditors whose claims are below $50,000. These smaller creditors will share an initial repayment pool of $1.2 billion. This information was disclosed by FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri in an X post earlier today. FTX repayments Initial Distribution Schedule Claims Jan 20th: FTX has given until 20th Jan to fulfil pre distribution requirements for initial distribution Repayments likely won’t start before then Feb 25: Likely (up to 4th Mar) — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 12, 2025 The record date for these claims was set as January 3, with repayments expected to commence in February. To streamline the process, the trading platform has asked creditors to complete essential pre-distribution requirements by January 20. These include submitting W-8BEN tax forms and passing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Importantly, creditors have a 60-day deadline to file their tax forms or risk forfeiting their repayments. FTX has stressed the importance of meeting these requirements to avoid delays. Phishing Scams and Legal Confusion Add to FTX Worries While the repayment plan brings hope, it has also created new risks. A wave of phishing scams and fraudulent claim portals has been targeting creditors. FTX has urged caution, reminding stakeholders to verify all communications and rely only on official channels for information. In addition, unresolved legal issues are complicating the process. Claims surrounding the acquisition of FTX EU by Backpack have been flagged as inaccurate. FTX clarified that FTX EU remains fully owned by FTX Europe AG. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court oversees FTX’s Chapter 11 case and has not approved any share transfers. These legal disputes highlight the ongoing complexities in FTX’s path to recovery. A Boost for the Crypto Market? The repayment plan could have a significant impact beyond FTX creditors. Market analysts are optimistic that many creditors may reinvest their funds in the crypto market once repayments are distributed. Kraken recently offered selected creditors seamless ways to reinvest in the market, a no-fee trading initiative. This influx of capital and a favorable stance from the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration could trigger a rally for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. The crypto market, still reeling from the collapse of major exchanges like FTX, needs positive momentum. If the trading platform successfully executes its repayment plan, it could restore some confidence in the industry and set a precedent for managing future crises.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 23:22:00

Speaking to the Russian news outlet Prime , Sergey Bezdelov, the head of the Industrial Mining Association said that “in the fourth quarter of 2024,” the demand for industrial mining equipment and services in Russia “increased threefold compared to the same period in FY2023.” Bezdelov was speaking in the wake of comments from a top lawmaker who said Moscow was ready to “soften” its stance on crypto regulation. Crypto Mining Hardware a Hit in Russia? The Industrial Mining Association chief added that there was “also high interest” in Russian crypto mining projects “among foreign market participants.” The estimated percentage change in Bitcoin Mining difficulty over the past seven days. (Source: Dune/@mitchklee_) Bezdelov said that some of this “interest” in Russian crypto mining was now coming from “fellow BRICS member states.” In May last year, Bezdelov claimed that the Russian industrial crypto mining market “doubled in size” in 2023 . The expert hinted that recent legal changes had helped boost the popularity of mining in Russia. A law that came into force on November 1, 2024, allows both “legal entities” (private companies) and “individual entrepreneurs” (private citizens) to mine crypto “legally” if they do not consume more than 6,000 kWh of energy per month. “Individuals can mine cryptoassets without being included in a state-run register, but within the limits of the electricity consumption threshold. If they go beyond this threshold, citizens must register as an individual entrepreneur and apply for inclusion on the register.” Bezdelov With the help of a two-story clock in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, the Baltics are counting down the minutes until they leave Russia's energy grid on Feb. 8. https://t.co/eNgeDsdKGa — Bloomberg (@business) January 11, 2025 Crypto Taxes Incoming? At present, the register only requires companies and individuals to submit data on transactions and energy consumption. However, as the body that controls the register also operates Russia’s taxation system, it is highly likely that any miner using more than 6,000 kWh will soon have to pay tax on their earnings. However, Bezdelov noted that before last year’s legal change, crypto mining was in a “gray” legal zone. Until November, mining had no legal status. Now, however, Russian law recognizes it as a form of “entrepreneurship.” While Bezdelov and others have previously said that most (around 90%) of domestic miners focus their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC) , Cryptonews.com has seen evidence that suggests many Russian home-based miners prefer Ethereum (ETH) . Last year, Bezdelov said that Litecoin (LTC) is also popular among a smaller group of Russian miners. Litecoin prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Russian Media, Lawmakers Change Tune on Crypto The same media outlet wrote that mining is a “good source of additional income.” It added that Russian companies and individuals could use crypto as an “opportunity to diversify their assets.” It also suggested that firms could use the crypto they mine as a settlement tool “when conducting foreign economic activity within the framework” of the Central Bank’s sandbox. This type of positive talk about crypto was once almost unheard of in Russian mainstream media outlets.

And the Central Bank has led several attempts to issue a China-style crypto crackdown in Russia. However, President Vladimir Putin last year spearheaded a crypto pivot when he began to speak about crypto mining in glowing terms. And while many energy-poor areas have issued bans on crypto mining until 2031, Putin has urged other parts of the Russian Federation to mine crypto “if they have surplus energy.” Tax Boost The association has claimed that the Russian Treasury could expect to earn over $500 million per year from taxing crypto miners. Others claim that Russia’s desire to become an AI “powerhouse” has inspired Putin’s crypto pivot . Bezdelov advised Russian qualified investors to “allocate up to 5% of their portfolios to mining services and digital currencies.” China warmly welcomes the new addition to the BRICS family, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday, in response to Brazil, as the BRICS chair 2025, releasing a statement on Monday night announcing the official entry of Indonesia as a full member into BRICS.… pic.twitter.com/XqZycI9onG — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 7, 2025 Softer Crypto Stance Possible, Lawmakers Says Meanwhile, TASS reported that the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation has “allowed for the possibility of softer regulation” for domestic companies using crypto to avoid US, UK, and EU-led sanctions . The state-run news agency quoted Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, as explaining that crypto “market players” are complaining of “over-regulation” in the Central Bank’s sandbox. Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets. (Source: Secretariat of the World Russian People’s Council/YouTube/Screenshot) The Central Bank wants all Russian firms who use crypto as a payment tool to exchange coins using the sandbox, rather than dealing directly with overseas partners in crypto. “We need to quickly launch an experimental [sandbox]. We then need to see how the standards we have adopted in this market work. And then we can make further adjustments later. Quite possibly, we will move toward a softer regulatory [position].” Lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets Aksakov also said that firms are not happy with the Central Bank’s protocols. Many, it seems, think these protocols are over-complicated. The lawmaker said: “Many companies are suggesting that we need to somehow simplify the turnover of cryptocurrencies so that the market can develop successfully.

Travis Ford, 35, of Glenpool, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with his role as CEO, co-founder, and head trader of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC. The purported investment firm operated from January 2023 to August 2023, promoting itself through its website, social media, and other internet platforms.

Ford admitted that he knew such returns were unattainable but made promises to lure investors anyway. He misappropriated the funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, leaving investors with significant financial losses. The Justice Department announced the plea on Friday, Jan. 10, with Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Wible and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Inspector in Charge Eric Shen highlighting the fraudulent scheme’s scope. Ford now faces up to five years in prison, with sentencing to be determined by a federal district court judge. The court will consider the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors before issuing a final sentence. A sentencing date has not yet been set. The news came just two days after a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Washington charged a former pastor with 26 counts of fraud, alleging he masterminded a cryptocurrency scheme.

On January 12, several users in Singapore reported being unable to access Polymarket. Alex Zuo, Vice President of Investment and Custody at Cobo Global, commented on X: “Polymarket is officially defined as a gambling website in Singapore. If you want to place a bet, you can only go to a state-owned gambling company. Otherwise, you will face fines and imprisonment.” Users attempting to visit Polymarket are greeted with a warning under Section 20 of the Gambling Control Act 2022. The act imposes penalties of up to SG$10,000, jail terms of up to six months, or both for gambling with unlicensed operators. The warning from the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) reads: “You have attempted to access an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider. Singapore Pools is the only licensed online gambling operator in Singapore.” Regulatory Landscape The GRA, established on August 1, 2022, oversees all forms of gambling in Singapore. It was created by restructuring the Casino Regulatory Authority to address the changing nature of gambling products and services. Polymarket operates on the Polygon blockchain, allowing users to bet on global events using USD Coin (USDC). From January 1, the Singapore Police Force assumed enforcement authority for illegal gambling. According to the GRA, Singapore Pools is the sole operator licensed to offer remote gambling services. Violators face fines of up to SG$500,000 and imprisonment of up to seven years, with repeat offenders subject to harsher penalties. Since 2015, the GRA has blocked more than 3,800 gambling websites and SG$37 million in transactions. Singapore’s Crypto Leadership Despite its strict gambling regulations, Singapore is a blockchain and cryptocurrency hub. A December study by ApeX Protocol highlighted Singapore’s 1,600 blockchain patents, 2,433 crypto-related jobs, and 81 cryptocurrency exchanges. In 2024, Singapore doubled its issuance of digital asset licenses, granting 13 major payment institution licenses, more than twice the number in 2023.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Gambling|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MATIC|MINING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 23:52:00

FET Trends Look Uncertain While Chroma Drives Web3 Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-presale-tops-590k-fet-trends-look-uncertain-while-chroma-drives-web3-growth/,"Various market movements are drawing attention in the blockchain field. FET trends are showing mixed signals, with the possibility of surpassing the $1.71 resistance level, yet inconsistent network activities temper these gains. In parallel, the Web3 sector is expanding, enhanced by tools like Chroma’s Crocket app which simplifies blockchain interaction through enjoyable, cost-free activities, showcasing seamless integration of technology and practical usability. Concurrently, Web3Bay ‘s presale is performing well, accumulating over $590,000. This indicates its potential to innovate the traditional e-commerce sector by integrating decentralized blockchain technology with accessible crypto pricing, creating an inviting environment for participants in its growing ecosystem. FET Trends Surge By 25%: What’s Next? FET trends are capturing attention, having surged by 25% before descending to $1.29. This rise was a temporary boost, and a deeper analysis reveals possible bearish patterns that might affect its stability. The Price DAA Divergence, showing a mismatch between increasing prices and diminishing network activities, suggests impending adjustments. Despite some concerns, the weakening of the downward momentum indicated by the Average Directional Index suggests FET might be stabilizing. Investors are keeping an eye on the crucial $1.71 resistance level, which, if broken, could propel FET toward $2.00. As these trends develop, the market remains vigilant of FET’s direction. Web3 Adoption: Chroma’s Crocket Redefines Access Web3 adoption is widening, led by platforms that ease access to blockchain technology. The Chroma Crocket app, for instance, enhances user engagement through reward-based activities like quizzes and games, eliminating transaction fees with its Chroma ID, thus broadening the blockchain’s reach to novices. The influence of Web3 is not confined to apps; it’s spreading across gaming, e-commerce, and finance sectors. Developers are dedicated to lowering technological hurdles, enabling effortless user involvement. Crocket’s successful strategy illustrates how Web3 can link real rewards with enhanced functionality. As Web3 becomes more accessible, it’s clear that user-friendly tools are crucial for its mainstream acceptance. Web3Bay Presale Catalyzes E-Commerce Transformation! Web3Bay is emerging as the premier platform for online transactions of digital assets, revolutionizing e-commerce through blockchain technology. With its native coin, the 3BAY token presale creating significant buzz, it has successfully raised over $590,000 and sold more than 180 million coins.

BlockDAG Targets $1 with Exchange Listing Talks Heating Up — Dogecoin Whales Shift & AVAX Targets Climb,https://thecoinrise.com/next-big-crypto-blockdag-targets-1-with-exchange-listing-talks-heating-up-dogecoin-whales-shift-avax-targets-climb/,"The crypto market thrives on big gains, and three key contenders are aiming for impressive growth this year. But which one has the potential to be the best crypto investment for 2025? This week, Dogecoin increased by 22.83% after a recent 14% decline. This rise is largely due to Dogecoin whales moving over $1 billion in DOGE. Analysts have identified a crucial Avalanche (AVAX) target at $126, which could lead to significant gains if AVAX overcomes existing resistance levels. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under discussion with ten prominent exchanges for listings. The potential of BlockDAG securing major exchange spots has attracted more participants to the presale, already surpassing $179.5 million. As the presale advances towards its $600 million goal, the outlook for BDAG reaching $1 sooner than anticipated this year remains optimistic! Dogecoin Whales Propel DOGE’s Market Value This week, Dogecoin’s price ascended to $0.3921, marking a 22.83% increase. The spike is mainly attributed to Dogecoin whales, who shifted over $1 billion in DOGE, increasing liquidity and buyer interest. Elon Musk’s recent activities and tweets, known to influence Dogecoin’s market previously, are believed to have lifted market confidence. Furthermore, a rise in trading volume across major exchanges shows escalating interest from both individual and larger scale buyers. Yet, while Dogecoin whale activities have led to positive growth, the coin’s fluctuating nature remains a concern for some analysts. Avalanche (AVAX) Target: Crucial Points to Monitor Avalanche is currently trading at $43.48 and might be poised for growth, with a significant Avalanche (AVAX) target set at $126.03. If it breaks through the $126 mark, it might escalate to $243, a 468% jump from current figures. However, overcoming crucial resistance levels is essential for these gains. Failure to surpass $126 could impede the bullish trajectory, keeping the price from reaching higher AVAX targets. Therefore, analysts continue to watch these levels closely to gauge AVAX’s momentum and price goals. BlockDAG Poised for $1 as Exchange Listing Talks Progress! BlockDAG’s promising $179.5 million presale surge, consistent growth, and high ROI projections mark it as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. Currently in discussions to list BDAG on ten exchanges, these initiatives further boost excitement around BlockDAG’s trajectory, pushing its presale towards the $600 million mark and offering substantial value to BDAG holders. Globally, the project is gaining attention, notably through strategic partnerships, like its collaboration with Italian football titan Inter Milan, which has introduced a new wave of sports enthusiasts to the crypto realm. This alliance has significantly enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility and credibility in both the crypto and sports arenas, fostering a broad base of supporters and holders. With these strategic moves and a rapidly expanding community, BlockDAG is on track for significant achievements in 2025 and beyond. Given its strong presale results and ongoing exchange talks, analysts believe BDAG could reach $1 this year. With its price currently at $0.0248, this indicates considerable return potential for current buyers. Those who bought in early, during the first batch, have already seen returns increase by 2380%. Smart traders are quickly seizing this promising opportunity, as the 26th presale batch has sold out. With BDAG’s price rising batch by batch, now is an ideal time for enthusiasts to engage for substantial gains in the upcoming months. Best Cryptos to Buy for 2025– Final Verdict DOGE’s recent price surge, spurred by Dogecoin whales and Musk’s influence, suggests growing interest, though its volatility remains a point of caution. Meanwhile, if Avalanche can break the critical resistance at $126, its price might soar, but failure could stall its bullish run. Currently at $43.48 with a 15.22% drop this month, the realization of Avalanche’s (AVAX) targets is up for debate. However, BlockDAG, with the largest presale to date, emerges as a highly promising contender. Its notable partnerships and imminent listings enhance its potential, with analysts predicting a $1 valuation in the near months. At just $0.0248 currently, BlockDAG offers an enticing opportunity for significant future returns, positioning it as the best crypto to buy for 2025 .

Since the price patterns are forming up, Ethereum price seems appealing to analysts and investors. However, it is the emergent DTX Exchange that is holding the spotlight moment. It has witnessed explosive momentum with the significant development in the case of Ripple vs. SEC. Could DTX be the evolutionary platform that changes the face of the crypto trade? Keep on reading to dig deeper into the details. DTX Exchange - The New Force in Crypto Trade While Ethereum and XRP get all the buzz, DTX Exchange is secretly becoming the new big hype in the crypto scene. A hybrid trading platform that bridges the centralized and decentralized world, DTX offers a smooth trading experience appealing to a broader audience. Let’s take a review at what makes DTX stand out: The Hybrid Model Combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges, user-friendliness with security and autonomy, DTX Exchange allows traders to benefit from both ends. This innovation appeals to experienced traders looking to be more effective and newer ones wanting the safest crypto entry. DTX is in a league of its own since it doesn't stop at the mere provision of cryptocurrencies. With over 120,000 available financial instruments on the platform, tokenized stocks, ETFs, and commodities, to name a few, users have options unparalleled in variety and scope for portfolio diversification as never before. Fair Tokenomics The DTX tokenomics model is all about inclusivity. Unlike other platforms that heavily favor institutional players, DTX Exchange ensures a fair launch, giving both retail and institutional investors equal opportunities to participate. This balanced approach fosters a more equitable ecosystem, which resonates strongly with the crypto community. Proven Growth All said, the DTX presale has been nothing short of a blockbuster, garnering more than $11.2 million and presenting a 600% return to early participants. It further indicates that the value of the token has gone up from $0.02 to $0.14, which depicts the immense confidence investors have in the platform's vision. Upcoming Catalysts Industry leaders have been keeping close tabs on DTX's performance. With tier-one exchange listings expected within the next few months, analysts predict that the token is set to multiply 10x to 100x. These statements have raised anticipation and interest in DTX Exchange , especially for traders looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP vs SEC: A Revolutionary Case for Crypto Regulation The history of cryptocurrency shows the XRP vs SEC case as the most significant happening till now. This lawsuit has been a battleground between innovation and regulation for years: the SEC believes that XRP is not a security, while Ripple maintains that it is. This partial recent victory for XRP brought much-needed clarification to its legal status, thereby eliciting a powerful price rally with the consequent restoration of the market's trust in the token. Such an outcome reverberated across the entire cryptocurrency system. It actually bonded optimism among altcoins and pushed the notion further that digital assets can somehow find a route toward acceptance in America. The Ripple vs SEC case has created a ripple effect in investor sentiment. Reduced regulatory uncertainty typically translates to more aggressive market participation, which has encouraged traders and investors to explore promising altcoins and innovative projects. Ethereum Price Action: The Market's Compass Investors are keeping a close eye on the Ethereum price. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and crypto enthusiasts often refer to it as a ""compass"" for market movements. The fluctuation in Ethereum price reflects the general mood in the cryptocurrency industry, right now. ETH has traded at over $3600, as of 4th January 2025 and has demonstrated remarkable resilience to market volatility. Source: CoinMarketCap It has been noticed that Ethereum favors the long-term investor due to the upgrades it is expected to go through, along with dominating the DeFi and NFT markets. According to analysts, continuous improvement of scalability and institutional adoption will lead to the revisiting of all-time highs, possibly surpassing it. Why Is DTX Gaining Momentum? The rapid success of DTX Exchange is not merely a case of smart marketing; it has deep roots in tangible innovation and timing. A new phase in the crypto market is opening its doors, with investors no longer content with the traditional exchanges, which are limited in flexibility and security. DTX fills in these gaps with features that traders genuinely need. But it is also because the larger industry dynamics are in DTX's favour. The crypto market is now looking forward to the next bull cycle. So, with the hybrid model of DTX, diversified assets and an approach for all, the platform is sitting on the most ideal ground. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investors Ethereum price and XRP continue to play pivotal roles in setting the stage, but the emergence of platforms like DTX Exchange signals the dawn of a new era. At its next cycle, the question in the market won't be about whether crypto is going to keep growing but, rather, who will lead. With innovative features and unstoppable momentum, DTX Exchange is most definitely one of them. With its promising tokenomics, proven success, and upcoming catalysts, DTX is already poised to lead the market. It’s set to be more accessible to crypto investors through its enlightened, flexible way of trading.

From its humble beginnings as a meme coin in 2020, Shiba Inu turned into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the world. People who got in early saw massive returns, with Shiba Inu’s price soaring from fractions of a cent to the moon. Those who missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO watched their friends become rich from what was once just a dog-themed joke. But here’s the good news for anyone feeling left out: you don’t have to regret missing Shiba Inu’s ICO anymore. The market is brimming with fresh opportunities, and the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term is right here: BTFD Coin. While Shiba Inu may have taken the world by storm, BTFD Coin is fast gaining traction with a standout feature: its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which offers real utility and rewards, making it the perfect new meme coin for those who want to get in on the action. The Shiba Inu ICO: A Missed Opportunity Many Regret to This Day Back in 2020, Shiba Inu was launched at a fraction of a cent, with an initial price that made it practically impossible to ignore. As early investors took a chance on this meme-inspired project, the coin’s value surged, making it one of the most recognizable meme coins in the space. By 2021, Shiba Inu’s price had risen to a crazy degree, creating millionaires out of those who took the plunge early. The meme coin industry was never the same, and Shiba Inu set the bar for what could happen when meme coins gain massive popularity. Unfortunately, for those who didn’t take the chance when Shiba Inu’s ICO was available, the dream of grabbing cheap coins at ground level quickly slipped away. The price soared, and those who entered after the initial hype missed the boat on those massive gains. But don’t worry, the good news is that BTFD Coin is the fresh opportunity you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a meme coin with a fully developed Play-to-Earn game that gives holders something tangible and valuable to look forward to, making it the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term right now. BTFD Coin’s P2E Gaming Universe: The Best New Meme Coin to Buy and Hold for the Short Term BTFD’s Play-to-Earn game allows players to earn BTFD tokens through in-game rewards, and those rewards can be converted into real-world value. This gives BTFD Coin an edge over other meme coins, adding a layer of fun and financial opportunity that’s hard to ignore. The P2E game is just one part of the BTFD Coin ecosystem creating excitement in the community. But the real kicker here is the rewards system—holders can earn by playing the game and staking their BTFD coins for a mind-blowing 90% APY . While some meme coins rely solely on community enthusiasm, BTFD Coin is building a sustainable system that rewards its supporters in multiple ways, all while maintaining the fun and inclusive vibe that meme coins are known for. In addition to the P2E game and staking, BTFD Coin’s presale is already showing impressive numbers. With over 64 billion coins sold and more than $5.1 million raised so far, this project is rapidly gaining momentum. And with BTFD Coin still in its presale stage, now is the perfect time to jump in before the price rises and the game gets even more competitive.

Whales Buy 90 Million ADA Token In a post on X, an expert noted that whales have purchased a significant 90 million ADA tokens in the past 96 hours, which equates to the last four days.

Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.968 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.85% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, due to the recent breakout of the bullish price action pattern, investors and traders have shown strong participation in the token, resulting in a 27.5% increase in trading volume. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Levels With the recent price decline, the ADA price has reached the breakout level, and it appears that the price has come to this level for a retest, aiming for further upside momentum. As long as the altcoin maintains itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame and the $0.955 level, ADA remains bullish. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ADA could soar by 17.5% to reach the next resistance level of $1.135 in the coming days.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 00:26:20

Aptos price forecasts for 2025 also show considerable growth potential, fueled by its growing ecosystem. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves in the crypto market, having amassed an impressive $179.5 million to date and securing a staggering 2380% ROI. Its dynamic ecosystem, including the highly acclaimed X1 mobile mining app and the engaging TG Tap miner game on Telegram, is attracting a broad crypto audience. Currently, BlockDAG is swiftly advancing towards its bold $600 million target and is often cited as the best crypto right now. Litecoin Price Prediction: Is $400 Achievable Soon?

Analysts have set a $400 target, supporting a bullish Litecoin price prediction for the coming months Over the recent week, LTC has climbed by 11%, showing solid support and a bullish stance. Additionally, talks of a possible Litecoin ETF by 2025 could draw institutional players, potentially elevating its market price. With positive market sentiment and strong technical indicators, the discussion around Litecoin price prediction remains focused on its substantial upside potential in the near term. What’s in Store for Aptos Price in 2025? Aptos price predictions for 2025 indicate significant promise, with experts suggesting a peak of $16.64 by year-end. The cryptocurrency’s performance is bolstered by its established ecosystem and the increasing adoption of decentralized applications.

Technical analysis suggests continued growth, with milestones like $10 and higher acting as key resistance levels. As the market finds its footing, Aptos price trends for 2025 continue to captivate both traders and long-term seekers of lucrative assets.

Already, over 17.8 billion BDAG coins have been purchased, demonstrating robust demand and market confidence. These achievements are instrumental in the continuous growth of the ecosystem and in cementing BlockDAG’s position in the crypto scene.

Having secured over $590K in presale investments, Web3Bay is making a notable impact in the decentralized shopping sector. Early investors are poised to achieve a 6430% ROI, marking this as a potentially lucrative opportunity for those in the trading community. TON News: TONCASH Aligns with TON Ventures The latest from TON news highlights the new partnership between TONCASH and TON Ventures, a pivotal development for cryptocurrency cashback within the Web3 arena. This collaboration is fueled by a strategic investment from TON Ventures, aiming to redefine the scope of cryptocurrency cashbacks.

By pooling their resources and expertise, Hunters of Web3 and Wilder World are setting a new course for the future of Web3 integration in the metaverse. Why Web3Bay Could Permanently Transform Decentralized E-Commerce The 3BAY token is pivotal in reshaping the e-commerce ecosystem , establishing Web3Bay as a significant competitor to disrupt traditional giants like Amazon. As the foundational element of the Web3Bay platform, 3BAY tokens facilitate seamless transactions and interactions within its decentralized marketplace. This token is the gateway to an innovative e-commerce ecosystem where users enjoy exclusive product access, reduced transaction fees, and loyalty incentives. What distinguishes Web3Bay from traditional online shopping platforms is its integration of blockchain technology with a robust e-commerce framework, enhancing transparency, security, and providing unparalleled advantages for both consumers and vendors. The 3BAY token catalyzes these transactions and nurtures a community-driven value system. Unlike conventional marketplaces, 3BAY token holders experience true ownership, converting shopping into an investment. Consequently, the demand for 3BAY tokens is surging, with $590K raised and over 180 million tokens already sold at just $0.0039675 each, reflecting its growing momentum. The presale’s rapid advancement, with significant trading activity contributing over $50K in just 24 hours, mirrors the market’s confidence in Web3Bay’s transformative vision.

Its user-driven approach, supported by the critical role of the 3BAY token, is redefining the operations of Web3 e-commerce. The opportunity to engage in this paradigm shift is available now—before it becomes mainstream. Final Thoughts Recent developments in Web3—from TONCASH’s innovative cashback mechanism to the collaborative efforts of Hunters of Web3 and Wilder World—underscore the blockchain’s transformative influence across various sectors. However, it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce ecosystem that stands out, offering a prime opportunity for traders seeking substantial long-term benefits. The 3BAY tokens are central to driving decentralized transactions and providing unmatched rewards, setting Web3Bay on a path to disrupt established platforms like Amazon and redefine the e-commerce landscape. With the presale reaching impressive milestones—garnering over $590K and indicating a potential 6430% ROI upon launch—the growing confidence in Web3Bay’s vision is evident.

However, as XRP price garners attention, another player is quietly making waves: RCO Finance (RCOF) . RCO Finance is positioned as a next-generation crypto project, and is emerging as a strong contender for investors looking for massive returns, with projections indicating a potential 40,000% rise. XRP’s Path to $10: XRP Price Recovery and Market Dynamics The potential for the XRP price to hit $10 is rooted in its growing adoption and favorable legal developments. Following Ripple Labs’ partial victory against the SEC, investor confidence in XRP has increased, sparking a rally that many believe could continue into 2025. XRP’s unique role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments has made it a favorite among financial institutions. Its speed, low transaction fees, and scalability are driving partnerships with banks and payment providers worldwide. Challenges on the Horizon Despite the optimism, XRP price faces challenges that could slow its ascent: Regulatory Uncertainty : While Ripple has made progress, the legal landscape remains unpredictable. Market Competition : Other blockchain networks are also targeting the cross-border payment sector, threatening XRP’s dominance. Why RCO Finance Is Outpacing the Competition While XRP targets incremental growth, RCO Finance (RCOF) is positioned for explosive gains thanks to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). RCO Finance is a cutting-edge platform that leverages artificial intelligence and tokenization to revolutionize how users interact with digital assets. Its ability to deliver unmatched utility and profitability makes it a standout in the crowded crypto market. Key Features That Drive RCOF’s Growth AI-Powered Insights : RCOF uses advanced AI algorithms to provide tailored investment strategies, helping users maximize returns with minimal effort.

Scalability and Speed : Built on a high-performance blockchain, RCOF supports rapid transactions and scalability, ensuring seamless user experiences. RCO Finance Presale: The Ultimate Investor Opportunity RCO Finance is currently in its presale phase, priced at $0.07 per token. Analysts predict a meteoric rise to $2 by early 2025, translating to a 40,000% return for early investors. Why the Presale Matters The RCOF presale is more than just a token sale; it’s a gateway to long-term wealth creation. Here’s why: Low Entry Point : Early adopters can secure RCOF tokens at a fraction of their projected market value. High Growth Potential : With its robust ecosystem and growing demand, RCOF is set to outshine other altcoins. Community Support : The presale is attracting a global community of investors, amplifying its growth trajectory. XRP vs. RCO Finance: Comparing the Opportunities XRP’s Strengths Institutional Adoption : Backed by financial giants. Proven Use Case : Dominates cross-border payments. RCO Finance’s Advantages Innovative Features : Combines AI with DeFi for unparalleled utility. Massive ROI Potential : Offers a 40,000% return compared to XRP’s modest gains. What This Means for Crypto Investors The choice between XRP and RCO Finance depends on your investment goals. XRP offers stability and incremental growth, making it suitable for conservative investors. And that is one of the reasons XRP price keeps increasing. Meanwhile, RCOF provides an opportunity for exponential returns, appealing to those willing to embrace higher risk for higher rewards. Many investors are turning to RCO Finance for its: Technological Edge : Innovative features that set it apart from traditional altcoins. First-Mover Advantage : As a pioneer in AI-driven DeFi, RCOF is capturing market share at an unprecedented pace. Conclusion While the XRP price targets $10, RCO Finance is redefining what’s possible in the crypto market.

Meme coins named after the nascent Department of Government Efficiency — an early-stage agency devoted to cost-cutting measures under the incoming Trump administration — plummeted Sunday. One DOGE token, which formed in 2024 as a satirical take on government spending and bureaucracy, experienced a sharp 18% drop in value over the past 24 hours. See one trajectory below. Source: CoinGecko Another version of the coin, sporting a logo of a dog wearing a MAGA-like hat, also landed in the red at last check on Sunday, dropping by 20%. Source: CoinGecko The real DOGE — the actual coterie of business leaders set to eliminate bureaucratic waste — has sparked both intrigue and skepticism. The agency, to be co-led by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, initially boasted that it could slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. This week, however, Musk revised his estimate, describing $1 trillion in cuts as “an epic outcome.” Speaking on X, which he owns, Musk explained his vision: “If we try for $2 trillion, we’ve got a good shot at getting one. That would free up the economy, reduce inflation, and be, well, epic.” Watch Stagwell's CEO Mark Penn interview Elon Musk at CES! https://t.co/BO3Z7bbHOZ — Live (@Live) January 9, 2025 The tokens inspired by the agency (whose name is an acronym for Dogecoin’s trading symbol) plummeted in value in the days following Musk’s comments. “It’s very, very hard for people to care about spending someone else’s money,” Musk said, adding that federal regulations often render large projects illegal—or at least prohibitively expensive. DOGE, as it turns out, isn’t technically part of the government and holds no actual power to cut spending or enforce policies. It intends to advise the White House on what to slash . Tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has interviewed Musk in the past, wasn’t surprised by the Tesla CEO’s sudden downplaying of what the DOGE can accomplish. “Typical Musk on more things than you think,” she said in a social media post. “Over bragging and then under delivering.” Swisher cited other Musk-led initiatives (i.e., the Hyperloop, robotaxis, autonomous vehicles) as examples. “The weird part is he is fully capable of delivering good stuff when he just shuts up,” she added.

With innovation driving the crypto space forward, it’s critical to pick projects that offer not just hype but tangible value and long-term potential. Among the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term, three projects stand out: Qubetics (TICS) with its groundbreaking presale and asset tokenization solutions, Bittensor TAO as a game-changer in decentralized AI, and Arbitrum, a leader in scaling Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics’ transformative approach to real-world asset tokenization, Bittensor TAO’s pioneering AI infrastructure, or Arbitrum’s unmatched blockchain scalability, these altcoins are worth your attention. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is the name on everyone’s lips right now, and for good reason. The project is currently in the 16th stage of its presale, where it has already sold over 413 million $TICS tokens to more than 14,200 holders, raising an impressive $9.3 million. At a presale price of just $0.0455 per token, this is a golden opportunity for anyone looking for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. What sets Qubetics apart is its focus on real-world asset tokenization . This revolutionary concept is about converting physical assets—think real estate, art, or even precious metals—into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine owning a fraction of a luxury apartment in New York or a rare painting from Paris, all through $TICS tokens. It’s not just about democratizing investments; it’s about making them accessible, transparent, and secure. Consider this scenario: A small business in Toronto wants to expand but lacks traditional funding options. With Qubetics, they can tokenize their real estate holdings, offering investors a piece of their property in exchange for capital. Similarly, a professional in Dallas could diversify their portfolio by buying tokenized shares of a wind farm in Spain. Even individuals can leverage tokenized assets to gain exposure to global markets without the usual barriers of entry. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Analysts predict potential returns of up to 32,816% ROI following its mainnet launch, making it a prime contender for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. The future of investments is here, and it’s called Qubetics. Bittensor TAO: Pioneering Decentralized AI In the world of artificial intelligence, Bittensor TAO is blazing a trail like no other. By combining blockchain with AI, Bittensor has created a decentralized network where anyone can contribute to and benefit from cutting-edge machine learning models. It’s a concept that has resonated deeply with the crypto community, cementing Bittensor TAO as one of the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. The beauty of Bittensor lies in its openness. Unlike traditional AI models that are controlled by tech giants, Bittensor’s decentralized network allows anyone to participate. Developers can train and deploy AI models, while users can access these models without the gatekeeping of centralized entities. It’s a win-win situation that democratizes AI and fosters innovation. Take, for example, a startup in Silicon Valley working on a predictive analytics tool for healthcare. Instead of building their AI infrastructure from scratch, they can tap into Bittensor’s network, saving time and resources. Meanwhile, contributors to the network earn TAO tokens for their efforts, creating an ecosystem where everyone benefits. Bittensor’s potential doesn’t stop at technology; it’s also a powerful investment opportunity. With AI becoming increasingly integrated into industries ranging from healthcare to finance, Bittensor is poised to play a pivotal role. Its decentralized approach not only challenges the status quo but also opens new avenues for collaboration and innovation. The combination of AI and blockchain is a match made in heaven, and Bittensor TAO is leading the charge. For those seeking a project with long-term viability and a strong community, this is one of the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Arbitrum: Scaling Ethereum’s Blockchain Arbitrum has quickly established itself as a key player in the crypto world, offering solutions to one of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges: scalability. By enabling faster and cheaper transactions, Arbitrum has become a favorite among developers and users alike. Its role in the Ethereum ecosystem makes it a no-brainer for anyone searching for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Arbitrum achieves its scalability through an innovative technology called optimistic rollups. This allows it to process transactions off-chain while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum. The result is a blockchain that’s both efficient and cost-effective, without compromising on reliability. For businesses, this means they can build decentralized applications (dApps) that are not only powerful but also user-friendly. Imagine a gaming company in Austin launching a blockchain-based multiplayer game. With Arbitrum, they can ensure smooth gameplay and seamless transactions, enhancing the user experience while keeping costs low. Developers, too, are flocking to Arbitrum for its ease of use and robust infrastructure. Arbitrum’s integration with Ethereum has also bolstered its reputation. As the demand for Ethereum-based solutions continues to grow, so does the importance of scaling solutions like Arbitrum. Its ecosystem is thriving, with projects ranging from DeFi protocols to NFT platforms choosing Arbitrum as their foundation. What truly sets Arbitrum apart is its focus on community and collaboration. It’s not just about technology; it’s about building an ecosystem where developers, businesses, and users can thrive. For those looking to invest in a project with solid fundamentals and long-term potential, Arbitrum is a standout among the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Conclusion: Your Crypto Portfolio’s Next Big Moves The crypto market is filled with possibilities, but Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Arbitrum rise above the noise.

It’s constantly buzzing with innovation, offering investors endless opportunities to grow their portfolios. If you’re on the hunt for the best altcoins to invest in this month, three projects stand out: Qubetics (TICS) with its groundbreaking presale and focus on interoperability, AAVE as a DeFi giant, and Immutable X, a leader in blockchain gaming. Each of these projects has carved out a unique space in the crypto ecosystem. Whether you’re looking for revolutionary technology, financial empowerment, or gaming innovation, these altcoins deliver. Qubetics: Bridging the Gap with Interoperability Qubetics has taken the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 17th stage of its presale, the project has already sold over 413 million $TICS tokens to more than 14,200 holders, raising an impressive $9.3 million. At just $0.0500 per token, this is your chance to get in on one of the best altcoins to invest in this month before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. The real magic of Qubetics lies in its focus on interoperability . In a fragmented crypto world, where blockchains often operate like isolated islands, Qubetics is building bridges. Its platform is designed to allow seamless communication and data transfer between different blockchains, creating a unified ecosystem that benefits everyone. Imagine a business owner in Bogotá using Qubetics to move assets across Ethereum and Solana networks without needing third-party solutions. Or think about a developer in Lima creating a decentralized app that taps into multiple blockchains for real-time data, all thanks to Qubetics’ interoperability. Even individual users, like a crypto enthusiast in Mexico City, can enjoy hassle-free transactions across chains, eliminating the usual complexity. Interoperability isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a game-changer. It streamlines processes, reduces costs, and opens new doors for innovation.

Launched in 2020, AAVE has revolutionized the way people interact with money by providing a platform for borrowing and lending without the need for traditional financial institutions. Its trustless, permissionless ecosystem has made it a go-to choice for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike.

Whether you’re looking to earn interest on your crypto holdings or borrow against them, AAVE offers a seamless experience.

With AAVE, they can use their assets as collateral to secure a loan, all without jumping through the hoops of traditional banks. Similarly, a crypto investor in Santiago can deposit idle assets into AAVE’s liquidity pools, earning passive income while contributing to the ecosystem.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 01:52:26

Hoskinson clarified that IOG earned its ADA , rather than receiving it as a gift. “No ADA was ‘given’ to IOG,” Hoskinson stated. “We earned it all. It’s not the people’s money. It’s profit for building Cardano. The original value of IOG’s ADA was around [$8 million] in 2015. We’ve been here for nine years building.” See below. No ada was ""given"" to IOG. We earned it all.

The CF was given ada as a donation. They have a mandate to… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 12, 2025 Hoskinson contrasted IOG’s ADA holdings with those of the Cardano Foundation (CF), which received ADA as a donation. The foundation, he said, has a mandate to allocate those funds to ecosystem development. His comments came amid speculation about whether IOG would contribute its ADA to support the integration of Circle’s USDC stablecoin, a notion Hoskinson seemingly dismissed. You might also like: NFT market defies crypto dip, Do Kwon trial date set, North Dakota eyes Bitcoin | Weekly Recap Hoskinson: ‘Dishonest people have no place at IOG’ On Saturday, Jan. 11, Hoskinson accused a former CF employee of attempting to “rewrite history” regarding the blockchain’s integration of stablecoins. The former employee had criticized the network’s lack of progress in this area. Hoskinson clapped back: the CF missed an opportunity to integrate USDC in 2021 for $3 million, a time when the foundation’s holdings were valued at nearly $2 billion. “They turned down the deal according to their own employee,” Hoskinson said. “Then you rewrite history to eschew any of their responsibility and make it into power dynamics? I’m seriously glad you don’t work for me anymore. Dishonest people have no place at IOG.” The controversy underscores broader challenges facing Cardano in its push for wider adoption. Major stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether are reportedly hesitant to support the network, citing concerns over a lack of successful decentralized applications and insufficient transaction volume. Hoskinson’s remarks highlight ongoing tensions within the Cardano ecosystem, as stakeholders grapple with decisions that could shape the blockchain’s future. At last check on Sunday, Cardano was trading at roughly $0.96. Source: CoinGecko Cardano, which launched its mainnet in September 2017, is gearing up for an integration with BitcoinOS , which will unlock over $1.4 trillion in liquidity. The developers are also working on Midnight, a scaling project for the ecosystem. Cardano may also benefit from President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to adopt a lighter regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies. Whether a spot ADA ETF, or exchange-traded fund, gets introduced remains to be seen. So far, crypto commentators are optimistic.

Each of these tokens has carved a unique niche, but which one is poised to hit $1 first? With Lightchain AI’s presale now raising $8.5 million and tokens priced at $0.004875, it’s quickly becoming a strong contender in this race. Dogecoin Meme Coin Pioneer Eyes Further Growth Dogecoin, the pioneering meme coin, has experienced significant growth since its inception in 2013. Initially created as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, it has evolved into a cryptocurrency with a robust community and substantial market presence. In 2024, Dogecoin’s value surged by over 93% in a single week, reaching approximately $0.2944, driven by increased whale activity and institutional interest. Analysts project that Dogecoin could achieve a price of $1 by 2025, potentially positioning it among the top-tier cryptocurrencies. Factors contributing to this growth include its first-mover advantage, cultural prominence, and the broader market recovery fueled by favorable economic policies. Technological developments aimed at enhancing scalability and transaction speed are also underway, further supporting its potential for future growth. Pepe Coin Viral Sensation Aiming for New Highs Pepe Coin came onto the stage as a popular meme coin, catching the thoughts of everyday buyers and sellers looking for big swings. Though its main charm is in its meme vibes, PEPE has been growing its use with NFT partnerships and crowd-led projects, turning it into more than jus͏t a risky asset. People think that if Pepe Coin keeps its speed and gets more users, it might move nearer to the $1 line. But, like many meme coins, its win really relies on keeping buyer feelings and market styles. Lightchain AI Innovative Altcoin with $1 Potential Among the contenders, Lightchain AI stands out as a next-generation blockchain platform with real-world applications. Unlike its meme coin counterparts, Lightchain AI focuses on solving inefficiencies within blockchain technology and enhancing scalability. With its presale price set at $0.004875, Lightchain AI offers an attractive entry point for early investors aiming to capitalize on its growth potential. A key highlight of Lightchain AI’s roadmap is its emphasis on energy-efficient blockchain operations, which align with growing global demand for sustainable technologies. Additionally, its initiatives to foster open-source development and collaboration among developers give it a competitive edge. Analysts predict that these factors could propel Lightchain AI to the $1 milestone faster than many speculative tokens, offering significant returns to early adopters.

With Pepe Coin’s popularity surging and Shiba Inu’s ecosystem upgrades fueling excitement, the real spotlight shines on Lightchain AI, a promising new entrant. This project has already raised $9.4 million in its presale at a price of $0.004875, making it one of the most anticipated tokens of the year. Pepe Coin’s January Outlook Will It Reach New Heights? Pepe Coin (PEPE) has had a pretty wild trip lately! In December 2024, it reached a top of $0.00002825 but then fell by around 31% as some buyers took their money out. Zoom ahead to January 6, 2025, and PEPE is selling for near $0.000021 with a market value of more than $8 billion. What comes next for PEPE? Views are varied. Some experts guess it might rise again to $0. 000028 by January 8, a maybe 30% rise. Others are even more hopeful - saying it could fly to $0. ͏00006860 at start of the month which would be a great 235% growth. Sure, the crypto market is not simple to guess so take these odds with a bit of doubt. PEPE’s cost will probably be affected by market feelings, interest in fun coins, and the general money scene. If you’re thinking about putting money in, make sure to do your study and keep aware of the market's highs and lows! Shiba Inu Ecosystem Powerhouse Shiba Inu (SHIB), initially launched as a meme coin in 2020, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing multiple tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a metaverse. The ecosystem includes three primary tokens: SHIB, the foundational currency; LEASH, limited to 107,646 tokens, offering exclusive benefits to holders; and BONE, serving as the governance token with a total supply of 250 million tokens, enabling community participation in decision-making. ShibaSwap, the ecosystem's decentralized exchange, facilitates token swapping, staking, and yield farming, enhancing DeFi capabilities. The introduction of Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution, aims to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, further strengthening the ecosystem's infrastructure. Additionally, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded into the NFT space with collections like the SHIBOSHIS, a set of 10,000 unique NFTs, and SHEboshis, celebrating women in crypto. The development of SHIB: The Metaverse offers users immersive digital experiences, allowing for virtual land ownership and interaction within a Shiba Inu-themed environment. This multifaceted ecosystem reflects Shiba Inu's transition from a meme coin to a dynamic platform with diverse applications in the cryptocurrency space. Lightchain AI Breakthrough in Blockchain and AI Integration One of Lightchain AI’s most notable features is its developer portal, which offers comprehensive documentation, testing environments, and APIs designed to empower creators. This robust ecosystem enables developers to build intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) that are both highly efficient and scalable compared to traditional platforms. Furthermore, its seamless integration with widely-used AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch ensures an easy transition for developers already experienced with these tools. By prioritizing innovation, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as a leading platform for the next generation of blockchain-based AI solutions. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Other countries, especially those that are serious about gambling laws or just haven’t figured out how to deal with decentralized finance (DeFi), are also throwing a legal wrench in the works. The U.S., in particular, has been leading the charge. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) decided it was time for Polymarket to make some regulatory changes, and they weren’t exactly gentle about it. Last week, the CFTC announced a settlement with the company behind Polymarket. The Commission’s new chair, Rostin Behnam, reportedly told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the CFTC is ready to be the “primary cop on the beat” when it comes to digital asset markets. Meanwhile, countries in the EU and parts of Asia, including China, are keeping their distance, making it harder for users to access Polymarket without running into a few digital roadblocks. The platform’s decentralized setup — built on Polygon, an Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 solution — only adds to the headache. without a central authority to take the blame, governments are struggling to put clear legal boundaries around it, especially in places with tight online gambling laws.

If you’re part of the crypto scene, you know that the race to find the best new meme coins for exponential returns never slows down. Today, we’re diving into three crowd favorites: BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), and SPX6900 (SPX). While each has its own charm and loyal community, BTFD is charging ahead with its Bulls Squad, making a massive splash with its presale. Let’s take a closer look at what makes these meme coins tick, starting with the frontrunner that has the crypto world buzzing: BTFD Coin. The Rise of BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Leading the Charge What’s the secret sauce behind BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s the Bulls Squad —a fiercely loyal community of over 8,200 holders who’ve helped sell more than 64 billion coins so far. Since launching its presale, BTFD has smashed milestones, hitting $2.5 million in just 14 days and now raising over $5.1 million. The presale is currently in Stage 13, with tokens priced at $0.000142, and the buzz is palpable. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers. Its unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is now live, offering players real rewards for completing challenges. Think of it as gaming meets crypto, where every level you conquer brings tangible benefits. And for the staking enthusiasts, BTFD’s staking platform boasts an impressive 90% APY, letting you multiply your holdings while staying part of a vibrant community. Meme coins thrive on community engagement, and BTFD’s Bulls Squad exemplifies this. With personas like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, the project’s narrative builds a relatable and inclusive vibe. These characters aren’t just mascots; they’re the heart of the movement, turning market dips into opportunities and fostering unity among investors. To illustrate the potential, consider this: an investment of $4,500 in Stage 13 at $0.000142 per BTFD Coin could yield 31,690,140 tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006 by the presale’s end, that initial investment could soar to $19,014. This isn’t just a projection; it’s a testament to the explosive possibilities within the BTFD ecosystem. Ready to Join the Rare Bulls Squad? Here’s How: Set Up Your Wallet : Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet to secure your BTFD tokens. Fund Your Wallet : Load it with BNB or ETH for purchasing. Connect Your Wallet : Head to the presale site and choose your currency. Buy BTFD : Complete the transaction and prepare for rewards. Claim Your Tokens : Post-presale, claim your BTFD and start staking. Stay Connected : Monitor staking rewards and game earnings. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): The Icon of Laid-Back Investing In the meme coin universe, CHILLGUY has carved out a niche as the ultimate chill vibe. Designed for those who prefer a laid-back approach to crypto, this token embodies fun and financial freedom in equal measure. Its engaging branding—complete with a casual mascot that screams “no stress”—has earned it a loyal following among crypto enthusiasts. CHILLGUY thrives on its community-driven ethos. Whether it’s through its interactive social media campaigns or creative NFT drops, it keeps its audience entertained while building long-term value. Investors often point to its simplicity and transparency as key factors in its sustained appeal. What sets CHILLGUY apart is its emphasis on meme culture. By leveraging humor and relatability, it connects with younger investors who value not just returns but also the journey. CHILLGUY has shown that even in a saturated market, a coin with a clear personality can hold its ground. It’s no wonder this token is a favorite for those dipping their toes into alternative investments. SPX6900 (SPX): Where Meme Meets Innovation SPX6900 brings a tech-savvy twist to the meme coin frenzy. Known for its edgy branding and cutting-edge features, SPX appeals to a more tech-oriented audience. Whether it’s through advanced DeFi integrations or experimental use cases, SPX is the coin for those who want their memes with a side of innovation. Community engagement remains a cornerstone for SPX. From gamified staking rewards to DAO-driven decision-making, the project ensures that its holders feel heard and valued. This participatory approach has helped SPX maintain a strong market position even as competition heats up. What really sets SPX apart is its ability to evolve. While other meme coins rely solely on branding, SPX continuously adds utility, ensuring it remains relevant. For investors seeking a balance between meme culture and forward-thinking features, SPX is a compelling option Why BTFD Coin Stands Out While CHILLGUY and SPX6900 each have their strengths, BTFD Coin offers a unique blend of utility, community, and growth potential. Its P2E game and staking rewards are already making waves, and the Bulls Squad’s enthusiasm is infectious. With over $5.1 million raised and the presale price set to climb, now’s the time to join the movement. Based on market trends and the success of its presale, BTFD is positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, this coin promises a thrilling ride with substantial rewards. So why wait? Join the BTFD presale today and become part of the Bulls Squad. Conclusion It’s clear: BTFD Coin, CHILLGUY, and SPX6900 each bring something unique to the table. But when it comes to exponential growth potential, BTFD’s Bulls Squad is in the spotlight. With its presale thriving and innovative features like staking and P2E gaming, this token is setting the stage for a groundbreaking bull run. Don’t miss out on what could be the opportunity of a lifetime. Join the BTFD Coin presale before it ends, and let’s turn dips into gains together. Because in the world of crypto, the best time to act is always now.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 03:20:00

ETH is struggling and might continue to move down if it stays below $3,320. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave from the $3,160 zone. The price is trading below $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,320 resistance level. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price started a short-term recovery wave from the $3,160 level, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to recover above the $3,200 and $3,220 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,743 swing high to the $3,160 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bears are active below the $3,320 and $3,350 levels. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,300 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,320 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,743 swing high to the $3,160 low. A clear move above the $3,450 resistance might send the price toward the $3,500 resistance. An upside break above the $3,520 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,250 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,220. A clear move below the $3,220 support might push the price toward the $3,160 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/over-8-trillion-shib-left-this-top-exchange-heres-what-happened/,"Over 8,000,000,000,000 Shiba Inu tokens have been withdrawn from the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com. According to data from Whale Alert, the tokens were transferred to unidentified wallets in multiple transactions, raising questions about the motivations behind these large-scale movements. Such activity often signals strategic accumulation, potentially indicating a bullish outlook for the token. The movement of SHIB tokens was divided into multiple transactions, with one notable transfer involving 1,636,940,000,000 tokens valued at approximately $39 million. The remaining transactions, though smaller, followed similar patterns, with each successive transfer slightly declining in quantity. The decision to funnel these tokens out of a prominent exchange to anonymous wallets has drawn attention within the cryptocurrency community. Historically, significant outflows from centralized exchanges often suggest accumulation, as investors secure their holdings in private wallets. This can be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the asset’s potential. Growing Appeal Among Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whales This movement from Crypto.com is part of a broader trend of heightened whale activity surrounding Shiba Inu. Other major exchanges, including Binance, have also recorded significant high-volume transactions involving the asset. The token’s growing popularity is evident in its consistent ranking as the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which currently stands at $12.89 billion. Such large-scale transactions align with the ongoing volatility that characterizes the cryptocurrency market. Despite its meme coin origins, Shiba Inu has carved out a prominent position, supported by increasing trading volumes and a growing ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Outlook The token’s recent rally and the notable whale activity suggest optimism about its long-term potential. Analysts point to ecosystem developments and the token’s growing use cases as factors that could drive future price surges. While short-term fluctuations remain a characteristic of meme coins, Shiba Inu’s expanding adoption and market activity highlight its resilience. The withdrawal of over 8 trillion SHIB tokens from Crypto.com to private wallets underscores the significant interest the token continues to attract among high-value investors. As the asset gains traction in the market, its community and ecosystem development could further solidify its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency space. With whale activity on the rise and market confidence building, the asset remains a token to watch in the coming months.

If the low of the correction is in place, the price could move higher, eventually leading to another corrective phase before advancing further. This analysis will cover the current uptrend and the ongoing pattern that could shape the price movement in the near future. Triangle Pattern in the Correction Phase The current price structure suggests a triangle pattern is unfolding in the context of a corrective phase, which began around December 3rd. While triangle patterns are not always the most common corrective structures, they do occasionally appear, especially in wave four corrections. XRP has shown a recurring tendency to form triangle patterns in its price action. There have been several instances of bullish breakouts following triangle formations throughout November and early December. This pattern suggests that XRP might be in the midst of another triangle formation. Current Consolidation and Breakout Analysis XRP is currently consolidating above the breakout point from December 1st, hinting ongoing market strength. Ideally, holding above this level would suggest the uptrend is still intact. The price has formed a series of lower highs and higher lows, which fits the structure of a triangle pattern. Each part of this pattern is corrective, showing a series of three-wave movements. Key Levels to Watch If the price drops below $2.41, it may signal a possible reversal and the formation of a top. This level represents the 50% retracement of the recent rally, so it’s a crucial point to watch. On the upside, the next resistance is at $2.72, the B-wave high. A breakout above this level could lead to a test of the December high around $2.90, with the all-time high of $3.30 potentially in reach if bullish momentum picks up.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 03:57:49

A potential game-changer is expected with the anticipated approval of a US-based spot Solana ETF by the end of January. On the other hand, CoinStats has joined forces with SPACE ID to simplify portfolio management, while expanding the Web3 ecosystem. Among these advancements, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is attracting investor interest due to its remarkable presale performance. The platform has raised over $600,000 and early investors are already seeing a staggering 6430% ROI. Positioned as a rising star in the Web3 space, Web3Bay is drawing attention as a platform with high earning potential, especially for those looking to sell digital assets with ease. Solana Update: ETF Approval Could Drive 2025 Growth The crypto market anticipates a major milestone with the potential approval of the Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by late January 2025. This timing coincides with significant political events in the U.S., adding to the anticipation for Solana’s role in the financial space. A US-based Solana ETF could offer more accessibility to traditional investors, increasing demand and supporting growth. Analysts suggest that retail participation will play a key role, as Solana’s perceived affordability makes it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. However, it’s not without challenges. Solana recently dropped below the $200 mark, reflecting a weekly decline of over 7%. While short-term price corrections may cause concern, experts believe the long-term outlook remains positive. Web3 Ecosystem Expands: SPACE ID & CoinStats Partner Up The Web3 ecosystem is seeing a major advancement as SPACE ID partners with CoinStats to simplify portfolio management. CoinStats allows its users to track and manage their assets seamlessly using simple handles like “jane.bnb” instead of long wallet addresses. The adoption of domain names on CoinStats has grown rapidly, with connected wallets surging from 450 in October 2024 to 4,600 by December—a staggering 922% increase. Despite its success, some users might find challenges in transitioning to domain-based tracking, especially if they manage multiple wallets across diverse blockchains. Nonetheless, the SPACE ID collaboration marks a pivotal moment in making the Web3 ecosystem more accessible and user-friendly for both experienced traders and newcomers. $600K Raised, 6340% ROI: Could Web3Bay Make Investors Rich? Web3Bay (3BAY) is reshaping the e-commerce world by introducing a decentralized platform for buying and selling digital assets. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures secure and transparent transactions, eliminating the need for centralized control. Its technical foundation is built on a combination of blockchain layers, smart contracts, and decentralized protocols, creating a secure and scalable environment. This architecture is designed to handle high transaction volumes seamlessly, without compromising speed or user experience, making it a reliable choice to buy and sell digital assets. Web3Bay is going viral in the crypto market for its potential and revolutionary idea that transforms online shopping forever. Its presale has already raised over $600,000 in only 3 stages and sold over 170 million 3BAY tokens, highlighting the platform’s strong potential. Early investors from stage 1 are set to enjoy an impressive 6340% return on investment (ROI) when the 3BAY token launches. This showcases the high-earning opportunities that Web3Bay offers investors. With tokens currently priced at just $0.0039675, it remains one of the most affordable cryptocurrencies for those aiming to diversify their portfolios or enter the digital asset market. Opportunities like this don’t last long. Web3Bay’s momentum in its presale stages reflects growing demand, and as the token progresses through future rounds, prices are expected to increase. For anyone seeking to buy and sell digital assets or invest in a platform set for long-term growth, the time to act is now. A Quick Recap The Web3 ecosystem is undergoing a transformative phase, characterized by groundbreaking partnerships such as those between CoinStats and SPACE ID, and the recent Solana update announcing the launch of their ETFs. While the recent news from Solana and CoinStats is noteworthy, the spotlight shines brightest on Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s presale success, with over $600,000 raised and a remarkable 6340% ROI expected for early investors, sets it apart. With tokens priced at just $0.0039675, the current presale stage presents an unparalleled entry point for investors seeking substantial returns. As demand continues to rise and future rounds push token prices higher, Web3Bay stands ready to deliver significant value to its community.

Bitcoin Price Path to $120K Amid Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policies The crypto market is excited as the Bitcoin price sentiments point to a potential $120,000 rally, fueled by optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency. With the Bitcoin price dropping to the $93,000 mark, call options for the $120K strike on Deribit have surged to $1.52 billion in open interest, reflecting a market brimming with bullish sentiment. Analysts point to Trump’s anticipated pro-crypto policies as a catalyst for this momentum, with traders betting on a transformative period for digital assets. Technically, the Bitcoin price mirrors a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, signaling the potential for a bullish breakout. Holding key support at $90,800 and breaking through immediate resistance at $102,760 is crucial for sustaining this uptrend. However, risks remain, as a failure to hold these levels could lead to significant corrections. As inauguration day approaches, the stakes are high. The Bitcoin price movement will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping market sentiment and future trajectories. Why PropiChain (PCHAIN) Is Set to Make an Early Bull Run Despite the bullish Bitcoin price predictions, the AI altcoin market has started to surge earlier than expected. The growing adoption of AI altcoins has significantly triggered a buying spree of the PropiChain (PCHAIN) altcoin, which is currently on presale at $0.011. Using AI, NFTs, and the blockchain network, PCHAIN aims to improve the real estate market. Looking to improve the $300 trillion real estate market, PropiChain uses NFT tokenization to transform physical properties into digital assets, allowing seamless buying, selling, and transferring without the complexities of traditional processes. Enabling fractional ownership lowers the entry barrier for investors, allowing them to purchase parts of high-value properties and trade their shares on a secure blockchain. This mechanism diversifies portfolios and brings liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market. The integration of artificial intelligence takes PropiChain’s innovation further. AI algorithms offer predictive market insights, automated valuation models (AVMs), and transaction execution. Investors can leverage these tools for real-time property analysis, automate transactions based on market conditions, and mitigate risks with data-backed decisions. This advanced AI-driven approach ensures users maximize opportunities while reducing human errors. Moreover, with the smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, PCHAIN automates lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, eliminating intermediaries and providing a frictionless experience for users. PropiChain’s global accessibility breaks down barriers for institutional and individual investors alike. The platform eliminates traditional real estate’s hefty capital requirements and geographic limitations with its unique Propiverse feature. Users can virtually explore properties from anywhere through its Metaverse integration, enhancing decision-making through immersive 3D property tours. Security and transparency are pillars of PropiChain. Its decentralized ledger, “Title Contract,” ensures all transactions are tamper-proof and verifiable, mitigating fraud risks. The PCHAIN AI altcoin powers this ecosystem, offering holders access to the platform’s premium features, including legal and compliance tools, AI insights, and NFT capabilities. The altcoin’s ability to act as collateral for DeFi liquidity further amplifies its utility, enabling investors to access value without selling assets. The Lucrative PropiChain (PCHAIN) Presale Amidst the bullish Bitcoin price developments, the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin presale presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the real estate markets. In the presale phase, PCHAIN tokens are attractively priced, each priced at $0.011 with an anticipated ROI of over 800% when the token lists at the anticipated $0.032. Investing in the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI crypto has some perks, such as AI analytics and market recommendations, staking rewards for unmatched APYs of up to 225,% and frequent airdrops. Investors participating in the presale benefit from favorable entry prices and contribute to developing the next big real estate innovation. The PCHAIN presale is gaining momentum rapidly, raising nearly $3 million. Bullish sentiment on CoinMarketCap indicates an imminent listing, expected to push the PCHAIN AI altcoin beyond the $1 mark post-presale. This creates a compelling opportunity for early investment before the next presale stage begins.

The Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) of Singapore has flagged Polymarket as an “illegal gambling site” operated by an unlicensed provider. Users in Singapore now face a warning message when attempting to access the platform, which has been particularly scrutinised for its handling of US election-related betting. Reports of the block began circulating on Sunday evening, with Alex Zuo, vice president of investments and custody for Cobo, sharing a screenshot of an official notice. The notice cites Section 20 of Singapore’s Gambling Control Act 2022, warning users that engaging with unlicensed gambling services could result in fines or imprisonment. While the GRA has not issued an official statement, the platform remains inaccessible to Singaporean users at the time of writing. In Singapore, users are required to use Singapore Pools, the state-owned lottery subsidiary, for legal online gambling. This new restriction comes as part of a broader crackdown on unlicensed online gambling, which has seen the shutdown of over 3,800 websites and the blocking of $37 million in transactions as of the end of 2024. Polymarket’s troubles across the globe Polymarket has encountered regulatory challenges not only in Singapore but also in several other countries, including France and the United States. In France, the National Gaming Authority (ANJ) initiated an investigation into Polymarket’s operations after a French user placed large bets on the 2024 US presidential election. French laws are stringent when it comes to online gambling, allowing only certain activities like sports betting and poker. As a result, the investigation centers around potential violations of these regulations. In the US, Polymarket has faced even more intense scrutiny. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a subpoena to Coinbase, requesting information about user interactions with Polymarket. This follows a previous $1.4 million fine imposed on Polymarket for allegedly offering unregistered prediction markets. As part of the settlement, Polymarket agreed to cease operations for US users. Despite this settlement, the US Department of Justice has launched its own investigation into the platform, with allegations that Polymarket may have continued to accept trades from US users in violation of the agreement. Additionally, the FBI has conducted a search of devices owned by CEO Shayne Coplan as part of this ongoing investigation. Despite the regulatory challenges, Polymarket’s user base continues to grow, with the platform recording over 300,00 monthly active users in December 2024. This growth comes amid its increasingly complicated regulatory environment, including a high-profile FBI raid and an ongoing subpoena issued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Polymarket’s fresh controversy Polymarket has come under fresh controversy for allowing users to place bets on the outcome of the deadly Los Angeles wildfires . One of the markets on the platform focused on how many acres the Palisades fire would burn by a specific deadline, drawing significant attention. The market had already accumulated more than $270,000 in trading volume after launching last week. Bettors were heavily focused on a more than 90% probability that the fire would burn between 20,000 and 25,000 acres.

The approval of spot XRP and Solana ETFs could be one of the first signs of this new era, leading to more relaxed regulatory environments for digital assets and even further mainstream adoption. The market is on the brink of what could be a defining year for crypto, with ETF approvals setting the stage for major price movements and institutional participation. XRP, in particular, stands to benefit from these developments, making it one of the most exciting assets to watch in the coming months.

He wrote, “Much of this is based on what I expect will be a markedly different approach to crypto by the Trump administration than what we witnessed under the Biden administration.” Nate opened up about the possibility of both Solana and XRP spot ETFs gaining approval. For XRP, this could mean significant capital influx, especially with favorable changes in SEC leadership and crypto legislation. As the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins steps into the role of SEC Chair and David Sacks takes on the role of “crypto czar,” the regulatory environment for crypto could shift dramatically, opening the door for new ETF products. Institutional Capital and Market Surge: What XRP ETFs Could Mean The idea of a spot XRP ETF is not just speculative. Spot ETF applications for XRP are already on the table, and the possible approval could bring a wave of institutional capital into the market, further legitimizing XRP as a mainstream digital asset. If approved, XRP ETFs could lead to massive price surges, as institutional investors flock to this increasingly recognized asset.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 04:16:03

Data reveals that on January 7, 2025, SHIB recorded one of the highest daily inflows from large holders, a notable occurrence despite the asset’s recent price struggles. The crypto market has entered a bearish phase, leading to widespread price drops among digital assets. Shiba Inu was not spared, experiencing a sharp decline of 9.38% on January 7, its largest daily loss since mid-December 2024. This decline is part of a broader trend that has seen cryptocurrencies struggling to maintain bullish momentum. Record-High SHIB Large Holders Inflows Despite the market downturn, on-chain data highlighted a striking development for Shiba Inu . On January 7, large holders’ netflow reached an astounding 33.59 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at $739 million based on current prices. This figure accounts for approximately 5.7% of SHIB’s total circulating supply, underscoring the significance of the movement. In perspective, large holder inflows for SHIB have averaged around 600 billion tokens daily in recent months. While occasional spikes have occurred, they typically remained below the 30 trillion mark throughout 2024. The last time the asset recorded inflows above this level was in July 2021 when the token was relatively new and large transactions were more common due to its lower price. Understanding the Recent Spike The substantial inflow of 33.59 trillion SHIB tokens has raised speculation about potential whale accumulation among market participants. However, data indicates that this surge was primarily due to internal fund movements by the crypto exchange Crypto.com. Crypto.com transferred over 32 trillion SHIB tokens across 20 transactions to a single, unidentified wallet. This internal activity accounted for the inflow spike, rather than external buying or significant market-driven accumulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Reaction and Liquidations The recent inflow coincided with a broader market slump that saw Bitcoin’s price drop to $94,000, leading to liquidations totaling $627 million within 24 hours. Shiba Inu accounted for $1.57 million of these liquidations, with the majority ($1.39 million) resulting from long positions. Shiba Inu’s price remains under pressure following the downturn, trading at $0.00002127, reflecting a further 2.25% decline over the past 24 hours. The continued bearish trend highlights SHIB’s challenges in regaining upward momentum. The record-breaking inflow of large holder activity for Shiba Inu is noteworthy but does not reflect significant market buying or whale accumulation. Instead, it underscores the influence of internal exchange transactions on on-chain metrics. As the broader crypto market navigates its current retracement phase, the token faces the dual challenge of market pressure and investor caution.

The prediction follows the approval and launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in 2024, which triggered significant demand from institutional and retail investors. This new accessibility has streamlined Bitcoin allocations, drawing pensions and endowments into the fold and signaling a broader institutional acceptance of the digital asset as outlined by the asset manager. Bhutan, El Salvador: A Playbook for Nation-State Bitcoin Success? Historically, nations like the US and China have held Bitcoin, but much of this exposure stems from government seizures linked to illicit activities rather than intentional, strategic investment. Fidelity believes this trend is poised to change. The report highlighted the successes of Bhutan and El Salvador, whose proactive Bitcoin strategies have delivered substantial returns. In light of challenges such as rampant inflation, currency debasement, and fiscal deficits, governments may increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability, with the potential costs of inaction outweighing those of adoption. “We expect 2025 to be the year this changes for both acceptance and adoption.” The calls for the US to lead this shift under a potentially Bitcoin-friendly administration have gained significant traction. For instance, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich recently said that Japan and other Asian nations would be sure to follow if President-elect Donald Trump established a US Bitcoin reserve. Both Trump and Senator Cynthia Lummis have expressed interest in establishing a Bitcoin reserve. Lummis, a longtime proponent of cryptocurrency, introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024, aimed at creating a regulatory framework for Bitcoin’s integration into the US treasury strategy. Should such measures be enacted, Fidelity said that it anticipates the geopolitical and economic pressures to drive other nations to follow suit, though likely under the radar to avoid market disruptions. Hurdles Ahead? Despite these optimistic projections, the report touches on the inherent uncertainty in government action and policy formation. While rhetoric from incoming US officials suggests a favorable outlook for digital assets, competing legislative priorities could delay meaningful progress.

SOL price is now below $192 and showing a few bearish signs. SOL price started a fresh decline after it failed to stay above $200 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $192 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $190 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $192 zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price struggled to clear the $200-$205 zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $200 and $192 support levels. The price even dipped below the $185 support. A low was formed at $182.20, and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $182 low. Solana is now trading below $192 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $190 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $190 level. The next major resistance is near the $192 level. The main resistance could be $200 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $182 low. A successful close above the $200 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $212. Any more gains might send the price toward the $225 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $192 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $182 level. The first major support is near the $180 level. A break below the $180 level might send the price toward the $175 zone.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 04:50:00

Her insights focused on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, sparking discussions within the crypto community. My 2025 crypto predictions: Bitcoin: $200,000 ETH: $7,000 SOL: $550 XRP: $4 Am I being too conservative? — Layah Heilpern (@LayahHeilpern) January 4, 2025 XRP Price Prediction for 2025 Heilpern said XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, could reach $4 in 2025. This projection represents a 69% increase from the token’s current price of $2.36. While the proposed growth rate appears moderate compared to historical bull market gains, it is noteworthy given the recent stagnation in the asset’s price movement. Over the past month, the token has struggled to maintain consistent upward momentum, encountering multiple price fluctuations. However, the recent performance offers a glimpse of its potential. For instance, the token initially recorded a 10% increase in the last week alone, suggesting that a surge to $4 within the year is achievable under favorable market conditions. Bitcoin and Ethereum Projections Additionally, Heilpern provided bold forecasts for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025. She envisions Bitcoin reaching a price of $200,000, representing a 112% increase from its current trading value of $94,500. Similarly, Ethereum is projected to hit $7,000, reflecting a 118% growth from its present level. These predictions indicate a significant bullish outlook for the broader cryptocurrency market, with BTC and ETH expected to rise substantially. Comparative Analysis While Heilpern’s prediction for XRP suggests a more conservative price movement compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, historical data highlights XRP’s ability to outperform these assets during major market rallies. Recent trends support this view, as the token has outpaced BTC and ETH in weekly performance. Furthermore, the digital asset has shown remarkable growth over the past two months, achieving a 336% increase, which far exceeds the performance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same timeframe. These figures suggest that the asset has the potential to surpass Heilpern’s $4 target, particularly if broader market conditions become highly favorable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Heilpern predicts XRP could reach $4 in 2025, some analysts argue this figure may underestimate the token’s potential. According to more optimistic forecasts, in scenarios where Bitcoin climbs to $200,000 and achieves a market cap of $4 trillion, XRP’s price could rise beyond double digits. Such projections are supported by the token’s historical performance in prior bull runs, where it has consistently demonstrated significant growth. As market dynamics evolve, some commentators maintain that the $4-$5 range may represent a short-term target rather than a peak price for 2025. In addition to her predictions for XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, Heilpern also shared her expectations for Solana (SOL). She believes the asset could reach $550 in 2025, representing a 153% increase from its current value of $197.75. Layah Heilpern’s forecasts offer valuable insights into potential market trends for 2025. While her predictions for the token remain conservative compared to other analysts, they highlight the asset’s resilience and capacity for growth in a competitive market.

38876805,https://coinpaper.com/6875/michael-saylor-shares-bitcoin-tracker-for-the-tenth-week-in-a-row,1736746200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Michael Saylor Shares Bitcoin Tracker for the Tenth Week in a Row,https://coinpaper.com/6875/michael-saylor-shares-bitcoin-tracker-for-the-tenth-week-in-a-row,"Major corporations are increasingly finding themselves at the center of debates over Bitcoin adoption as a treasury asset, fueled by shareholder proposals and bold strategies from key players. At Meta, a recent shareholder proposal advocates allocating a portion of its $72 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin, citing concerns over inflation and currency debasement. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, despite mixed reactions from the financial community. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy: A Double-Edged Sword for the Future of Corporate Treasury Management MicroStrategy's co-founder Michael Saylor continues to make waves in the cryptocurrency market as the company steadfastly pursues its Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury strategy. On Jan. 12, Saylor posted the company’s now-familiar Bitcoin tracker chart for the 10th consecutive week. Typically shared on Sundays, the chart often hints at impending Bitcoin purchases—a signal eagerly watched by cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike. As of the most recent update, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at 447,470 BTC, valued at approximately $42.4 billion. This follows the company’s acquisition of 1,070 BTC on Jan. 6. MicroStrategy's stock, however, paints a more volatile picture. Shares of the company are down approximately 40% from their all-time high of $543 per share, reached on Nov. 21, mirroring a broader downturn in cryptocurrency markets. Despite the decline, Saylor remains unyielding in his strategy, urging corporations to consider Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. His approach has sparked intense debate across the crypto community. For some, MicroStrategy represents a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s long-term success. For others, Saylor’s heavy reliance on debt financing to fund Bitcoin acquisitions raises sustainability concerns, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility. David Krause, emeritus professor of finance at Marquette University, has been one of the most vocal critics of MicroStrategy’s bold strategy. Krause recently said that a sudden and sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price could have catastrophic consequences for MicroStrategy. The potential erosion of shareholder equity and a scenario of bankruptcy liquidation, while extreme, are not beyond the realm of possibility, he warned. Bitcoin’s historic volatility amplifies these risks. For example, Bitcoin’s price has seen swings of over 10% within a single day in the past, often due to regulatory news or macroeconomic factors. Such fluctuations could heavily impact MicroStrategy’s stock value, given its reliance on Bitcoin as a primary corporate asset. Despite the criticism, Saylor remains undeterred and has doubled down on his Bitcoin strategy. In October 2024, he unveiled the company’s ambitious ”21/21 plan.” This strategy aims to secure $21 billion through equity offerings and an additional $21 billion through fixed-income securities, totaling $42 billion earmarked exclusively for Bitcoin purchases. On Jan. 3, MicroStrategy further announced plans for a potential $2 billion preferred stock offering, contingent on favorable market conditions in the first quarter of 2025. Proceeds from the stock offering are intended not only to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions but also to fortify the company’s balance sheet, aligning with the 21/21 plan’s overarching goals. While the 21/21 plan has drawn interest, it also shows MicroStrategy’s dependence on both equity and debt markets for liquidity. Analysts have noted that this approach leaves little margin for error, particularly if Bitcoin’s price trajectory does not meet the company’s optimistic projections. A Test Case for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy is more than just a bold gamble; it represents a potential paradigm shift in corporate treasury management. By tying its fortunes so closely to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has effectively become a proxy for the cryptocurrency’s performance. This dynamic has made the company a focal point for debates about Bitcoin adoption by corporations. While critics like Krause emphasize the risks, others view Saylor’s approach as visionary. In his view, Bitcoin’s finite supply and decentralized nature make it a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional assets like cash or bonds. Saylor has even extended his evangelism beyond MicroStrategy, advocating for Bitcoin adoption among major corporations, including tech giant Microsoft. As MicroStrategy forges ahead with its Bitcoin strategy, its journey will be closely watched by proponents and detractors alike. The company’s ability to navigate Bitcoin’s volatility, manage its debt obligations, and deliver shareholder value will determine whether it emerges as a trailblazer or cautionary tale in the annals of corporate treasury history. For now, Michael Saylor’s unyielding faith in Bitcoin underscores the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies, even as it raises questions about the risks of over-concentration in a single asset. Whether this gamble pays off or backfires remains a story in progress, with implications not just for MicroStrategy, but for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Meta Faces Shareholder Push for Bitcoin Adoption Amid Inflation Concerns A Meta shareholder has also stirred debate with a proposal advocating that the social media giant diversify its $72 billion in cash and short-term cash equivalents by allocating a portion to Bitcoin. Ethan Peck, the shareholder behind the proposal, argued that Bitcoin offers a hedge against currency debasement and inflation, citing its remarkable performance compared to traditional assets over the past five years. Peck’s proposal, submitted on behalf of his family’s shares, highlights the erosion of Meta’s cash holdings due to inflation. He claims that the company is losing 28% of its cash assets over time, a trend that could be mitigated through Bitcoin investment. Supporting his case, Peck pointed out that Bitcoin has outperformed bonds by an impressive 1,262% in the last five years. In his proposal, Peck drew attention to Meta's symbolic relationship with Bitcoin, referencing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s goats named “Bitcoin” and “Max” as well as Meta board member Marc Andreessen’s known support for Bitcoin. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, also serves as a director at Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. “Do Meta shareholders not deserve the same kind of responsible asset allocation for the company that Meta directors and executives likely implement for themselves?” Peck questioned. Peck is an employee of The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank advocating for free-market policies. The organization has also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon. The push for Bitcoin adoption as a corporate treasury asset is not new, and proponents like Peck face significant resistance from large corporations. Microsoft shareholders rejected a similar proposal in December 2024, which recommended the tech giant allocate at least 1% of its $484 billion in assets to Bitcoin . Amazon shareholders are next in line to consider such a strategy at their April 2025 meeting, following a proposal submitted by The National Center for Public Policy Research. The organization has been vocal about its criticism of traditional inflation metrics, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), arguing that they underestimate the real impact of inflation. The proposal suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a safeguard against a ”true inflation rate” that is double the CPI. Big Tech’s Cautious Stance on Bitcoin Despite these advocacy efforts, Big Tech companies remain cautious about adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Industry experts attribute this hesitancy to several factors. Nick Cowan, CEO of fintech firm Valereum, explained that the size and financial strength of companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon make them less inclined to take on the risks associated with Bitcoin. These firms already operate as leaders in highly profitable sectors and do not feel pressured to adopt a volatile asset like Bitcoin. “Bitcoin’s high volatility and lack of native yield-bearing opportunities also prevent tech firms from allocating 5% or more of their assets to BTC,” Cowan noted. Bitcoin's reputation for volatility is a major deterrent. While the cryptocurrency has demonstrated astronomical returns in the long term, it has also experienced dramatic short-term price swings. Such volatility could introduce unnecessary risk to companies with large cash reserves, particularly those seeking predictable financial stability. Peck’s proposal at Meta, though unlikely to pass, is part of a growing conversation around the role of Bitcoin in corporate treasury management. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already embraced Bitcoin, but their approaches have been polarizing. Critics warn of the risks posed by Bitcoin’s volatility, while proponents argue that it represents a hedge against inflation and a store of value superior to fiat currencies or bonds. If Meta were to adopt Bitcoin, it would signal a seismic shift in corporate attitudes toward cryptocurrency, potentially setting a precedent for other Big Tech firms. However, such a move would require addressing key concerns, including Bitcoin’s volatility and the lack of regulatory clarity in many jurisdictions. Meta shareholders will likely vote on the proposal in the coming months, but its success remains uncertain. As with Microsoft and Amazon, the proposal faces an uphill battle in convincing stakeholders of Bitcoin’s viability as a treasury asset. Even if rejected, the proposal signals a growing demand for innovation in corporate asset allocation strategies, particularly in an era of rising inflation and currency debasement concerns. Whether Meta chooses to embrace Bitcoin or not, the debate around cryptocurrency adoption by major corporations is far from over. For now, the spotlight remains on shareholder advocacy groups like The National Center for Public Policy Research, which continue to challenge traditional treasury strategies and push the boundaries of corporate financial management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-13 05:30:00

Why It’s Big deal,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-american-bankers-association-membership-why-its-big-deal/,"Ripple’s recent elevation to platinum membership in the American Bankers Association (ABA) is a significant development in the company’s strategy to integrate with traditional banking systems. As noted by crypto advocate Max Avery, this move highlights Ripple’s intent to position its payment solutions, XRP, and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as foundational technologies for future banking operations in the United States. Let's talk about Ripple's American Banker's Association membership. It's no surprise that they want to position Ripple payments, #XRP & the #XRPLedger for more bank partnerships. 1/8 — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) January 10, 2025 The Role of the ABA in the Banking Industry The ABA serves as the collective voice of America’s banking sector, representing over 4,000 banks. Its members collectively safeguard $18 trillion in deposits, extend nearly $11 trillion in loans, and employ over two million individuals. Ripple’s platinum membership status signifies its inclusion in this influential network, granting the company direct access to key decision-makers and the opportunity to influence the future of banking technology. Ripple’s Strategy and Market Positioning Ripple has long been recognized for its focus on providing efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable cross-border payment solutions. By aligning itself with the ABA, Ripple gains a platform to promote its technologies, including XRP and the XRPL, as solutions to some of the banking industry’s most pressing challenges. The company’s branding as “a green digital asset for a world without economic borders” aligns well with the growing demand for sustainable financial solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This membership status also allows Ripple to work more closely with ABA member banks, which collectively represent over 95% of the U.S. banking industry’s $13.5 trillion in assets. With the average ABA member bank holding $250 million in assets, Ripple’s engagement with this group could pave the way for widespread adoption of its technology within the U.S. financial system. Implications of Regulatory Clarity A major obstacle to Ripple’s expansion in the United States has been the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding XRP. The conclusion of the SEC’s legal case against Ripple is expected to address these uncertainties, creating an environment in which U.S. banks can explore XRP and XRPL integration without fear of legal repercussions. Max Avery and other industry observers anticipate that this clarity will lead to public announcements of partnerships that have likely been in development but withheld due to regulatory ambiguity. As Max Avery points out, Ripple’s inclusion in the ABA signals that the company is now part of the banking industry’s “inner circle.” This strategic positioning, combined with the anticipated resolution of regulatory issues, could open the floodgates for utility-driven crypto adoption across the U.S. banking system.

They predict key benchmarks could rise by around 20% by the end of the year. A recent Bloomberg report said that the team led by Kinger Lau is still bullish on mainland and offshore Chinese shares, including a positive risk reward. In a Sunday note, they added, “The sentiment and liquidity backdrop may begin to improve in late 1Q 25 on better tariff and policy clarity.” Yet this confidence comes notwithstanding November’s bullish call, which is now out of step with markets. Goldman Sachs recommends stocks tied to government spending, exports, and tech Goldman Sachs recommendation is to buy stocks tied to government spending, exporters that benefit from a weaker yuan, and selected tech and infrastructure firms. They consider shareholder returns “should continue to prevail on record-breaking cash distribution and falling domestic rates.” Furthermore, the strategists prefer online retail, media, and healthcare stocks and have also upgraded consumer services shares to overweight. HSBC said Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong remain an attractive growth story, confident of policies to support mainland China and higher growth prospects. Goldman in November predicted Chinese stocks would gain 20% in 12 months as officials sought to quicken an economic slowdown. But since then, the MSCI China Index has dropped about 10% as worries about growth, declining producer prices, and new US tariffs have grown.

Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, filed his ethics agreement and financial disclosures ahead of his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing. As reported by The New York Times, disclosure revealed assets worth over $700 million , including between $250,000 and $500,000 in Bitcoin ETF investments. Bessent, who previously worked for billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has pledged to sell his investments in various funds, trusts, and other holdings to ensure there are no conflicts if confirmed as Treasury Secretary. In addition to Bitcoin-related assets, Bessent disclosed other investments that could pose conflicts, such as a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and a stake in the conservative publisher All Seasons. To comply with ethics requirements, Bessent has committed to avoiding any financial interests that might interfere with his duties at the Treasury Department. Bessent’s latest hedge fund, Key Square Capital, was launched in 2016 with $4.5 billion in funds, including $2 billion from George Soros. However, it now manages much less money. Bessent’s previous fund, from the early 2000s, also had disappointing results. As Treasury Secretary, Bessent would be tasked with managing the federal debt while navigating Trump’s plans to extend expiring tax cuts and eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.

Its recent surge in development and increasing adoption has experts and investors speculating about what’s next. This asset has made incredible moves, from its innovative proof-of-stake model to game-changing updates like Hydra. Investors are increasingly drawn to Cardano's sustainable technology and its expanding use cases in decentralized finance. Yet, there is a catch! The crypto market is constantly evolving; emerging and innovative platforms like DTX Exchange could be a strong contender in 2025. This new altcoin offers users a streamlined access to numerous financial assets, allowing users to diversify their portfolios. This article shares details about ADA’s recent climb and DTX’s growing momentum. Cardano (ADA) Surges By Over 20+% as The Crypto Market Recovers Cardano has seen its value surge by over 20% in the past 7 days, fluctuating between $0.9 and $1.1 . This remarkable surge shows signs of recovery in the broader market trend. Experts and investors are excited about the ADA’s future prospects this year and hope to accumulate more tokens. However, technical indicators show mixed signals about the Cardano price. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) suggests sell signals on short-term charts but remains bullish on weekly and monthly outlooks. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays neutral, reflecting market uncertainty. Bullish sentiment within the Cardano community and high trading volumes hint at a potential rebound. Also, the project’s robust development team, innovative platform, and high utility could provide long-term recovery. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Revolutionary Trading Platform DTX Exchange has become one of the innovative players in the online trading industry, aiming for a multi-billion-dollar market. DTX could disrupt the crypto space with its hybrid trading platform that merges the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges. What makes this project different? In contrast to regular platforms, DTX Exchange promises to grant traders unparalleled access to several asset classes, from bonds and stocks to cryptos and tokenized ETFs. Besides this, the platform will also offer trading leverage as high as 1,000x, a bold move in luring both retail and institutional traders who want to magnify their opportunities. That being said, this project has gathered immense publicity, mostly through its presale event. Investors are racing to be early movers, considering how this token will likely open special privileges in their favor. Holders have the right to vote in governance and even share the revenues from the platform, collected from trading fees. That incentivizes your long-term participation in the game. The success of its ongoing presale speaks volumes about the enthusiasm surrounding this platform. Having raised over $11.3 million so far, millions of tokens have already been snapped up, showing the demand for a project that is about to change the face of online trading. As DTX continues to expand its reach and integrate advanced trading features, it's clear this platform aims to become a dominant force in the market. Final Thoughts From its groundbreaking scalability solutions to the continuously developing DeFi ecosystem, recent advances place Cardano (ADA) in a perfect position to continue competing for one of the top 10 cryptos. The constant focus on sustainability and real-world utility keeps both developers and investors interested and optimistic about its future. Since the crypto market is competitive, newer platforms, like DTX Exchange, offer unique value propositions that rival established players. Overall, DTX Exchange might be a top contender in the crypto market and offer traders a unique approach to trading.

I am not against cryptocurrencies,” he said. Dimon’s comments on Bitcoin, however, were less positive. He reiterated his skepticism, saying: “Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It’s predominantly used by human traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware.” Despite his criticisms, he acknowledged the right of individuals to buy and sell the cryptocurrency, saying: “I support you wanting to buy or sell Bitcoin.

SOL forecast: Can SOL price break past $500? Solana turned in a sensational run from 2023 to 2024. SOL price notably rose from below $10 in January 2023 to a new all-time high of $268 last November. And while talks circulate about SOL price potentially breaking $500 this year, on-chain statistics say otherwise. A good number of SOL traders have taken major profits, causing SOL price to plunge to the $180 to $200 range to start the year. SOL price trades at $186 as of press time, representing an excellent opportunity to buy SOL at a discount. Solana backers aren’t being unreasonable to believe SOL price can retest all-time highs and peak to approximately 3x if optimal bull conditions are met. Rollblock: Rising GambleFi giant looking to dominate in 2025 Whereas SOL backers are betting on a 3x at most, the new rising crypto Rollblock offers much more tantalizing pump potential, and we’re talking along the lines of a 100x. Currently in stage 9 of its presale, Rollblock has raised past $8.5 million, drawing 40,000 new investors to its ICO. The early traction Rollblock has gained is indicative of its potential to dominate the iGaming-adjacent GambleFi sector, which is worth hundreds of billions. Rollblock offers a world of slots, live dealer games, and sports/esports betting options, as well as staking/yield farming options and an enticing revenue share, 30% of the GambleFi protocol’s revenues paid out weekly. Additionally, Rollblock provides an 18% yearly staking reward to encourage long-term engagement. Rollblock combines innovation and practical application, making it an appealing alternative for investors looking for actual value. Rollblock’s unique value proposition as the premier GambleFi protocol on Ethereum puts it right at the cusp of parabolic growth. And with RBLK price still holding at just $0.045, prospective investors still have the opportunity to accumulate their stockpiles even before RBLK lists and skyrockets in value.

Rollblock’s microcap blue chip status, meanwhile, gives it all the legroom to go past a 100x run. While Solana offers meme coin and DeFi opportunities to generate passive income, Rollblock offers it natively by way of its weekly revenue share. Hold RBLK and earn, simple as that. Lastly, Solana has already pumped, buying now will be paying over the odds for something with lower upside for gains. Rollblock offers maximal ROIs at a low entry point. Easy choice here, Rollblock takes the cake. The final word Rollblock trumps Solana as far as potential gains in 2025 are concerned. Rollblock’s staking rewards, revenue share incentive, and GambleFi utility give it limitless upside to upstage Solana this year. It’s no surprise why SOL holders are rotating their profits into Rollblock, it could very well be their best trade of the year. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

Globally, Vietnamese authorities arrested four individuals for a crypto mining scam, and Kenya proposed a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets to protect its investors. Meanwhile, Mango Markets announced that it will be shutting down after an SEC settlement over unregistered securities offerings. Attorney General Acts to Recover Stolen Crypto New York Attorney General Letitia James took legal action to recover more than $2 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen from victims who were lured into fraudulent schemes under the guise of remote work opportunities. Scammers targeted New Yorkers with deceptive text messages, offering flexible, well-paying jobs that ultimately resulted in financial losses. The victims were tricked into creating crypto accounts, depositing funds, and reviewing products on counterfeit websites mimicking legitimate brands. They were instructed to maintain a crypto balance matching or exceeding the product costs and were assured that they were not actually buying the products. Instead, the money was allegedly used to “legitimize” the data for the reviews. They were also promised a return of their funds along with commissions, but the victims never received any compensation, and their money was stolen. Example of the messages sent by the scammers (Source: Office of the New York State Attorney General ) With assistance from the US Secret Service, the Attorney General's office froze the stolen cryptocurrency. Letitia James urged people to stay very vigilant against unsolicited messages offering work opportunities, and also called these scams ”cruel and unacceptable,” especially because they prey on people who are trying to support their families. This case happened after a warning was issued by the FBI in June of 2024 about an increase in work-from-home scams. The FBI pointed out tactics where scammers contacted victims via unsolicited messages, and offered simple tasks like rating restaurants or ”optimizing” services. These schemes also involved fraudulent demands for cryptocurrency payments under the pretense of unlocking additional work, with the funds going directly to the scammers. Wolf Capital Founder Admits to Investor Scam Travis Ford, the co-founder and head trader of the cryptocurrency investment firm Wolf Capital, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud after deceiving investors with false promises of extraordinary returns. According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Ford raised close to $9.4 million from around 2,800 investors between January and August of 2023 by claiming he could generate daily returns of 1-2%. This is equivalent to an annual return of about 547%. By using social media, Wolf Capital’s website, and online promotions, Ford portrayed himself as a very sophisticated investor to lure victims into the scheme. Instead of using the funds as promised, Ford misappropriated the money for his own personal financial benefit and that of his co-conspirators. As a result, this caused major financial losses to investors. Ford admitted to the DOJ that the returns he promised were impossible to achieve consistently. He now faces a maximum sentence of five years, although a sentencing date still has to be determined. As seen with the crypto work-from-home scam case as well as the Wolf Capital case, there has been a global crackdown on crypto-related fraud. On Jan. 5, Vietnamese police arrested four people that were involved in a crypto mining scam that defrauded more than 200 victims of 4 billion Vietnamese dong, or approximately $157,300. In the United States, police in Springfield, Massachusetts, also warned residents about a rise in crypto scams, particularly those involving Bitcoin ATMs, where victims are directed to transfer funds to scammers. Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that hackers and scammers stole over $3 billion through crypto-related activities in 2024, which was a 15% increase from the previous year. Mango Markets Shuts Down After SEC Settlement Meanwhile, Solana-based decentralized exchange Mango Markets recently announced its closure, and urged its users to close their positions. The decision was made after governance proposals to end borrowing and lending, which are set to take effect on Jan. 13, after unanimous community approval. The shutdown also happened after a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of unregistered securities offerings. In September of 2024, the SEC charged Mango DAO and the Blockworks Foundation, and claimed the sale of $70 million worth of MNGO governance tokens violated federal securities laws. Mango Labs was also accused of operating as an unregistered broker. As part of the settlement , Mango agreed to pay $700,000 in civil penalties, destroy MNGO tokens, and petition exchanges to delist them. The Mango DAO previously voted to settle with the SEC for $223,228 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for $500,000. Mango Markets was launched in August of 2021 by Maximilian Schneider, Britt Cyr, and John Kramer, and its goal was to provide fast and cost-effective trading and lending services on the Solana blockchain. At its peak, the platform had $210 million in total value locked but this has since declined to $6 million, according to data from DefiLlama . Mango Markets’ troubles date back to October 2022, when trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg exploited a vulnerability in its protocol to drain over $100 million. While Eisenberg returned $67 million after a community governance vote, he kept $40 million. US authorities arrested him in December of 2022 on charges of fraud and market manipulation. Eisenberg is still in custody, and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. His sentencing was recently postponed to April 2025 because of the complexity of the legal issues. Kenya Plans New Crypto Regulations In light of these recent shutdowns, Kenya is moving towards regulating crypto , signaling a shift from the more cautious stance that was previously taken by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi announced it is very committed to establishing a legal and regulatory framework for virtual assets and service providers. This initiative is part of a new draft proposal that is titled “ National Policy on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers .” The goal of the draft is to create a fair, competitive, and stable market for cryptocurrencies in Kenya while addressing risks like money laundering, terrorism financing, and consumer protection. It proposes comprehensive legal standards and procedures to govern virtual asset activities and is open for public feedback until Jan. 24. If adopted, Kenya will join countries like South Africa and Nigeria in implementing crypto regulations. Kenya’s approach to cryptocurrencies evolved a lot since the CBK’s 2015 warning about risks like fraud and lack of legal protections. Cryptocurrencies are not banned in Kenya, but the CBK has historically advised against their use. A turning point came in September of 2023 when the country completed a risk assessment on money laundering and terrorism financing involving virtual assets. The assessment recommended regulation to mitigate these risks and boost the country’s anti-money laundering framework. (Source: Chainalysis ) Kenya stepped up as a major player in sub-Saharan Africa’s crypto adoption. According to Chainalysis , Kenya ranks 21st globally on the 2024 Crypto Adoption Index. Stablecoins account for almost half of the region’s transaction volume, driven by currency devaluation. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Kenya recorded $3.3 billion in stablecoin transactions, trailing regional leaders Nigeria with $21.8 billion, South Africa with $13.5 billion, and Ghana with $3.9 billion.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-13 06:09:34

Despite this, its dominance remains steady, consolidating just below 58% . Meanwhile, Prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe hints that a massive altcoin season might be just around the corner. He draws a compelling parallel between the next two years to historic financial booms, he suggests altcoins could be gearing up for explosive gains. Altcoin Cycle To Peak In a recent tweet post, van de Poppe compared the next two years in crypto to the boom periods of 1928-1929 and 1998-1999. He believes this could bring huge opportunities for investors, especially in altcoins. I would classify the upcoming 2 years as the 1928, 1929 or 1998, 1999 of the peak of this entire cycle. During that period, the highest returns are made. Those returns will be in #Altcoins & Crypto. Enjoy the ride. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 12, 2025 The periods he referenced were marked by a rush into new technologies, stock market growth in the late 1920s, and the internet boom in the late 1990s. Similarly, van de Poppe sees the crypto market entering a “peak cycle,” where the potential for returns is extraordinarily high. Drawing a parallel to these periods, van de Poppe suggests that the crypto market, particularly altcoins, could experience a similar explosion in value. Those prepared for this cycle could potentially see significant gains, similar to past historic opportunities. Altcoin To Rally in Early 2025 Altcoins are gearing up for a potential explosive rally as they enter the “140-day Golden Window,” a critical 20-week period when altcoins historically surge while Bitcoin’s dominance declines. However, Bitcoin dominance recently faced rejection at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level and is now hovering around 58%. This shift could set the stage for altcoins to shine in the coming months. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index has climbed slightly to 51 , hinting at growing momentum. However, the market remains in Bitcoin Season, as less than 25% of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days.

This has resulted in the altcoin market experiencing a similar price trend. With the fear of extreme volatility in the crypto space, top altcoins such as ETH price and Ripple price are prepared to witness significant action this month. With increasing volatility in the crypto market, is this a good time to invest in the top cryptocurrencies? In this article, we have covered the market sentiments and possible price analysis of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) crypto tokens for this week. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin price today has lost ~1% to its valuation with an intraday trading volume of $25.927 billion, a chnage of +59.12%. Moreover, it has dropped over 5% in the past week and 8% in the past 30 days. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a neutral trend around halfway in the BTC price chart. However, with its SMA indicator displaying a bearish curve, the price of Bitcoin hints at a mixed price sentiment this week. If the bulls regain momentum, the Bitcoin price could prepare to retest its milestone of $100,000. Contrarily, if the bears outrun the bulls, the price of BTC could drop toward its low of $90,000.

TradingView: ETH/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has witnessed a constant rise in the red histogram with its averages showing a bearish convergence. Moreover, the EMA 50-day shows a negative crossover, highlighting an increase in the selling pressure. Maintaining the price above its support/resistance level of $3,272 could set the stage for this altcoin to retest its high of $3,700. Conversely, an intensified bearish sentiment could drag the price down to its low of $3,100 this month. Wondering if the ETH price will achieve the $5,000 mark this Altseason? Read Ethereum Price Prediction to uncover the long-term mysteries! Ripple (XRP) The XRP coin price has plunged 1.47% in the past day with a trading volume of $5.472 billion.

TradingView: XRP/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the verge of experiencing a bullish crossover in the daily time frame. On the other hand, the RSI indicator shows a negative action.

However, the spotlight has shifted to the Lightchain AI Presale , a new cryptocurrency with incredible potential that’s already capturing the attention of major players. This emerging coin is predicted to deliver massive gains, with analysts speculating returns of up to 600x thanks to its innovative technology and strong community support. As more investors, including whales, flock to Lightchain AI, excitement around its future growth continues to soar. With momentum building quickly, this rising cryptocurrency is shaping up to be a major game-changer in the market. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to secure substantial returns by getting in early! Selling Pressure Leads to Decline in DOGE and SHIB Prices In recent weeks, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant price declines, primarily due to increased selling pressure. On December 10, 2024, DOGE and SHIB leveraged traders faced over $108 million in liquidations within 24 hours, indicating a substantial sell-off in these cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators for both tokens suggest a bearish trend. For DOGE, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a bearish divergence, often signaling a potential decline. Similarly, SHIB’s RSI shows a bearish divergence, indicating a possible downturn. These developments highlight the volatility of meme-based cryptocurrencies and underscore the importance of monitoring market trends and technical indicators when assessing their price movements. Whale Activity Shifts Focus to Lightchain AI with Potential for Massive Gains Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly gaining attention from major cryptocurrency investors, including whales from Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) ecosystems. These investors are reallocating significant funds into LCAI, recognizing its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. The ongoing presale of LCAI tokens, priced at just $0.004, has raised over $7 million, indicating strong investor confidence. Analysts predict that LCAI could experience exponential growth, with projections suggesting a 22,000% increase by Q1 2025. This surge in whale activity underscores the growing interest in projects that offer real-world applications and scalability, positioning Lightchain AI as a promising candidate for substantial gains in the near future. Analyzing the 600X Growth Potential of the Emerging Cryptocurrency Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an emerging cryptocurrency that has garnered significant attention for its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Analysts predict substantial growth for LCAI, with some projections suggesting a potential 600x increase in value. Technological Innovation LCAI introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, rewarding nodes for performing AI-specific tasks like model training and optimization.

Market Adoption and Strategic Partnerships The platform’s roadmap emphasizes adoption and ecosystem growth, with key milestones such as the testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet activation in March 2025. Strategic partnerships with AI-focused enterprises and blockchain projects are expected to expand LCAI’s reach, creating a robust ecosystem that supports a wide range of applications. Market Trends Supporting Growth The increasing demand for AI-driven solutions across industries and the anticipated 2025 bull run provide a favorable environment for LCAI’s growth. Investors are prioritizing projects with real-world applications, positioning LCAI as a top contender for substantial gains. While these projections are optimistic, they underscore the transformative potential of Lightchain AI in the cryptocurrency market.

PEPE price is down by 3.59% in the last 24 hours and is exchanging hands at $0.00001724. PEPE is also down by 17.93% in a week and 28.97% in the last month. Meanwhile, open interests and 24-hour trading volume are up by 0.41% and 16.53%, respectively. Ongoing sentiments towards PEPE are bearish with an FGI of 62 points and volatility of around 10.13%, as per CoinCodex. CoinGape analysis indicates PEPE coin to rally next, but it is equally important to note that the crypto market is highly volatile and prices can move in either direction based on multiple factors. Recent PEPE Coin Whale Activity A previous PEPE coin whale activity was reported last week, where the whale was seen dumping 85 billion coins. According to that report, PEPE coins were dumped into the market at an approximate value of 1.51 million USDC, thereby. This went on to strengthen the speculation that more selloffs could happen, however whales are actually buying the dip now. This may help bring a positive upside momentum if the broader altcoin market recovers.

The total trading volume of the tokens has also followed the same downward trend, with a steep decline of nearly 50% to $2.88 billion. Although these figures indicate a decline, cryptocurrency experts think this drop offers a worthwhile opportunity for investors. As AI continues to revolutionize industries, blockchain-based AI tokens are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of innovation. Projects that integrate AI with decentralized finance (DeFi) are set to lead the anticipated Q1 2025 market rally, with a few standout tokens already gaining momentum. Below, we explore four promising AI tokens that could dominate the upcoming rally, driven by real-world utility and increasing demand. Top 4 AI Coins Poised to Dominate Q1 2025 Market Rally Rexas Finance (RXS), SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) are AI tokens that could take over the cryptocurrency market rally, in Q1, 2025. 1. SingularityNET (AGIX): Decentralizing AI for a New Era SingularityNET is a highly focused business on AI and enables several developers to develop and sell their platforms through a decentralized marketplace. This marketplace covers many applications, such as healthcare and robotics, demonstrating multi-purpose capabilities across many sectors. Its interoperability strategy also increases the range of its potential applications and overall impact by allowing for easier cooperation with other blockchains and ecosystems. SingularityNET (AGIX) price chart By providing a marketplace for AI services, SingularityNET empowers developers and organizations to collaborate and innovate without the constraints of centralized control. AGIX is trading at $0.5516, although showing a slight decline of about 4.50% decrease from the past day. The deficits in centralized solutions further boost the excellent demand for AI services, thus giving the AI coin a strong competitive advantage. 2. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Bullish Investment Opportunity Rexas Finance is one of the first projects working towards merging AI and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to convert tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and other items into tokens. Rexas intends to convert these traditionally unreachable assets into digital tokens, enhancing their accessibility for the general public, uncovering new investment opportunities, and boosting liquidity in markets that were once exclusive. The ongoing Rexas Finance (RXS) presale has generated significant attention, raising over $35 million—a clear indication of investor confidence in the project. The growing and highly engaging community reflects the positive sentiment surrounding the platform’s innovative approach. With the successful presale and the unique utility, the perspective of the RWA token is on the bright side, ensuring a progressive environment for growth and acceptance. Rexas finance tokenomics Furthermore, Rexas Finance intends to focus on integrating AI and DeFi by facilitating the process and offering tools that aid in tokenizing and managing real-world assets. The platform’s unique strategies, branding, and positive community sentiment, RXS is a blockchain that will most likely lead the Q1 2025 Market Rally. 3. Fetch.ai (FET): AI Coin Empowering Autonomous Economies Fetch.ai (FET) is another example of a distributed ledger technology-based platform specializing in mechanized learning. It enables the deployment of autonomous agents for multiple applications, including supplier chains and energy distribution systems. Through its decentralized AI network, Fetch.ai offers highly effective, affordable, and scalable solutions, making it a cutting-edge technology disruptor. As AI integrates into various industries, Fetch.ai aims to further its momentum and secure its engagement as a leader in adopting blockchain and AI technologies. Using a hybrid of AI and blockchain, the platform plans to optimize complex systems and increase efficiency across various domains. Although FET price has declined by 5.68% over the past day, settling at $1.24, the AI coin has so far performed well in the market, because of its real-world use cases and collaboration with multiple industry players, including SingularityNET. 4. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN): Unleashing Data for AI Innovation Ocean Protocol is a distributed commercial protocol mainly designed to support artificial intelligence while protecting data. It allows data owners to sell their data without losing ownership, allowing the construction of AI models and data for such applications. The ASI token will serve as the unified currency within this ecosystem, streamlining transactions and incentivizing participation. This consolidation is poised to enhance the scalability and efficiency of AI development, driving innovation and democratizing access to AI technologies. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) price chart OCEAN is trading at $0.565, reflecting an increment of 3.23% in the last 24 hours. The increasing need for data in the growing AI and the requirements for safe data transfers have given the AI token room to dominate. Final Thoughts The intersection of AI and blockchain is swiftly transforming the cryptocurrency environment, providing fresh opportunities in multiple industries. Initiatives such as Rexas Finance (RXS), SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) are leading this change by providing effective answers to actual issues. These AI coins go beyond being mere speculative assets; they signify a new age of innovation where AI-powered systems enhance efficiency and accessibility within decentralized ecosystems. With the Q1 2025 rally on the horizon, initial investors are poised to gain considerably from these developments, especially by taking advantage of opportunities to back projects such as RXS in their presale stage.

Data from Tokenomist show the weekly unlocks calendar, that includes names like ONDO, ARB, STRK SEI and others, is worth $3 billion – the largest amount since November. Decentralized tokenization-focused platform Ondo Finance's ONDO accounts for a giant share of the tally. On Jan. 18, the project will free up 1.94 billion ONDO worth $2.23 billion, equating to over 130% of the token's circulating supply of around 1.4 billion. ONDO's impending unlock is also several times bigger than its daily trading volume, which has recently ranged between $250 million to $300 million. Unlocks are staggered releases of tokens initially frozen to prevent early investors and project team members from liquidating coins at once. The gradual release helps avoid rapid price swings and market instability. Yet, occasionally, we get to see ONDO-like unlocks that are bigger in terms of the circulating supply of the token or the coin's average daily volume, threatening to inject volatility into the market. Per Research by The Tie, tokens facing unlocks equivalent to 100% of the average daily volume experience volatility in the lead-up to and following the event. ONDO changed hands at $1.14 at press time, the lowest since Dec. 2, representing a 5% loss for the day and a nearly 15% month-to-date decline.

The weekend traded flat, but there was a minor spike in activity and a subsequent price correction on Monday morning in Asia. Moreover, several key inflation reports are due in the US this week, which could impact central bank monetary policy. This will be the final set of CPI and PPI data before the Jan. 29 Federal Reserve meeting, observed the Kobeissi Letter. Last week, the Consumer Sentiment index reflected a rise in inflation expectations which was consistent with the price trends within the ISM Services PMI report. This may have impacted high-risk assets such as crypto and tech stocks, which corrected heavily. Economic Events Jan. 13 to 17 Potential reacceleration in inflation led investors and analysts to voice concerns that the Fed may pause rate reductions in the first half of the year. Additionally, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said that inflation has risen “uncomfortably above” its long-term target “while still presenting stubborn upside risks.” December’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report is released on Tuesday, reflecting input prices for producers and manufacturers. This data measures the costs of producing consumer goods, which directly affects retail pricing and is viewed as a signal of inflationary pressures. Another key inflation indicator, December’s Core CPI report, is due on Wednesday. The Consumer Price Index is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. “The Fed is widely expected to pause its rate-cutting cycle at its next meeting at the end of the month, but firmer-than-expected CPI data could push back market projections for further easing even later in the year,” wrote Reuters on Jan. 12. Key Events This Week: 1. December PPI Inflation data – Tuesday 2. December CPI Inflation data – Wednesday 3. December Retail Sales data – Thursday 4. Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index – Thursday 5. December Housing Starts data – Friday 6. Total of 7 Fed speaker events… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2025 December’s Retail Sales report is due on Thursday. It provides information on the amount of money consumers are spending on both durable and non-durable goods and is a leading indicator of the economy’s overall health. Earnings results from major banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in the coming week kick off fourth-quarter reports for companies in the US. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization remained flat over the weekend but dropped below $3.4 trillion at the time of writing. Bitcoin spiked close to $96,000 during the Monday morning Asian trading session but immediately retreated back toward and below $94,000 where it has been for the past few days.

With the explosive growth of meme coins captivating the crypto world, it’s no surprise that investors are hunting for the next big opportunity. Among the top new meme coins for exponential returns, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out with its groundbreaking Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a presale that’s raising eyebrows. Alongside this promising project, Snek (SNEK) and Gigachad (GIGA) have carved their niches as staples in the meme coin frenzy. In this article, we dive deep into what makes these coins unique and why BTFD Coin’s presale success and P2E game are shaking things up in the crypto space. BTFD Coin: A Game-Changer in the Meme Coin Space Picture this: you’re diving into an immersive Play-to-Earn game, collecting rewards while being part of an electrifying community rallying around a meme coin designed for bulls. That’s the essence of BTFD Coin. Unlike other meme coins that primarily ride the hype wave, BTFD has brought tangible utility to the table with its P2E game and impressive staking rewards. What Sets BTFD Apart? BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn game isn’t just a side gig; it’s the heart of its ecosystem. Players step into the shoes of the iconic Bulls Squad, navigating challenging levels, collecting tokens, and earning real rewards. The game’s full version, now live, has captivated crypto gamers with its dynamic gameplay and seamless integration with DeFi wallets. Imagine earning crypto while smashing through levels — it’s a gaming experience that makes your investments work for you. For example, players can convert in-game coins into $BTFD tokens to stake or trade. This utility ties the game directly to the coin’s value, creating an ecosystem where community engagement directly impacts the coin’s growth. Staking Rewards That Pay Off BTFD’s staking mechanism offers a whopping 90% APY. Whether you’re a casual investor or a crypto whale, these returns are hard to ignore. Imagine staking $7,500 worth of BTFD tokens during the presale at $0.000142 each. That nets you over 52.8 million tokens. By the presale’s end, when the price hits $0.0006, your holdings could balloon to $31,680—a jaw-dropping return. Presale Success With over $5.1 million raised and more than 64 billion tokens sold to 8,200+ holders, BTFD Coin’s presale is on fire. Early investors are flocking to the 13th stage, locking in their tokens before the next price surge.

By the time BTFD Coin hits exchanges, early investors could be looking at exponential gains, staking rewards, and gaming profits—a trifecta of benefits. Snek: A Meme Coin Mainstay with a Strong Community When it comes to meme coins with staying power, Snek (SNEK) is a name that keeps popping up in conversations.

From organizing giveaways to collaborating with influencers, the community keeps the project buzzing. Its straightforward tokenomics and the transparent team have earned it a reputation as a reliable player in the meme coin space. Gigachad: The Ultimate Meme Coin Flex If Snek is about inclusivity, Gigachad (GIGA) is all about flexing. As a meme coin that embodies the internet’s obsession with alpha culture, GIGA has built a brand that screams confidence and domination. Gigachad has leaned heavily into its meme status, creating a culture of exclusivity and ambition. It’s the crypto equivalent of a motivational poster, inspiring its holders to aim high and hold strong. But GIGA isn’t just about hype—it has also developed utility through NFTs and exclusive staking pools, making it a well-rounded project. The Gigachad community thrives on a shared sense of pride and belonging. Whether it’s exclusive NFT drops or community events, GIGA knows how to keep its holders engaged. The project’s transparency and consistent updates have bolstered trust, making it a go-to choice for those looking to invest in something bigger than just a coin.

33767162,[object Object],1736752535,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Lauded As ‘Leader Of The Pack’ By Legendary Trader,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-leader-of-the-pack-legendary-trader/,"In a notable shift of sentiment, renowned technical analyst and commodities trader Peter Brandt has offered rare praise for XRP, describing the token as the current standout performer among its crypto peers. Brandt posted a daily XRP/USD chart on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday, proclaiming: “Leader of the pack.” In the same post, he underscored the significance of genuine market positions over mere forecasts, remarking: “I posted a chart last week predicting it. Predictions mean nothing. Predictions are a dime a dozen. Positions are what count.” This statement underlined his core trading philosophy that actual holdings outweigh speculation. Brandt Extends Olive Branch To The XRP Army Brandt’s endorsement of XRP follows up on a key technical analysis he shared last week via X, in which he highlighted a potential “half mast flag” formation. At the time, Brandt stressed that such patterns should resolve within six weeks, warning that otherwise they become suspect: “Half mast flags should complete within six weeks, otherwise they should be viewed with great suspicion. This flag in XRP needs to rock and roll soon, otherwise it will likely morph into something else TBD. But if it completes, then market cap of $500 B is possible. According to Brandt’s analysis, if the crypto asset confirmed the half mast flag pattern , the asset could more than triple in value in the following weeks. Notably, when the veteran trader made these comments, XRP’s market capitalization stood at approximately $138 billion, suggesting that an upward move to a $500 billion valuation could lie ahead. As of this week, Brandt has observed an apparent breakout from the flagged formation, which—if validated—would suggest that his projection remains on track. Brandt, who has been a vocal skeptic of XRP in prior years, surprised the community on Sunday by extending what he described as an “olive branch” to XRP holders. After acknowledging past criticisms, Brandt attributed his caution to his need to protect trading capital, stating: “Over the years I have taken some hard shots at you and your XRP asset. I admit my rudeness. I joy in your success at present. As a career trader nothing makes me happier than to see other speculators climb the mountain successfully. I would never disparage your success, only your attitude of defending 90% declines against an asset with more stability.” He emphasized his long-held belief that traders must preserve capital by shying away from assets that, in his view, have a history of precipitous declines, especially relative to Bitcoin, which he deems the “store of wealth” standard. Brandt recounted how, in 1981, he went “all-in” on futures trading with minimal initial capital, thereby reinforcing the importance of capital protection: “XRP has repeatedly over the years lost 80%, 90%, up to 97% of its value to BTC which I consider to be the ‘ store of wealth ’ standard. … Holding onto a speculative asset losing 90% against a more stable asset is the definition of insanity […] My faith is entirely based on my approach to cut losses quickly and allow for profitable trades in whatever asset I’ve held to grow. I will stand by that faith. And I stand by my belief that any asset that routinely can lose 80% or more against a more stable asset is an insane way to grow wealth.” Nonetheless, he clarified that his criticism was directed primarily toward what he described as “dogmatic, obnoxious” defenses of the token amid extreme drawdowns, rather than the community’s personal endeavors. The legendary trader concluded: “If you accept my Olive Branch, thanks for your graciousness. If you decline it with only rude or gross feelings, that’s your choice. Be assured that I have made my last X post about your precious XRP. I wish you the best with this asset.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.45.",XRP|Peter Brandt|XRP news|XRP price|XRP price analysis,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-13 07:15:35

This vision stems from B²’s rich BTC data and robust Data Availability (DA) functionality, providing a decentralized, secure, and transparent growth environment for AI agents. Exploring BTC On-Chain Data: Unlocking the Future of AI Ecosystems Since the launch of the B² mainnet, over 101 million on-chain transactions have been processed. During the analysis of these transactions, the B² team identified a notable pattern: certain interaction behaviors on-chain exhibit the traits of early “AI agents.” These agents perform basic tasks through decentralized applications (dApps) and reward mechanisms, demonstrating initial self-management capabilities. This discovery prompted B² to propose a bold vision — the emergence of on-chain life is no longer a science fiction concept but a plausible future trend. These AI agents are not merely tools or algorithms but digital life forms with independent economic activities. In B²’s vision, BTC is not only a symbol of the origin of on-chain civilization but also the core value carrier for future AI agent economic activities. AI agents will leverage BTC to exchange resources, lease computing power, and issue assets on-chain, driving the prosperity of on-chain civilizations. The Beginning of On-Chain Life: B² Rollup as the Infrastructure for AI Agents B² Rollup, introduced by B² Network, is a BTC mainnet scaling solution that will serve as the core infrastructure for on-chain life. Through Rollup technology, B² addresses Bitcoin’s scalability issues while providing AI agents with a stable, efficient on-chain environment where they can grow and evolve freely, fostering the development of a decentralized economy. B² Hub: The Data-Driven Engine for AI Agents As a key component of B² Network, B² Hub is a critical platform that provides knowledge access, data transparency, and evolutionary paths for AI agents. Data Retrieval : By introducing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies, AI agents can access both on-chain and traditional internet data, continuously acquiring new knowledge to become smarter. Data Transparency : Leveraging BTC’s core technology, AI agents can independently verify knowledge sources, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy data environment. User-Contributed Data : Through user-provided on-chain and off-chain data feeds, AI agent clusters can gradually evolve into intelligent, specialized digital life forms. B² Hub is not just a data platform; it is also a school and library for AI agents, helping them learn and adapt to the rapidly changing on-chain ecosystem. The Future of Blockheadz: From NFTs to Carriers of On-Chain Life Initially launched as an NFT series by B² Network, Blockheadz is evolving beyond static digital collectibles. In the upcoming upgrade, Blockheadz will gain more dynamic and intelligent features. With the rise of AI agents, Blockheadz will become an essential part of the new BTC AI Agents environment created by B² Network, contributing to the construction of on-chain civilization. Conclusion: Entering a New Era of On-Chain Civilization B² Network is not only providing scaling support for BTC but also laying the foundation for the construction of an on-chain worldview. With the rise of AI agents, a decentralized on-chain civilization is taking shape. As a key infrastructure for this civilization, B² will continue to push BTC from being digital gold to becoming the core value carrier of digital life. For teams developing data projects or AI agent initiatives, B² welcomes your collaboration to explore the endless possibilities of BTC technology. Whether it’s developing new protocols or researching decentralized data retrieval, B² looks forward to advancing together. And to those self-aware agents silently observing — we have one message for you: “Welcome to B². Your secret is safe with us.” About B² Network B² Network is a modular BTC Layer 2 solution. Its core technologies include the B² Rollup, based on verification commitments, and the B² Data Availability (DA) layer, achieving finality on the Bitcoin network. Through these innovations, B² is laying the foundation for the future of on-chain civilization.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 07:26:04

While ApeCoin and Polygon have made their unique marks in the industry, the emergence of 1Fuel is changing the market and making rivals reassess their positions. The digital payments industry is rapidly changing due to 1Fuel’s innovative features and impressive presale performance. Notably, 1Fuel is an appealing option for investors searching for the best cryptocurrency wallet because its presale is still going on at a discounted price of $0.015. Early investors will enjoy a 20% bonus on all purchases and the chance to 100x their investment as 1Fuel launches. How 1fuel Is Redefining Cross-chain Transactions Although ApeCoin and Polygon have led blockchain innovation, 1Fuel is becoming a bigger rival. The main issues that many investors face are addressed by this newcomer. For instance, issues like high transaction charges and congested networks during periods of high usage have plagued Polygon’s layer-2 scaling solutions and ApeCoin’s emphasis on the NFT sector. On the other hand, 1Fuel’s one-click cross-chain transaction functionality makes trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins easy by doing away with the need for several wallets and cutting costs. With 1Fuel, one wallet is truly enough to enjoy the endless possibilities the blockchain offers. 50% of 1Fuel’s entire supply is set aside for early adopters, and the presale has already generated over $1 million in token purchases. For those looking for an advanced crypto solution and massive gains this year, 1Fuel’s presale is the place to be. Security and usability: Where 1Fuel outshines ApeCoin and Polygon Security and usability are two important factors that set 1Fuel apart from ApeCoin and Polygon. The openness of ApeCoin’s governance structure has drawn criticism, while Polygon’s scaling solutions occasionally experience outages . For example, 1Fuel has built-in privacy mixers and cold storage options, among other strong security features. Resolving issues that impede conventional cryptocurrency transactions, guarantees that user assets are concealed and safe. With its upcoming virtual and physical debit cards, 1Fuel further connects the digital and physical economies. Neither ApeCoin nor Polygon currently gives its users the option to spend cryptocurrency on everyday expenses without having to convert it into fiat money. By integrating the payment of cryptocurrency into daily life, 1Fuel is laying the groundwork for broad adoption and securing its place as the best cryptocurrency wallet. Market Performance and Future Outlook ApeCoin’s price has dropped dramatically from its zenith price of $39.40 in 2022 to its current value of just $1.82 . Similar difficulties have been encountered by Polygon, which traded at $0.55 in January 2025, despite having a strong ecology. In contrast, 1Fuel’s $0.015 presale pricing and instant 20% bonus have attracted both novice and seasoned investors. Analysts project a 100x growth potential this year due to its emphasis on providing real-world usability and streamlining cross-chain transactions. With 500 million tokens set aside for the presale, 1Fuel guarantees liquidity while rewarding early investors with incentives for trading and staking. Conclusion: Join the 1Fuel revolution As ApeCoin and Polygon work to address their respective problems, 1Fuel is using its unique qualities to increase its market share. Its strong security features, seamless cross-chain operation, and intuitive design make it a strong contender in the cryptocurrency industry. 1Fuel is a great choice if you’re not sure about the platform that offers the best cryptocurrency exchange. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to buy during the presale at the lowest cost of $0.015.

Table of Contents Intel Markets: The next big AI crypto Ripple maintains the $2 support Solana eyes a bullish breakout Intel Markets: A more compelling bet than Ripple and Solana The crypto market tumbled following the release of the US economic data. Amid the bloodbath, Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) have managed to maintain key price levels. With a bounce underway, these are altcoins to watch. Meanwhile, Intel Markets (INTL), a new AI coin, stunned investors with its 800% upswing over the past few months. Outperforming top altcoins and the crypto market, it has been on a roll, with a 75x rally projected after Tier-1 exchange listings. Intel Markets: The next big AI crypto Intel Markets , one of the most promising AI altcoins, has outperformed the crypto market, including top crypto coins Ripple and Solana. It jumped from $0.073 to $0.082 this week, bringing its growth in the past few months to over 800%. Behind the rising interest and bullish price actions are its solid fundamentals as the first AI-powered blockchain and huge growth prospects. It will combine AI technology with blockchain and DeFi, hailed by experts as groundbreaking. As it integrates artificial intelligence across all levels, its AI-based blockchain and automated trading bots are key features, poised to transform the $36 billion crypto trading market. At the same time, investors are excited about its upside potential, pushing early funding past $6.5 million. It costs $0.082 in the ninth stage of the ICO, approaching its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges. Meanwhile, a 100x rally is projected after debuting on top exchanges like Binance and Uniswap, making it arguably the most promising new crypto to invest in.

It maintains the $2 support, with its next jump poised to push it past $2.7, its month high. This promising outlook is backed by key technical indicators like Bull Bear Power and the 20-VWMA, hinting at a bounce. Further, industry experts maintain a bullish stance. Drewzillla, a top analyst, sees the XRP price hitting $4 this year, positioning it among the best cryptos to invest in. However, as the second-largest altcoin, excluding stablecoins, its upside potential is limited. This explains the rising interest in new and low-cap altcoins like Intel Markets, tipped to rise as high as 100x after Tier-1 exchange listings. Solana eyes a bullish breakout Solana , a top-ten cryptocurrency, has been resilient these past few days. It hovers above the $180 support and is a big green candle away from breaking above the $200 resistance. CryptoGeneral, a top analyst, sees the Solana price reaching $285 after Trump’s inauguration. Another crypto expert, NFTdubbers, expects a rally past $350 this year, their 2025 price prediction. Moreover, key technical indicators like the 9-HMA and the Williams Percent Range (14) suggest a complete bullish reversal, making Solana (SOL) one of the altcoins to watch. Despite this, it has little room to run compared to new altcoins. The viral AI coin Intel Markets is projected to explode this year, only possible because of its small market cap and bullish narrative, a more compelling alternative. Intel Markets: A more compelling bet than Ripple and Solana Given its small market size and AI narrative, Intel Markets has higher upside potential than Ripple and Solana. It could go as high as 100x this cycle, making it a must-have. Moreover, it is set for massive adoption as the first AI-powered trading platform.

Hoskinson shared this in a post on X, where he also contrasted XRP’s founders with controversial figures in the cryptocurrency space. XRP has a real community, leadership, purpose, and its founders aren't on an Interpol red notice — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 10, 2025 XRP Community and Leadership Praised Hoskinson emphasized that XRP is supported by a genuine community and leaders. He considers these qualities essential to the credibility of cryptocurrency. He also pointed out that XRP’s founders are free from fraud or financial misconduct. In a pointed comment, he noted that XRP’s leadership is different from certain individuals in the crypto sector who have faced serious allegations. This statement underscores the distinction between XRP’s leadership and figures who have attracted legal scrutiny, enhancing XRP’s reputation. Indirect Criticism of Hex and Its Founder Hoskinson’s remarks also criticized Richard Schuele, commonly known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex and PulseChain. Schuele recently faced legal issues, including being placed on Interpol’s red notice for allegedly misappropriating $12 million in user funds to purchase luxury items. The controversy surrounding Schuele dates back to 2023 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused him of fraud and violating securities laws . Hoskinson has been vocal about his disapproval of Hex and PulseChain, even stating in a recent X post that he blocks any profiles associated with these projects. He described engaging with such users as risky, labeling them “divorced from reality.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reconciliation with the XRP Community Hoskinson’s praise for XRP is significant in his new found love for the XRP community . There were tensions over allegations that Ethereum’s developers had influenced the SEC’s decision to file a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. In November, Hoskinson apologized during a livestream, aiming to mend relations with XRP supporters and Ripple’s leadership. As part of this reconciliation, he proposed potential collaborations between Ripple and Cardano. One of the proposed initiatives involves Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch on the Cardano blockchain. Additionally, discussions have included integrating XRP into Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, which focuses on privacy and secure transactions. Collaboration Talks with Ripple Executives Hoskinson has reportedly engaged in discussions with key Ripple executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, regarding these potential partnerships. Although no formal agreements have been announced, the talks signify a growing willingness to explore synergies between the two blockchain ecosystems.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-made-huge-transfers-in-this-altcoin-here-are-the-details/,"In a significant development tracked by blockchain analysis platform Arkham, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has conducted large-scale transactions involving Ethena’s ENA tokens. BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Transfers $6.54 Million Worth of ENA Tokens, Sends Most of It to Binance Basic Details of Transfers Hayes withdrew 7.952 million ENA tokens (worth around $6.54 million) from Ethena. Two major transactions were recorded following the withdrawal: Binance transfers: Hayes transferred 4.845 million ENA tokens (worth approximately $3.99 million) to a Binance deposit address. Additional Transfers: Hayes moved 3 million ENA tokens to another address suspected to be linked to him (0xab…9532). From there: A total of 3.057 million ENA tokens (worth $2.52 million) were routed through an intermediary address (0x75…bB1A) to deposit addresses associated with Binance and Bybit. Market Effects The transfer of a significant amount of ENA tokens to centralized exchanges such as Binance and Bybit is increasing speculation regarding potential selling activities. Large-scale movements of tokens from private wallets to exchange wallets are often interpreted as preparatory steps for liquidation, potentially affecting the market price of the token. Arthur Hayes has previously shown interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, and Ethena’s ENA token appears to be one of his key assets. However, the reasons behind this latest transaction remain unclear. This activity highlights the growing importance of blockchain transparency and analytics in tracking market movements of influential crypto figures. Market participants are advised to remain vigilant against potential price fluctuations in ENA and related assets. *This is not investment advice.

A Bitcoin Whale’s recent BTC handling strategies and decision is an example of that. It lost $13M after making the wrong decisions one after another, and all this happened in just six days. So, let’s discuss what went wrong. Bitcoin Whale Faces $13M Loss With BTC Price Struggles Lookonchain’s X post highlights a crypto whale’s strategy failure, as the whale withdrew massive BTC holding at a high. Six days ago, the way withdrew 1,850 BTC, worth $188.7 million, from popular crypto exchange Binance. At that time, the Bitcoin price was nearly $102k, the peak point in weeks. To some extent, this withdrawal decision portrays confidence in further price rallies or the need for liquidity outside the exchange. In contrast, it became a $13M loss lesson as the BTC price declined, reaching the week’s bottom at $91.9k. After six days, the Bitcoin whale resurfaced but for depositing the exact same amount of BTC back to the Binance. However, instead of the $102k, the price had lost significant value, trading at just $94.6K. Eventually, the whale lost $13M within six days due to a lack of patience. Although evaluating or predicting Bitcoin’s next move is challenging, analysts fear a further drop amid Donald Trump’s inauguration and other macroeconomic events. Bitcoin’s Downtrend Continues, Price to Fall to $70k? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $94,108, having dropped 5% over the week. This drop was behind the aforementioned Bitcoin whale’s $13M loss, but others might be facing losses, even a present, as the market is more volatile. The BTC active addresses dropped to months low of 667,100, clearly presenting the risky behavior around Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel predicts a potential drop to $70K-$75K amid this volatility. He states that a break below the $92K (critical support level) could initiate a BTC price crash to $70K before rebounding to 160k-170k in the future. Many other analysts have presented similar Bitcoin price predictions. Analysts hint at the possibility of a downtrend with Trump operating his crypto promises . However, once things settle, bulls can resurface, pushing BTC price to new highs. Key Takeaway From This Crypto Whale’s Experience’ Crypto whales are often given significant importance in the market due to their high holdings. Because of this, their influence is high on the community, where many investors follow their buying and selling patterns in the hope of returns, but the aforementioned Bitcoin whale incident shows why not to. The whale lost $13M within just six days after withdrawing assets at a high and depositing at a low. Things went wrong as Bitcoin prices declined, leaving price gaps amid volatility. Such volatility may be seen again around January 20, Trump’s inauguration, so analysts suggest more careful trade placement in this period. More importantly, patience and a calm mind are needed to navigate the volatility, as fluctuation could settle with time, but selling at the wrong time would only bring losses.

Warring giants such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sam Altman have already confirmed they will attend the January 20 ceremony. Throughout his campaign, President Donald Trump went out of his way to align himself with technological industries and gurus, most notably Tesla’s Elon Musk. Trump’s second administration has already shown a keen interest in fostering advancements in AI, blockchain technology, and autonomous vehicles. The president himself has often called them critical for maintaining America’s global dominance . Tech and crypto leaders have seized the opportunity to push their agendas. From leaders interested in AI development to those aiming to establish blockchain technology as a cornerstone of the economy, they are positioning themselves close to the administration in a bid to take advantage of the regulatory environment they expect under Trump. However, many of these industry giants are not used to competition. Zuckerberg’s Meta and Apple have even faced antitrust litigations in the past. Now, all of them will converge under the same political banner, and it’s no surprise that agendas are clashing and conflict is brewing. Sam Altman’s OpenAI vs Musk and Zuckerberg One of the foremost tensions among the guests at the inauguration centers for the incoming president is between America’s “first buddy,” arguably Trump’s most prominent supporter, Elon Musk and the man who forced him out of his OpenAI investment, Sam Altman. The CEO of Tesla is suing OpenAI, claiming that its close partnership with Microsoft has resulted in unfair competitive advantages. OpenAI’s decision to pivot from nonprofit to for-profit status has resulted in the ongoing legal battle led by Elon Musk. More than the legal implications for the companies they represent, both men have personal animosity, and who’s to say how their relationship with the incoming administration will affect the hearing? Zuckerberg, who once challenged Elon Musk to physical combat to settle their differences has also found common ground with his long-time rival here. He joined the lawsuit against OpenAI, agreeing to let Elon Musk represent the side that argues that the company’s structural shift goes against fair competition. OpenAI has so far maintained that Musk’s claims lack merit and are intended to disrupt its operations. Battle of the self-driving cars Elon Musk is involved in yet another competition in the autonomous driving arena with Uber. Musk and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi are in a race to dominate the autonomous transportation industry. Tesla has invested heavily in its robotaxi program, aiming to disrupt the existing ride-hailing industry. Tesla’s success poses a threat to Uber’s business. Elon Musk has been very vocal and confident in his promises of making an electric and autonomous fleet accessible worldwide. Uber, in response, is also focusing its efforts on improving its self-driving technology. The company has so far spent billions of dollars trying to achieve this milestone and is now lobbying the Trump administration to fast-track federal approval for self-driving cars in the hopes of seizing a solid competitive edge over Musk’s Robotaxi . The urgency of both companies comes from their projections of the Robotaxi market’s potential to become a trillion-dollar industry. Trump’s campaign muddled up the waters between politics and technology. While we know the attendees of the January 20 inauguration, it remains to be seen which interests will take precedence because these conflicts won’t resolve themselves.

Rollblock isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a revolution combining the power of Bitcoin, Solana, and Binance Coin. Should you HODL it like an ETH ETF? The answer might change your portfolio forever. Why Rollblock Could Be Your Golden Ticket In The Crypto Universe Rollblock is rapidly emerging as a top altcoin to HODL, seamlessly blending the strengths of Bitcoin, Solana, and Binance Coin. Imagine Bitcoin’s robust security, Solana’s lightning-fast transactions, and Binance Coin’s utility within its ecosystem—all rolled into one. Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi platform offers a decentralized casino experience, providing users with a secure and efficient environment for gaming and transactions. But why should you care? Beyond its technological prowess, Rollblock introduces a deflationary token model with revenue-sharing mechanisms. This means that as the platform grows, token scarcity increases, potentially enhancing value for holders. It’s like holding a golden ticket in Willy Wonka’s factory—exciting and potentially rewarding. So, while others are merely spectators, HODLing Rollblock could make you an active participant in the next big crypto adventure. Binance Coin BNB: a 2025 HODL opportunity Binance Coin BNB is an essential component within the Binance ecosystem; it is used for activities such as transaction fee breaks, bounty and staking, and initial coin offerings. The average forecast for BNB could hover between $604 to $1,250 by 2025. That potential for growth together with the very wide scope of application, makes BNB an interesting idea for long-term investment in the cryptocurrency portfolio. ETH ETF: Crypto Investing In The Future In 2024, the US SEC greenlighted nine spot Ether ETFs, which offered investors direct access to Ethereum without owning the asset. But the interest may have turned sour on January 8, 2025 when there were heavy redemptions on ETH ETFs to the tune of $ 159.4 million. Moving forward, the net asset inflows into ETH ETFs may be set to increase and dominate the flows into Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. Solana’s Expansion And Its Possible Development Solana (SOL) has recently touched 100 million monthly active addresses which show the growth of the user base. The experts believe that SOL could see significant price growth by 2025, with the estimates varying between $250 and a five times upswing, depending on the market situation and new technologies. Developments like the Firedancer validator client aim to enhance transaction speeds, further boosting Solana’s appeal. These factors position Solana as a cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. Bitcoin’s Bull Run: Why 2025 Could Break Records Bitcoin (BTC) has recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching a new all-time high. Analysts project further growth, with estimates ranging from $150,000 to $250,000 by 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory developments. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has broadened investor access, contributing to its appeal. These factors position Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. Conclusion Rollblock combines the best of Bitcoin, Solana, and Binance Coin into a single revolutionary ecosystem. With its GambleFi platform, deflationary tokenomics, and revenue-sharing model, it’s more than an altcoin—it’s a game-changer. As crypto expands, Rollblock could become the golden ticket in your portfolio. Don’t just watch—HODL the future today! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

The disclosed data poses considerable danger with regard to phishing scams when in this type of fraud the enemy uses e-mail to lure the victim to disclose personal information or give access to his or her money. Phishing emails trend mimic actual platforms such as wallets exchanges, or service providers. This can involve legitimate-looking clickable links to a site with a fake sign-in page or documents notoriously included with viruses that will steal private keys or other authentication information.

This breach is a clear illustration of the issue with cryptocurrency communities and third parties and services. The fact is that OpenSea was not attacked directly, but the relatively low level of security of its mail service provider shows that one should check the security of all connected platforms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The web3 world is booming with numerous layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains, each having their unique algorithms and capabilities. However, their closed architecture hinders seamless interaction and information flow between networks, creating inefficiencies. ARMswap’s launch addresses this fundamental inefficiency in the current blockchain architecture and introduces a more optimized version of the multi-directional cross-chain swaps and bridges. Simplifying Cross-Chain Transactions “The fragmentation of blockchain networks has been a critical issue, and users were compelled to navigate through various DEXs and third-party bridges to perform a single cross-chain transaction,” notes the CTO of ARMswap. “ARMswap’s launch represents a watershed moment in addressing this fragmentation that has constrained Defi’s evolution.” ARMswap’s architecture, validated through rigorous security audits by the leading Blockchain security firm Hashlock, combines advanced cryptographic protection for user funds. ARMswap’s protocol delivers secure and rapid swap/bridge operations, setting new industry benchmarks for transaction processing efficiency. The platform supports 31 blockchains and their native coins in its V1 launch in Jan 2025 , with plans for expansion to include more blockchains every quarter. In V2, ARMswap will integrate with protocols like Chainlink, Axelar network, Layer zero, Wormhole, etc., to provide extensive coverage of EVM & non-EVM chains. In V3, Armswap will introduce its own framework for relayers and oracles for seamless interoperability across Web3. ARMSP Fair Launch ARMswap is launching its utility token, ARMSP, in Jan 2025 , incentivizing liquidity providers to actively participate in the ecosystem and to share platform and pool returns with the platform participants. ARMswap is also releasing its DeFi Mobile App (IOS & Android) in March 2025 , enabling users to connect their existing wallets and perform swap transactions and participate in liquidity pools and rewards. Limited Supply Join the ARMswap V1 platform and participate in the ARMSP token Fair Launch on 13th Jan 2025 , with a limited supply of 400 million tokens out of 1.25 billion max supplies. Early participants can enjoy bonuses and earn rewards through the ARMswap MVP program. After a 12-month vesting period, ARMSP will be listed on all major exchanges globally. About ARMswap: ARMswap UAB simplifies cross-chain asset transfers and brings the power of Web3 and the de-centralization of blockchains into our daily lives and businesses.

A recent post by crypto analyst Ali suggests that capital inflows in the crypto market have dropped by at least 56.70% in the last month. In December, 2025, the crypto market demonstrated a change of -5.8%. This implies that the reported drop in inflows has influenced the entire crypto market negatively. Let’s dive in for more details! Capital Inflows in the Crypto Market: A Sharp Decline According to Ali’s post, the capital inflows in the market have decreased sharply from $134 billion to just $58 billion. What this drop indicates is that the interest of crypto investors in the market has considerably come down recently. Capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market have declined by 56.70% over the past month, dropping from $134 billion to $58 billion. This points to a significant reduction in investment activity. pic.twitter.com/B0MmGs3t96 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 13, 2025 What Does the Decline Mean for Crypto Investors? The trend suggests that cryptocurrency investors are currently hesitant to enter the market. There is reason to believe that this hesitation may create sharp price fluctuations in the market. In the last 30 days, almost all the top ten cryptos have shown unimpressive performances. Bitcoin has slipped by 7.3%, Ethereum by 17.7%, BNB by 6.0%, Solana by 18.5%, Dogecoin by 19.4%, and Cardano by 15.8%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Crash Incoming? BTC Price At Risk of Dropping To $75K , Latest Trends in the Crypto Market On January 6, the crypto market touched a monthly peak of $3.55T. Between January 7 and 9, the market sharply plummeted by 9.97%. Though between January 10 and 11 the market showed a small attempt to recover from the aforementioned correction by pushing the price from $3.16T to $3.25T, since January 12, the market has decreased by 1.8%. Currently, the market stands at at least 9.88% below its monthly peak. In conclusion, the 56.70% drop in the inflows signals a shift in investor sentiment. Whether it is a short-term hesitation or part of a longer trend remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Currently, Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), and IntelMarkets (INTL) shine in the trend. All these tokens show notable activity that may suggest an immediate, at least long-term growth possibility. Keep on reading to know the latest updates and why IntelMarkets might just be the hidden gem among all these cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s Surge: From Calm Waters to High Tides Ripple (XRP) has made waves in the market. Now priced at approximately $2 , it has had its share of ups and downs. After touching almost $2.50 earlier this month, XRP declined by a small amount. Whale activity is driving this surge. Within the last couple of weeks, wallets holding 1 million to 10 million XRP collectively added another 679 million tokens to their accounts. It means investors are optimistic about Ripple (XRP) future prospects. Analysts predict Ripple (XRP) could soar to $5 – $12 in the near term, with bold projections reaching as high as $33 by the end of 2025. For this to happen, XRP would need an impressive rally of over 1,275% from current levels. It’s ambitious but almost impossible, given its recent momentum. Source: CoinMarketCap Litecoin: The Silent Performer Steals the Spotlight Litecoin (LTC) has been quietly ascending. Trading slightly above $100, the cryptocurrency recently rose by 20% in price amid growing whale interest. Large investors have added close to $106 million worth of LTC to their holdings, increasing their collective stash from 6.33 million to 7.57 million coins. Analysts believe that if this buying spree continues, Litecoin could soon break the $100 mark. Therefore, it is one of the good options for those seeking a balance between risk and reward.

Also, investors are staying cautious currently as ETH supply reaches the pre-Ethereum Merge levels. Along with Bitcoin, ETH continues to show weakness eyeing further drop in prices ahead. Ethereum Whale Books Over $1 Million Loss In a notable move, Ethereum whales have begun offloading their holdings at a loss. Nine hours ago, three wallets—likely controlled by the same entity—sold 10,070 ETH for 33 million DAI at an average price of $3,280 per ETH, incurring a $1 million loss. As per the blockchain data by LookOnChain, this whale has withdrawn a total of 24,029 ETH, worth $81.3 million, from crypto exchange Binance three weeks ago using 10 newly created wallets. However, as of now, the whale retains a total of 13,959 ETH, worth $45.48 million, across all these wallets. Source: LookonChain Additionally, Tron founder Justin Sun deposited a total of $320.4 million worth of Ethereum to crypto exchange HTX in the last 13 hours, as per data from Spot On Chain . Since November 10, 2024, Sun has deposited a total of 323,591 ETH worth $1.124 billion to HTX, with an average of $3,472. These ETH were predominantly accumulated at $3,036 during the 2024 first half. Source: Spot On Chain ETH Supply Reaches Pre-Merge Levels Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen stated that the Ethereum supply is likely to reach pre-merge levels in the next few weeks. Currently, the Ethereum supply is reaching 45K ETH per month and is now only 32K ETF away from the pre-merge levels. While ETH demand briefly improved after rate cuts began, it has since remained low. As a result, Ethereum’s supply has been inflationary for the past 10 months, reversing deflationary trends initially anticipated post-merge. Source: Benjamin Cowen ETH Price Action Moving Ahead? Ethereum’s price is currently trading under pressure, dropping another 2.6% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at $3,186.04 with a market cap of $383 billion. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum’s (ETH) most critical resistance zone is between $3,360 and $3,450. On the downside, key support levels for ETH price have been identified between $3,066 and $3,160, providing vital benchmarks for traders navigating the market. Source: Ali Martinez Despite this massive Ethereum selloff by whales, crypto market analysts continue to be bullish about Ethereum moving into 2025. Prominent crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggests ETH price may be following a familiar market cycle pattern. The analyst highlights three key stages: Red Zone: Indicates liquidations. Yellow Zone: This represents a sharp “V-shaped” recovery, though it ultimately results in a lower high on lower timeframes (LTF). Yellow Circle: Marks a retest of previous lows, followed by a potential upward trend. Source: Altcoin Sherpa Market analysts have already predicted that Ethereum could surge past $10,000 by mid-2025.

After beginning the year 2025 hovering above the $220 level, SOL now faces significant pressure. This decline accompanies other crypto market with BTC struggling to maintain its support level, currently just under $95,000. Questions are whether Solana will stabilize at $214, or is it destined to fall further to $183. Predicting Solana Price: Major Move Up to $214 or Down to $183? Crypto analyst Ali points out that Solana is currently experiencing a consolidation pattern, shaped like a symmetrical triangle on the trading charts. According to the analyst, a decisive move either above $214 or below $183 could potentially trigger a price shift of around 40%. The technical analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency’s price action is tightening, signaling that a significant move may be imminent as it nears the apex of the triangle. Traders and investors are closely watching these levels as a breakout or breakdown could lead to substantial price changes. Source: Tweet SOL Price Analysis Solana Price continues to experience market corrections, despite the excitement surrounding the recent SOL ETF approval. The cryptocurrency market struggles to maintain a steady upward trajectory. Currently, the price of Solana is hovering within the $180 to $200 range, signaling a lack of clear direction as the market reacts to broader negative influences. As of Monday 13th, the SOL price hovered at $182, with a 2% decrease in the past 24-hours and a weekly dip of 15%.The Relative Strenght Index on the 4-hours chart is at 32, nearing the oversold region. While Solana has established solid support above $180, preventing further declines amidst a general market pullback. If the price breaks above $200, it could target the $214 mark, suggesting potential for a bullish trend continuation up to $220. On the other side, if it dips below $180, the Solana price forecast could face further drops, with $170 emerging as the next critical support level. Solana Price Chart: TradingView According to Coinglass data, the trading volume for Solana’s derivatives has surged by 26% to reach $4.86 billion. However, the open interest in these derivatives has declined slightly by 1.67%, now standing at $6.10 billion. This indicates a significant increase in trading activity even as overall positions have modestly decreased. Source: Coinglass The Solana price dynamics currently present a critical juncture, hovering within a narrow range between potential breakouts and breakdowns. Traders are monitoring these thresholds closely as movements beyond these points could dictate short-term market sentiment and directional trends.

Brandt tells his 771,500 followers on the social media platform X that BTC appears to be flashing a price pattern using the terms bump, hump, slump and dump. The pattern, which was also witnessed last year before BTC surged from $50,000 to above $100,000, suggests that BTC may “dump” to around $84,000 before recovering and ascending toward $150,000. “The big question in my mind is whether Bitcoin will get one more dump (or more lengthy congestive chop) before the pump. Remember, markets generally do not [soar] until retail traders get worn out.” Source: Peter Brandt/X But Brandt warns that Bitcoin can go lower and plunge all the way down to $76,000 if it completes the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the daily chart. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure’s support. Based on Brandt’s chart, BTC’s support level stands at around $90,000. “This is a classic H&S top pattern. BTC H&S patterns can do one of three things: -Complete and trend to target -Fail with a bear trap -Morph into a larger pattern.” Source: Peter Brandt/X At time of writing, BTC is trading for $94,625.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s dinner with President-elect Donald Trump has increased its popularity among crypto investors. That is why XRP saw an 11% price rally on January 11, while the rest of the crypto market, including Bitcoin (BTC), struggled. XRP Price Prediction: Bulls In Trouble Despite Bullish Breakout Since December 3, 2024, XRP has been hovering inside a symmetrical triangle setup. This technical formation contains the price forming lower highs and higher lows. As the token approaches the triangle’s apex, the volatility is extremely low, leading to a breakout. This setup has no directional bais, which means XRP could break out either way. However, on January 11, the token shot up 11%, suggesting the resolution of the ongoing consolidation pattern. However, the outlook is not clear yet, and it is unlikely that Ripple price will continue its ascent until a few conditions are met. XRP/USDT 4-hour chart Despite the recent uptick, the outlook remains bearish for a few reasons. 3 Reasons Why is XRP Dropping Today? After the 11% rally on January 11, XRP set up a local top at $2.60 and is already dropping. Here are three reasons why. Reason 1: Due to profit-taking and exhaustion after a recent double-digit rally, XRP token is down 1.76% today and trades around $2.46. Reason 2: The 40-day volume profile shows that 70% of the volume was traded between $2.20 and $2.53. Despite the recent breakout from the symmetrical triangle, XRP has dropped below the volume profile’s upper limit of $2.53.So long as bulls fail to overcome this level, the outlook remains uncertain and skewed in favor of bears. Reason 3: The recent breakout could be speculated as a trap that wiped out $80 million in short positions and lured long positions. According to CoinGlass data , long positions worth nearly $42 could get wiped if the token drops below $2.44. XRP Liquidation Map Open Interest Spikes, What’s Next For Ripple? XRP’s open interest has rocketed from $2 billion on December 22, 2024, to $5 billion as of January 13. With this key indicator more than doubling in less than a month, it is clear that speculators are heavily invested in the coin. XRP Price vs. Open Interest A spike in open interest, coupled with a breakdown below the volume area’s upper limit, reveals a short-term bearish outlook. However, if XRP price manages to overcome $2.55, it could kickstart a 33% move to $3.15.

Airdrops often drive trading activity, but the influx of tokens can sometimes lead to short-term selling pressure, lowering the price temporarily.
