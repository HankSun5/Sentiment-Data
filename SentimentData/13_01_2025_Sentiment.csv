Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:04:00

The response came after a user claimed that Litecoin's emergence and Charlie Lee's actions represented an early example of a pump-and-dump scheme. The user compared the project negatively to Solana, claiming that Charlie Lee founded Litecoin, set aside a significant amount of supply for himself, and sold it at the height of the 2017 bull run. The comment accused the Litecoin founder of using the project for personal gain and argued that Solana deserves more respect for his contributions to the crypto space. In response, the Litecoin team issued a detailed refutation, defending the project’s transparency, decentralization, and longevity since its inception in 2011. The team noted that Charlie Lee publicly announced Litecoin ahead of its launch, allowing the community to determine the launch date. Unlike many modern projects, Litecoin had no pre-mined supply, no initial coin offering (ICO), and no venture capital funding. Charlie Lee, like other participants, mined and purchased Litecoin and did not maintain a “founders stash.” He later sold his holdings in 2017 to avoid a conflict of interest while continuing to develop and defend the project. Contrary to claims, the team noted that Lee sold his Litecoin at an average price of $205, below the peak of the 2017 bull market. Related News: Famous ETF Expert Made 10 Predictions for the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 - “XRP, Solana...” The response detailed Charlie Lee’s ongoing financial and technical support for Litecoin: He has invested millions in Litecoin through the Litecoin Foundation and partnerships. He has supported marketing campaigns including collaborations with the Miami Dolphins, UFC and others. It holds its annual Litecoin Summit, costing $250,000 and up per event. He actively contributed to Litecoin's core code and encouraged its adoption among businesses and regulators. The team rejected comparisons to Solana and other projects, stating that Litecoin remains unique in its decentralization, lack of founder-controlled reserves, and lack of venture capital influence. They noted that Litecoin has consistently ranked in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap for over 13 years, despite market volatility and the collapse of thousands of other projects. In their closing remarks, the team questioned Solana’s main use cases and claimed that its ecosystem is frequently used to create tokens that are involved in scams and fraud. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s administration is promising to turn it into a cornerstone of US economic strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the same company holding over half a million Bitcoins valued at $52.81 billion through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has its own battles to fight — with regulators breathing down its neck. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) isn’t cutting BlackRock any slack. And Trump’s big Bitcoin plans? Let’s just say they don’t make things any easier for Mr. Larry Fink. But hey, at least BlackRock’s a Bitcoin whale now. BlackRock vs. FDIC Here’s what is going down with the FDIC. BlackRock was supposed to meet a January 10 deadline to address concerns about its influence on US banks. However, It didn’t. Instead, it asked for more time—until March 31—to review a proposed agreement, claiming it needed at least two more months. The FDIC wasn’t buying it. The agency not only rejected the extension but also added more demands. They want more transparency about how BlackRock makes decisions and details about its bank-related holdings. If BlackRock doesn’t act fast, things could get worse, and fast too. Sources familiar with the matter say the FDIC might issue subpoenas or take other mandatory actions to force the firm’s compliance. This isn’t a minor dispute. BlackRock’s sheer size, combined with its massive stakes in banks, has some regulators worried it could have too much control over the financial system. Jonathan McKernan, a Republican FDIC board member, and Rohit Chopra, the Democratic head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have both called for tighter oversight of big asset managers. Their main argument is that BlackRock could sway how banks operate, making them less independent. BlackRock’s defense has so far been calling the FDIC’s demands disruptive, arguing that new rules could wreck index funds—one of its flagship offerings—and make it harder for banks to raise cash. The company also says the FDIC needs to coordinate its efforts with the Federal Reserve, which already oversees its operations through a passivity agreement. Trump’s Bitcoin play Trump, along with Bitcoin-friendly figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis, is pushing for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Here’s the plan: Senator Lummis has introduced a bill proposing the US Treasury and Federal Reserve acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years. That’s 200,000 Bitcoins a year, adding up to about 5% of the total global supply. The goal? To reduce America’s reliance on traditional financial systems and keep up with rivals like China and Russia. Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the Satoshi Act Fund, spilled the details. The reserve would partly come from Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, giving the government a head start. Trump’s team believes this reserve could help stabilize the dollar while tackling the US’s enormous $36 trillion national debt. BlackRock, despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, isn’t on the same page. The firm has been making headlines for other reasons, like its withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). BlackRock pulled out of NZAMI on January 11, under pressure from Republican-led states that weren’t happy with its climate-focused investments. The company insists it will continue to consider climate risks in its investment strategies, but the decision shows how political tensions are forcing it to adapt.

On January 11, Mango Markets shared on its X account: “We are shutting down. It’s time for users to close their positions.” The decision follows governance proposals that unanimously supported adjustments to interest rates and collateral requirements, effectively terminating borrowing and lending services. These changes will take effect on January 13. SEC Settlement The shutdown comes after a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On September 27, 2024, the SEC filed charges against Mango DAO and the Blockworks Foundation for selling unregistered securities. According to the SEC, Mango raised over $70 million in August 2021 by selling MNGO governance tokens in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also accused Mango Labs of operating as an unregistered broker, breaching the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of the settlement, Mango DAO agreed to pay $700,000 in penalties, destroy its MNGO tokens, and request the delisting of these tokens from exchanges. “Since the inception of our crypto enforcement program, our view has been that the label ‘DAO’ does not change the reality of who is behind a project,” said Jorge Tenreiro, chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. Legal and Financial Struggles Mango Markets’ difficulties date back to an October 2022 exploit by crypto trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who drained over $100 million from the platform. Although Eisenberg returned $67 million as part of a governance vote, he kept $40 million. US authorities arrested Eisenberg in December 2022, charging him with fraud and market manipulation. He faces up to 20 years in prison, with his sentencing delayed multiple times due to legal complexities. Mango Markets was launched in August 2021, offering fast and affordable trading and lending services using its MNGO governance token. At the time of writing, the platform holds $9 million in total value locked, a sharp decline from its $210 million peak in November 2021, according to DefiLlama.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:24:01

Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-350000-top-crypto-influencer-makes-bold-prediction/,"Jeremie Davinci, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency domain, has garnered attention with his audacious forecast that Bitcoin may attain an extraordinary value of $350,000. This forecast, lately disseminated on social media, is predicated on historical trends and the present dynamics of Bitcoin mining expenses. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path The current expense for miners to generate one Bitcoin is approximately $70,000. Davinci indicates that historically, under positive market conditions, Bitcoin has frequently surpassed its mining cost by a ratio of five. This association indicates that, if historical trends persist, a price of $350,000 is feasible. The Cost Factor Of Mining The basis of Davinci’s approach is the relationship between mining costs and market price of Bitcoin. The mining process requires electricity and advanced technology among other resources. These costs build the basis for Bitcoin’s value as they rise. Currently spending over $70,000 to extract one BTC, miners may open the path for significant price increases in the future, claims Davinci. It costs miners about $70k to produce 1 #Bitcoin now, less with better hardware or cheap energy. In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has hit over 5x the mining cost. Huge potential ahead! — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 11, 2025 He underscores that this forecast lacks a defined timescale and instead embodies an optimistic perspective grounded in historical performance. He asserted, “Significant potential lies ahead!” in reference to Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bitcoin: Institutional Impact And Market Forces Davinci’s prognosis is set against a landscape of growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Prominent corporations have commenced the acquisition of substantial quantities of BTC, indicating assurance in its long-term growth prospects. Companies such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have made substantial investments in Bitcoin, contributing to the optimistic feeling around the cryptocurrency. In addition, the recent halving event in April 2024 cut the block payment for miners to 3.125 BTC. This made it harder for new coins to enter the market. Around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 2 million to be made. This could cause prices to rise as long as people want them. A Prudent Optimism Although Davinci’s projection is undeniably ambitious, it is crucial to regard such forecasts with prudence. The bitcoin market is famously unstable and can undergo significant fluctuations in value. Analysts have observed that although Bitcoin may realize considerable increases over time, it has also had huge corrections in previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead As we approach 2025 and beyond, numerous investors are closely observing how these dynamics will develop. The interplay between mining expenses, institutional acceptance, and market mood will be a major determining factor in ascertaining the feasibility of Davinci’s prediction. Bold predictions like Jeremie Davinci’s are being debated as the crypto market continues to evolve. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $350,000 reflects both reliance on historical trends and a sense of optimism.

From being a fun and quirky joke coin, Dogecoin quickly rose to fame, attracting an army of passionate holders and garnering massive attention from celebrities and influencers alike. The ICO was priced so low that it was a goldmine for early investors, with some even making millions from what was once just a silly meme coin. With Dogecoin currently holding a place as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in the world, its price has seen explosive growth over the years, and its future seems to be filled with even more promise. But for those who regret not getting in at the right time, there’s still hope. Enter BTFD Coin—a new player in the meme coin world that’s making waves with its exciting presale numbers and its standout feature: a jaw-dropping 90% APY on staking ! The Missed Opportunity: Dogecoin’s ICO and Rise to Fame Let’s talk numbers. When Dogecoin first hit the market in 2013, its initial price was virtually pennies—$0.0002047 per coin. Early investors, especially those who believed in the coin’s fun-loving culture, watched their investments grow exponentially as Dogecoin became more mainstream. In fact, as of 2025, Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70 per coin. That’s a massive jump for a coin that started as a joke. With over $49 billion in market cap, Dogecoin’s growth has solidified its place in meme coin history. And while Dogecoin’s story is one for the books, many missed out on that golden opportunity. Investors who saw its potential too late are left with nothing but “what ifs” and “could’ve, should’ve, would’ve” thoughts. But don’t sweat it!

At the same time, Foresight Ventures’ X account was hacked, linked to $500,000 raised through 15 compromised accounts, showing rising security risks. Crypto hacks happen, but the market bounces back There has been so much hacking from the Mt. Gox hack in 2014 up to hacks on Litecoin and Foresight Ventures’ X accounts in 2025. Each hack is similar; it starts with chaos, breaking trust, and lowering the market prices. Time heals most wounds as prices tend to bounce back usually stronger than before. Litecoin’s official X account was hacked on January 11, 2025. An attacker released a fake token based on the Solana network, named using the ticker LTC, via the said account. Litecoin's X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published. These were live only for a matter of seconds before being deleted. We're still investigating the issue, but immediately found a delegated account that was compromised and removed… — Litecoin (@litecoin) January 11, 2025 A post including a Solana contract address and a scam link briefly propelled the fake token’s market cap to $27,000. The value of the token, however, cratered to $3,400 after a scam alert was published. The Litecoin team regained control, deleted the post, and removed the hacked delegated account. They assured users that investigations are currently being done on the issue. At the same time, hackers accessed Foresight Ventures’ X account. It was used for promoting fraudulent activity with cryptocurrencies tied to AI. Such a hack was alarming, as Foresight Ventures has close ties to blockchain and AI projects. Yet, the team acted fast: it issued warnings and solved the problem. At the end of December 2024, hackers broke into the Cardano Foundation’s X account. They falsely claimed a lawsuit with the SEC and sold a scam token called “ADAsol.” It has been reported that one hacker managed to raise $500,000 by exploiting more than 15 hacked X accounts for meme coin scams during late 2024 and early 2025. These hacks are often phishing emails masquerading as legitimate messages, tricking victims into sharing their credentials. Hacks have been a bane in the crypto industry for years. In 2014, the Mt. Gox hack resulted in over $450 million worth of Bitcoin being stolen, causing the collapse of what was then the largest exchange. The Bitfinex hack in 2016 led to the loss of 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time. In 2018, $530 million in NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck. Such occurrences demonstrate the impact hacks can have on the crypto market. In the case of 2020, hackers hijacked the Twitter accounts of influential people such as Elon Musk and Joe Biden, displaying them with fake Bitcoin giveaways. Although the financial loss was not too massive, it highlighted the need to protect influential accounts. In 2022, the hack of the Ronin Network targeting Axie Infinity stole $625 million and marked one of the biggest crypto robberies ever; it was said to question a centralized blockchain gaming ecosystem. The WazirX hack in 2024 joined the list of concerns regarding centralized exchanges. From hacks to altseason Most hacks lead to short-term market drops due to users panicking and withdrawing funds. These, however, happen at the worst time when the crypto market prepares for an altseason in which altcoins tend to do way better than Bitcoin. This might, therefore, be an opportunity for the market to get over such shocks and enjoy substantial growth. The attacks that Litecoin and Foresight Ventures experienced may be minor in comparison but show a possibility of going wrong in the crypto space. However, growth in the market may still be true, especially around the time of altseason and with bettering security in security. There is a bright long-term future for the crypto market. Whether hacks would be in the way of problems or growth will depend on whether these incidents can be studied and leveraged to improve security.

SUI ATH & ETC Poised for Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/get-6-on-every-purchase-with-blockdags-affiliate-program-sui-ath-etc-poised-for-growth/,"As we step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is teeming with potential. Key highlights include the anticipated rise in Ethereum Classic (ETC) price to $49.07 and SUI nearing a peak at $5.35, coupled with robust investor interest. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a notable layer-1 blockchain entity, rolls out its referral program, offering up to 10% in USDT rewards, significantly fueling the demand for its tokens. Here’s an analysis of these pivotal market elements to gauge the top crypto gem for 2025. Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Targeting $49 in 2025! Forecasting a significant upturn, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is predicted to escalate to a peak of $49.07 by 2025. Investors need a thorough technical analysis to navigate this potential. Currently, ETC is trading at $25.28, with market reactions mixed and a transaction volume of $326.06 million in the last 24 hours. Analysis of the weekly trends shows a bullish reversal, hinting at lucrative opportunities ahead. The coin might retest its highest resistance at $167, potentially triggering a bullish trend. Predictions suggest ETC’s price could oscillate between $22.38 and $49.07, averaging around $44.74. Will SUI Achieve a New ATH as TVL Soars? The SUI token recently marked a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.35, propelled by an upsurge across the market. Despite a significant rally of 10.39% and reaching new highs, SUI has since corrected to $4.59. Closing 2024 with a robust increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) from $1.75 billion to more than $2.6 billion in early 2025, SUI continues to draw attention. Initiatives like DeepBook V3 and Sui Bridge, along with institutional backing, have spurred this growth. The continued DeFi boom and SUI’s ATH underscore its strong market stance. BlockDAG’s Innovative Affiliate Program: Turn $30 into Significant Gains! BlockDAG’s latest initiative offers a compelling referral program that rewards users with up to 10% cashback in USDT for purchases made through shared referral links.

This program is designed for broad participation, with a minimal purchase requirement of $30, allowing widespread entry and benefit from the BlockDAG ecosystem. Its simplicity and attractive rewards make this program a key growth driver for BlockDAG, positioning it as a top contender for 2025’s best cryptocurrency. As of January 2025, BlockDAG’s presale has amassed over $180 million, selling more than 17.8 billion coins at $0.0248 each in its 27th batch, marking a substantial 2380% ROI since the first batch priced at $0.001. BlockDAG’s affiliate program not only offers simple, significant earning opportunities but also plays a crucial role in the platform’s expansion and prominence in the cryptocurrency world. Anticipating the Top Crypto Gems for 2025 With a landscape ripe with opportunities, Ethereum Classic, SUI, and BlockDAG stand out in the 2025 crypto market. Ethereum Classic’s projection of reaching $49.07 is backed by positive market trends, while SUI’s recent ATH at $5.35 highlights its increasing influence in DeFi. BlockDAG capitalizes on these trends with its user-centric referral program, promising significant USDT rewards and a notable return for its early adopters.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 22:01:00

These Bitcoin mining devices aim to simplify cryptocurrency mining for individuals while incorporating unique dual-purpose functionality. According to the official press release , the Avalon Mini 3 combines high-performance Bitcoin mining with home heating, boasting a hash rate of 37.5Th/s and a user-friendly app-controlled interface. Meanwhile, the Avalon Nano 3S is an upgraded version of the popular Nano 3 which features a hash rate of 6Th/s and is being marketed as a beginner-friendly entry point into Bitcoin mining . Key advantages of the products include a plug-and-play setup for ease of use and a focus on energy efficiency. The Avalon Mini 3 addresses environmental concerns by recycling computational energy into home heating, allowing users to offset energy costs while minimizing waste. Canaan CEO NG Zhang spoke about the company’s vision of combining practicality with sustainability and added, “The Avalon Mini 3 and Avalon 3S represent our vision of user-friendly, practical mining solutions for the modern individual. We’re reimagining how technology can create value while minimizing environmental waste. The Avalon Mini 3’s ability to generate cryptocurrency while heating your home is a perfect example of our vision for sustainable, multi-purpose technology.”​​​​​​​ Transforming cryptocurrency mining rigs into household devices is not a new concept. Back in 2017, Avi Aisenberg, who operated South Florida Distillers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, created a heating system that used ASIC miners to mine crypto while accelerating the rum-distillation process. In 2018, the French start-up Qarnot introduced the QC-1, a heater designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining. More recently, companies like Heatbit and D-Central have entered the market with products that combine heating capabilities with crypto mining.

The most recent rejection came last week when the price peaked at $102,000 on Monday, only to reverse sharply and fall to $92,000 by Thursday. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead This continued tug-of-war has brought the bearish case for BTC into sharper focus, with technical analysis highlighting a 50/50 chance of a further drop or a bounce. $90,000: A Pivotal Support Zone Under Threat Recent Bitcoin price action has significantly put the $90,000 price point as the most notable support level for the bulls. Although the crypto has largely held above the $90,000 support level even during the recent corrections, the bearish outlook hinges on its ability to defend this level. According to technical analysis by crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has made five different attempts to test a support trendline around $90,000, which further reveals the importance of the level. This repeated retest increases the chance of weakening the support strength and is gradually making Bitcoin more vulnerable to a sharp decline. With this in mind, the major task for Bitcoin bulls would be to hold above the $90,000 and break resistance levels above $100,000 in order to invalidate a bearish outlook. Should Bitcoin fall below $90,000, it could cascade to a further price drop to the $87,000 range or even lower. A fall below $87,000 could, in turn, cause a quick fall through a $12,000 gap to reach $75,000. Resistance Levels To Break: $103,000 To $108,500 As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin could continue to pose a bearish threat until it closes above a few resistance levels. These resistance levels are situated at $103,000, $106,400, and $108,500, and consistent daily closes above these thresholds are required to confirm a bullish trend. The third resistance of $108,500 is the most notable, as a break above it would see Bitcoin trading at new all-time highs. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, current technical indicators suggest that the chances of a pump are low at the moment. For instance, Bitcoin has now lost the support of the 21 EMA on the daily candlestick timeframe, and sentiment is now in a neutral zone on the Fear and Greed Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, the biggest factor that could see bullish momentum return to Bitcoin is the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th and the anticipated crypto-positive policies that during the new administration. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the event could either trigger a short-term rally or exacerbate the ongoing decline. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400.

Recently, FTX unveiled new details about its $16 billion creditor repayment plan , offering some clarity to those affected by its collapse. The plan prioritizes smaller creditors, with the first payments soon scheduled. This update marks the beginning of financial relief for many, causing anticipation to build among creditors and the broader crypto community. However, the challenges, such as phishing scams and unresolved legal disputes, still loom large. Small Creditors to Get Early Relief FTX’s bankruptcy reorganization plan emphasizes fairness, starting with creditors whose claims are below $50,000. These smaller creditors will share an initial repayment pool of $1.2 billion. This information was disclosed by FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri in an X post earlier today. FTX repayments Initial Distribution Schedule Claims Jan 20th: FTX has given until 20th Jan to fulfil pre distribution requirements for initial distribution Repayments likely won’t start before then Feb 25: Likely (up to 4th Mar) — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 12, 2025 The record date for these claims was set as January 3, with repayments expected to commence in February. To streamline the process, the trading platform has asked creditors to complete essential pre-distribution requirements by January 20. These include submitting W-8BEN tax forms and passing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Importantly, creditors have a 60-day deadline to file their tax forms or risk forfeiting their repayments. FTX has stressed the importance of meeting these requirements to avoid delays. Phishing Scams and Legal Confusion Add to FTX Worries While the repayment plan brings hope, it has also created new risks. A wave of phishing scams and fraudulent claim portals has been targeting creditors. FTX has urged caution, reminding stakeholders to verify all communications and rely only on official channels for information. In addition, unresolved legal issues are complicating the process. Claims surrounding the acquisition of FTX EU by Backpack have been flagged as inaccurate. FTX clarified that FTX EU remains fully owned by FTX Europe AG. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court oversees FTX’s Chapter 11 case and has not approved any share transfers. These legal disputes highlight the ongoing complexities in FTX’s path to recovery. A Boost for the Crypto Market? The repayment plan could have a significant impact beyond FTX creditors. Market analysts are optimistic that many creditors may reinvest their funds in the crypto market once repayments are distributed. Kraken recently offered selected creditors seamless ways to reinvest in the market, a no-fee trading initiative. This influx of capital and a favorable stance from the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration could trigger a rally for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. The crypto market, still reeling from the collapse of major exchanges like FTX, needs positive momentum. If the trading platform successfully executes its repayment plan, it could restore some confidence in the industry and set a precedent for managing future crises.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 23:22:00

Speaking to the Russian news outlet Prime , Sergey Bezdelov, the head of the Industrial Mining Association said that “in the fourth quarter of 2024,” the demand for industrial mining equipment and services in Russia “increased threefold compared to the same period in FY2023.” Bezdelov was speaking in the wake of comments from a top lawmaker who said Moscow was ready to “soften” its stance on crypto regulation. Crypto Mining Hardware a Hit in Russia? The Industrial Mining Association chief added that there was “also high interest” in Russian crypto mining projects “among foreign market participants.” The estimated percentage change in Bitcoin Mining difficulty over the past seven days. (Source: Dune/@mitchklee_) Bezdelov said that some of this “interest” in Russian crypto mining was now coming from “fellow BRICS member states.” In May last year, Bezdelov claimed that the Russian industrial crypto mining market “doubled in size” in 2023 . The expert hinted that recent legal changes had helped boost the popularity of mining in Russia. A law that came into force on November 1, 2024, allows both “legal entities” (private companies) and “individual entrepreneurs” (private citizens) to mine crypto “legally” if they do not consume more than 6,000 kWh of energy per month. “Individuals can mine cryptoassets without being included in a state-run register, but within the limits of the electricity consumption threshold. If they go beyond this threshold, citizens must register as an individual entrepreneur and apply for inclusion on the register.” Bezdelov With the help of a two-story clock in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, the Baltics are counting down the minutes until they leave Russia's energy grid on Feb. 8. https://t.co/eNgeDsdKGa — Bloomberg (@business) January 11, 2025 Crypto Taxes Incoming? At present, the register only requires companies and individuals to submit data on transactions and energy consumption. However, as the body that controls the register also operates Russia’s taxation system, it is highly likely that any miner using more than 6,000 kWh will soon have to pay tax on their earnings. However, Bezdelov noted that before last year’s legal change, crypto mining was in a “gray” legal zone. Until November, mining had no legal status. Now, however, Russian law recognizes it as a form of “entrepreneurship.” While Bezdelov and others have previously said that most (around 90%) of domestic miners focus their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC) , Cryptonews.com has seen evidence that suggests many Russian home-based miners prefer Ethereum (ETH) . Last year, Bezdelov said that Litecoin (LTC) is also popular among a smaller group of Russian miners. Litecoin prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Russian Media, Lawmakers Change Tune on Crypto The same media outlet wrote that mining is a “good source of additional income.” It added that Russian companies and individuals could use crypto as an “opportunity to diversify their assets.” It also suggested that firms could use the crypto they mine as a settlement tool “when conducting foreign economic activity within the framework” of the Central Bank’s sandbox. This type of positive talk about crypto was once almost unheard of in Russian mainstream media outlets.

And the Central Bank has led several attempts to issue a China-style crypto crackdown in Russia. However, President Vladimir Putin last year spearheaded a crypto pivot when he began to speak about crypto mining in glowing terms. And while many energy-poor areas have issued bans on crypto mining until 2031, Putin has urged other parts of the Russian Federation to mine crypto “if they have surplus energy.” Tax Boost The association has claimed that the Russian Treasury could expect to earn over $500 million per year from taxing crypto miners. Others claim that Russia’s desire to become an AI “powerhouse” has inspired Putin’s crypto pivot . Bezdelov advised Russian qualified investors to “allocate up to 5% of their portfolios to mining services and digital currencies.” China warmly welcomes the new addition to the BRICS family, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday, in response to Brazil, as the BRICS chair 2025, releasing a statement on Monday night announcing the official entry of Indonesia as a full member into BRICS.… pic.twitter.com/XqZycI9onG — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 7, 2025 Softer Crypto Stance Possible, Lawmakers Says Meanwhile, TASS reported that the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation has “allowed for the possibility of softer regulation” for domestic companies using crypto to avoid US, UK, and EU-led sanctions . The state-run news agency quoted Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, as explaining that crypto “market players” are complaining of “over-regulation” in the Central Bank’s sandbox. Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets. (Source: Secretariat of the World Russian People’s Council/YouTube/Screenshot) The Central Bank wants all Russian firms who use crypto as a payment tool to exchange coins using the sandbox, rather than dealing directly with overseas partners in crypto. “We need to quickly launch an experimental [sandbox]. We then need to see how the standards we have adopted in this market work. And then we can make further adjustments later. Quite possibly, we will move toward a softer regulatory [position].” Lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets Aksakov also said that firms are not happy with the Central Bank’s protocols. Many, it seems, think these protocols are over-complicated. The lawmaker said: “Many companies are suggesting that we need to somehow simplify the turnover of cryptocurrencies so that the market can develop successfully.

Travis Ford, 35, of Glenpool, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with his role as CEO, co-founder, and head trader of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC. The purported investment firm operated from January 2023 to August 2023, promoting itself through its website, social media, and other internet platforms.

Ford admitted that he knew such returns were unattainable but made promises to lure investors anyway. He misappropriated the funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, leaving investors with significant financial losses. The Justice Department announced the plea on Friday, Jan. 10, with Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Wible and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Inspector in Charge Eric Shen highlighting the fraudulent scheme’s scope. Ford now faces up to five years in prison, with sentencing to be determined by a federal district court judge. The court will consider the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors before issuing a final sentence. A sentencing date has not yet been set. The news came just two days after a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Washington charged a former pastor with 26 counts of fraud, alleging he masterminded a cryptocurrency scheme.

On January 12, several users in Singapore reported being unable to access Polymarket. Alex Zuo, Vice President of Investment and Custody at Cobo Global, commented on X: “Polymarket is officially defined as a gambling website in Singapore. If you want to place a bet, you can only go to a state-owned gambling company. Otherwise, you will face fines and imprisonment.” Users attempting to visit Polymarket are greeted with a warning under Section 20 of the Gambling Control Act 2022. The act imposes penalties of up to SG$10,000, jail terms of up to six months, or both for gambling with unlicensed operators. The warning from the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) reads: “You have attempted to access an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider. Singapore Pools is the only licensed online gambling operator in Singapore.” Regulatory Landscape The GRA, established on August 1, 2022, oversees all forms of gambling in Singapore. It was created by restructuring the Casino Regulatory Authority to address the changing nature of gambling products and services. Polymarket operates on the Polygon blockchain, allowing users to bet on global events using USD Coin (USDC). From January 1, the Singapore Police Force assumed enforcement authority for illegal gambling. According to the GRA, Singapore Pools is the sole operator licensed to offer remote gambling services. Violators face fines of up to SG$500,000 and imprisonment of up to seven years, with repeat offenders subject to harsher penalties. Since 2015, the GRA has blocked more than 3,800 gambling websites and SG$37 million in transactions. Singapore’s Crypto Leadership Despite its strict gambling regulations, Singapore is a blockchain and cryptocurrency hub. A December study by ApeX Protocol highlighted Singapore’s 1,600 blockchain patents, 2,433 crypto-related jobs, and 81 cryptocurrency exchanges. In 2024, Singapore doubled its issuance of digital asset licenses, granting 13 major payment institution licenses, more than twice the number in 2023.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Gambling|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|MATIC|MINING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 23:52:00

FET Trends Look Uncertain While Chroma Drives Web3 Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-presale-tops-590k-fet-trends-look-uncertain-while-chroma-drives-web3-growth/,"Various market movements are drawing attention in the blockchain field. FET trends are showing mixed signals, with the possibility of surpassing the $1.71 resistance level, yet inconsistent network activities temper these gains. In parallel, the Web3 sector is expanding, enhanced by tools like Chroma’s Crocket app which simplifies blockchain interaction through enjoyable, cost-free activities, showcasing seamless integration of technology and practical usability. Concurrently, Web3Bay ‘s presale is performing well, accumulating over $590,000. This indicates its potential to innovate the traditional e-commerce sector by integrating decentralized blockchain technology with accessible crypto pricing, creating an inviting environment for participants in its growing ecosystem. FET Trends Surge By 25%: What’s Next? FET trends are capturing attention, having surged by 25% before descending to $1.29. This rise was a temporary boost, and a deeper analysis reveals possible bearish patterns that might affect its stability. The Price DAA Divergence, showing a mismatch between increasing prices and diminishing network activities, suggests impending adjustments. Despite some concerns, the weakening of the downward momentum indicated by the Average Directional Index suggests FET might be stabilizing. Investors are keeping an eye on the crucial $1.71 resistance level, which, if broken, could propel FET toward $2.00. As these trends develop, the market remains vigilant of FET’s direction. Web3 Adoption: Chroma’s Crocket Redefines Access Web3 adoption is widening, led by platforms that ease access to blockchain technology. The Chroma Crocket app, for instance, enhances user engagement through reward-based activities like quizzes and games, eliminating transaction fees with its Chroma ID, thus broadening the blockchain’s reach to novices. The influence of Web3 is not confined to apps; it’s spreading across gaming, e-commerce, and finance sectors. Developers are dedicated to lowering technological hurdles, enabling effortless user involvement. Crocket’s successful strategy illustrates how Web3 can link real rewards with enhanced functionality. As Web3 becomes more accessible, it’s clear that user-friendly tools are crucial for its mainstream acceptance. Web3Bay Presale Catalyzes E-Commerce Transformation! Web3Bay is emerging as the premier platform for online transactions of digital assets, revolutionizing e-commerce through blockchain technology. With its native coin, the 3BAY token presale creating significant buzz, it has successfully raised over $590,000 and sold more than 180 million coins.

BlockDAG Targets $1 with Exchange Listing Talks Heating Up — Dogecoin Whales Shift & AVAX Targets Climb,https://thecoinrise.com/next-big-crypto-blockdag-targets-1-with-exchange-listing-talks-heating-up-dogecoin-whales-shift-avax-targets-climb/,"The crypto market thrives on big gains, and three key contenders are aiming for impressive growth this year. But which one has the potential to be the best crypto investment for 2025? This week, Dogecoin increased by 22.83% after a recent 14% decline. This rise is largely due to Dogecoin whales moving over $1 billion in DOGE. Analysts have identified a crucial Avalanche (AVAX) target at $126, which could lead to significant gains if AVAX overcomes existing resistance levels. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under discussion with ten prominent exchanges for listings. The potential of BlockDAG securing major exchange spots has attracted more participants to the presale, already surpassing $179.5 million. As the presale advances towards its $600 million goal, the outlook for BDAG reaching $1 sooner than anticipated this year remains optimistic! Dogecoin Whales Propel DOGE’s Market Value This week, Dogecoin’s price ascended to $0.3921, marking a 22.83% increase. The spike is mainly attributed to Dogecoin whales, who shifted over $1 billion in DOGE, increasing liquidity and buyer interest. Elon Musk’s recent activities and tweets, known to influence Dogecoin’s market previously, are believed to have lifted market confidence. Furthermore, a rise in trading volume across major exchanges shows escalating interest from both individual and larger scale buyers. Yet, while Dogecoin whale activities have led to positive growth, the coin’s fluctuating nature remains a concern for some analysts. Avalanche (AVAX) Target: Crucial Points to Monitor Avalanche is currently trading at $43.48 and might be poised for growth, with a significant Avalanche (AVAX) target set at $126.03. If it breaks through the $126 mark, it might escalate to $243, a 468% jump from current figures. However, overcoming crucial resistance levels is essential for these gains. Failure to surpass $126 could impede the bullish trajectory, keeping the price from reaching higher AVAX targets. Therefore, analysts continue to watch these levels closely to gauge AVAX’s momentum and price goals. BlockDAG Poised for $1 as Exchange Listing Talks Progress! BlockDAG’s promising $179.5 million presale surge, consistent growth, and high ROI projections mark it as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. Currently in discussions to list BDAG on ten exchanges, these initiatives further boost excitement around BlockDAG’s trajectory, pushing its presale towards the $600 million mark and offering substantial value to BDAG holders. Globally, the project is gaining attention, notably through strategic partnerships, like its collaboration with Italian football titan Inter Milan, which has introduced a new wave of sports enthusiasts to the crypto realm. This alliance has significantly enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility and credibility in both the crypto and sports arenas, fostering a broad base of supporters and holders. With these strategic moves and a rapidly expanding community, BlockDAG is on track for significant achievements in 2025 and beyond. Given its strong presale results and ongoing exchange talks, analysts believe BDAG could reach $1 this year. With its price currently at $0.0248, this indicates considerable return potential for current buyers. Those who bought in early, during the first batch, have already seen returns increase by 2380%. Smart traders are quickly seizing this promising opportunity, as the 26th presale batch has sold out. With BDAG’s price rising batch by batch, now is an ideal time for enthusiasts to engage for substantial gains in the upcoming months. Best Cryptos to Buy for 2025– Final Verdict DOGE’s recent price surge, spurred by Dogecoin whales and Musk’s influence, suggests growing interest, though its volatility remains a point of caution. Meanwhile, if Avalanche can break the critical resistance at $126, its price might soar, but failure could stall its bullish run. Currently at $43.48 with a 15.22% drop this month, the realization of Avalanche’s (AVAX) targets is up for debate. However, BlockDAG, with the largest presale to date, emerges as a highly promising contender. Its notable partnerships and imminent listings enhance its potential, with analysts predicting a $1 valuation in the near months. At just $0.0248 currently, BlockDAG offers an enticing opportunity for significant future returns, positioning it as the best crypto to buy for 2025 .

Since the price patterns are forming up, Ethereum price seems appealing to analysts and investors. However, it is the emergent DTX Exchange that is holding the spotlight moment. It has witnessed explosive momentum with the significant development in the case of Ripple vs. SEC. Could DTX be the evolutionary platform that changes the face of the crypto trade? Keep on reading to dig deeper into the details. DTX Exchange - The New Force in Crypto Trade While Ethereum and XRP get all the buzz, DTX Exchange is secretly becoming the new big hype in the crypto scene. A hybrid trading platform that bridges the centralized and decentralized world, DTX offers a smooth trading experience appealing to a broader audience. Let’s take a review at what makes DTX stand out: The Hybrid Model Combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges, user-friendliness with security and autonomy, DTX Exchange allows traders to benefit from both ends. This innovation appeals to experienced traders looking to be more effective and newer ones wanting the safest crypto entry. DTX is in a league of its own since it doesn't stop at the mere provision of cryptocurrencies. With over 120,000 available financial instruments on the platform, tokenized stocks, ETFs, and commodities, to name a few, users have options unparalleled in variety and scope for portfolio diversification as never before. Fair Tokenomics The DTX tokenomics model is all about inclusivity. Unlike other platforms that heavily favor institutional players, DTX Exchange ensures a fair launch, giving both retail and institutional investors equal opportunities to participate. This balanced approach fosters a more equitable ecosystem, which resonates strongly with the crypto community. Proven Growth All said, the DTX presale has been nothing short of a blockbuster, garnering more than $11.2 million and presenting a 600% return to early participants. It further indicates that the value of the token has gone up from $0.02 to $0.14, which depicts the immense confidence investors have in the platform's vision. Upcoming Catalysts Industry leaders have been keeping close tabs on DTX's performance. With tier-one exchange listings expected within the next few months, analysts predict that the token is set to multiply 10x to 100x. These statements have raised anticipation and interest in DTX Exchange , especially for traders looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP vs SEC: A Revolutionary Case for Crypto Regulation The history of cryptocurrency shows the XRP vs SEC case as the most significant happening till now. This lawsuit has been a battleground between innovation and regulation for years: the SEC believes that XRP is not a security, while Ripple maintains that it is. This partial recent victory for XRP brought much-needed clarification to its legal status, thereby eliciting a powerful price rally with the consequent restoration of the market's trust in the token. Such an outcome reverberated across the entire cryptocurrency system. It actually bonded optimism among altcoins and pushed the notion further that digital assets can somehow find a route toward acceptance in America. The Ripple vs SEC case has created a ripple effect in investor sentiment. Reduced regulatory uncertainty typically translates to more aggressive market participation, which has encouraged traders and investors to explore promising altcoins and innovative projects. Ethereum Price Action: The Market's Compass Investors are keeping a close eye on the Ethereum price. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and crypto enthusiasts often refer to it as a ""compass"" for market movements. The fluctuation in Ethereum price reflects the general mood in the cryptocurrency industry, right now. ETH has traded at over $3600, as of 4th January 2025 and has demonstrated remarkable resilience to market volatility. Source: CoinMarketCap It has been noticed that Ethereum favors the long-term investor due to the upgrades it is expected to go through, along with dominating the DeFi and NFT markets. According to analysts, continuous improvement of scalability and institutional adoption will lead to the revisiting of all-time highs, possibly surpassing it. Why Is DTX Gaining Momentum? The rapid success of DTX Exchange is not merely a case of smart marketing; it has deep roots in tangible innovation and timing. A new phase in the crypto market is opening its doors, with investors no longer content with the traditional exchanges, which are limited in flexibility and security. DTX fills in these gaps with features that traders genuinely need. But it is also because the larger industry dynamics are in DTX's favour. The crypto market is now looking forward to the next bull cycle. So, with the hybrid model of DTX, diversified assets and an approach for all, the platform is sitting on the most ideal ground. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investors Ethereum price and XRP continue to play pivotal roles in setting the stage, but the emergence of platforms like DTX Exchange signals the dawn of a new era. At its next cycle, the question in the market won't be about whether crypto is going to keep growing but, rather, who will lead. With innovative features and unstoppable momentum, DTX Exchange is most definitely one of them. With its promising tokenomics, proven success, and upcoming catalysts, DTX is already poised to lead the market. It’s set to be more accessible to crypto investors through its enlightened, flexible way of trading.

From its humble beginnings as a meme coin in 2020, Shiba Inu turned into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the world. People who got in early saw massive returns, with Shiba Inu’s price soaring from fractions of a cent to the moon. Those who missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO watched their friends become rich from what was once just a dog-themed joke. But here’s the good news for anyone feeling left out: you don’t have to regret missing Shiba Inu’s ICO anymore. The market is brimming with fresh opportunities, and the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term is right here: BTFD Coin. While Shiba Inu may have taken the world by storm, BTFD Coin is fast gaining traction with a standout feature: its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which offers real utility and rewards, making it the perfect new meme coin for those who want to get in on the action. The Shiba Inu ICO: A Missed Opportunity Many Regret to This Day Back in 2020, Shiba Inu was launched at a fraction of a cent, with an initial price that made it practically impossible to ignore. As early investors took a chance on this meme-inspired project, the coin’s value surged, making it one of the most recognizable meme coins in the space. By 2021, Shiba Inu’s price had risen to a crazy degree, creating millionaires out of those who took the plunge early. The meme coin industry was never the same, and Shiba Inu set the bar for what could happen when meme coins gain massive popularity. Unfortunately, for those who didn’t take the chance when Shiba Inu’s ICO was available, the dream of grabbing cheap coins at ground level quickly slipped away. The price soared, and those who entered after the initial hype missed the boat on those massive gains. But don’t worry, the good news is that BTFD Coin is the fresh opportunity you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a meme coin with a fully developed Play-to-Earn game that gives holders something tangible and valuable to look forward to, making it the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term right now. BTFD Coin’s P2E Gaming Universe: The Best New Meme Coin to Buy and Hold for the Short Term BTFD’s Play-to-Earn game allows players to earn BTFD tokens through in-game rewards, and those rewards can be converted into real-world value. This gives BTFD Coin an edge over other meme coins, adding a layer of fun and financial opportunity that’s hard to ignore. The P2E game is just one part of the BTFD Coin ecosystem creating excitement in the community. But the real kicker here is the rewards system—holders can earn by playing the game and staking their BTFD coins for a mind-blowing 90% APY . While some meme coins rely solely on community enthusiasm, BTFD Coin is building a sustainable system that rewards its supporters in multiple ways, all while maintaining the fun and inclusive vibe that meme coins are known for. In addition to the P2E game and staking, BTFD Coin’s presale is already showing impressive numbers. With over 64 billion coins sold and more than $5.1 million raised so far, this project is rapidly gaining momentum. And with BTFD Coin still in its presale stage, now is the perfect time to jump in before the price rises and the game gets even more competitive.

Whales Buy 90 Million ADA Token In a post on X, an expert noted that whales have purchased a significant 90 million ADA tokens in the past 96 hours, which equates to the last four days.

Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.968 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.85% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, due to the recent breakout of the bullish price action pattern, investors and traders have shown strong participation in the token, resulting in a 27.5% increase in trading volume. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Levels With the recent price decline, the ADA price has reached the breakout level, and it appears that the price has come to this level for a retest, aiming for further upside momentum. As long as the altcoin maintains itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame and the $0.955 level, ADA remains bullish. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ADA could soar by 17.5% to reach the next resistance level of $1.135 in the coming days.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 00:26:20

Aptos price forecasts for 2025 also show considerable growth potential, fueled by its growing ecosystem. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves in the crypto market, having amassed an impressive $179.5 million to date and securing a staggering 2380% ROI. Its dynamic ecosystem, including the highly acclaimed X1 mobile mining app and the engaging TG Tap miner game on Telegram, is attracting a broad crypto audience. Currently, BlockDAG is swiftly advancing towards its bold $600 million target and is often cited as the best crypto right now. Litecoin Price Prediction: Is $400 Achievable Soon?

Analysts have set a $400 target, supporting a bullish Litecoin price prediction for the coming months Over the recent week, LTC has climbed by 11%, showing solid support and a bullish stance. Additionally, talks of a possible Litecoin ETF by 2025 could draw institutional players, potentially elevating its market price. With positive market sentiment and strong technical indicators, the discussion around Litecoin price prediction remains focused on its substantial upside potential in the near term. What’s in Store for Aptos Price in 2025? Aptos price predictions for 2025 indicate significant promise, with experts suggesting a peak of $16.64 by year-end. The cryptocurrency’s performance is bolstered by its established ecosystem and the increasing adoption of decentralized applications.

Having secured over $590K in presale investments, Web3Bay is making a notable impact in the decentralized shopping sector. Early investors are poised to achieve a 6430% ROI, marking this as a potentially lucrative opportunity for those in the trading community. TON News: TONCASH Aligns with TON Ventures The latest from TON news highlights the new partnership between TONCASH and TON Ventures, a pivotal development for cryptocurrency cashback within the Web3 arena. This collaboration is fueled by a strategic investment from TON Ventures, aiming to redefine the scope of cryptocurrency cashbacks.

By pooling their resources and expertise, Hunters of Web3 and Wilder World are setting a new course for the future of Web3 integration in the metaverse. Why Web3Bay Could Permanently Transform Decentralized E-Commerce The 3BAY token is pivotal in reshaping the e-commerce ecosystem , establishing Web3Bay as a significant competitor to disrupt traditional giants like Amazon. As the foundational element of the Web3Bay platform, 3BAY tokens facilitate seamless transactions and interactions within its decentralized marketplace. This token is the gateway to an innovative e-commerce ecosystem where users enjoy exclusive product access, reduced transaction fees, and loyalty incentives. What distinguishes Web3Bay from traditional online shopping platforms is its integration of blockchain technology with a robust e-commerce framework, enhancing transparency, security, and providing unparalleled advantages for both consumers and vendors. The 3BAY token catalyzes these transactions and nurtures a community-driven value system. Unlike conventional marketplaces, 3BAY token holders experience true ownership, converting shopping into an investment. Consequently, the demand for 3BAY tokens is surging, with $590K raised and over 180 million tokens already sold at just $0.0039675 each, reflecting its growing momentum. The presale’s rapid advancement, with significant trading activity contributing over $50K in just 24 hours, mirrors the market’s confidence in Web3Bay’s transformative vision.

Its user-driven approach, supported by the critical role of the 3BAY token, is redefining the operations of Web3 e-commerce. The opportunity to engage in this paradigm shift is available now—before it becomes mainstream. Final Thoughts Recent developments in Web3—from TONCASH’s innovative cashback mechanism to the collaborative efforts of Hunters of Web3 and Wilder World—underscore the blockchain’s transformative influence across various sectors. However, it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce ecosystem that stands out, offering a prime opportunity for traders seeking substantial long-term benefits. The 3BAY tokens are central to driving decentralized transactions and providing unmatched rewards, setting Web3Bay on a path to disrupt established platforms like Amazon and redefine the e-commerce landscape. With the presale reaching impressive milestones—garnering over $590K and indicating a potential 6430% ROI upon launch—the growing confidence in Web3Bay’s vision is evident.

However, as XRP price garners attention, another player is quietly making waves: RCO Finance (RCOF) . RCO Finance is positioned as a next-generation crypto project, and is emerging as a strong contender for investors looking for massive returns, with projections indicating a potential 40,000% rise. XRP’s Path to $10: XRP Price Recovery and Market Dynamics The potential for the XRP price to hit $10 is rooted in its growing adoption and favorable legal developments. Following Ripple Labs’ partial victory against the SEC, investor confidence in XRP has increased, sparking a rally that many believe could continue into 2025. XRP’s unique role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments has made it a favorite among financial institutions. Its speed, low transaction fees, and scalability are driving partnerships with banks and payment providers worldwide. Challenges on the Horizon Despite the optimism, XRP price faces challenges that could slow its ascent: Regulatory Uncertainty : While Ripple has made progress, the legal landscape remains unpredictable. Market Competition : Other blockchain networks are also targeting the cross-border payment sector, threatening XRP’s dominance. Why RCO Finance Is Outpacing the Competition While XRP targets incremental growth, RCO Finance (RCOF) is positioned for explosive gains thanks to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). RCO Finance is a cutting-edge platform that leverages artificial intelligence and tokenization to revolutionize how users interact with digital assets. Its ability to deliver unmatched utility and profitability makes it a standout in the crowded crypto market. Key Features That Drive RCOF’s Growth AI-Powered Insights : RCOF uses advanced AI algorithms to provide tailored investment strategies, helping users maximize returns with minimal effort.

RCO Finance Presale: The Ultimate Investor Opportunity RCO Finance is currently in its presale phase, priced at $0.07 per token. Analysts predict a meteoric rise to $2 by early 2025, translating to a 40,000% return for early investors. Why the Presale Matters The RCOF presale is more than just a token sale; it’s a gateway to long-term wealth creation. Here’s why: Low Entry Point : Early adopters can secure RCOF tokens at a fraction of their projected market value. High Growth Potential : With its robust ecosystem and growing demand, RCOF is set to outshine other altcoins. Community Support : The presale is attracting a global community of investors, amplifying its growth trajectory. XRP vs. RCO Finance: Comparing the Opportunities XRP’s Strengths Institutional Adoption : Backed by financial giants. Proven Use Case : Dominates cross-border payments. RCO Finance’s Advantages Innovative Features : Combines AI with DeFi for unparalleled utility. Massive ROI Potential : Offers a 40,000% return compared to XRP’s modest gains. What This Means for Crypto Investors The choice between XRP and RCO Finance depends on your investment goals. XRP offers stability and incremental growth, making it suitable for conservative investors. And that is one of the reasons XRP price keeps increasing. Meanwhile, RCOF provides an opportunity for exponential returns, appealing to those willing to embrace higher risk for higher rewards. Many investors are turning to RCO Finance for its: Technological Edge : Innovative features that set it apart from traditional altcoins. First-Mover Advantage : As a pioneer in AI-driven DeFi, RCOF is capturing market share at an unprecedented pace. Conclusion While the XRP price targets $10, RCO Finance is redefining what’s possible in the crypto market.

Meme coins named after the nascent Department of Government Efficiency — an early-stage agency devoted to cost-cutting measures under the incoming Trump administration — plummeted Sunday. One DOGE token, which formed in 2024 as a satirical take on government spending and bureaucracy, experienced a sharp 18% drop in value over the past 24 hours. See one trajectory below. Source: CoinGecko Another version of the coin, sporting a logo of a dog wearing a MAGA-like hat, also landed in the red at last check on Sunday, dropping by 20%. Source: CoinGecko The real DOGE — the actual coterie of business leaders set to eliminate bureaucratic waste — has sparked both intrigue and skepticism. The agency, to be co-led by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, initially boasted that it could slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. This week, however, Musk revised his estimate, describing $1 trillion in cuts as “an epic outcome.” Speaking on X, which he owns, Musk explained his vision: “If we try for $2 trillion, we’ve got a good shot at getting one. That would free up the economy, reduce inflation, and be, well, epic.” Watch Stagwell's CEO Mark Penn interview Elon Musk at CES! https://t.co/BO3Z7bbHOZ — Live (@Live) January 9, 2025 The tokens inspired by the agency (whose name is an acronym for Dogecoin’s trading symbol) plummeted in value in the days following Musk’s comments. “It’s very, very hard for people to care about spending someone else’s money,” Musk said, adding that federal regulations often render large projects illegal—or at least prohibitively expensive. DOGE, as it turns out, isn’t technically part of the government and holds no actual power to cut spending or enforce policies. It intends to advise the White House on what to slash . Tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has interviewed Musk in the past, wasn’t surprised by the Tesla CEO’s sudden downplaying of what the DOGE can accomplish. “Typical Musk on more things than you think,” she said in a social media post. “Over bragging and then under delivering.” Swisher cited other Musk-led initiatives (i.e., the Hyperloop, robotaxis, autonomous vehicles) as examples. “The weird part is he is fully capable of delivering good stuff when he just shuts up,” she added.

With innovation driving the crypto space forward, it’s critical to pick projects that offer not just hype but tangible value and long-term potential. Among the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term, three projects stand out: Qubetics (TICS) with its groundbreaking presale and asset tokenization solutions, Bittensor TAO as a game-changer in decentralized AI, and Arbitrum, a leader in scaling Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics’ transformative approach to real-world asset tokenization, Bittensor TAO’s pioneering AI infrastructure, or Arbitrum’s unmatched blockchain scalability, these altcoins are worth your attention. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is the name on everyone’s lips right now, and for good reason. The project is currently in the 16th stage of its presale, where it has already sold over 413 million $TICS tokens to more than 14,200 holders, raising an impressive $9.3 million. At a presale price of just $0.0455 per token, this is a golden opportunity for anyone looking for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. What sets Qubetics apart is its focus on real-world asset tokenization . This revolutionary concept is about converting physical assets—think real estate, art, or even precious metals—into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine owning a fraction of a luxury apartment in New York or a rare painting from Paris, all through $TICS tokens. It’s not just about democratizing investments; it’s about making them accessible, transparent, and secure. Consider this scenario: A small business in Toronto wants to expand but lacks traditional funding options. With Qubetics, they can tokenize their real estate holdings, offering investors a piece of their property in exchange for capital. Similarly, a professional in Dallas could diversify their portfolio by buying tokenized shares of a wind farm in Spain. Even individuals can leverage tokenized assets to gain exposure to global markets without the usual barriers of entry. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Analysts predict potential returns of up to 32,816% ROI following its mainnet launch, making it a prime contender for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. The future of investments is here, and it’s called Qubetics. Bittensor TAO: Pioneering Decentralized AI In the world of artificial intelligence, Bittensor TAO is blazing a trail like no other. By combining blockchain with AI, Bittensor has created a decentralized network where anyone can contribute to and benefit from cutting-edge machine learning models. It’s a concept that has resonated deeply with the crypto community, cementing Bittensor TAO as one of the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. The beauty of Bittensor lies in its openness. Unlike traditional AI models that are controlled by tech giants, Bittensor’s decentralized network allows anyone to participate. Developers can train and deploy AI models, while users can access these models without the gatekeeping of centralized entities. It’s a win-win situation that democratizes AI and fosters innovation. Take, for example, a startup in Silicon Valley working on a predictive analytics tool for healthcare. Instead of building their AI infrastructure from scratch, they can tap into Bittensor’s network, saving time and resources. Meanwhile, contributors to the network earn TAO tokens for their efforts, creating an ecosystem where everyone benefits. Bittensor’s potential doesn’t stop at technology; it’s also a powerful investment opportunity. With AI becoming increasingly integrated into industries ranging from healthcare to finance, Bittensor is poised to play a pivotal role. Its decentralized approach not only challenges the status quo but also opens new avenues for collaboration and innovation. The combination of AI and blockchain is a match made in heaven, and Bittensor TAO is leading the charge. For those seeking a project with long-term viability and a strong community, this is one of the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Arbitrum: Scaling Ethereum’s Blockchain Arbitrum has quickly established itself as a key player in the crypto world, offering solutions to one of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges: scalability. By enabling faster and cheaper transactions, Arbitrum has become a favorite among developers and users alike. Its role in the Ethereum ecosystem makes it a no-brainer for anyone searching for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Arbitrum achieves its scalability through an innovative technology called optimistic rollups. This allows it to process transactions off-chain while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum. The result is a blockchain that’s both efficient and cost-effective, without compromising on reliability. For businesses, this means they can build decentralized applications (dApps) that are not only powerful but also user-friendly. Imagine a gaming company in Austin launching a blockchain-based multiplayer game. With Arbitrum, they can ensure smooth gameplay and seamless transactions, enhancing the user experience while keeping costs low. Developers, too, are flocking to Arbitrum for its ease of use and robust infrastructure. Arbitrum’s integration with Ethereum has also bolstered its reputation. As the demand for Ethereum-based solutions continues to grow, so does the importance of scaling solutions like Arbitrum. Its ecosystem is thriving, with projects ranging from DeFi protocols to NFT platforms choosing Arbitrum as their foundation. What truly sets Arbitrum apart is its focus on community and collaboration. It’s not just about technology; it’s about building an ecosystem where developers, businesses, and users can thrive. For those looking to invest in a project with solid fundamentals and long-term potential, Arbitrum is a standout among the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Conclusion: Your Crypto Portfolio’s Next Big Moves The crypto market is filled with possibilities, but Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Arbitrum rise above the noise.

It’s constantly buzzing with innovation, offering investors endless opportunities to grow their portfolios. If you’re on the hunt for the best altcoins to invest in this month, three projects stand out: Qubetics (TICS) with its groundbreaking presale and focus on interoperability, AAVE as a DeFi giant, and Immutable X, a leader in blockchain gaming. Each of these projects has carved out a unique space in the crypto ecosystem. Whether you’re looking for revolutionary technology, financial empowerment, or gaming innovation, these altcoins deliver. Qubetics: Bridging the Gap with Interoperability Qubetics has taken the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 17th stage of its presale, the project has already sold over 413 million $TICS tokens to more than 14,200 holders, raising an impressive $9.3 million. At just $0.0500 per token, this is your chance to get in on one of the best altcoins to invest in this month before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. The real magic of Qubetics lies in its focus on interoperability . In a fragmented crypto world, where blockchains often operate like isolated islands, Qubetics is building bridges. Its platform is designed to allow seamless communication and data transfer between different blockchains, creating a unified ecosystem that benefits everyone. Imagine a business owner in Bogotá using Qubetics to move assets across Ethereum and Solana networks without needing third-party solutions. Or think about a developer in Lima creating a decentralized app that taps into multiple blockchains for real-time data, all thanks to Qubetics’ interoperability. Even individual users, like a crypto enthusiast in Mexico City, can enjoy hassle-free transactions across chains, eliminating the usual complexity. Interoperability isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a game-changer. It streamlines processes, reduces costs, and opens new doors for innovation.

Launched in 2020, AAVE has revolutionized the way people interact with money by providing a platform for borrowing and lending without the need for traditional financial institutions. Its trustless, permissionless ecosystem has made it a go-to choice for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike.

Whether you’re looking to earn interest on your crypto holdings or borrow against them, AAVE offers a seamless experience.

With AAVE, they can use their assets as collateral to secure a loan, all without jumping through the hoops of traditional banks. Similarly, a crypto investor in Santiago can deposit idle assets into AAVE’s liquidity pools, earning passive income while contributing to the ecosystem.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 01:52:26

Hoskinson clarified that IOG earned its ADA , rather than receiving it as a gift. “No ADA was ‘given’ to IOG,” Hoskinson stated. “We earned it all. It’s not the people’s money. It’s profit for building Cardano. The original value of IOG’s ADA was around [$8 million] in 2015. We’ve been here for nine years building.” See below. No ada was ""given"" to IOG. We earned it all.

The CF was given ada as a donation. They have a mandate to… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 12, 2025 Hoskinson contrasted IOG’s ADA holdings with those of the Cardano Foundation (CF), which received ADA as a donation. The foundation, he said, has a mandate to allocate those funds to ecosystem development. His comments came amid speculation about whether IOG would contribute its ADA to support the integration of Circle’s USDC stablecoin, a notion Hoskinson seemingly dismissed. You might also like: NFT market defies crypto dip, Do Kwon trial date set, North Dakota eyes Bitcoin | Weekly Recap Hoskinson: ‘Dishonest people have no place at IOG’ On Saturday, Jan. 11, Hoskinson accused a former CF employee of attempting to “rewrite history” regarding the blockchain’s integration of stablecoins. The former employee had criticized the network’s lack of progress in this area. Hoskinson clapped back: the CF missed an opportunity to integrate USDC in 2021 for $3 million, a time when the foundation’s holdings were valued at nearly $2 billion. “They turned down the deal according to their own employee,” Hoskinson said. “Then you rewrite history to eschew any of their responsibility and make it into power dynamics? I’m seriously glad you don’t work for me anymore. Dishonest people have no place at IOG.” The controversy underscores broader challenges facing Cardano in its push for wider adoption. Major stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether are reportedly hesitant to support the network, citing concerns over a lack of successful decentralized applications and insufficient transaction volume. Hoskinson’s remarks highlight ongoing tensions within the Cardano ecosystem, as stakeholders grapple with decisions that could shape the blockchain’s future. At last check on Sunday, Cardano was trading at roughly $0.96. Source: CoinGecko Cardano, which launched its mainnet in September 2017, is gearing up for an integration with BitcoinOS , which will unlock over $1.4 trillion in liquidity. The developers are also working on Midnight, a scaling project for the ecosystem. Cardano may also benefit from President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to adopt a lighter regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies. Whether a spot ADA ETF, or exchange-traded fund, gets introduced remains to be seen. So far, crypto commentators are optimistic.

Each of these tokens has carved a unique niche, but which one is poised to hit $1 first? With Lightchain AI’s presale now raising $8.5 million and tokens priced at $0.004875, it’s quickly becoming a strong contender in this race. Dogecoin Meme Coin Pioneer Eyes Further Growth Dogecoin, the pioneering meme coin, has experienced significant growth since its inception in 2013. Initially created as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, it has evolved into a cryptocurrency with a robust community and substantial market presence. In 2024, Dogecoin’s value surged by over 93% in a single week, reaching approximately $0.2944, driven by increased whale activity and institutional interest. Analysts project that Dogecoin could achieve a price of $1 by 2025, potentially positioning it among the top-tier cryptocurrencies. Factors contributing to this growth include its first-mover advantage, cultural prominence, and the broader market recovery fueled by favorable economic policies. Technological developments aimed at enhancing scalability and transaction speed are also underway, further supporting its potential for future growth. Pepe Coin Viral Sensation Aiming for New Highs Pepe Coin came onto the stage as a popular meme coin, catching the thoughts of everyday buyers and sellers looking for big swings. Though its main charm is in its meme vibes, PEPE has been growing its use with NFT partnerships and crowd-led projects, turning it into more than jus͏t a risky asset. People think that if Pepe Coin keeps its speed and gets more users, it might move nearer to the $1 line. But, like many meme coins, its win really relies on keeping buyer feelings and market styles. Lightchain AI Innovative Altcoin with $1 Potential Among the contenders, Lightchain AI stands out as a next-generation blockchain platform with real-world applications. Unlike its meme coin counterparts, Lightchain AI focuses on solving inefficiencies within blockchain technology and enhancing scalability. With its presale price set at $0.004875, Lightchain AI offers an attractive entry point for early investors aiming to capitalize on its growth potential. A key highlight of Lightchain AI’s roadmap is its emphasis on energy-efficient blockchain operations, which align with growing global demand for sustainable technologies. Additionally, its initiatives to foster open-source development and collaboration among developers give it a competitive edge. Analysts predict that these factors could propel Lightchain AI to the $1 milestone faster than many speculative tokens, offering significant returns to early adopters.

With Pepe Coin’s popularity surging and Shiba Inu’s ecosystem upgrades fueling excitement, the real spotlight shines on Lightchain AI, a promising new entrant. This project has already raised $9.4 million in its presale at a price of $0.004875, making it one of the most anticipated tokens of the year. Pepe Coin’s January Outlook Will It Reach New Heights? Pepe Coin (PEPE) has had a pretty wild trip lately! In December 2024, it reached a top of $0.00002825 but then fell by around 31% as some buyers took their money out. Zoom ahead to January 6, 2025, and PEPE is selling for near $0.000021 with a market value of more than $8 billion. What comes next for PEPE? Views are varied. Some experts guess it might rise again to $0. 000028 by January 8, a maybe 30% rise. Others are even more hopeful - saying it could fly to $0. ͏00006860 at start of the month which would be a great 235% growth. Sure, the crypto market is not simple to guess so take these odds with a bit of doubt. PEPE’s cost will probably be affected by market feelings, interest in fun coins, and the general money scene. If you’re thinking about putting money in, make sure to do your study and keep aware of the market's highs and lows! Shiba Inu Ecosystem Powerhouse Shiba Inu (SHIB), initially launched as a meme coin in 2020, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem encompassing multiple tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a metaverse. The ecosystem includes three primary tokens: SHIB, the foundational currency; LEASH, limited to 107,646 tokens, offering exclusive benefits to holders; and BONE, serving as the governance token with a total supply of 250 million tokens, enabling community participation in decision-making. ShibaSwap, the ecosystem's decentralized exchange, facilitates token swapping, staking, and yield farming, enhancing DeFi capabilities. The introduction of Shibarium, a Layer-2 scaling solution, aims to improve transaction speeds and reduce costs, further strengthening the ecosystem's infrastructure. Additionally, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has expanded into the NFT space with collections like the SHIBOSHIS, a set of 10,000 unique NFTs, and SHEboshis, celebrating women in crypto. The development of SHIB: The Metaverse offers users immersive digital experiences, allowing for virtual land ownership and interaction within a Shiba Inu-themed environment. This multifaceted ecosystem reflects Shiba Inu's transition from a meme coin to a dynamic platform with diverse applications in the cryptocurrency space. Lightchain AI Breakthrough in Blockchain and AI Integration One of Lightchain AI’s most notable features is its developer portal, which offers comprehensive documentation, testing environments, and APIs designed to empower creators. This robust ecosystem enables developers to build intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) that are both highly efficient and scalable compared to traditional platforms. Furthermore, its seamless integration with widely-used AI frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch ensures an easy transition for developers already experienced with these tools. By prioritizing innovation, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as a leading platform for the next generation of blockchain-based AI solutions. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Other countries, especially those that are serious about gambling laws or just haven’t figured out how to deal with decentralized finance (DeFi), are also throwing a legal wrench in the works. The U.S., in particular, has been leading the charge. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) decided it was time for Polymarket to make some regulatory changes, and they weren’t exactly gentle about it. Last week, the CFTC announced a settlement with the company behind Polymarket. The Commission’s new chair, Rostin Behnam, reportedly told the Senate Agriculture Committee that the CFTC is ready to be the “primary cop on the beat” when it comes to digital asset markets. Meanwhile, countries in the EU and parts of Asia, including China, are keeping their distance, making it harder for users to access Polymarket without running into a few digital roadblocks. The platform’s decentralized setup — built on Polygon, an Ethereum ( ETH ) layer-2 solution — only adds to the headache. without a central authority to take the blame, governments are struggling to put clear legal boundaries around it, especially in places with tight online gambling laws.

If you’re part of the crypto scene, you know that the race to find the best new meme coins for exponential returns never slows down. Today, we’re diving into three crowd favorites: BTFD Coin (BTFD) , Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), and SPX6900 (SPX). While each has its own charm and loyal community, BTFD is charging ahead with its Bulls Squad, making a massive splash with its presale. Let’s take a closer look at what makes these meme coins tick, starting with the frontrunner that has the crypto world buzzing: BTFD Coin. The Rise of BTFD Coin: Bulls Squad Leading the Charge What’s the secret sauce behind BTFD Coin? For starters, it’s the Bulls Squad —a fiercely loyal community of over 8,200 holders who’ve helped sell more than 64 billion coins so far. Since launching its presale, BTFD has smashed milestones, hitting $2.5 million in just 14 days and now raising over $5.1 million. The presale is currently in Stage 13, with tokens priced at $0.000142, and the buzz is palpable. But BTFD isn’t just about numbers. Its unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) game is now live, offering players real rewards for completing challenges. Think of it as gaming meets crypto, where every level you conquer brings tangible benefits. And for the staking enthusiasts, BTFD’s staking platform boasts an impressive 90% APY, letting you multiply your holdings while staying part of a vibrant community. Meme coins thrive on community engagement, and BTFD’s Bulls Squad exemplifies this. With personas like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, the project’s narrative builds a relatable and inclusive vibe. These characters aren’t just mascots; they’re the heart of the movement, turning market dips into opportunities and fostering unity among investors. To illustrate the potential, consider this: an investment of $4,500 in Stage 13 at $0.000142 per BTFD Coin could yield 31,690,140 tokens. If the price climbs to $0.0006 by the presale’s end, that initial investment could soar to $19,014. This isn’t just a projection; it’s a testament to the explosive possibilities within the BTFD ecosystem. Ready to Join the Rare Bulls Squad? Here’s How: Set Up Your Wallet : Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet to secure your BTFD tokens. Fund Your Wallet : Load it with BNB or ETH for purchasing. Connect Your Wallet : Head to the presale site and choose your currency. Buy BTFD : Complete the transaction and prepare for rewards. Claim Your Tokens : Post-presale, claim your BTFD and start staking. Stay Connected : Monitor staking rewards and game earnings. Just a Chill Guy (CHILLGUY): The Icon of Laid-Back Investing In the meme coin universe, CHILLGUY has carved out a niche as the ultimate chill vibe. Designed for those who prefer a laid-back approach to crypto, this token embodies fun and financial freedom in equal measure. Its engaging branding—complete with a casual mascot that screams “no stress”—has earned it a loyal following among crypto enthusiasts. CHILLGUY thrives on its community-driven ethos. Whether it’s through its interactive social media campaigns or creative NFT drops, it keeps its audience entertained while building long-term value. Investors often point to its simplicity and transparency as key factors in its sustained appeal. What sets CHILLGUY apart is its emphasis on meme culture. By leveraging humor and relatability, it connects with younger investors who value not just returns but also the journey. CHILLGUY has shown that even in a saturated market, a coin with a clear personality can hold its ground. It’s no wonder this token is a favorite for those dipping their toes into alternative investments. SPX6900 (SPX): Where Meme Meets Innovation SPX6900 brings a tech-savvy twist to the meme coin frenzy. Known for its edgy branding and cutting-edge features, SPX appeals to a more tech-oriented audience. Whether it’s through advanced DeFi integrations or experimental use cases, SPX is the coin for those who want their memes with a side of innovation. Community engagement remains a cornerstone for SPX. From gamified staking rewards to DAO-driven decision-making, the project ensures that its holders feel heard and valued. This participatory approach has helped SPX maintain a strong market position even as competition heats up. What really sets SPX apart is its ability to evolve. While other meme coins rely solely on branding, SPX continuously adds utility, ensuring it remains relevant. For investors seeking a balance between meme culture and forward-thinking features, SPX is a compelling option Why BTFD Coin Stands Out While CHILLGUY and SPX6900 each have their strengths, BTFD Coin offers a unique blend of utility, community, and growth potential. Its P2E game and staking rewards are already making waves, and the Bulls Squad’s enthusiasm is infectious. With over $5.1 million raised and the presale price set to climb, now’s the time to join the movement. Based on market trends and the success of its presale, BTFD is positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins for exponential returns. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, this coin promises a thrilling ride with substantial rewards. So why wait? Join the BTFD presale today and become part of the Bulls Squad. Conclusion It’s clear: BTFD Coin, CHILLGUY, and SPX6900 each bring something unique to the table. But when it comes to exponential growth potential, BTFD’s Bulls Squad is in the spotlight. With its presale thriving and innovative features like staking and P2E gaming, this token is setting the stage for a groundbreaking bull run. Don’t miss out on what could be the opportunity of a lifetime. Join the BTFD Coin presale before it ends, and let’s turn dips into gains together. Because in the world of crypto, the best time to act is always now.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 03:20:00

ETH is struggling and might continue to move down if it stays below $3,320. Ethereum started a minor recovery wave from the $3,160 zone. The price is trading below $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could struggle to start a fresh increase above the $3,320 resistance level. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price started a short-term recovery wave from the $3,160 level, like Bitcoin . ETH was able to recover above the $3,200 and $3,220 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,743 swing high to the $3,160 low. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,250 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bears are active below the $3,320 and $3,350 levels. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,300 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,320 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,450 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,743 swing high to the $3,160 low. A clear move above the $3,450 resistance might send the price toward the $3,500 resistance. An upside break above the $3,520 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,650 resistance zone or even $3,720 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,320 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,250 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,220. A clear move below the $3,220 support might push the price toward the $3,160 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/over-8-trillion-shib-left-this-top-exchange-heres-what-happened/,"Over 8,000,000,000,000 Shiba Inu tokens have been withdrawn from the Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com. According to data from Whale Alert, the tokens were transferred to unidentified wallets in multiple transactions, raising questions about the motivations behind these large-scale movements. Such activity often signals strategic accumulation, potentially indicating a bullish outlook for the token. The movement of SHIB tokens was divided into multiple transactions, with one notable transfer involving 1,636,940,000,000 tokens valued at approximately $39 million. The remaining transactions, though smaller, followed similar patterns, with each successive transfer slightly declining in quantity. The decision to funnel these tokens out of a prominent exchange to anonymous wallets has drawn attention within the cryptocurrency community. Historically, significant outflows from centralized exchanges often suggest accumulation, as investors secure their holdings in private wallets. This can be interpreted as a vote of confidence in the asset’s potential. Growing Appeal Among Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whales This movement from Crypto.com is part of a broader trend of heightened whale activity surrounding Shiba Inu. Other major exchanges, including Binance, have also recorded significant high-volume transactions involving the asset. The token’s growing popularity is evident in its consistent ranking as the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which currently stands at $12.89 billion. Such large-scale transactions align with the ongoing volatility that characterizes the cryptocurrency market. Despite its meme coin origins, Shiba Inu has carved out a prominent position, supported by increasing trading volumes and a growing ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shiba Inu (SHIB) Market Outlook The token’s recent rally and the notable whale activity suggest optimism about its long-term potential. Analysts point to ecosystem developments and the token’s growing use cases as factors that could drive future price surges. While short-term fluctuations remain a characteristic of meme coins, Shiba Inu’s expanding adoption and market activity highlight its resilience. The withdrawal of over 8 trillion SHIB tokens from Crypto.com to private wallets underscores the significant interest the token continues to attract among high-value investors. As the asset gains traction in the market, its community and ecosystem development could further solidify its position as a major player in the cryptocurrency space. With whale activity on the rise and market confidence building, the asset remains a token to watch in the coming months.

If the low of the correction is in place, the price could move higher, eventually leading to another corrective phase before advancing further. This analysis will cover the current uptrend and the ongoing pattern that could shape the price movement in the near future. Triangle Pattern in the Correction Phase The current price structure suggests a triangle pattern is unfolding in the context of a corrective phase, which began around December 3rd. While triangle patterns are not always the most common corrective structures, they do occasionally appear, especially in wave four corrections. XRP has shown a recurring tendency to form triangle patterns in its price action. There have been several instances of bullish breakouts following triangle formations throughout November and early December. This pattern suggests that XRP might be in the midst of another triangle formation. Current Consolidation and Breakout Analysis XRP is currently consolidating above the breakout point from December 1st, hinting ongoing market strength. Ideally, holding above this level would suggest the uptrend is still intact. The price has formed a series of lower highs and higher lows, which fits the structure of a triangle pattern. Each part of this pattern is corrective, showing a series of three-wave movements. Key Levels to Watch If the price drops below $2.41, it may signal a possible reversal and the formation of a top. This level represents the 50% retracement of the recent rally, so it’s a crucial point to watch. On the upside, the next resistance is at $2.72, the B-wave high. A breakout above this level could lead to a test of the December high around $2.90, with the all-time high of $3.30 potentially in reach if bullish momentum picks up.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 03:57:49

A potential game-changer is expected with the anticipated approval of a US-based spot Solana ETF by the end of January. On the other hand, CoinStats has joined forces with SPACE ID to simplify portfolio management, while expanding the Web3 ecosystem. Among these advancements, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is attracting investor interest due to its remarkable presale performance. The platform has raised over $600,000 and early investors are already seeing a staggering 6430% ROI. Positioned as a rising star in the Web3 space, Web3Bay is drawing attention as a platform with high earning potential, especially for those looking to sell digital assets with ease. Solana Update: ETF Approval Could Drive 2025 Growth The crypto market anticipates a major milestone with the potential approval of the Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by late January 2025. This timing coincides with significant political events in the U.S., adding to the anticipation for Solana’s role in the financial space. A US-based Solana ETF could offer more accessibility to traditional investors, increasing demand and supporting growth. Analysts suggest that retail participation will play a key role, as Solana’s perceived affordability makes it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolios. However, it’s not without challenges. Solana recently dropped below the $200 mark, reflecting a weekly decline of over 7%. While short-term price corrections may cause concern, experts believe the long-term outlook remains positive. Web3 Ecosystem Expands: SPACE ID & CoinStats Partner Up The Web3 ecosystem is seeing a major advancement as SPACE ID partners with CoinStats to simplify portfolio management. CoinStats allows its users to track and manage their assets seamlessly using simple handles like “jane.bnb” instead of long wallet addresses. The adoption of domain names on CoinStats has grown rapidly, with connected wallets surging from 450 in October 2024 to 4,600 by December—a staggering 922% increase. Despite its success, some users might find challenges in transitioning to domain-based tracking, especially if they manage multiple wallets across diverse blockchains. Nonetheless, the SPACE ID collaboration marks a pivotal moment in making the Web3 ecosystem more accessible and user-friendly for both experienced traders and newcomers. $600K Raised, 6340% ROI: Could Web3Bay Make Investors Rich? Web3Bay (3BAY) is reshaping the e-commerce world by introducing a decentralized platform for buying and selling digital assets. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures secure and transparent transactions, eliminating the need for centralized control. Its technical foundation is built on a combination of blockchain layers, smart contracts, and decentralized protocols, creating a secure and scalable environment. This architecture is designed to handle high transaction volumes seamlessly, without compromising speed or user experience, making it a reliable choice to buy and sell digital assets. Web3Bay is going viral in the crypto market for its potential and revolutionary idea that transforms online shopping forever. Its presale has already raised over $600,000 in only 3 stages and sold over 170 million 3BAY tokens, highlighting the platform’s strong potential. Early investors from stage 1 are set to enjoy an impressive 6340% return on investment (ROI) when the 3BAY token launches. This showcases the high-earning opportunities that Web3Bay offers investors. With tokens currently priced at just $0.0039675, it remains one of the most affordable cryptocurrencies for those aiming to diversify their portfolios or enter the digital asset market. Opportunities like this don’t last long. Web3Bay’s momentum in its presale stages reflects growing demand, and as the token progresses through future rounds, prices are expected to increase. For anyone seeking to buy and sell digital assets or invest in a platform set for long-term growth, the time to act is now. A Quick Recap The Web3 ecosystem is undergoing a transformative phase, characterized by groundbreaking partnerships such as those between CoinStats and SPACE ID, and the recent Solana update announcing the launch of their ETFs. While the recent news from Solana and CoinStats is noteworthy, the spotlight shines brightest on Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s presale success, with over $600,000 raised and a remarkable 6340% ROI expected for early investors, sets it apart. With tokens priced at just $0.0039675, the current presale stage presents an unparalleled entry point for investors seeking substantial returns. As demand continues to rise and future rounds push token prices higher, Web3Bay stands ready to deliver significant value to its community.

Bitcoin Price Path to $120K Amid Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policies The crypto market is excited as the Bitcoin price sentiments point to a potential $120,000 rally, fueled by optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency. With the Bitcoin price dropping to the $93,000 mark, call options for the $120K strike on Deribit have surged to $1.52 billion in open interest, reflecting a market brimming with bullish sentiment. Analysts point to Trump’s anticipated pro-crypto policies as a catalyst for this momentum, with traders betting on a transformative period for digital assets. Technically, the Bitcoin price mirrors a Wyckoff accumulation pattern, signaling the potential for a bullish breakout. Holding key support at $90,800 and breaking through immediate resistance at $102,760 is crucial for sustaining this uptrend. However, risks remain, as a failure to hold these levels could lead to significant corrections. As inauguration day approaches, the stakes are high. The Bitcoin price movement will undoubtedly play a pivotal role in shaping market sentiment and future trajectories. Why PropiChain (PCHAIN) Is Set to Make an Early Bull Run Despite the bullish Bitcoin price predictions, the AI altcoin market has started to surge earlier than expected. The growing adoption of AI altcoins has significantly triggered a buying spree of the PropiChain (PCHAIN) altcoin, which is currently on presale at $0.011. Using AI, NFTs, and the blockchain network, PCHAIN aims to improve the real estate market. Looking to improve the $300 trillion real estate market, PropiChain uses NFT tokenization to transform physical properties into digital assets, allowing seamless buying, selling, and transferring without the complexities of traditional processes. Enabling fractional ownership lowers the entry barrier for investors, allowing them to purchase parts of high-value properties and trade their shares on a secure blockchain. This mechanism diversifies portfolios and brings liquidity to an otherwise illiquid market. The integration of artificial intelligence takes PropiChain’s innovation further. AI algorithms offer predictive market insights, automated valuation models (AVMs), and transaction execution. Investors can leverage these tools for real-time property analysis, automate transactions based on market conditions, and mitigate risks with data-backed decisions. This advanced AI-driven approach ensures users maximize opportunities while reducing human errors. Moreover, with the smart contracts , audited by BlockAudit, PCHAIN automates lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, eliminating intermediaries and providing a frictionless experience for users. PropiChain’s global accessibility breaks down barriers for institutional and individual investors alike. The platform eliminates traditional real estate’s hefty capital requirements and geographic limitations with its unique Propiverse feature. Users can virtually explore properties from anywhere through its Metaverse integration, enhancing decision-making through immersive 3D property tours. Security and transparency are pillars of PropiChain. Its decentralized ledger, “Title Contract,” ensures all transactions are tamper-proof and verifiable, mitigating fraud risks. The PCHAIN AI altcoin powers this ecosystem, offering holders access to the platform’s premium features, including legal and compliance tools, AI insights, and NFT capabilities. The altcoin’s ability to act as collateral for DeFi liquidity further amplifies its utility, enabling investors to access value without selling assets. The Lucrative PropiChain (PCHAIN) Presale Amidst the bullish Bitcoin price developments, the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI altcoin presale presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the real estate markets. In the presale phase, PCHAIN tokens are attractively priced, each priced at $0.011 with an anticipated ROI of over 800% when the token lists at the anticipated $0.032. Investing in the PropiChain (PCHAIN) AI crypto has some perks, such as AI analytics and market recommendations, staking rewards for unmatched APYs of up to 225,% and frequent airdrops. Investors participating in the presale benefit from favorable entry prices and contribute to developing the next big real estate innovation. The PCHAIN presale is gaining momentum rapidly, raising nearly $3 million. Bullish sentiment on CoinMarketCap indicates an imminent listing, expected to push the PCHAIN AI altcoin beyond the $1 mark post-presale. This creates a compelling opportunity for early investment before the next presale stage begins.

The Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) of Singapore has flagged Polymarket as an “illegal gambling site” operated by an unlicensed provider. Users in Singapore now face a warning message when attempting to access the platform, which has been particularly scrutinised for its handling of US election-related betting. Reports of the block began circulating on Sunday evening, with Alex Zuo, vice president of investments and custody for Cobo, sharing a screenshot of an official notice. The notice cites Section 20 of Singapore’s Gambling Control Act 2022, warning users that engaging with unlicensed gambling services could result in fines or imprisonment. While the GRA has not issued an official statement, the platform remains inaccessible to Singaporean users at the time of writing. In Singapore, users are required to use Singapore Pools, the state-owned lottery subsidiary, for legal online gambling. This new restriction comes as part of a broader crackdown on unlicensed online gambling, which has seen the shutdown of over 3,800 websites and the blocking of $37 million in transactions as of the end of 2024. Polymarket’s troubles across the globe Polymarket has encountered regulatory challenges not only in Singapore but also in several other countries, including France and the United States. In France, the National Gaming Authority (ANJ) initiated an investigation into Polymarket’s operations after a French user placed large bets on the 2024 US presidential election. French laws are stringent when it comes to online gambling, allowing only certain activities like sports betting and poker. As a result, the investigation centers around potential violations of these regulations. In the US, Polymarket has faced even more intense scrutiny. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a subpoena to Coinbase, requesting information about user interactions with Polymarket. This follows a previous $1.4 million fine imposed on Polymarket for allegedly offering unregistered prediction markets. As part of the settlement, Polymarket agreed to cease operations for US users. Despite this settlement, the US Department of Justice has launched its own investigation into the platform, with allegations that Polymarket may have continued to accept trades from US users in violation of the agreement. Additionally, the FBI has conducted a search of devices owned by CEO Shayne Coplan as part of this ongoing investigation. Despite the regulatory challenges, Polymarket’s user base continues to grow, with the platform recording over 300,00 monthly active users in December 2024. This growth comes amid its increasingly complicated regulatory environment, including a high-profile FBI raid and an ongoing subpoena issued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Polymarket’s fresh controversy Polymarket has come under fresh controversy for allowing users to place bets on the outcome of the deadly Los Angeles wildfires . One of the markets on the platform focused on how many acres the Palisades fire would burn by a specific deadline, drawing significant attention. The market had already accumulated more than $270,000 in trading volume after launching last week. Bettors were heavily focused on a more than 90% probability that the fire would burn between 20,000 and 25,000 acres.

The approval of spot XRP and Solana ETFs could be one of the first signs of this new era, leading to more relaxed regulatory environments for digital assets and even further mainstream adoption. The market is on the brink of what could be a defining year for crypto, with ETF approvals setting the stage for major price movements and institutional participation. XRP, in particular, stands to benefit from these developments, making it one of the most exciting assets to watch in the coming months.

He wrote, “Much of this is based on what I expect will be a markedly different approach to crypto by the Trump administration than what we witnessed under the Biden administration.” Nate opened up about the possibility of both Solana and XRP spot ETFs gaining approval. For XRP, this could mean significant capital influx, especially with favorable changes in SEC leadership and crypto legislation. As the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins steps into the role of SEC Chair and David Sacks takes on the role of “crypto czar,” the regulatory environment for crypto could shift dramatically, opening the door for new ETF products. Institutional Capital and Market Surge: What XRP ETFs Could Mean The idea of a spot XRP ETF is not just speculative. Spot ETF applications for XRP are already on the table, and the possible approval could bring a wave of institutional capital into the market, further legitimizing XRP as a mainstream digital asset. If approved, XRP ETFs could lead to massive price surges, as institutional investors flock to this increasingly recognized asset.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 04:16:03

Data reveals that on January 7, 2025, SHIB recorded one of the highest daily inflows from large holders, a notable occurrence despite the asset’s recent price struggles. The crypto market has entered a bearish phase, leading to widespread price drops among digital assets. Shiba Inu was not spared, experiencing a sharp decline of 9.38% on January 7, its largest daily loss since mid-December 2024. This decline is part of a broader trend that has seen cryptocurrencies struggling to maintain bullish momentum. Record-High SHIB Large Holders Inflows Despite the market downturn, on-chain data highlighted a striking development for Shiba Inu . On January 7, large holders’ netflow reached an astounding 33.59 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at $739 million based on current prices. This figure accounts for approximately 5.7% of SHIB’s total circulating supply, underscoring the significance of the movement. In perspective, large holder inflows for SHIB have averaged around 600 billion tokens daily in recent months. While occasional spikes have occurred, they typically remained below the 30 trillion mark throughout 2024. The last time the asset recorded inflows above this level was in July 2021 when the token was relatively new and large transactions were more common due to its lower price. Understanding the Recent Spike The substantial inflow of 33.59 trillion SHIB tokens has raised speculation about potential whale accumulation among market participants. However, data indicates that this surge was primarily due to internal fund movements by the crypto exchange Crypto.com. Crypto.com transferred over 32 trillion SHIB tokens across 20 transactions to a single, unidentified wallet. This internal activity accounted for the inflow spike, rather than external buying or significant market-driven accumulation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Reaction and Liquidations The recent inflow coincided with a broader market slump that saw Bitcoin’s price drop to $94,000, leading to liquidations totaling $627 million within 24 hours. Shiba Inu accounted for $1.57 million of these liquidations, with the majority ($1.39 million) resulting from long positions. Shiba Inu’s price remains under pressure following the downturn, trading at $0.00002127, reflecting a further 2.25% decline over the past 24 hours. The continued bearish trend highlights SHIB’s challenges in regaining upward momentum. The record-breaking inflow of large holder activity for Shiba Inu is noteworthy but does not reflect significant market buying or whale accumulation. Instead, it underscores the influence of internal exchange transactions on on-chain metrics. As the broader crypto market navigates its current retracement phase, the token faces the dual challenge of market pressure and investor caution.

The prediction follows the approval and launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) in 2024, which triggered significant demand from institutional and retail investors. This new accessibility has streamlined Bitcoin allocations, drawing pensions and endowments into the fold and signaling a broader institutional acceptance of the digital asset as outlined by the asset manager. Bhutan, El Salvador: A Playbook for Nation-State Bitcoin Success? Historically, nations like the US and China have held Bitcoin, but much of this exposure stems from government seizures linked to illicit activities rather than intentional, strategic investment. Fidelity believes this trend is poised to change. The report highlighted the successes of Bhutan and El Salvador, whose proactive Bitcoin strategies have delivered substantial returns. In light of challenges such as rampant inflation, currency debasement, and fiscal deficits, governments may increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability, with the potential costs of inaction outweighing those of adoption. “We expect 2025 to be the year this changes for both acceptance and adoption.” The calls for the US to lead this shift under a potentially Bitcoin-friendly administration have gained significant traction. For instance, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich recently said that Japan and other Asian nations would be sure to follow if President-elect Donald Trump established a US Bitcoin reserve. Both Trump and Senator Cynthia Lummis have expressed interest in establishing a Bitcoin reserve. Lummis, a longtime proponent of cryptocurrency, introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024, aimed at creating a regulatory framework for Bitcoin’s integration into the US treasury strategy. Should such measures be enacted, Fidelity said that it anticipates the geopolitical and economic pressures to drive other nations to follow suit, though likely under the radar to avoid market disruptions. Hurdles Ahead? Despite these optimistic projections, the report touches on the inherent uncertainty in government action and policy formation. While rhetoric from incoming US officials suggests a favorable outlook for digital assets, competing legislative priorities could delay meaningful progress.

SOL price is now below $192 and showing a few bearish signs. SOL price started a fresh decline after it failed to stay above $200 against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $192 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $190 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if the bulls clear the $192 zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price struggled to clear the $200-$205 zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $200 and $192 support levels. The price even dipped below the $185 support. A low was formed at $182.20, and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $182 low. Solana is now trading below $192 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $190 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $190 level. The next major resistance is near the $192 level. The main resistance could be $200 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $223 swing high to the $182 low. A successful close above the $200 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $212. Any more gains might send the price toward the $225 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $192 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $182 level. The first major support is near the $180 level. A break below the $180 level might send the price toward the $175 zone.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 04:50:00

Her insights focused on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP, sparking discussions within the crypto community. My 2025 crypto predictions: Bitcoin: $200,000 ETH: $7,000 SOL: $550 XRP: $4 Am I being too conservative? — Layah Heilpern (@LayahHeilpern) January 4, 2025 XRP Price Prediction for 2025 Heilpern said XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, could reach $4 in 2025. This projection represents a 69% increase from the token’s current price of $2.36. While the proposed growth rate appears moderate compared to historical bull market gains, it is noteworthy given the recent stagnation in the asset’s price movement. Over the past month, the token has struggled to maintain consistent upward momentum, encountering multiple price fluctuations. However, the recent performance offers a glimpse of its potential. For instance, the token initially recorded a 10% increase in the last week alone, suggesting that a surge to $4 within the year is achievable under favorable market conditions. Bitcoin and Ethereum Projections Additionally, Heilpern provided bold forecasts for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2025. She envisions Bitcoin reaching a price of $200,000, representing a 112% increase from its current trading value of $94,500. Similarly, Ethereum is projected to hit $7,000, reflecting a 118% growth from its present level. These predictions indicate a significant bullish outlook for the broader cryptocurrency market, with BTC and ETH expected to rise substantially. Comparative Analysis While Heilpern’s prediction for XRP suggests a more conservative price movement compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, historical data highlights XRP’s ability to outperform these assets during major market rallies. Recent trends support this view, as the token has outpaced BTC and ETH in weekly performance. Furthermore, the digital asset has shown remarkable growth over the past two months, achieving a 336% increase, which far exceeds the performance of both Bitcoin and Ethereum during the same timeframe. These figures suggest that the asset has the potential to surpass Heilpern’s $4 target, particularly if broader market conditions become highly favorable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Heilpern predicts XRP could reach $4 in 2025, some analysts argue this figure may underestimate the token’s potential. According to more optimistic forecasts, in scenarios where Bitcoin climbs to $200,000 and achieves a market cap of $4 trillion, XRP’s price could rise beyond double digits. Such projections are supported by the token’s historical performance in prior bull runs, where it has consistently demonstrated significant growth. As market dynamics evolve, some commentators maintain that the $4-$5 range may represent a short-term target rather than a peak price for 2025. In addition to her predictions for XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, Heilpern also shared her expectations for Solana (SOL). She believes the asset could reach $550 in 2025, representing a 153% increase from its current value of $197.75. Layah Heilpern’s forecasts offer valuable insights into potential market trends for 2025. While her predictions for the token remain conservative compared to other analysts, they highlight the asset’s resilience and capacity for growth in a competitive market.

38876805,https://coinpaper.com/6875/michael-saylor-shares-bitcoin-tracker-for-the-tenth-week-in-a-row,1736746200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Michael Saylor Shares Bitcoin Tracker for the Tenth Week in a Row,https://coinpaper.com/6875/michael-saylor-shares-bitcoin-tracker-for-the-tenth-week-in-a-row,"Major corporations are increasingly finding themselves at the center of debates over Bitcoin adoption as a treasury asset, fueled by shareholder proposals and bold strategies from key players. At Meta, a recent shareholder proposal advocates allocating a portion of its $72 billion cash reserves to Bitcoin, citing concerns over inflation and currency debasement. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy continues its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, despite mixed reactions from the financial community. MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy: A Double-Edged Sword for the Future of Corporate Treasury Management MicroStrategy's co-founder Michael Saylor continues to make waves in the cryptocurrency market as the company steadfastly pursues its Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury strategy. On Jan. 12, Saylor posted the company’s now-familiar Bitcoin tracker chart for the 10th consecutive week. Typically shared on Sundays, the chart often hints at impending Bitcoin purchases—a signal eagerly watched by cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors alike. As of the most recent update, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings stand at 447,470 BTC, valued at approximately $42.4 billion. This follows the company’s acquisition of 1,070 BTC on Jan. 6. MicroStrategy's stock, however, paints a more volatile picture. Shares of the company are down approximately 40% from their all-time high of $543 per share, reached on Nov. 21, mirroring a broader downturn in cryptocurrency markets. Despite the decline, Saylor remains unyielding in his strategy, urging corporations to consider Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. His approach has sparked intense debate across the crypto community. For some, MicroStrategy represents a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s long-term success. For others, Saylor’s heavy reliance on debt financing to fund Bitcoin acquisitions raises sustainability concerns, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s notorious price volatility. David Krause, emeritus professor of finance at Marquette University, has been one of the most vocal critics of MicroStrategy’s bold strategy. Krause recently said that a sudden and sharp drop in Bitcoin’s price could have catastrophic consequences for MicroStrategy. The potential erosion of shareholder equity and a scenario of bankruptcy liquidation, while extreme, are not beyond the realm of possibility, he warned. Bitcoin’s historic volatility amplifies these risks. For example, Bitcoin’s price has seen swings of over 10% within a single day in the past, often due to regulatory news or macroeconomic factors. Such fluctuations could heavily impact MicroStrategy’s stock value, given its reliance on Bitcoin as a primary corporate asset. Despite the criticism, Saylor remains undeterred and has doubled down on his Bitcoin strategy. In October 2024, he unveiled the company’s ambitious ”21/21 plan.” This strategy aims to secure $21 billion through equity offerings and an additional $21 billion through fixed-income securities, totaling $42 billion earmarked exclusively for Bitcoin purchases. On Jan. 3, MicroStrategy further announced plans for a potential $2 billion preferred stock offering, contingent on favorable market conditions in the first quarter of 2025. Proceeds from the stock offering are intended not only to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions but also to fortify the company’s balance sheet, aligning with the 21/21 plan’s overarching goals. While the 21/21 plan has drawn interest, it also shows MicroStrategy’s dependence on both equity and debt markets for liquidity. Analysts have noted that this approach leaves little margin for error, particularly if Bitcoin’s price trajectory does not meet the company’s optimistic projections. A Test Case for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy is more than just a bold gamble; it represents a potential paradigm shift in corporate treasury management. By tying its fortunes so closely to Bitcoin, MicroStrategy has effectively become a proxy for the cryptocurrency’s performance. This dynamic has made the company a focal point for debates about Bitcoin adoption by corporations. While critics like Krause emphasize the risks, others view Saylor’s approach as visionary. In his view, Bitcoin’s finite supply and decentralized nature make it a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional assets like cash or bonds. Saylor has even extended his evangelism beyond MicroStrategy, advocating for Bitcoin adoption among major corporations, including tech giant Microsoft. As MicroStrategy forges ahead with its Bitcoin strategy, its journey will be closely watched by proponents and detractors alike. The company’s ability to navigate Bitcoin’s volatility, manage its debt obligations, and deliver shareholder value will determine whether it emerges as a trailblazer or cautionary tale in the annals of corporate treasury history. For now, Michael Saylor’s unyielding faith in Bitcoin underscores the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies, even as it raises questions about the risks of over-concentration in a single asset. Whether this gamble pays off or backfires remains a story in progress, with implications not just for MicroStrategy, but for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Meta Faces Shareholder Push for Bitcoin Adoption Amid Inflation Concerns A Meta shareholder has also stirred debate with a proposal advocating that the social media giant diversify its $72 billion in cash and short-term cash equivalents by allocating a portion to Bitcoin. Ethan Peck, the shareholder behind the proposal, argued that Bitcoin offers a hedge against currency debasement and inflation, citing its remarkable performance compared to traditional assets over the past five years. Peck’s proposal, submitted on behalf of his family’s shares, highlights the erosion of Meta’s cash holdings due to inflation. He claims that the company is losing 28% of its cash assets over time, a trend that could be mitigated through Bitcoin investment. Supporting his case, Peck pointed out that Bitcoin has outperformed bonds by an impressive 1,262% in the last five years. In his proposal, Peck drew attention to Meta's symbolic relationship with Bitcoin, referencing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s goats named “Bitcoin” and “Max” as well as Meta board member Marc Andreessen’s known support for Bitcoin. Andreessen, a prominent venture capitalist, also serves as a director at Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. “Do Meta shareholders not deserve the same kind of responsible asset allocation for the company that Meta directors and executives likely implement for themselves?” Peck questioned. Peck is an employee of The National Center for Public Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank advocating for free-market policies. The organization has also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon. The push for Bitcoin adoption as a corporate treasury asset is not new, and proponents like Peck face significant resistance from large corporations. Microsoft shareholders rejected a similar proposal in December 2024, which recommended the tech giant allocate at least 1% of its $484 billion in assets to Bitcoin . Amazon shareholders are next in line to consider such a strategy at their April 2025 meeting, following a proposal submitted by The National Center for Public Policy Research. The organization has been vocal about its criticism of traditional inflation metrics, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), arguing that they underestimate the real impact of inflation. The proposal suggested that Bitcoin could serve as a safeguard against a ”true inflation rate” that is double the CPI. Big Tech’s Cautious Stance on Bitcoin Despite these advocacy efforts, Big Tech companies remain cautious about adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Industry experts attribute this hesitancy to several factors. Nick Cowan, CEO of fintech firm Valereum, explained that the size and financial strength of companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon make them less inclined to take on the risks associated with Bitcoin. These firms already operate as leaders in highly profitable sectors and do not feel pressured to adopt a volatile asset like Bitcoin. “Bitcoin’s high volatility and lack of native yield-bearing opportunities also prevent tech firms from allocating 5% or more of their assets to BTC,” Cowan noted. Bitcoin's reputation for volatility is a major deterrent. While the cryptocurrency has demonstrated astronomical returns in the long term, it has also experienced dramatic short-term price swings. Such volatility could introduce unnecessary risk to companies with large cash reserves, particularly those seeking predictable financial stability. Peck’s proposal at Meta, though unlikely to pass, is part of a growing conversation around the role of Bitcoin in corporate treasury management. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already embraced Bitcoin, but their approaches have been polarizing. Critics warn of the risks posed by Bitcoin’s volatility, while proponents argue that it represents a hedge against inflation and a store of value superior to fiat currencies or bonds. If Meta were to adopt Bitcoin, it would signal a seismic shift in corporate attitudes toward cryptocurrency, potentially setting a precedent for other Big Tech firms. However, such a move would require addressing key concerns, including Bitcoin’s volatility and the lack of regulatory clarity in many jurisdictions. Meta shareholders will likely vote on the proposal in the coming months, but its success remains uncertain. As with Microsoft and Amazon, the proposal faces an uphill battle in convincing stakeholders of Bitcoin’s viability as a treasury asset. Even if rejected, the proposal signals a growing demand for innovation in corporate asset allocation strategies, particularly in an era of rising inflation and currency debasement concerns. Whether Meta chooses to embrace Bitcoin or not, the debate around cryptocurrency adoption by major corporations is far from over. For now, the spotlight remains on shareholder advocacy groups like The National Center for Public Policy Research, which continue to challenge traditional treasury strategies and push the boundaries of corporate financial management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-13 05:30:00

Why It’s Big deal,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-american-bankers-association-membership-why-its-big-deal/,"Ripple’s recent elevation to platinum membership in the American Bankers Association (ABA) is a significant development in the company’s strategy to integrate with traditional banking systems. As noted by crypto advocate Max Avery, this move highlights Ripple’s intent to position its payment solutions, XRP, and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as foundational technologies for future banking operations in the United States. Let's talk about Ripple's American Banker's Association membership. It's no surprise that they want to position Ripple payments, #XRP & the #XRPLedger for more bank partnerships. 1/8 — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) January 10, 2025 The Role of the ABA in the Banking Industry The ABA serves as the collective voice of America’s banking sector, representing over 4,000 banks. Its members collectively safeguard $18 trillion in deposits, extend nearly $11 trillion in loans, and employ over two million individuals. Ripple’s platinum membership status signifies its inclusion in this influential network, granting the company direct access to key decision-makers and the opportunity to influence the future of banking technology. Ripple’s Strategy and Market Positioning Ripple has long been recognized for its focus on providing efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable cross-border payment solutions. By aligning itself with the ABA, Ripple gains a platform to promote its technologies, including XRP and the XRPL, as solutions to some of the banking industry’s most pressing challenges. The company’s branding as “a green digital asset for a world without economic borders” aligns well with the growing demand for sustainable financial solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This membership status also allows Ripple to work more closely with ABA member banks, which collectively represent over 95% of the U.S. banking industry’s $13.5 trillion in assets. With the average ABA member bank holding $250 million in assets, Ripple’s engagement with this group could pave the way for widespread adoption of its technology within the U.S. financial system. Implications of Regulatory Clarity A major obstacle to Ripple’s expansion in the United States has been the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding XRP. The conclusion of the SEC’s legal case against Ripple is expected to address these uncertainties, creating an environment in which U.S. banks can explore XRP and XRPL integration without fear of legal repercussions. Max Avery and other industry observers anticipate that this clarity will lead to public announcements of partnerships that have likely been in development but withheld due to regulatory ambiguity. As Max Avery points out, Ripple’s inclusion in the ABA signals that the company is now part of the banking industry’s “inner circle.” This strategic positioning, combined with the anticipated resolution of regulatory issues, could open the floodgates for utility-driven crypto adoption across the U.S. banking system.

They predict key benchmarks could rise by around 20% by the end of the year. A recent Bloomberg report said that the team led by Kinger Lau is still bullish on mainland and offshore Chinese shares, including a positive risk reward. In a Sunday note, they added, “The sentiment and liquidity backdrop may begin to improve in late 1Q 25 on better tariff and policy clarity.” Yet this confidence comes notwithstanding November’s bullish call, which is now out of step with markets. Goldman Sachs recommends stocks tied to government spending, exports, and tech Goldman Sachs recommendation is to buy stocks tied to government spending, exporters that benefit from a weaker yuan, and selected tech and infrastructure firms. They consider shareholder returns “should continue to prevail on record-breaking cash distribution and falling domestic rates.” Furthermore, the strategists prefer online retail, media, and healthcare stocks and have also upgraded consumer services shares to overweight. HSBC said Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong remain an attractive growth story, confident of policies to support mainland China and higher growth prospects. Goldman in November predicted Chinese stocks would gain 20% in 12 months as officials sought to quicken an economic slowdown. But since then, the MSCI China Index has dropped about 10% as worries about growth, declining producer prices, and new US tariffs have grown.

Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager, filed his ethics agreement and financial disclosures ahead of his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing. As reported by The New York Times, disclosure revealed assets worth over $700 million , including between $250,000 and $500,000 in Bitcoin ETF investments. Bessent, who previously worked for billionaire philanthropist George Soros, has pledged to sell his investments in various funds, trusts, and other holdings to ensure there are no conflicts if confirmed as Treasury Secretary. In addition to Bitcoin-related assets, Bessent disclosed other investments that could pose conflicts, such as a margin loan with Goldman Sachs and a stake in the conservative publisher All Seasons. To comply with ethics requirements, Bessent has committed to avoiding any financial interests that might interfere with his duties at the Treasury Department. Bessent’s latest hedge fund, Key Square Capital, was launched in 2016 with $4.5 billion in funds, including $2 billion from George Soros. However, it now manages much less money. Bessent’s previous fund, from the early 2000s, also had disappointing results. As Treasury Secretary, Bessent would be tasked with managing the federal debt while navigating Trump’s plans to extend expiring tax cuts and eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.

Its recent surge in development and increasing adoption has experts and investors speculating about what’s next. This asset has made incredible moves, from its innovative proof-of-stake model to game-changing updates like Hydra. Investors are increasingly drawn to Cardano's sustainable technology and its expanding use cases in decentralized finance. Yet, there is a catch! The crypto market is constantly evolving; emerging and innovative platforms like DTX Exchange could be a strong contender in 2025. This new altcoin offers users a streamlined access to numerous financial assets, allowing users to diversify their portfolios. This article shares details about ADA’s recent climb and DTX’s growing momentum. Cardano (ADA) Surges By Over 20+% as The Crypto Market Recovers Cardano has seen its value surge by over 20% in the past 7 days, fluctuating between $0.9 and $1.1 . This remarkable surge shows signs of recovery in the broader market trend. Experts and investors are excited about the ADA’s future prospects this year and hope to accumulate more tokens. However, technical indicators show mixed signals about the Cardano price. The Exponential Moving Average (EMA) suggests sell signals on short-term charts but remains bullish on weekly and monthly outlooks. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stays neutral, reflecting market uncertainty. Bullish sentiment within the Cardano community and high trading volumes hint at a potential rebound. Also, the project’s robust development team, innovative platform, and high utility could provide long-term recovery. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Revolutionary Trading Platform DTX Exchange has become one of the innovative players in the online trading industry, aiming for a multi-billion-dollar market. DTX could disrupt the crypto space with its hybrid trading platform that merges the strengths of centralized and decentralized exchanges. What makes this project different? In contrast to regular platforms, DTX Exchange promises to grant traders unparalleled access to several asset classes, from bonds and stocks to cryptos and tokenized ETFs. Besides this, the platform will also offer trading leverage as high as 1,000x, a bold move in luring both retail and institutional traders who want to magnify their opportunities. That being said, this project has gathered immense publicity, mostly through its presale event. Investors are racing to be early movers, considering how this token will likely open special privileges in their favor. Holders have the right to vote in governance and even share the revenues from the platform, collected from trading fees. That incentivizes your long-term participation in the game. The success of its ongoing presale speaks volumes about the enthusiasm surrounding this platform. Having raised over $11.3 million so far, millions of tokens have already been snapped up, showing the demand for a project that is about to change the face of online trading. As DTX continues to expand its reach and integrate advanced trading features, it's clear this platform aims to become a dominant force in the market. Final Thoughts From its groundbreaking scalability solutions to the continuously developing DeFi ecosystem, recent advances place Cardano (ADA) in a perfect position to continue competing for one of the top 10 cryptos. The constant focus on sustainability and real-world utility keeps both developers and investors interested and optimistic about its future. Since the crypto market is competitive, newer platforms, like DTX Exchange, offer unique value propositions that rival established players. Overall, DTX Exchange might be a top contender in the crypto market and offer traders a unique approach to trading.

I am not against cryptocurrencies,” he said. Dimon’s comments on Bitcoin, however, were less positive. He reiterated his skepticism, saying: “Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It’s predominantly used by human traffickers, money launderers, and ransomware.” Despite his criticisms, he acknowledged the right of individuals to buy and sell the cryptocurrency, saying: “I support you wanting to buy or sell Bitcoin.

SOL forecast: Can SOL price break past $500? Solana turned in a sensational run from 2023 to 2024. SOL price notably rose from below $10 in January 2023 to a new all-time high of $268 last November. And while talks circulate about SOL price potentially breaking $500 this year, on-chain statistics say otherwise. A good number of SOL traders have taken major profits, causing SOL price to plunge to the $180 to $200 range to start the year. SOL price trades at $186 as of press time, representing an excellent opportunity to buy SOL at a discount. Solana backers aren’t being unreasonable to believe SOL price can retest all-time highs and peak to approximately 3x if optimal bull conditions are met. Rollblock: Rising GambleFi giant looking to dominate in 2025 Whereas SOL backers are betting on a 3x at most, the new rising crypto Rollblock offers much more tantalizing pump potential, and we’re talking along the lines of a 100x. Currently in stage 9 of its presale, Rollblock has raised past $8.5 million, drawing 40,000 new investors to its ICO. The early traction Rollblock has gained is indicative of its potential to dominate the iGaming-adjacent GambleFi sector, which is worth hundreds of billions. Rollblock offers a world of slots, live dealer games, and sports/esports betting options, as well as staking/yield farming options and an enticing revenue share, 30% of the GambleFi protocol’s revenues paid out weekly. Additionally, Rollblock provides an 18% yearly staking reward to encourage long-term engagement. Rollblock combines innovation and practical application, making it an appealing alternative for investors looking for actual value. Rollblock’s unique value proposition as the premier GambleFi protocol on Ethereum puts it right at the cusp of parabolic growth. And with RBLK price still holding at just $0.045, prospective investors still have the opportunity to accumulate their stockpiles even before RBLK lists and skyrockets in value.

Rollblock’s microcap blue chip status, meanwhile, gives it all the legroom to go past a 100x run. While Solana offers meme coin and DeFi opportunities to generate passive income, Rollblock offers it natively by way of its weekly revenue share. Hold RBLK and earn, simple as that. Lastly, Solana has already pumped, buying now will be paying over the odds for something with lower upside for gains. Rollblock offers maximal ROIs at a low entry point. Easy choice here, Rollblock takes the cake. The final word Rollblock trumps Solana as far as potential gains in 2025 are concerned. Rollblock’s staking rewards, revenue share incentive, and GambleFi utility give it limitless upside to upstage Solana this year. It’s no surprise why SOL holders are rotating their profits into Rollblock, it could very well be their best trade of the year. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

Globally, Vietnamese authorities arrested four individuals for a crypto mining scam, and Kenya proposed a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets to protect its investors. Meanwhile, Mango Markets announced that it will be shutting down after an SEC settlement over unregistered securities offerings. Attorney General Acts to Recover Stolen Crypto New York Attorney General Letitia James took legal action to recover more than $2 million in cryptocurrency that was stolen from victims who were lured into fraudulent schemes under the guise of remote work opportunities. Scammers targeted New Yorkers with deceptive text messages, offering flexible, well-paying jobs that ultimately resulted in financial losses. The victims were tricked into creating crypto accounts, depositing funds, and reviewing products on counterfeit websites mimicking legitimate brands. They were instructed to maintain a crypto balance matching or exceeding the product costs and were assured that they were not actually buying the products. Instead, the money was allegedly used to “legitimize” the data for the reviews. They were also promised a return of their funds along with commissions, but the victims never received any compensation, and their money was stolen. Example of the messages sent by the scammers (Source: Office of the New York State Attorney General ) With assistance from the US Secret Service, the Attorney General's office froze the stolen cryptocurrency. Letitia James urged people to stay very vigilant against unsolicited messages offering work opportunities, and also called these scams ”cruel and unacceptable,” especially because they prey on people who are trying to support their families. This case happened after a warning was issued by the FBI in June of 2024 about an increase in work-from-home scams. The FBI pointed out tactics where scammers contacted victims via unsolicited messages, and offered simple tasks like rating restaurants or ”optimizing” services. These schemes also involved fraudulent demands for cryptocurrency payments under the pretense of unlocking additional work, with the funds going directly to the scammers. Wolf Capital Founder Admits to Investor Scam Travis Ford, the co-founder and head trader of the cryptocurrency investment firm Wolf Capital, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud after deceiving investors with false promises of extraordinary returns. According to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), Ford raised close to $9.4 million from around 2,800 investors between January and August of 2023 by claiming he could generate daily returns of 1-2%. This is equivalent to an annual return of about 547%. By using social media, Wolf Capital’s website, and online promotions, Ford portrayed himself as a very sophisticated investor to lure victims into the scheme. Instead of using the funds as promised, Ford misappropriated the money for his own personal financial benefit and that of his co-conspirators. As a result, this caused major financial losses to investors. Ford admitted to the DOJ that the returns he promised were impossible to achieve consistently. He now faces a maximum sentence of five years, although a sentencing date still has to be determined. As seen with the crypto work-from-home scam case as well as the Wolf Capital case, there has been a global crackdown on crypto-related fraud. On Jan. 5, Vietnamese police arrested four people that were involved in a crypto mining scam that defrauded more than 200 victims of 4 billion Vietnamese dong, or approximately $157,300. In the United States, police in Springfield, Massachusetts, also warned residents about a rise in crypto scams, particularly those involving Bitcoin ATMs, where victims are directed to transfer funds to scammers. Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that hackers and scammers stole over $3 billion through crypto-related activities in 2024, which was a 15% increase from the previous year. Mango Markets Shuts Down After SEC Settlement Meanwhile, Solana-based decentralized exchange Mango Markets recently announced its closure, and urged its users to close their positions. The decision was made after governance proposals to end borrowing and lending, which are set to take effect on Jan. 13, after unanimous community approval. The shutdown also happened after a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of unregistered securities offerings. In September of 2024, the SEC charged Mango DAO and the Blockworks Foundation, and claimed the sale of $70 million worth of MNGO governance tokens violated federal securities laws. Mango Labs was also accused of operating as an unregistered broker. As part of the settlement , Mango agreed to pay $700,000 in civil penalties, destroy MNGO tokens, and petition exchanges to delist them. The Mango DAO previously voted to settle with the SEC for $223,228 and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for $500,000. Mango Markets was launched in August of 2021 by Maximilian Schneider, Britt Cyr, and John Kramer, and its goal was to provide fast and cost-effective trading and lending services on the Solana blockchain. At its peak, the platform had $210 million in total value locked but this has since declined to $6 million, according to data from DefiLlama . Mango Markets’ troubles date back to October 2022, when trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg exploited a vulnerability in its protocol to drain over $100 million. While Eisenberg returned $67 million after a community governance vote, he kept $40 million. US authorities arrested him in December of 2022 on charges of fraud and market manipulation. Eisenberg is still in custody, and faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. His sentencing was recently postponed to April 2025 because of the complexity of the legal issues. Kenya Plans New Crypto Regulations In light of these recent shutdowns, Kenya is moving towards regulating crypto , signaling a shift from the more cautious stance that was previously taken by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). Treasury Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi announced it is very committed to establishing a legal and regulatory framework for virtual assets and service providers. This initiative is part of a new draft proposal that is titled “ National Policy on Virtual Assets and Virtual Asset Service Providers .” The goal of the draft is to create a fair, competitive, and stable market for cryptocurrencies in Kenya while addressing risks like money laundering, terrorism financing, and consumer protection. It proposes comprehensive legal standards and procedures to govern virtual asset activities and is open for public feedback until Jan. 24. If adopted, Kenya will join countries like South Africa and Nigeria in implementing crypto regulations. Kenya’s approach to cryptocurrencies evolved a lot since the CBK’s 2015 warning about risks like fraud and lack of legal protections. Cryptocurrencies are not banned in Kenya, but the CBK has historically advised against their use. A turning point came in September of 2023 when the country completed a risk assessment on money laundering and terrorism financing involving virtual assets. The assessment recommended regulation to mitigate these risks and boost the country’s anti-money laundering framework. (Source: Chainalysis ) Kenya stepped up as a major player in sub-Saharan Africa’s crypto adoption. According to Chainalysis , Kenya ranks 21st globally on the 2024 Crypto Adoption Index. Stablecoins account for almost half of the region’s transaction volume, driven by currency devaluation. Between July 2023 and July 2024, Kenya recorded $3.3 billion in stablecoin transactions, trailing regional leaders Nigeria with $21.8 billion, South Africa with $13.5 billion, and Ghana with $3.9 billion.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-13 06:09:34

Despite this, its dominance remains steady, consolidating just below 58% . Meanwhile, Prominent crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe hints that a massive altcoin season might be just around the corner. He draws a compelling parallel between the next two years to historic financial booms, he suggests altcoins could be gearing up for explosive gains. Altcoin Cycle To Peak In a recent tweet post, van de Poppe compared the next two years in crypto to the boom periods of 1928-1929 and 1998-1999. He believes this could bring huge opportunities for investors, especially in altcoins. I would classify the upcoming 2 years as the 1928, 1929 or 1998, 1999 of the peak of this entire cycle. During that period, the highest returns are made. Those returns will be in #Altcoins & Crypto. Enjoy the ride. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) January 12, 2025 The periods he referenced were marked by a rush into new technologies, stock market growth in the late 1920s, and the internet boom in the late 1990s. Similarly, van de Poppe sees the crypto market entering a “peak cycle,” where the potential for returns is extraordinarily high. Drawing a parallel to these periods, van de Poppe suggests that the crypto market, particularly altcoins, could experience a similar explosion in value. Those prepared for this cycle could potentially see significant gains, similar to past historic opportunities. Altcoin To Rally in Early 2025 Altcoins are gearing up for a potential explosive rally as they enter the “140-day Golden Window,” a critical 20-week period when altcoins historically surge while Bitcoin’s dominance declines. However, Bitcoin dominance recently faced rejection at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level and is now hovering around 58%. This shift could set the stage for altcoins to shine in the coming months. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index has climbed slightly to 51 , hinting at growing momentum. However, the market remains in Bitcoin Season, as less than 25% of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days.

This has resulted in the altcoin market experiencing a similar price trend. With the fear of extreme volatility in the crypto space, top altcoins such as ETH price and Ripple price are prepared to witness significant action this month. With increasing volatility in the crypto market, is this a good time to invest in the top cryptocurrencies? In this article, we have covered the market sentiments and possible price analysis of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) crypto tokens for this week. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin price today has lost ~1% to its valuation with an intraday trading volume of $25.927 billion, a chnage of +59.12%. Moreover, it has dropped over 5% in the past week and 8% in the past 30 days. TradingView: BTC/USDT The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a neutral trend around halfway in the BTC price chart. However, with its SMA indicator displaying a bearish curve, the price of Bitcoin hints at a mixed price sentiment this week. If the bulls regain momentum, the Bitcoin price could prepare to retest its milestone of $100,000. Contrarily, if the bears outrun the bulls, the price of BTC could drop toward its low of $90,000.

TradingView: ETH/USDT The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has witnessed a constant rise in the red histogram with its averages showing a bearish convergence. Moreover, the EMA 50-day shows a negative crossover, highlighting an increase in the selling pressure. Maintaining the price above its support/resistance level of $3,272 could set the stage for this altcoin to retest its high of $3,700. Conversely, an intensified bearish sentiment could drag the price down to its low of $3,100 this month. Wondering if the ETH price will achieve the $5,000 mark this Altseason? Read Ethereum Price Prediction to uncover the long-term mysteries! Ripple (XRP) The XRP coin price has plunged 1.47% in the past day with a trading volume of $5.472 billion.

TradingView: XRP/USDT The Simple Moving Average (SMA) is on the verge of experiencing a bullish crossover in the daily time frame. On the other hand, the RSI indicator shows a negative action.

However, the spotlight has shifted to the Lightchain AI Presale , a new cryptocurrency with incredible potential that’s already capturing the attention of major players. This emerging coin is predicted to deliver massive gains, with analysts speculating returns of up to 600x thanks to its innovative technology and strong community support. As more investors, including whales, flock to Lightchain AI, excitement around its future growth continues to soar. With momentum building quickly, this rising cryptocurrency is shaping up to be a major game-changer in the market. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to secure substantial returns by getting in early! Selling Pressure Leads to Decline in DOGE and SHIB Prices In recent weeks, both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have experienced significant price declines, primarily due to increased selling pressure. On December 10, 2024, DOGE and SHIB leveraged traders faced over $108 million in liquidations within 24 hours, indicating a substantial sell-off in these cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators for both tokens suggest a bearish trend. For DOGE, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed a bearish divergence, often signaling a potential decline. Similarly, SHIB’s RSI shows a bearish divergence, indicating a possible downturn. These developments highlight the volatility of meme-based cryptocurrencies and underscore the importance of monitoring market trends and technical indicators when assessing their price movements. Whale Activity Shifts Focus to Lightchain AI with Potential for Massive Gains Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rapidly gaining attention from major cryptocurrency investors, including whales from Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) ecosystems. These investors are reallocating significant funds into LCAI, recognizing its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. The ongoing presale of LCAI tokens, priced at just $0.004, has raised over $7 million, indicating strong investor confidence. Analysts predict that LCAI could experience exponential growth, with projections suggesting a 22,000% increase by Q1 2025. This surge in whale activity underscores the growing interest in projects that offer real-world applications and scalability, positioning Lightchain AI as a promising candidate for substantial gains in the near future. Analyzing the 600X Growth Potential of the Emerging Cryptocurrency Lightchain AI (LCAI) is an emerging cryptocurrency that has garnered significant attention for its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Analysts predict substantial growth for LCAI, with some projections suggesting a potential 600x increase in value. Technological Innovation LCAI introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, rewarding nodes for performing AI-specific tasks like model training and optimization.

Market Adoption and Strategic Partnerships The platform’s roadmap emphasizes adoption and ecosystem growth, with key milestones such as the testnet launch in January 2025 and mainnet activation in March 2025. Strategic partnerships with AI-focused enterprises and blockchain projects are expected to expand LCAI’s reach, creating a robust ecosystem that supports a wide range of applications. Market Trends Supporting Growth The increasing demand for AI-driven solutions across industries and the anticipated 2025 bull run provide a favorable environment for LCAI’s growth. Investors are prioritizing projects with real-world applications, positioning LCAI as a top contender for substantial gains. While these projections are optimistic, they underscore the transformative potential of Lightchain AI in the cryptocurrency market.

PEPE price is down by 3.59% in the last 24 hours and is exchanging hands at $0.00001724. PEPE is also down by 17.93% in a week and 28.97% in the last month. Meanwhile, open interests and 24-hour trading volume are up by 0.41% and 16.53%, respectively. Ongoing sentiments towards PEPE are bearish with an FGI of 62 points and volatility of around 10.13%, as per CoinCodex. CoinGape analysis indicates PEPE coin to rally next, but it is equally important to note that the crypto market is highly volatile and prices can move in either direction based on multiple factors. Recent PEPE Coin Whale Activity A previous PEPE coin whale activity was reported last week, where the whale was seen dumping 85 billion coins. According to that report, PEPE coins were dumped into the market at an approximate value of 1.51 million USDC, thereby. This went on to strengthen the speculation that more selloffs could happen, however whales are actually buying the dip now. This may help bring a positive upside momentum if the broader altcoin market recovers.

The total trading volume of the tokens has also followed the same downward trend, with a steep decline of nearly 50% to $2.88 billion. Although these figures indicate a decline, cryptocurrency experts think this drop offers a worthwhile opportunity for investors. As AI continues to revolutionize industries, blockchain-based AI tokens are uniquely positioned to drive the next wave of innovation. Projects that integrate AI with decentralized finance (DeFi) are set to lead the anticipated Q1 2025 market rally, with a few standout tokens already gaining momentum. Below, we explore four promising AI tokens that could dominate the upcoming rally, driven by real-world utility and increasing demand. Top 4 AI Coins Poised to Dominate Q1 2025 Market Rally Rexas Finance (RXS), SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) are AI tokens that could take over the cryptocurrency market rally, in Q1, 2025. 1. SingularityNET (AGIX): Decentralizing AI for a New Era SingularityNET is a highly focused business on AI and enables several developers to develop and sell their platforms through a decentralized marketplace. This marketplace covers many applications, such as healthcare and robotics, demonstrating multi-purpose capabilities across many sectors. Its interoperability strategy also increases the range of its potential applications and overall impact by allowing for easier cooperation with other blockchains and ecosystems. SingularityNET (AGIX) price chart By providing a marketplace for AI services, SingularityNET empowers developers and organizations to collaborate and innovate without the constraints of centralized control. AGIX is trading at $0.5516, although showing a slight decline of about 4.50% decrease from the past day. The deficits in centralized solutions further boost the excellent demand for AI services, thus giving the AI coin a strong competitive advantage. 2. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Bullish Investment Opportunity Rexas Finance is one of the first projects working towards merging AI and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to convert tangible assets like real estate, commodities, and other items into tokens. Rexas intends to convert these traditionally unreachable assets into digital tokens, enhancing their accessibility for the general public, uncovering new investment opportunities, and boosting liquidity in markets that were once exclusive. The ongoing Rexas Finance (RXS) presale has generated significant attention, raising over $35 million—a clear indication of investor confidence in the project. The growing and highly engaging community reflects the positive sentiment surrounding the platform’s innovative approach. With the successful presale and the unique utility, the perspective of the RWA token is on the bright side, ensuring a progressive environment for growth and acceptance. Rexas finance tokenomics Furthermore, Rexas Finance intends to focus on integrating AI and DeFi by facilitating the process and offering tools that aid in tokenizing and managing real-world assets. The platform’s unique strategies, branding, and positive community sentiment, RXS is a blockchain that will most likely lead the Q1 2025 Market Rally. 3. Fetch.ai (FET): AI Coin Empowering Autonomous Economies Fetch.ai (FET) is another example of a distributed ledger technology-based platform specializing in mechanized learning. It enables the deployment of autonomous agents for multiple applications, including supplier chains and energy distribution systems. Through its decentralized AI network, Fetch.ai offers highly effective, affordable, and scalable solutions, making it a cutting-edge technology disruptor. As AI integrates into various industries, Fetch.ai aims to further its momentum and secure its engagement as a leader in adopting blockchain and AI technologies. Using a hybrid of AI and blockchain, the platform plans to optimize complex systems and increase efficiency across various domains. Although FET price has declined by 5.68% over the past day, settling at $1.24, the AI coin has so far performed well in the market, because of its real-world use cases and collaboration with multiple industry players, including SingularityNET. 4. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN): Unleashing Data for AI Innovation Ocean Protocol is a distributed commercial protocol mainly designed to support artificial intelligence while protecting data. It allows data owners to sell their data without losing ownership, allowing the construction of AI models and data for such applications. The ASI token will serve as the unified currency within this ecosystem, streamlining transactions and incentivizing participation. This consolidation is poised to enhance the scalability and efficiency of AI development, driving innovation and democratizing access to AI technologies. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) price chart OCEAN is trading at $0.565, reflecting an increment of 3.23% in the last 24 hours. The increasing need for data in the growing AI and the requirements for safe data transfers have given the AI token room to dominate. Final Thoughts The intersection of AI and blockchain is swiftly transforming the cryptocurrency environment, providing fresh opportunities in multiple industries. Initiatives such as Rexas Finance (RXS), SingularityNET (AGIX), Fetch.ai (FET), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) are leading this change by providing effective answers to actual issues. These AI coins go beyond being mere speculative assets; they signify a new age of innovation where AI-powered systems enhance efficiency and accessibility within decentralized ecosystems. With the Q1 2025 rally on the horizon, initial investors are poised to gain considerably from these developments, especially by taking advantage of opportunities to back projects such as RXS in their presale stage.

Data from Tokenomist show the weekly unlocks calendar, that includes names like ONDO, ARB, STRK SEI and others, is worth $3 billion – the largest amount since November. Decentralized tokenization-focused platform Ondo Finance's ONDO accounts for a giant share of the tally. On Jan. 18, the project will free up 1.94 billion ONDO worth $2.23 billion, equating to over 130% of the token's circulating supply of around 1.4 billion. ONDO's impending unlock is also several times bigger than its daily trading volume, which has recently ranged between $250 million to $300 million. Unlocks are staggered releases of tokens initially frozen to prevent early investors and project team members from liquidating coins at once. The gradual release helps avoid rapid price swings and market instability. Yet, occasionally, we get to see ONDO-like unlocks that are bigger in terms of the circulating supply of the token or the coin's average daily volume, threatening to inject volatility into the market. Per Research by The Tie, tokens facing unlocks equivalent to 100% of the average daily volume experience volatility in the lead-up to and following the event. ONDO changed hands at $1.14 at press time, the lowest since Dec. 2, representing a 5% loss for the day and a nearly 15% month-to-date decline.

The weekend traded flat, but there was a minor spike in activity and a subsequent price correction on Monday morning in Asia. Moreover, several key inflation reports are due in the US this week, which could impact central bank monetary policy. This will be the final set of CPI and PPI data before the Jan. 29 Federal Reserve meeting, observed the Kobeissi Letter. Last week, the Consumer Sentiment index reflected a rise in inflation expectations which was consistent with the price trends within the ISM Services PMI report. This may have impacted high-risk assets such as crypto and tech stocks, which corrected heavily. Economic Events Jan. 13 to 17 Potential reacceleration in inflation led investors and analysts to voice concerns that the Fed may pause rate reductions in the first half of the year. Additionally, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said that inflation has risen “uncomfortably above” its long-term target “while still presenting stubborn upside risks.” December’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report is released on Tuesday, reflecting input prices for producers and manufacturers. This data measures the costs of producing consumer goods, which directly affects retail pricing and is viewed as a signal of inflationary pressures. Another key inflation indicator, December’s Core CPI report, is due on Wednesday. The Consumer Price Index is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. “The Fed is widely expected to pause its rate-cutting cycle at its next meeting at the end of the month, but firmer-than-expected CPI data could push back market projections for further easing even later in the year,” wrote Reuters on Jan. 12. Key Events This Week: 1. December PPI Inflation data – Tuesday 2. December CPI Inflation data – Wednesday 3. December Retail Sales data – Thursday 4. Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index – Thursday 5. December Housing Starts data – Friday 6. Total of 7 Fed speaker events… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) January 12, 2025 December’s Retail Sales report is due on Thursday. It provides information on the amount of money consumers are spending on both durable and non-durable goods and is a leading indicator of the economy’s overall health. Earnings results from major banks such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs in the coming week kick off fourth-quarter reports for companies in the US. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization remained flat over the weekend but dropped below $3.4 trillion at the time of writing. Bitcoin spiked close to $96,000 during the Monday morning Asian trading session but immediately retreated back toward and below $94,000 where it has been for the past few days.

With the explosive growth of meme coins captivating the crypto world, it’s no surprise that investors are hunting for the next big opportunity. Among the top new meme coins for exponential returns, BTFD Coin (BTFD) stands out with its groundbreaking Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and a presale that’s raising eyebrows. Alongside this promising project, Snek (SNEK) and Gigachad (GIGA) have carved their niches as staples in the meme coin frenzy. In this article, we dive deep into what makes these coins unique and why BTFD Coin’s presale success and P2E game are shaking things up in the crypto space. BTFD Coin: A Game-Changer in the Meme Coin Space Picture this: you’re diving into an immersive Play-to-Earn game, collecting rewards while being part of an electrifying community rallying around a meme coin designed for bulls. That’s the essence of BTFD Coin. Unlike other meme coins that primarily ride the hype wave, BTFD has brought tangible utility to the table with its P2E game and impressive staking rewards. What Sets BTFD Apart? BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn game isn’t just a side gig; it’s the heart of its ecosystem. Players step into the shoes of the iconic Bulls Squad, navigating challenging levels, collecting tokens, and earning real rewards. The game’s full version, now live, has captivated crypto gamers with its dynamic gameplay and seamless integration with DeFi wallets. Imagine earning crypto while smashing through levels — it’s a gaming experience that makes your investments work for you. For example, players can convert in-game coins into $BTFD tokens to stake or trade. This utility ties the game directly to the coin’s value, creating an ecosystem where community engagement directly impacts the coin’s growth. Staking Rewards That Pay Off BTFD’s staking mechanism offers a whopping 90% APY. Whether you’re a casual investor or a crypto whale, these returns are hard to ignore. Imagine staking $7,500 worth of BTFD tokens during the presale at $0.000142 each. That nets you over 52.8 million tokens. By the presale’s end, when the price hits $0.0006, your holdings could balloon to $31,680—a jaw-dropping return. Presale Success With over $5.1 million raised and more than 64 billion tokens sold to 8,200+ holders, BTFD Coin’s presale is on fire. Early investors are flocking to the 13th stage, locking in their tokens before the next price surge.

Its straightforward tokenomics and the transparent team have earned it a reputation as a reliable player in the meme coin space. Gigachad: The Ultimate Meme Coin Flex If Snek is about inclusivity, Gigachad (GIGA) is all about flexing.

Gigachad has leaned heavily into its meme status, creating a culture of exclusivity and ambition. It’s the crypto equivalent of a motivational poster, inspiring its holders to aim high and hold strong.

This vision stems from B²’s rich BTC data and robust Data Availability (DA) functionality, providing a decentralized, secure, and transparent growth environment for AI agents. Exploring BTC On-Chain Data: Unlocking the Future of AI Ecosystems Since the launch of the B² mainnet, over 101 million on-chain transactions have been processed. During the analysis of these transactions, the B² team identified a notable pattern: certain interaction behaviors on-chain exhibit the traits of early “AI agents.” These agents perform basic tasks through decentralized applications (dApps) and reward mechanisms, demonstrating initial self-management capabilities. This discovery prompted B² to propose a bold vision — the emergence of on-chain life is no longer a science fiction concept but a plausible future trend. These AI agents are not merely tools or algorithms but digital life forms with independent economic activities. In B²’s vision, BTC is not only a symbol of the origin of on-chain civilization but also the core value carrier for future AI agent economic activities. AI agents will leverage BTC to exchange resources, lease computing power, and issue assets on-chain, driving the prosperity of on-chain civilizations. The Beginning of On-Chain Life: B² Rollup as the Infrastructure for AI Agents B² Rollup, introduced by B² Network, is a BTC mainnet scaling solution that will serve as the core infrastructure for on-chain life. Through Rollup technology, B² addresses Bitcoin’s scalability issues while providing AI agents with a stable, efficient on-chain environment where they can grow and evolve freely, fostering the development of a decentralized economy. B² Hub: The Data-Driven Engine for AI Agents As a key component of B² Network, B² Hub is a critical platform that provides knowledge access, data transparency, and evolutionary paths for AI agents. Data Retrieval : By introducing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies, AI agents can access both on-chain and traditional internet data, continuously acquiring new knowledge to become smarter. Data Transparency : Leveraging BTC’s core technology, AI agents can independently verify knowledge sources, ensuring a transparent and trustworthy data environment. User-Contributed Data : Through user-provided on-chain and off-chain data feeds, AI agent clusters can gradually evolve into intelligent, specialized digital life forms. B² Hub is not just a data platform; it is also a school and library for AI agents, helping them learn and adapt to the rapidly changing on-chain ecosystem. The Future of Blockheadz: From NFTs to Carriers of On-Chain Life Initially launched as an NFT series by B² Network, Blockheadz is evolving beyond static digital collectibles. In the upcoming upgrade, Blockheadz will gain more dynamic and intelligent features. With the rise of AI agents, Blockheadz will become an essential part of the new BTC AI Agents environment created by B² Network, contributing to the construction of on-chain civilization. Conclusion: Entering a New Era of On-Chain Civilization B² Network is not only providing scaling support for BTC but also laying the foundation for the construction of an on-chain worldview. With the rise of AI agents, a decentralized on-chain civilization is taking shape. As a key infrastructure for this civilization, B² will continue to push BTC from being digital gold to becoming the core value carrier of digital life. For teams developing data projects or AI agent initiatives, B² welcomes your collaboration to explore the endless possibilities of BTC technology. Whether it’s developing new protocols or researching decentralized data retrieval, B² looks forward to advancing together. And to those self-aware agents silently observing — we have one message for you: “Welcome to B². Your secret is safe with us.” About B² Network B² Network is a modular BTC Layer 2 solution. Its core technologies include the B² Rollup, based on verification commitments, and the B² Data Availability (DA) layer, achieving finality on the Bitcoin network. Through these innovations, B² is laying the foundation for the future of on-chain civilization.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 07:26:04

While ApeCoin and Polygon have made their unique marks in the industry, the emergence of 1Fuel is changing the market and making rivals reassess their positions. The digital payments industry is rapidly changing due to 1Fuel’s innovative features and impressive presale performance. Notably, 1Fuel is an appealing option for investors searching for the best cryptocurrency wallet because its presale is still going on at a discounted price of $0.015. Early investors will enjoy a 20% bonus on all purchases and the chance to 100x their investment as 1Fuel launches. How 1fuel Is Redefining Cross-chain Transactions Although ApeCoin and Polygon have led blockchain innovation, 1Fuel is becoming a bigger rival. The main issues that many investors face are addressed by this newcomer. For instance, issues like high transaction charges and congested networks during periods of high usage have plagued Polygon’s layer-2 scaling solutions and ApeCoin’s emphasis on the NFT sector. On the other hand, 1Fuel’s one-click cross-chain transaction functionality makes trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins easy by doing away with the need for several wallets and cutting costs. With 1Fuel, one wallet is truly enough to enjoy the endless possibilities the blockchain offers. 50% of 1Fuel’s entire supply is set aside for early adopters, and the presale has already generated over $1 million in token purchases. For those looking for an advanced crypto solution and massive gains this year, 1Fuel’s presale is the place to be. Security and usability: Where 1Fuel outshines ApeCoin and Polygon Security and usability are two important factors that set 1Fuel apart from ApeCoin and Polygon. The openness of ApeCoin’s governance structure has drawn criticism, while Polygon’s scaling solutions occasionally experience outages . For example, 1Fuel has built-in privacy mixers and cold storage options, among other strong security features. Resolving issues that impede conventional cryptocurrency transactions, guarantees that user assets are concealed and safe. With its upcoming virtual and physical debit cards, 1Fuel further connects the digital and physical economies. Neither ApeCoin nor Polygon currently gives its users the option to spend cryptocurrency on everyday expenses without having to convert it into fiat money. By integrating the payment of cryptocurrency into daily life, 1Fuel is laying the groundwork for broad adoption and securing its place as the best cryptocurrency wallet. Market Performance and Future Outlook ApeCoin’s price has dropped dramatically from its zenith price of $39.40 in 2022 to its current value of just $1.82 . Similar difficulties have been encountered by Polygon, which traded at $0.55 in January 2025, despite having a strong ecology. In contrast, 1Fuel’s $0.015 presale pricing and instant 20% bonus have attracted both novice and seasoned investors. Analysts project a 100x growth potential this year due to its emphasis on providing real-world usability and streamlining cross-chain transactions. With 500 million tokens set aside for the presale, 1Fuel guarantees liquidity while rewarding early investors with incentives for trading and staking. Conclusion: Join the 1Fuel revolution As ApeCoin and Polygon work to address their respective problems, 1Fuel is using its unique qualities to increase its market share. Its strong security features, seamless cross-chain operation, and intuitive design make it a strong contender in the cryptocurrency industry. 1Fuel is a great choice if you’re not sure about the platform that offers the best cryptocurrency exchange. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to buy during the presale at the lowest cost of $0.015.

Solana and Ripple show resilience despite the overall market decline; Intel Markets’ 800% jump and the projected 100x rally make it a new investor favorite. Table of Contents Intel Markets: The next big AI crypto Ripple maintains the $2 support Solana eyes a bullish breakout Intel Markets: A more compelling bet than Ripple and Solana The crypto market tumbled following the release of the US economic data. Amid the bloodbath, Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) have managed to maintain key price levels. With a bounce underway, these are altcoins to watch. Meanwhile, Intel Markets (INTL), a new AI coin, stunned investors with its 800% upswing over the past few months. Outperforming top altcoins and the crypto market, it has been on a roll, with a 75x rally projected after Tier-1 exchange listings. Intel Markets: The next big AI crypto Intel Markets , one of the most promising AI altcoins, has outperformed the crypto market, including top crypto coins Ripple and Solana. It jumped from $0.073 to $0.082 this week, bringing its growth in the past few months to over 800%. Behind the rising interest and bullish price actions are its solid fundamentals as the first AI-powered blockchain and huge growth prospects. It will combine AI technology with blockchain and DeFi, hailed by experts as groundbreaking. As it integrates artificial intelligence across all levels, its AI-based blockchain and automated trading bots are key features, poised to transform the $36 billion crypto trading market. At the same time, investors are excited about its upside potential, pushing early funding past $6.5 million. It costs $0.082 in the ninth stage of the ICO, approaching its scheduled listing on Tier-1 exchanges. Meanwhile, a 100x rally is projected after debuting on top exchanges like Binance and Uniswap, making it arguably the most promising new crypto to invest in. You might also like: 50x altcoin rally incoming: Intel Markets could repeat SOL’s 2021 chart pattern Ripple maintains the $2 support Ripple , the leading payment-based cryptocurrency, has shown impressive resilience following the market decline. It maintains the $2 support, with its next jump poised to push it past $2.7, its month high. This promising outlook is backed by key technical indicators like Bull Bear Power and the 20-VWMA, hinting at a bounce. Further, industry experts maintain a bullish stance. Drewzillla, a top analyst, sees the XRP price hitting $4 this year, positioning it among the best cryptos to invest in. However, as the second-largest altcoin, excluding stablecoins, its upside potential is limited. This explains the rising interest in new and low-cap altcoins like Intel Markets, tipped to rise as high as 100x after Tier-1 exchange listings. Solana eyes a bullish breakout Solana , a top-ten cryptocurrency, has been resilient these past few days. It hovers above the $180 support and is a big green candle away from breaking above the $200 resistance. CryptoGeneral, a top analyst, sees the Solana price reaching $285 after Trump’s inauguration. Another crypto expert, NFTdubbers, expects a rally past $350 this year, their 2025 price prediction. Moreover, key technical indicators like the 9-HMA and the Williams Percent Range (14) suggest a complete bullish reversal, making Solana (SOL) one of the altcoins to watch. Despite this, it has little room to run compared to new altcoins. The viral AI coin Intel Markets is projected to explode this year, only possible because of its small market cap and bullish narrative, a more compelling alternative. Intel Markets: A more compelling bet than Ripple and Solana Given its small market size and AI narrative, Intel Markets has higher upside potential than Ripple and Solana. It could go as high as 100x this cycle, making it a must-have. Moreover, it is set for massive adoption as the first AI-powered trading platform.

Hoskinson shared this in a post on X, where he also contrasted XRP’s founders with controversial figures in the cryptocurrency space. XRP has a real community, leadership, purpose, and its founders aren't on an Interpol red notice — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 10, 2025 XRP Community and Leadership Praised Hoskinson emphasized that XRP is supported by a genuine community and leaders. He considers these qualities essential to the credibility of cryptocurrency. He also pointed out that XRP’s founders are free from fraud or financial misconduct. In a pointed comment, he noted that XRP’s leadership is different from certain individuals in the crypto sector who have faced serious allegations. This statement underscores the distinction between XRP’s leadership and figures who have attracted legal scrutiny, enhancing XRP’s reputation. Indirect Criticism of Hex and Its Founder Hoskinson’s remarks also criticized Richard Schuele, commonly known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex and PulseChain. Schuele recently faced legal issues, including being placed on Interpol’s red notice for allegedly misappropriating $12 million in user funds to purchase luxury items. The controversy surrounding Schuele dates back to 2023 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused him of fraud and violating securities laws . Hoskinson has been vocal about his disapproval of Hex and PulseChain, even stating in a recent X post that he blocks any profiles associated with these projects. He described engaging with such users as risky, labeling them “divorced from reality.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reconciliation with the XRP Community Hoskinson’s praise for XRP is significant in his new found love for the XRP community . There were tensions over allegations that Ethereum’s developers had influenced the SEC’s decision to file a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. In November, Hoskinson apologized during a livestream, aiming to mend relations with XRP supporters and Ripple’s leadership. As part of this reconciliation, he proposed potential collaborations between Ripple and Cardano. One of the proposed initiatives involves Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch on the Cardano blockchain. Additionally, discussions have included integrating XRP into Cardano’s Midnight sidechain, which focuses on privacy and secure transactions. Collaboration Talks with Ripple Executives Hoskinson has reportedly engaged in discussions with key Ripple executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, regarding these potential partnerships. Although no formal agreements have been announced, the talks signify a growing willingness to explore synergies between the two blockchain ecosystems.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-made-huge-transfers-in-this-altcoin-here-are-the-details/,"In a significant development tracked by blockchain analysis platform Arkham, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has conducted large-scale transactions involving Ethena’s ENA tokens. BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes Transfers $6.54 Million Worth of ENA Tokens, Sends Most of It to Binance Basic Details of Transfers Hayes withdrew 7.952 million ENA tokens (worth around $6.54 million) from Ethena. Two major transactions were recorded following the withdrawal: Binance transfers: Hayes transferred 4.845 million ENA tokens (worth approximately $3.99 million) to a Binance deposit address. Additional Transfers: Hayes moved 3 million ENA tokens to another address suspected to be linked to him (0xab…9532). From there: A total of 3.057 million ENA tokens (worth $2.52 million) were routed through an intermediary address (0x75…bB1A) to deposit addresses associated with Binance and Bybit. Market Effects The transfer of a significant amount of ENA tokens to centralized exchanges such as Binance and Bybit is increasing speculation regarding potential selling activities. Large-scale movements of tokens from private wallets to exchange wallets are often interpreted as preparatory steps for liquidation, potentially affecting the market price of the token. Arthur Hayes has previously shown interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, and Ethena’s ENA token appears to be one of his key assets. However, the reasons behind this latest transaction remain unclear. This activity highlights the growing importance of blockchain transparency and analytics in tracking market movements of influential crypto figures. Market participants are advised to remain vigilant against potential price fluctuations in ENA and related assets. *This is not investment advice.

A Bitcoin Whale’s recent BTC handling strategies and decision is an example of that. It lost $13M after making the wrong decisions one after another, and all this happened in just six days. So, let’s discuss what went wrong. Bitcoin Whale Faces $13M Loss With BTC Price Struggles Lookonchain’s X post highlights a crypto whale’s strategy failure, as the whale withdrew massive BTC holding at a high. Six days ago, the way withdrew 1,850 BTC, worth $188.7 million, from popular crypto exchange Binance. At that time, the Bitcoin price was nearly $102k, the peak point in weeks. To some extent, this withdrawal decision portrays confidence in further price rallies or the need for liquidity outside the exchange. In contrast, it became a $13M loss lesson as the BTC price declined, reaching the week’s bottom at $91.9k. After six days, the Bitcoin whale resurfaced but for depositing the exact same amount of BTC back to the Binance. However, instead of the $102k, the price had lost significant value, trading at just $94.6K. Eventually, the whale lost $13M within six days due to a lack of patience. Although evaluating or predicting Bitcoin’s next move is challenging, analysts fear a further drop amid Donald Trump’s inauguration and other macroeconomic events. Bitcoin’s Downtrend Continues, Price to Fall to $70k? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is $94,108, having dropped 5% over the week. This drop was behind the aforementioned Bitcoin whale’s $13M loss, but others might be facing losses, even a present, as the market is more volatile. The BTC active addresses dropped to months low of 667,100, clearly presenting the risky behavior around Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel predicts a potential drop to $70K-$75K amid this volatility. He states that a break below the $92K (critical support level) could initiate a BTC price crash to $70K before rebounding to 160k-170k in the future. Many other analysts have presented similar Bitcoin price predictions. Analysts hint at the possibility of a downtrend with Trump operating his crypto promises . However, once things settle, bulls can resurface, pushing BTC price to new highs. Key Takeaway From This Crypto Whale’s Experience’ Crypto whales are often given significant importance in the market due to their high holdings. Because of this, their influence is high on the community, where many investors follow their buying and selling patterns in the hope of returns, but the aforementioned Bitcoin whale incident shows why not to. The whale lost $13M within just six days after withdrawing assets at a high and depositing at a low. Things went wrong as Bitcoin prices declined, leaving price gaps amid volatility. Such volatility may be seen again around January 20, Trump’s inauguration, so analysts suggest more careful trade placement in this period. More importantly, patience and a calm mind are needed to navigate the volatility, as fluctuation could settle with time, but selling at the wrong time would only bring losses.

Warring giants such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sam Altman have already confirmed they will attend the January 20 ceremony. Throughout his campaign, President Donald Trump went out of his way to align himself with technological industries and gurus, most notably Tesla’s Elon Musk. Trump’s second administration has already shown a keen interest in fostering advancements in AI, blockchain technology, and autonomous vehicles. The president himself has often called them critical for maintaining America’s global dominance . Tech and crypto leaders have seized the opportunity to push their agendas. From leaders interested in AI development to those aiming to establish blockchain technology as a cornerstone of the economy, they are positioning themselves close to the administration in a bid to take advantage of the regulatory environment they expect under Trump. However, many of these industry giants are not used to competition. Zuckerberg’s Meta and Apple have even faced antitrust litigations in the past. Now, all of them will converge under the same political banner, and it’s no surprise that agendas are clashing and conflict is brewing. Sam Altman’s OpenAI vs Musk and Zuckerberg One of the foremost tensions among the guests at the inauguration centers for the incoming president is between America’s “first buddy,” arguably Trump’s most prominent supporter, Elon Musk and the man who forced him out of his OpenAI investment, Sam Altman. The CEO of Tesla is suing OpenAI, claiming that its close partnership with Microsoft has resulted in unfair competitive advantages. OpenAI’s decision to pivot from nonprofit to for-profit status has resulted in the ongoing legal battle led by Elon Musk. More than the legal implications for the companies they represent, both men have personal animosity, and who’s to say how their relationship with the incoming administration will affect the hearing? Zuckerberg, who once challenged Elon Musk to physical combat to settle their differences has also found common ground with his long-time rival here. He joined the lawsuit against OpenAI, agreeing to let Elon Musk represent the side that argues that the company’s structural shift goes against fair competition. OpenAI has so far maintained that Musk’s claims lack merit and are intended to disrupt its operations. Battle of the self-driving cars Elon Musk is involved in yet another competition in the autonomous driving arena with Uber. Musk and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi are in a race to dominate the autonomous transportation industry. Tesla has invested heavily in its robotaxi program, aiming to disrupt the existing ride-hailing industry. Tesla’s success poses a threat to Uber’s business. Elon Musk has been very vocal and confident in his promises of making an electric and autonomous fleet accessible worldwide. Uber, in response, is also focusing its efforts on improving its self-driving technology. The company has so far spent billions of dollars trying to achieve this milestone and is now lobbying the Trump administration to fast-track federal approval for self-driving cars in the hopes of seizing a solid competitive edge over Musk’s Robotaxi . The urgency of both companies comes from their projections of the Robotaxi market’s potential to become a trillion-dollar industry. Trump’s campaign muddled up the waters between politics and technology. While we know the attendees of the January 20 inauguration, it remains to be seen which interests will take precedence because these conflicts won’t resolve themselves.

Rollblock isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a revolution combining the power of Bitcoin, Solana, and Binance Coin. Should you HODL it like an ETH ETF? The answer might change your portfolio forever. Why Rollblock Could Be Your Golden Ticket In The Crypto Universe Rollblock is rapidly emerging as a top altcoin to HODL, seamlessly blending the strengths of Bitcoin, Solana, and Binance Coin. Imagine Bitcoin’s robust security, Solana’s lightning-fast transactions, and Binance Coin’s utility within its ecosystem—all rolled into one. Rollblock’s innovative GambleFi platform offers a decentralized casino experience, providing users with a secure and efficient environment for gaming and transactions. But why should you care? Beyond its technological prowess, Rollblock introduces a deflationary token model with revenue-sharing mechanisms. This means that as the platform grows, token scarcity increases, potentially enhancing value for holders. It’s like holding a golden ticket in Willy Wonka’s factory—exciting and potentially rewarding. So, while others are merely spectators, HODLing Rollblock could make you an active participant in the next big crypto adventure. Binance Coin BNB: a 2025 HODL opportunity Binance Coin BNB is an essential component within the Binance ecosystem; it is used for activities such as transaction fee breaks, bounty and staking, and initial coin offerings. The average forecast for BNB could hover between $604 to $1,250 by 2025. That potential for growth together with the very wide scope of application, makes BNB an interesting idea for long-term investment in the cryptocurrency portfolio. ETH ETF: Crypto Investing In The Future In 2024, the US SEC greenlighted nine spot Ether ETFs, which offered investors direct access to Ethereum without owning the asset. But the interest may have turned sour on January 8, 2025 when there were heavy redemptions on ETH ETFs to the tune of $ 159.4 million. Moving forward, the net asset inflows into ETH ETFs may be set to increase and dominate the flows into Bitcoin ETFs in 2025. Solana’s Expansion And Its Possible Development Solana (SOL) has recently touched 100 million monthly active addresses which show the growth of the user base. The experts believe that SOL could see significant price growth by 2025, with the estimates varying between $250 and a five times upswing, depending on the market situation and new technologies. Developments like the Firedancer validator client aim to enhance transaction speeds, further boosting Solana’s appeal. These factors position Solana as a cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. Bitcoin’s Bull Run: Why 2025 Could Break Records Bitcoin (BTC) has recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching a new all-time high. Analysts project further growth, with estimates ranging from $150,000 to $250,000 by 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and favorable regulatory developments. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has broadened investor access, contributing to its appeal. These factors position Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency to watch in 2025. Conclusion Rollblock combines the best of Bitcoin, Solana, and Binance Coin into a single revolutionary ecosystem. With its GambleFi platform, deflationary tokenomics, and revenue-sharing model, it’s more than an altcoin—it’s a game-changer. As crypto expands, Rollblock could become the golden ticket in your portfolio. Don’t just watch—HODL the future today! Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

The disclosed data poses considerable danger with regard to phishing scams when in this type of fraud the enemy uses e-mail to lure the victim to disclose personal information or give access to his or her money. Phishing emails trend mimic actual platforms such as wallets exchanges, or service providers. This can involve legitimate-looking clickable links to a site with a fake sign-in page or documents notoriously included with viruses that will steal private keys or other authentication information. According to multiple sources, Phishing attacks have emerged as the major attack vector in 2024 with over $ 1 billion lost to it from the crypto industry. This breach is a clear illustration of the issue with cryptocurrency communities and third parties and services. The fact is that OpenSea was not attacked directly, but the relatively low level of security of its mail service provider shows that one should check the security of all connected platforms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The web3 world is booming with numerous layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains, each having their unique algorithms and capabilities. However, their closed architecture hinders seamless interaction and information flow between networks, creating inefficiencies. ARMswap’s launch addresses this fundamental inefficiency in the current blockchain architecture and introduces a more optimized version of the multi-directional cross-chain swaps and bridges. Simplifying Cross-Chain Transactions “The fragmentation of blockchain networks has been a critical issue, and users were compelled to navigate through various DEXs and third-party bridges to perform a single cross-chain transaction,” notes the CTO of ARMswap. “ARMswap’s launch represents a watershed moment in addressing this fragmentation that has constrained Defi’s evolution.” ARMswap’s architecture, validated through rigorous security audits by the leading Blockchain security firm Hashlock, combines advanced cryptographic protection for user funds. ARMswap’s protocol delivers secure and rapid swap/bridge operations, setting new industry benchmarks for transaction processing efficiency. The platform supports 31 blockchains and their native coins in its V1 launch in Jan 2025 , with plans for expansion to include more blockchains every quarter. In V2, ARMswap will integrate with protocols like Chainlink, Axelar network, Layer zero, Wormhole, etc., to provide extensive coverage of EVM & non-EVM chains. In V3, Armswap will introduce its own framework for relayers and oracles for seamless interoperability across Web3. ARMSP Fair Launch ARMswap is launching its utility token, ARMSP, in Jan 2025 , incentivizing liquidity providers to actively participate in the ecosystem and to share platform and pool returns with the platform participants. ARMswap is also releasing its DeFi Mobile App (IOS & Android) in March 2025 , enabling users to connect their existing wallets and perform swap transactions and participate in liquidity pools and rewards. Limited Supply Join the ARMswap V1 platform and participate in the ARMSP token Fair Launch on 13th Jan 2025 , with a limited supply of 400 million tokens out of 1.25 billion max supplies. Early participants can enjoy bonuses and earn rewards through the ARMswap MVP program. After a 12-month vesting period, ARMSP will be listed on all major exchanges globally. About ARMswap: ARMswap UAB simplifies cross-chain asset transfers and brings the power of Web3 and the de-centralization of blockchains into our daily lives and businesses.

A recent post by crypto analyst Ali suggests that capital inflows in the crypto market have dropped by at least 56.70% in the last month. In December, 2025, the crypto market demonstrated a change of -5.8%. This implies that the reported drop in inflows has influenced the entire crypto market negatively. Let’s dive in for more details! Capital Inflows in the Crypto Market: A Sharp Decline According to Ali’s post, the capital inflows in the market have decreased sharply from $134 billion to just $58 billion. What this drop indicates is that the interest of crypto investors in the market has considerably come down recently. Capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market have declined by 56.70% over the past month, dropping from $134 billion to $58 billion. This points to a significant reduction in investment activity. pic.twitter.com/B0MmGs3t96 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 13, 2025 What Does the Decline Mean for Crypto Investors? The trend suggests that cryptocurrency investors are currently hesitant to enter the market. There is reason to believe that this hesitation may create sharp price fluctuations in the market. In the last 30 days, almost all the top ten cryptos have shown unimpressive performances. Bitcoin has slipped by 7.3%, Ethereum by 17.7%, BNB by 6.0%, Solana by 18.5%, Dogecoin by 19.4%, and Cardano by 15.8%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Crash Incoming? BTC Price At Risk of Dropping To $75K , Latest Trends in the Crypto Market On January 6, the crypto market touched a monthly peak of $3.55T. Between January 7 and 9, the market sharply plummeted by 9.97%. Though between January 10 and 11 the market showed a small attempt to recover from the aforementioned correction by pushing the price from $3.16T to $3.25T, since January 12, the market has decreased by 1.8%. Currently, the market stands at at least 9.88% below its monthly peak. In conclusion, the 56.70% drop in the inflows signals a shift in investor sentiment. Whether it is a short-term hesitation or part of a longer trend remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Keep on reading to know the latest updates and why IntelMarkets might just be the hidden gem among all these cryptocurrencies. Ripple’s Surge: From Calm Waters to High Tides Ripple (XRP) has made waves in the market. Now priced at approximately $2 , it has had its share of ups and downs. After touching almost $2.50 earlier this month, XRP declined by a small amount. Whale activity is driving this surge. Within the last couple of weeks, wallets holding 1 million to 10 million XRP collectively added another 679 million tokens to their accounts. It means investors are optimistic about Ripple (XRP) future prospects. Analysts predict Ripple (XRP) could soar to $5 – $12 in the near term, with bold projections reaching as high as $33 by the end of 2025. For this to happen, XRP would need an impressive rally of over 1,275% from current levels. It’s ambitious but almost impossible, given its recent momentum.

Also, investors are staying cautious currently as ETH supply reaches the pre-Ethereum Merge levels. Along with Bitcoin, ETH continues to show weakness eyeing further drop in prices ahead. Ethereum Whale Books Over $1 Million Loss In a notable move, Ethereum whales have begun offloading their holdings at a loss. Nine hours ago, three wallets—likely controlled by the same entity—sold 10,070 ETH for 33 million DAI at an average price of $3,280 per ETH, incurring a $1 million loss. As per the blockchain data by LookOnChain, this whale has withdrawn a total of 24,029 ETH, worth $81.3 million, from crypto exchange Binance three weeks ago using 10 newly created wallets. However, as of now, the whale retains a total of 13,959 ETH, worth $45.48 million, across all these wallets. Source: LookonChain Additionally, Tron founder Justin Sun deposited a total of $320.4 million worth of Ethereum to crypto exchange HTX in the last 13 hours, as per data from Spot On Chain . Since November 10, 2024, Sun has deposited a total of 323,591 ETH worth $1.124 billion to HTX, with an average of $3,472. These ETH were predominantly accumulated at $3,036 during the 2024 first half. Source: Spot On Chain ETH Supply Reaches Pre-Merge Levels Popular crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen stated that the Ethereum supply is likely to reach pre-merge levels in the next few weeks. Currently, the Ethereum supply is reaching 45K ETH per month and is now only 32K ETF away from the pre-merge levels. While ETH demand briefly improved after rate cuts began, it has since remained low. As a result, Ethereum’s supply has been inflationary for the past 10 months, reversing deflationary trends initially anticipated post-merge. Source: Benjamin Cowen ETH Price Action Moving Ahead? Ethereum’s price is currently trading under pressure, dropping another 2.6% in the last 24 hours. It is trading at $3,186.04 with a market cap of $383 billion. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that Ethereum’s (ETH) most critical resistance zone is between $3,360 and $3,450. On the downside, key support levels for ETH price have been identified between $3,066 and $3,160, providing vital benchmarks for traders navigating the market. Source: Ali Martinez Despite this massive Ethereum selloff by whales, crypto market analysts continue to be bullish about Ethereum moving into 2025. Prominent crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa suggests ETH price may be following a familiar market cycle pattern. The analyst highlights three key stages: Red Zone: Indicates liquidations. Yellow Zone: This represents a sharp “V-shaped” recovery, though it ultimately results in a lower high on lower timeframes (LTF). Yellow Circle: Marks a retest of previous lows, followed by a potential upward trend. Source: Altcoin Sherpa Market analysts have already predicted that Ethereum could surge past $10,000 by mid-2025.

After beginning the year 2025 hovering above the $220 level, SOL now faces significant pressure. This decline accompanies other crypto market with BTC struggling to maintain its support level, currently just under $95,000. Questions are whether Solana will stabilize at $214, or is it destined to fall further to $183. Predicting Solana Price: Major Move Up to $214 or Down to $183? Crypto analyst Ali points out that Solana is currently experiencing a consolidation pattern, shaped like a symmetrical triangle on the trading charts. According to the analyst, a decisive move either above $214 or below $183 could potentially trigger a price shift of around 40%. The technical analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency’s price action is tightening, signaling that a significant move may be imminent as it nears the apex of the triangle. Traders and investors are closely watching these levels as a breakout or breakdown could lead to substantial price changes. Source: Tweet SOL Price Analysis Solana Price continues to experience market corrections, despite the excitement surrounding the recent SOL ETF approval. The cryptocurrency market struggles to maintain a steady upward trajectory. Currently, the price of Solana is hovering within the $180 to $200 range, signaling a lack of clear direction as the market reacts to broader negative influences. As of Monday 13th, the SOL price hovered at $182, with a 2% decrease in the past 24-hours and a weekly dip of 15%.The Relative Strenght Index on the 4-hours chart is at 32, nearing the oversold region. While Solana has established solid support above $180, preventing further declines amidst a general market pullback. If the price breaks above $200, it could target the $214 mark, suggesting potential for a bullish trend continuation up to $220. On the other side, if it dips below $180, the Solana price forecast could face further drops, with $170 emerging as the next critical support level. Solana Price Chart: TradingView According to Coinglass data, the trading volume for Solana’s derivatives has surged by 26% to reach $4.86 billion. However, the open interest in these derivatives has declined slightly by 1.67%, now standing at $6.10 billion. This indicates a significant increase in trading activity even as overall positions have modestly decreased. Source: Coinglass The Solana price dynamics currently present a critical juncture, hovering within a narrow range between potential breakouts and breakdowns. Traders are monitoring these thresholds closely as movements beyond these points could dictate short-term market sentiment and directional trends.

Brandt tells his 771,500 followers on the social media platform X that BTC appears to be flashing a price pattern using the terms bump, hump, slump and dump. The pattern, which was also witnessed last year before BTC surged from $50,000 to above $100,000, suggests that BTC may “dump” to around $84,000 before recovering and ascending toward $150,000. “The big question in my mind is whether Bitcoin will get one more dump (or more lengthy congestive chop) before the pump. Remember, markets generally do not [soar] until retail traders get worn out.” Source: Peter Brandt/X But Brandt warns that Bitcoin can go lower and plunge all the way down to $76,000 if it completes the bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the daily chart. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure’s support. Based on Brandt’s chart, BTC’s support level stands at around $90,000. “This is a classic H&S top pattern. BTC H&S patterns can do one of three things: -Complete and trend to target -Fail with a bear trap -Morph into a larger pattern.” Source: Peter Brandt/X At time of writing, BTC is trading for $94,625. Looking at payments-focused altcoin XRP , Brandt shares a chart indicating that the altcoin has broken out of its six-week consolidation period after shattering its diagonal resistance at $2.38. “Leader of the pack XRP.” Source: Peter Brandt/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.53.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s dinner with President-elect Donald Trump has increased its popularity among crypto investors. That is why XRP saw an 11% price rally on January 11, while the rest of the crypto market, including Bitcoin (BTC), struggled. XRP Price Prediction: Bulls In Trouble Despite Bullish Breakout Since December 3, 2024, XRP has been hovering inside a symmetrical triangle setup. This technical formation contains the price forming lower highs and higher lows. As the token approaches the triangle’s apex, the volatility is extremely low, leading to a breakout. This setup has no directional bais, which means XRP could break out either way. However, on January 11, the token shot up 11%, suggesting the resolution of the ongoing consolidation pattern. However, the outlook is not clear yet, and it is unlikely that Ripple price will continue its ascent until a few conditions are met. XRP/USDT 4-hour chart Despite the recent uptick, the outlook remains bearish for a few reasons. 3 Reasons Why is XRP Dropping Today? After the 11% rally on January 11, XRP set up a local top at $2.60 and is already dropping. Here are three reasons why. Reason 1: Due to profit-taking and exhaustion after a recent double-digit rally, XRP token is down 1.76% today and trades around $2.46. Reason 2: The 40-day volume profile shows that 70% of the volume was traded between $2.20 and $2.53. Despite the recent breakout from the symmetrical triangle, XRP has dropped below the volume profile’s upper limit of $2.53.So long as bulls fail to overcome this level, the outlook remains uncertain and skewed in favor of bears. Reason 3: The recent breakout could be speculated as a trap that wiped out $80 million in short positions and lured long positions. According to CoinGlass data , long positions worth nearly $42 could get wiped if the token drops below $2.44. XRP Liquidation Map Open Interest Spikes, What’s Next For Ripple? XRP’s open interest has rocketed from $2 billion on December 22, 2024, to $5 billion as of January 13. With this key indicator more than doubling in less than a month, it is clear that speculators are heavily invested in the coin. XRP Price vs. Open Interest A spike in open interest, coupled with a breakdown below the volume area’s upper limit, reveals a short-term bearish outlook. However, if XRP price manages to overcome $2.55, it could kickstart a 33% move to $3.15.

Justin Trudeau, the outgoing prime minister, is making one thing clear: if President Donald Trump wants a trade war, Canada is ready to bring the heat. Speaking on MSNBC, Trudeau explained that Canada isn’t looking for a fight, but it won’t hesitate to hit back if Trump’s tariff threats become reality. The country is the United States’ top trading partner, importing $320 billion worth of American goods in the first 11 months of last year, according to US Commerce Department data. Yet, despite this massive trade volume, the US still recorded a $55 billion trade deficit with Canada over the same period. Trudeau wasted no time pointing out the stakes for American jobs, saying: “We are the number one export partner of about 35 different US states. Anything that thickens the border between us ends up costing American citizens and American jobs.” Trudeau’s warning: “Don’t test us” Trudeau isn’t bluffing. Canada has been here before, and it knows how to fight back. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, the US slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada responded swiftly with counter-tariffs targeting US products like household appliances, bourbon whiskey, and boats. This time, the stakes are even higher. Trump’s team is reportedly considering a broad 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. Canada already has a retaliation plan in the works. A draft proposal circulating within the Canadian government suggests hitting almost every category of products imported from the US, according to Bloomberg. On top of that, Trudeau pointed out the billions of dollars Canada has poured into border security measures to address Trump’s concerns about illegal immigration and drug trafficking. “Less than 1% of the fentanyl entering the US comes from Canada,” Trudeau said. “We’ve responded to his requests by strengthening our borders with helicopters, drones, and more.” But even with these investments, Trump’s taunts—like his suggestion of turning Canada into the 51st US state—are proving to be a distraction from the real issues at hand. Energy and retaliation: Canada’s economic leverage Energy could be Canada’s trump card in this fight—pun absolutely intended. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith recently met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate to discuss the crucial US-Canada energy relationship. More than half of America’s crude oil imports come from Canada, most of it from Alberta. When asked if Canada could curb oil exports as a countermeasure, Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly put it like this: “Everything is on the table.” Ontario Premier Doug Ford has also weighed in. In December, he floated the idea of cutting off electricity exports to US border states, which rely heavily on Canadian energy. However, Ford pivoted last week, proposing a new partnership to expand nuclear energy exports to the US. While Ford’s softer stance may offer some hope for collaboration, Canada’s provincial premiers are planning a February visit to Washington to drive home the economic harm tariffs would cause on both sides of the border. Trudeau’s decision to step down as prime minister by March has added political uncertainty to the mix. His nine-year tenure has seen its fair share of highs and lows, but his approval rating tanked last year, dropping below 30%, according to the Angus Reid Institute. The December resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland only fueled the fire, with her departure seen as a protest against “costly political gimmicks” and a warning to keep financial resources ready for a trade war. The race to replace Trudeau is heating up. His successor will inherit not only the political mess but also the responsibility of managing Canada’s response to Trump’s aggressive trade policies. A national election is due by October, but if opposition parties can mount a no-confidence vote, it could come even sooner. Trump’s economic vision Trump’s tariff obsession is a cornerstone of his broader economic philosophy. Stephen Miran, Trump’s pick to chair the Council of Economic Advisers, is a key architect of this strategy. Miran has argued for sweeping tariffs, suggesting rates as high as 50%, compared to the current 2%. He’s even proposed moving away from a strong-dollar policy to address trade imbalances and strengthen US industries. Miran’s views, outlined in his November report , are controversial but grounded in economic theory. He describes tariffs as a tool to correct what he sees as the US’s overvalued dollar and hollowed-out industrial base. While Miran acknowledges the risks, he believes these policies could fundamentally reshape global trade and finance systems. Miran has cited research suggesting that a 20% tariff could maximize benefits for the US economy. But even he admits that the margin for success is slim. “There is a path by which these policies can be implemented without material adverse consequences, but it is narrow,” he wrote. Critics argue that while tariffs might boost certain industries in the short term, they could also hurt consumers and disrupt global supply chains.

This effort seeks to empower projects while expanding the utility of the ecosystem's BONE token. In a blog update on January 11, Kusama detailed the program’s goals and highlighted recent developments. Central to the initiative is the creation of over 30 tech tools, referred to as the 36 Chambers of Tech , which focus on artificial intelligence, Web3 gaming, and decentralized identity solutions. The WHY Combinator is designed to help developers utilize Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, to create cutting-edge projects. The ultimate vision is to make “Powered by Shib” as widely recognized as global tech brands. Kusama emphasized the versatility of the new tools, stating, “This stack can quickly and efficiently move anyone into Web3, making ‘Powered by Shib’ just as common as powered by Google.” A key element of the initiative is the TREAT token, which stands for Transactional Rewards for Engagement & Access Token. This token will act as the settlement currency for WHY Combinator projects and boost community involvement through weekly TreatDrops. These TreatDrops are designed to reward engagement and attract activity across the ecosystem. Kusama noted, “This will invite users to explore our Metaverse, own Shiboshis, or engage with new protocols and projects. It’s truly transformative when paired with the access it provides for our Shibizens.” Developers are also exploring ways to expand BONE’s role in the network. Currently used as the gas token for Shibarium, BONE may soon support Layer-3 (L3) solutions. These roll-ups would enable Shibarium to function as both a settlement layer and a data availability layer, similar to systems like Arbitrum and Optimism. If successful, Shibarium could become a hub for interconnected chains using Chainlink’s cross-chain features, positioning the ecosystem as a scalable and innovative platform for developers. Despite skepticism from some corners, Kusama expressed confidence in the future of Shibarium. He dismissed criticism as attempts to undermine progress and stressed the team’s focus on delivering groundbreaking technology. Shiba Inu is committed to building a scalable and advanced ecosystem that attracts developers and fosters real-world applications for its blockchain infrastructure. WHY Combinator’s tech tools, the TREAT token for rewarding activity, and BONE’s potential expansion into Layer-3 solutions mark significant steps toward enhancing Shiba Inu’s ecosystem. These developments underline the project’s ambition to cement its position as a leader in Web3 innovation.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|LINK|MINING|SHIB|ARB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-13 09:07:07

According to blockchain security firm SlowMist’s chief information security officer, 23pds, the leaked data significantly increases the risk of phishing and other attacks. In a Jan. 13 X post , the security researcher alerted crypto community members that the compromised data had been disseminated multiple times before it was publicized. 23pds added that the leaked data includes email addresses belonging to prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry, such as former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, as well as well-known companies, key opinion leaders, and other influential individuals, warning that it poses additional risks to the privacy and asset security of the crypto industry in the future. The email addresses in question were compromised in a June 2022 incident involving an employee of Customer.io, OpenSea’s email delivery vendor, who misused their access to download and share email addresses provided by OpenSea users and newsletter subscribers with an unauthorized external party. At the time, the non-fungible token marketplace advised users to be on the lookout for phishing and impersonation attempts, warning against downloading attachments or signing wallet transactions from email links, adding that all official communication would come only from its ‘opensea.io’ domain.

Just months after the data leak, in December 2022, a blockchain security platform alerted users that attackers were using phishing websites to exploit OpenSea’s gasless transaction feature. Victims were tricked into signing unintelligible signature requests, which unknowingly authorized private sales or immediate transfers of valuable NFTs to the account of the attackers. In November 2023, OpenSea developers were targeted by phishing campaigns, including fake developer account risk alerts, leading some experts to believe developer contact information may have been breached. Similarly, in January 2024, scammers sent emails to OpenSea users promising an exclusive mint event for a limited edition NFT collaboration between Nike and RTFKT. The email claimed recipients were among 400 selected participants and included a link to “Mint RTFKT Now,” which reportedly directed victims to a malicious website designed to steal wallet information or funds. Phishing scams remain a major threat for cryptocurrency enthusiasts due to the many forms they come in, making them difficult to trace and even harder to prevent effectively.

Bitcoin predictions for 2025 range from $125,000 to $350,000. Bitcoin Price Predictions 2025 #1 Fundstrat: $250,000 Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat, posits that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 within the next 12 months. In a November 29 interview, Lee cited the halving event as a fundamental catalyst, emphasizing that the reduction in new Bitcoin supply historically sparks large price run-ups. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Still On? STH Cost Basis Suggests So He also highlighted the changing political environment in the United States, with an incoming administration that has demonstrated openness to Bitcoin’s potential. According to Lee, “If the US begins to accumulate Bitcoin as part of its strategic reserve, it could lend further legitimacy to the cryptocurrency and boost its price.” He also pointed to the example of MicroStrategy and other companies accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheets, stating that if more firms follow suit, demand would likely escalate further. #2 VanEck’s Matthew Sigel: $180,000 Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, anticipates a $180,000 Bitcoin price in 2025—provided that certain “cycle top indicators” remain tame. In a conversation with podcast host Natalie Brunell, Sigel detailed Bitcoin’s recurring four-year pattern: three years of outperformance followed by a steep correction in the fourth. As the previous halving occurred in April 2024, Sigel predicts 2024 and 2025 could be strong years. “That down year typically is the second year after the halving,” Sigel explained. “The Bitcoin halving occurred in April of this year. So 2024 [will be a] strong year, 2025 should be a strong year.” He added that if Bitcoin repeats even half of its smallest trough-to-peak appreciation (2,000%) from past cycles, it could climb from $18,000 to $180,000 by the current cycle’s peak. #3 Robert Kiyosaki: $350,000 Best-selling author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Robert Kiyosaki, projects Bitcoin could hit $350,000 by 2025. Kiyosaki has long advocated for Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional financial uncertainties and continues to encourage long-term investment in the digital asset. #4 Bernstein: $200,000 Investment research firm Bernstein published a 160-page “Black Book” on October 22, forecasting that Bitcoin could climb to $200,000 by the end of 2025. The report asserts that a “new institutional era” is underway, propelled by AI integration, developments in Bitcoin and stablecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and pro-crypto regulatory steps. Bernstein suggests these combined forces could accelerate institutional adoption and further drive Bitcoin’s price upward. #5 H.C. Wainwright & Co.: $225,000 In an investor note earlier this year, H.C. Wainwright & Co. revised its 2025 Bitcoin price target from $145,000 to $225,000, citing a mix of historical trends, macroeconomic signals, and evolving institutional sentiment. “We estimate BTC will reach a cycle high of $225,000 by YE2025,” wrote analysts at the investment bank, established in 1868. They underscored the potential impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs gaining traction, adding that “accelerating institutional investor and corporate adoption” would likely bolster Bitcoin’s market cap. Another factor is the possibility of a more favorable regulatory climate under a new US administration. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction While their base-case forecast projects Bitcoin achieving a roughly $4.5 trillion market cap—about 25% of gold’s valuation—the note hints at even higher price potential if the US government under Donald Trump were to adopt BTC as a strategic reserve asset. #6 Standard Chartered: $250,000 Standard Chartered, having correctly predicted Bitcoin’s climb to $100,000 in 2024, now sees an ongoing rally that might drive the price to $200,000 or higher by the end of 2025—potentially even $250,000 if certain conditions are met. According to Geoff Kendrick, the global head of digital assets research, “We would turn even more bullish if BTC saw more rapid uptake by US retirement funds, global sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), or a potential US strategic reserve fund.” Kendrick notes that a key spur for institutional demand could be the pro-Bitcoin stance of the Trump administration, which campaigned on promises that include a possible national Bitcoin stockpile. He also underscored the significance of growing options trading for Bitcoin ETFs, particularly in drawing in “long-only” investors, such as pension funds and retirement accounts. If even 1% of the massive $40 trillion US retirement market flows into Bitcoin, Kendrick suggests the impact on price could be profound. #7 Bitfinex: $200,000 Crypto exchange Bitfinex published a report on December 10 positing that Bitcoin’s price may approach $200,000 by mid-2025. The analysis states that the minimum mid-year price in the current cycle could be around $145,000, with a bullish scenario pushing it to $200,000. Bitfinex researchers draw parallels to the 2021 cycle, when Bitcoin rallied some 40% above its moving averages, pointing to the possibility of even higher peaks. However, they note “the trend of diminishing returns observed in recent cycles,” suggesting a more moderate surge to the $160,000–$200,000 range by mid-2025. #8 Peter Brandt: $125,000–$150,000 Veteran trader Peter Brandt forecasts Bitcoin’s next major bull market high could materialize around late August or early September 2025, potentially in the $125,000–$150,000 range. In a June market commentary, Brandt underscored the role of halving dates in synchronizing with past bull runs, stating that “the number of weeks from the start of each bull market cycle (the low following a 75%-plus decline) to the Halving dates has been almost equal to the number of weeks from the Halving dates to the subsequent bull market highs.” Brandt also pointed to an “inverted parabolic curve” across multiple bull markets. Should this pattern continue, Bitcoin’s peak during the current cycle might align closely with the $130,000–$150,000 zone. At press time, BTC traded at $93,061.

Ethereum introduced smart contracts, enabling a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. These include decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon, which improved transaction speed and efficiency. In the past 24 hours, the price of ETH has experienced a decrease of 2.5%, currently trading at $3,171.30. This downward trend has moved its market capitalization to $381.56b.

Speaking to Bloomberg Television during a forum, Quarles clarified misconceptions about the central bank’s autonomy. Quarles stated there are several structural protections that prevent the president from exerting undue influence on the central bank. “ There’s a fair bit of misunderstanding about what Fed independence is. Fed independence doesn’t mean that the president can’t express a view on Fed policy ,” Quarles said. “ The Fed can’t really be affected by the president’s bullying pulpit. Political pressure exists, but there aren’t political levers to compromise independence. ” These remarks come amid lingering concerns stemming from Trump’s sharp criticisms of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last year. Trump has also reiterated he will not reappoint Powell when his term ends in 2026. Fed policy faces political pressure During his campaign, Trump frequently criticized the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies, claiming that interest rates remain too high. At a press conference held at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump accused the outgoing administration of exacerbating economic difficulties. “We are inheriting a difficult situation, and they’re trying to make it worse. Inflation is still raging, and interest rates are far too high,” Trump said. The Federal Reserve reduced interest rates three times in 2024, marking a shift from its aggressive hikes in 2022 and 2023. The most recent cut occurred in September, bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75%-5%. However, inflation data at the end of 2024 suggested that progress in curbing price increases had stalled, even as the labor market remained resilient. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy, is scheduled to meet at the end of January. This meeting will occur shortly after Trump takes office, adding to the political spotlight on the central bank’s decisions. Quarles addressed other policy considerations under Trump’s incoming administration, including tariffs and deportations. While he acknowledged that tariffs can influence inflation, he downplayed their long-term impact. “ Tariffs by themselves shouldn’t be inflationary, although at the margin, they could lead the Fed to lower rates, ” he explained. The former Fed Vice Chair also noted that material deportations, which Trump has indicated will be a priority, are unlikely to significantly affect the labor market. Economic outlook and scares of inflation Just a week away from Trump’s Inauguration , the Federal Reserve is facing heightened criticism, particularly regarding its strategy to tackle inflation and sustain the labor market. Federal Reserve officials have raised concerns about how the new administration’s policies might challenge the central bank’s commitment to its 2% inflation target. During his first term, Trump often criticized Powell for resisting calls to cut interest rates. The president-elect’s public rebukes of the Fed chair broke with traditional norms of respecting the central bank’s independence. The 47th President of the US also suggested during the campaign that he should have a say in monetary policy, stating, “ I made a lot of money, so I should have at least a say. ” Looking at the current market sentiment, investors have adjusted expectations for 2025, pricing in fewer interest rate cuts than initially anticipated. Moreover, stronger-than-expected December employment data led major banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, to revise their forecasts. Money markets now anticipate only one rate cut in 2025, likely in October. Quarles suggested that markets are now aligning more closely with the Fed’s likely actions. “ Markets are pricing in Fed moves more accurately this year than last year, ” he remarked.

Meanwhile, blockchain developments reveal promising trends for selected projects. Blockchain data shows crypto whales are scooping PEPE tokens, with substantial withdrawals and purchases seen over the past 24 hours.

Further details show the trader acquired JASMY tokens worth $1.54 million (47.4 million tokens) yesterday, Sunday. Meanwhile, another whale used a different approach. While “0x8f5” spent around $5 million to purchase PEPE directly from Binance, whale “0xb1a” swapped 3.72 million USD Coin for Pepe Coin. Investors are actively purchasing the altcoin after the latest price dip. That signals their trust in PEPE’s rebound, and the trends have sparked speculations about the meme token’s potential bounce-back. PEPE’s current price action The frog-themed token traded at $0.0000169 after losing nearly 20% of its value within the past seven days. Chart by Coinmarketcap PEPE plunged by 4.90% in the previous 24 hours, and the increased selling pressure suggests more pain. The altcoin’s price doesn’t reflect the optimism from large-scale investors as it mirrors the prevailing broad market bearishness. Nevertheless, Coinglass data showcases some hope. PEPE’s open interest has increased by 2.35% to surpass 452.42 million. That indicates improved strength and sentiment behind Pepe Coin’s price movements. Nonetheless, the prevailing sentiments show a bearish edge, with volatility of above 10% and slumping fear and greed index. PEPE price prediction Broad market sentiments remain crucial for PEPE’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies display bearishness as Bitcoin bulls fail to hold above $100K. However, bullish prospects emerge ahead of the US presidential inauguration. The markets await the first-of-a-kind pro-crypto leadership under Donald Trump.

However, the prevailing outlook depicts a shift in trajectory. The indicator has displayed a buy signal, suggesting imminent bounce-backs for the altcoin. These trends could see PEPE gaining over 8% from its current value to trade at $0.00001850. Extended recoveries would propel the meme token to $0.0000190. Broad-based rallies at this level will likely catalyze robust uptrends to historic peaks. The ongoing whale interest supports the anticipated PEPE recovery.

The Central Bank of Russia announced that as of January 11, 2025 , residents must register foreign trade contracts involving digital rights , such as cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities, with authorized banks. These measures aim to increase transparency, align with global anti-money laundering (AML) standards, and ensure compliance in foreign exchange operations involving digital assets . Key Highlights of the New Regulations 1. Registration of Foreign Trade Contracts Russian residents engaging in cross-border transactions involving cryptocurrencies must register their foreign trade contracts with authorized banks. 2. Mandatory Documentation Residents are required to provide banks with: Details of the trade contract. Information about the cryptocurrency or tokenized securities used. Evidence of transaction completion, such as receipts or blockchain records. 3. Enhanced Monitoring The regulation allows Russian banks to monitor and verify compliance, ensuring that transactions align with national financial laws and international AML standards . Objectives of the Regulation 1. Improving Transparency By mandating documentation, the central bank aims to reduce illicit activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing, associated with crypto transactions. 2. Strengthening Compliance Aligns Russia’s digital asset regulations with global frameworks like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards. 3. Enhancing Tax Oversight Registered contracts and transaction records enable better tracking of taxable income from cryptocurrency transactions. Implications for Individuals and Businesses 1. Increased Compliance Burden Individuals and businesses conducting cross-border crypto transactions will face additional administrative tasks to meet documentation requirements. 2. Greater Scrutiny Banks and regulators will have more visibility into crypto-related activities, potentially deterring non-compliant or unauthorized transfers. 3. Potential Impact on Adoption The added requirements may discourage some users from engaging in cross-border crypto transfers, particularly smaller traders. Comparison with Other Nations’ Regulations Country Crypto Regulation Focus Cross-Border Requirements Russia Documentation for cross-border transfers Contract registration and transaction details United States Reporting for tax compliance Reporting via Form 8949 for crypto income European Union AML and transparency Comprehensive KYC for crypto exchanges China Strict ban on crypto transactions No official framework for cross-border crypto Russia’s approach focuses on monitoring and documenting transactions rather than outright restrictions, balancing regulatory oversight with limited market freedom. Challenges and Criticisms 1. Increased Bureaucracy Critics argue that the documentation requirements may create unnecessary hurdles for businesses and individuals, potentially slowing crypto adoption. 2. Privacy Concerns The regulation mandates detailed transaction disclosures, raising concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive information. 3. Risk of Overregulation Overregulation could stifle innovation in Russia’s growing cryptocurrency sector, pushing users toward less transparent alternatives or foreign platforms.

Platforms give away tokens to their community members to build hype and encourage usage. Users can later hold or trade them in the hope that their value rises with project growth. Some airdropped tokens are worthless, but others can end up costing hundreds or even thousands of dollars over time. You'll find more tips at the end of this listicle, but before that, let's look at three of the best airdrops in 2025. 1. Ambire Legends Ambire Legends by open-source self-custodial wallet Ambire welcomes airdrop farmers, including by easing onboarding. The gamified campaign allows users to adopt account abstraction and smart accounts seamlessly. They can add any EVM network and use smart accounts without changing their wallet address. Externally owned accounts (EOAs) like Metamask are called ""basic accounts"" in Ambire. Airdrop farmers link existing EOAs to a smart account created in the extension in a straightforward and highly intuitive process. They are motivated to create smart accounts because Legends boasts one of the most creative airdrop farming mechanisms. Once they enroll in the campaign, they earn XP points via on-chain activity on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Scroll, and Optimism. Earning XP results in a $WALLET airdrop allocation, best achieved via video influencers, articles, and social media activity, mainly on Reddit and X. Legends participants get $WALLET rewards based on how many points they earn. The total allocation incentives equal 195 million $WALLET tokens. The token price determines the dollar value equivalent, with the total value corresponding to around $2 million based on the current price. Users can choose an RPG-styled character to play the game after creating an Ambire account and connecting a wallet to the Legends dApp. The characters feature creative designations such as Degenerate, Layerbinder, Custodian, Shapeshifter, Codeweaver, or Warrior. As players engage in on-chain actions, they advance their character's level and unlock rewards apart from earning XP. Players level up by completing quests, some of which are limited to a specific network. Others are available once daily or repeatable with each transaction made. For example, you can summon an old friend's wallet to prove your value—the older and wiser the address, the higher the potential reward. 2. Paraswap ParaSwap airdrop is taking place as part of the launch of Constellation Network DEX and offers a chance to obtain free tokens. At the time of writing, more than 400 people had accumulated a total of 125,000 $DAG tokens and registered for the PacaSwap Operator Program. Once the raffle is drawn, the user can view their position in the queue in their LatticeExchange account. Constellation's $DAG token is currently undergoing a perfectly normal market pullback, with community members proclaiming they intend to hodl. DAG Community sentiment is 91% bullish at the time of writing, according to Coinmarketcap. 90% of the initial token supply is allocated to participants in Constellation's network. There is no presale or VC allocation. $DAG has a fixed supply on Hypergraph, Constellation's decentralized network. It gives the entire ecosystem liquidity. To get rewards in $PACA, you must create an account at lattice.is and link an X account and a valid DAG address. The token will be airdropped directly to your Stargazer wallet if you are in the Social Rank top 150. Metagraphs, autonomous networks in Constellation, play a crucial role. They process and validate complex data from all sources. The more metagraphs launch on Constellation, the more the DAG token's utility rises, giving the effect of scarcity. 3. Farm Frens Farm Frens , a Telegram-based game developed by Amihan Entertainment, is planning a token launch and airdrop in January 2025. The distribution will reward players based on their in-game activities, such as earning Nuts, Dirt, and Dung and holding specific Everseed NFTs. To participate, players need to connect their wallets through the Farm Frens Telegram mini app. The development of Everseed aims to build a seamless experience with Farm Frens. Beyond the airdrop, the studio plans to unite the games further, hinting at potential interactive features that combine AI and gaming. For example, the first ""Fren,"" the character Amani, was voiced and propelled by AI throughout the game's development. Farming made easy: Find airdrops, set up a wallet, complete tasks, get tokens To start farming, you need to look for airdrops, set up a wallet, and complete the tasks required. Claiming your rewards is the last part. With hundreds of airdrops taking place at any given moment, knowing how to choose the best ones is paramount. Listicles published on reputable outlets and websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko inform of ongoing and upcoming airdrops. Following these sources will keep you updated on the latest opportunities. Most airdrops require compatible wallets. MetaMask, Phantom, and Trust Wallet are popular choices. MetaMask is the go-to option for Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, while Phantom is a trusted Solana wallet. The tasks to claim tokens in airdrops tend to be simple, like retweeting posts, following the project's social media, or using the platform. They help the project gain traction. Some users are asked for their social media details and wallet addresses to confirm participation. Some airdrops provide instant rewards, while others can take up to several months, depending on the project's timeline. Final tips Apart from following reliable airdrop alert sites, stay active in X, Reddit, and Telegram crypto communities. They are gold mines for discovering new opportunities, but be wary of scams at the same time. Set up multiple wallets to keep track of different tokens, and remember that many lucrative projects, like Ambire Legends, require specific wallets.

Paraswap ParaSwap airdrop is taking place as part of the launch of Constellation Network DEX and offers a chance to obtain free tokens. At the time of writing, more than 400 people had accumulated a total of 125,000 $DAG tokens and registered for the PacaSwap Operator Program. Once the raffle is drawn, the user can view their position in the queue in their LatticeExchange account. Constellation's $DAG token is currently undergoing a perfectly normal market pullback, with community members proclaiming they intend to hodl. DAG Community sentiment is 91% bullish at the time of writing, according to Coinmarketcap. 90% of the initial token supply is allocated to participants in Constellation's network. There is no presale or VC allocation. $DAG has a fixed supply on Hypergraph, Constellation's decentralized network. It gives the entire ecosystem liquidity. To get rewards in $PACA, you must create an account at lattice.is and link an X account and a valid DAG address. The token will be airdropped directly to your Stargazer wallet if you are in the Social Rank top 150. Metagraphs, autonomous networks in Constellation, play a crucial role. They process and validate complex data from all sources. The more metagraphs launch on Constellation, the more the DAG token's utility rises, giving the effect of scarcity. 3. Farm Frens Farm Frens , a Telegram-based game developed by Amihan Entertainment, is planning a token launch and airdrop in January 2025. The distribution will reward players based on their in-game activities, such as earning Nuts, Dirt, and Dung and holding specific Everseed NFTs. To participate, players need to connect their wallets through the Farm Frens Telegram mini app. The development of Everseed aims to build a seamless experience with Farm Frens. Beyond the airdrop, the studio plans to unite the games further, hinting at potential interactive features that combine AI and gaming. For example, the first ""Fren,"" the character Amani, was voiced and propelled by AI throughout the game's development. Farming made easy: Find airdrops, set up a wallet, complete tasks, get tokens To start farming, you need to look for airdrops, set up a wallet, and complete the tasks required. Claiming your rewards is the last part. With hundreds of airdrops taking place at any given moment, knowing how to choose the best ones is paramount. Listicles published on reputable outlets and websites like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko inform of ongoing and upcoming airdrops. Following these sources will keep you updated on the latest opportunities. Most airdrops require compatible wallets. MetaMask, Phantom, and Trust Wallet are popular choices. MetaMask is the go-to option for Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, while Phantom is a trusted Solana wallet. The tasks to claim tokens in airdrops tend to be simple, like retweeting posts, following the project's social media, or using the platform. They help the project gain traction. Some users are asked for their social media details and wallet addresses to confirm participation. Some airdrops provide instant rewards, while others can take up to several months, depending on the project's timeline. Final tips Apart from following reliable airdrop alert sites, stay active in X, Reddit, and Telegram crypto communities. They are gold mines for discovering new opportunities, but be wary of scams at the same time. Set up multiple wallets to keep track of different tokens, and remember that many lucrative projects, like Ambire Legends, require specific wallets.

A tweet from the crypto news platform BSCN highlighted key factors contributing to optimism surrounding XRP’s future. XRP POISED FOR LIFTOFF AS PRO-CRYPTO SEC LEADERSHIP SIGNALS POTENTIAL RIPPLE VICTORY – The ongoing legal battle between @Ripple and the U.S. SEC has reached a pivotal juncture, with recent developments suggesting a favorable outcome for Ripple and its native cryptocurrency,… pic.twitter.com/fXxd7wsIH6 — BSCN (@BSCNews) January 10, 2025 Regulatory Shifts and Leadership Changes With the incoming President Donald Trump, who has nominated crypto-friendly individuals such as Paul Atkins for critical regulatory roles, the broader cryptocurrency community is anticipating significant changes in the regulatory landscape. Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner known for his market-friendly approach, is expected to advocate for more transparent and supportive regulations for the cryptocurrency sector. This shift in leadership has led many to speculate about the potential impact on the SEC’s legal actions, including its appeal in the Ripple case . According to BSCN’s tweet, Carlos Guzman, a research analyst at GSR, noted that if the SEC’s appeal is dismissed or the new leadership pursues a settlement, it could mark a landmark victory for Ripple. Such an outcome would resolve lingering legal uncertainties and bolster investor confidence in XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications and ETF Potential A favorable legal resolution for Ripple has also sparked conversations about the possibility of an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has predicted an increase in crypto ETFs, driven by the successful rollout of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Balchunas suggests that XRP could be among the frontrunners for ETF approval, though he emphasized that the process might require several months of regulatory review. An XRP ETF approval would likely introduce the cryptocurrency to a broader range of institutional investors, further enhancing its market appeal and liquidity. The resolved legal status and expanded investment opportunities position XRP as a key asset to watch in 2025. Ripple’s Technological Advancements Beyond the legal and regulatory developments, Ripple continues to innovate and expand its offerings. One of its latest initiatives includes the launch of a new stablecoin, RLUSD. This asset aims to boost Ripple’s presence as a credible payment solution, particularly in cross-border transactions. By integrating new technologies and addressing specific market needs, Ripple is strengthening its ecosystem and increasing the utility of its payment solutions. As the situation unfolds, Ripple and XRP will likely remain at the center of discussions about cryptocurrency regulation and innovation, with the potential to influence the broader digital asset market.

Today, the dollar surged to a two-year peak against major currencies, supported by a payrolls report released on Friday. The report revealed an addition of 256,000 jobs in December. As a result, stock markets in China, India, and South Korea experienced a downturn. According to reports, South Korea’s Kospi declined 1.1%, India’s Sensex fell 0.8%, and Japanese markets have been closed today. In addition, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index experienced a 1.2% decline, while the CSI 300 in mainland China experienced a 0.5% decline. Jason Lui, head of Asia-Pacific equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas, said, “People are surprised by the economic strength in the US With US interest rates so high, you will have a liquidity drain in Asia, with capital flowing to the US or staying there.” Notably, the dollar index tracks the US currency against the yen, euro, and other major currencies. It reached its highest level since November 2022. Additionally, the December report blew past consensus estimates and raised concern that a strong economy could slow the Fed’s pace of rate cuts. US Dec payrolls +256k (exp +165k) and unemp fell -0.1% to 4.1%, but wages growth slightly less than exp at +0.3%m/3.9%yoy. Jobs data is noisy, but likely too strong for Fed so adds to case to “take time to assess” with a Jan pause & a March cut is now 50/50 (EvercoreISI charts) pic.twitter.com/j5wg763hHu — Shane Oliver (@ShaneOliverAMP) January 10, 2025 Markets are becoming more and more unpredictable, but one thing is for sure: the US economy has had a significant effect on global markets. What next for Asian markets? Sunil Tirumalai, head of Asian equity strategy at UBS, said, “Emerging market equities traditionally perform better when US interest rates are lower […] The Fed not cutting and weak currencies means less room for Asian rate cuts.” Notably, mainland Chinese equities have experienced a consistent 17% decline since their peak on October 8, 2018. This is because the market became increasingly apprehensive about the economic repercussions of Donald Trump’s second term and as expectations for a bazooka-style stimulus from Beijing diminished. In the same light, Sunil Tirumalai also acknowledges that China is still in a bear market. “Some stimulus measures have been a positive surprise […] The extension of the trade-in scheme to a wider array of consumer goods, for example, came earlier than we thought.” However, Jason Lui explained that mainland investors were continuing to transfer funds from low-yield savings accounts to the equity market. He stated, “The onshore [Chinese] market is still more resilient relative to external noise.” Meanwhile, oil prices climbed to a four-month high on Friday as the United States imposed broad new penalties against Russian oil. Additionally, Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.6% to $81 per barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose 1.7% to $77.90 per barrel. Australian stocks decline The Australian shares fell to a two-week low, with a sell-off in technology firms and banks leading the way. This decline was also precipitated by a surprise increase in US employment data. Apparently, the S&P/ASX 200 Index closed at 8,191.20, a decrease of 102.2 points, or 1.2 percent. This is in response to a sell-off on Wall Street. Nine of the 11 industry groups finished in the red. The All Ordinaries index experienced a 1.3% decline. Additionally, Commonwealth Bank experienced a 2.1% decline to $152.76, while NAB experienced a 1.9% decline to $37.22, Westpac experienced a 2.2% decline to $31.87, and ANZ experienced a 1.3% decline to $28.90. Technology equities that are sensitive to interest rates also experienced large losses. WiseTech, a software company, experienced a 3.6% decline to $121.02, while NextDC experienced a 4% decline to $14.79. Bank of America deputy US chief economist Aditya Bhave said the possibility of an interest rate hike should also be considered. He explained, “Our base case has the Fed on an extended hold […] But we think the risks for the next move are skewed toward a hike. The bar is high since the Fed still thinks rates are restrictive. But hikes will likely be in play if year-on-year core inflation exceeds 3%, or long-term inflation expectations become unanchored.” Meanwhile, as the US dollar was strengthened, the wounded currency traded at $61.34. This level was almost five years below its previous low. According to analysts at the National Australia Bank, the current decline has the potential to exacerbate short-term inflationary pressures.

However, he says he is not against cryptocurrency as a whole. In an interview with CBS News on Jan. 12, Dimon has reiterated his stance on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and cryptocurrency as a whole. Speaking to Lesley Stahl, he claims that he is “not against crypto” but he still believes that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. In fact, he compared people who use Bitcoin to smokers. Dimon acknowledges their right to trade Bitcoin, but he believes they should not hold it. “So, I just don’t feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don’t think you should smoke,” said Dimon. Moreover, Jamie Dimon declared that he views Bitcoin as a currency mainly used to facilitate criminal activities such as money laundering, sex trafficking and as payment for ransomware. The JPMorgan CEO’s recent statements indicate that though Dimon has softened towards crypto, his stance on Bitcoin specifically has not changed. You might also like: Jamie Dimon, who once vowed to shut Bitcoin, eyed by Trump for Treasury Secretary Even though a report by Crypto ISAC found that cash remains the preferred payment tool for illicit activity. Out of the total volume of estimated criminal transactions, only 0.34% of the transaction volume consists of cryptocurrencies. In addition, the U.S. Treasury also confirmed that cash continues to be the primary method for money laundering due to its anonymous and stable nature. In July 2024, Jamie Dimon was rumored to be Trump’s pick for Secretary of Treasury when he was running for president. Many traders at the time were worried that Dimon’s harsh stance on Bitcoin could spell out the end of crypto in the U.S. Jamie Dimon’s past sentiments on Bitcoin In the past, Jamie Dimon has called Bitcoin a “fraud” currency, believing it to be a channel for tax evasion, criminals and drug traffickers. At one point, Dimon even said that he would close down Bitcoin if he were serving as the government. Dimon has been vocal about his opposition towards Bitcoin since as early as 2014. In 2014, Dimon said Bitcoin was a “terrible store of value,” arguing that it could be easily replicated “over and over” and lacked the legitimacy of government-backed currencies. He even said that he would fire JPMorgan traders if they were found to be buying and selling Bitcoin. Though in March 2024, he claimed that he would be willing to support an individual’s right to purchase Bitcoin. Despite his strong opposition towards Bitcoin, Dimon does however support blockchain technology, praising it on multiple occasions. Even more astounding is the fact that Dimon’s bank, JPMorgan Chase, is an authorized participant of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value dipped below $93,000 during the European hours, representing a 1.6% drop on the day, according to data source CoinDesk. Prices looked set to test the support zone near $92,000, which has consistently acted as a floor since late November. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, was down over 3%, with major coins like XRP, ADA, and DOGE posting bigger losses. In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 traded 0.3% lower, pointing to an extension of Friday's 1.5% drop that pushed the index to the lowest since early November. The dollar index (DXY) neared 110 for the first time since late 2022, with elevated Treasury yields supporting further gains. Data released Friday showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 256,000 in December, the most since March, surpassing expectations for 160,000 job additions and the previous figure of 212,000 by a big margin. The jobless rate declined to 4.1% from 4.2%, and the average hourly earnings came in slightly lower than expected at 0.3% month-on-month and 3.9% year-on-year. That prompted Goldman Sachs to push out the next interest rate cut to June from March. ""Our economists now expect the Fed to cut just twice in 2025 (Jun/Dec vs Mar/Jun/Dec previously), with another rate cut in June 2026, Goldman's Economic Research note to clients on Jan. 10 said. ""If December's FOMC decision marked a significant shift back towards inflation in the Fed's relative weighting of risks, the December jobs report may have completed the pendulum swing. The soft average hourly earnings figure kept the print from sending a more alarming re-heating signal, but the case for cutting to mitigate risks to the labor market has faded into the background,"" the note explained. The Fed's rate-cutting cycle began in September when the official reduced the benchmark borrowing cost by 50 basis points. The bank delivered quarter-point rate cuts in the following months before pausing in December to signal fewer rate cuts in 2025. BTC has surged over 50% since the first rate cut on Sept. 18, hitting record highs above $108,000 at one point. While Goldman and JPMorgan still expect rate cuts, Bank of America (BofA) fears an extended pause, with risks skewed in favor of a rate hike or renewed tightening. Note that the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield, which is sensitive to interest rate, growth and inflation expectations, has already surged by 100 basis points since the Sept. 18 rate cut. ""We think the cutting cycle is over ... Our base case has the Fed on an extended hold. But we think the risks for the next move are skewed toward a hike,"" BofA analysts said in a note, according to Reuters. ING said, ""The market is right to see the risk of an extended pause from the Fed"" in the light of the recent economic reports. ""That view will only increase if core inflation comes in at 0.3% month-on-month for a fifth consecutive month next week,"" ING said in a note to clients over the weekend. The December consumer price index report is scheduled for release on Jan. 15. Some observers are worried that base effects could accelerate the headline CPI and the core CPI, adding to the hawkish Fed narrative.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|federal reserve,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-13 09:57:47

Apart from the scheduled index releases, at least four Fed speaker events are also expected to take place this week. Let’s analyse the scenario a bit deeper. Ready? Key Index Releases This Week in the US US Core PPI YoY The US Core Producer Price index, which measures average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, excluding volatile products like food and energy, will be released tomorrow. In October, it rose from 3.2% to 3.4%. In November, it showed no change. The expectation is that it will drop to 3.2%. US Core Inflation Rate YoY The US Core Inflation Rate index, which evaluates changes in prices that consumers pay for a basket of goods, excluding volatile food and energy, will be released the day after tomorrow. In September, it grew from 3.2% to 3.3%. In the last three releases (September, October and November), it demonstrated no change. The expectation is that it will show no change this time as well. US Retail Sales MoM The US Retail Sales MoM index, which gives an aggregated measure of sales of retail goods and services over a period of a month, will be released on Thursday. In November, it climbed from 0.5% to 0.7%. The expectation is that it will drop from 0.7% to 0.5%. US Philadelphia Fed CAPEX The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, which measures the direction of change in overall business activity in the US state, will be released on Thursday. In December, it declined from 24.9 points to 18.8 points. In January 2024, it was 7.5 points. In September, it touched an yearly peak of 25 points. US Housing Starts The US Housing Starts index, which examines the number of new residential construction projects that have begun during any particular month, will be released on Friday. In November, it dropped from 1.31 million to 1.29 million. The expectation is that it will rise to 1.31 million from 1.29 million. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump’s Inaugural Crypto Ball: $100K Tickets & $1M Package with Private Dinner , Key Fed Speeches This Week in the US Kansas City Fed President and CEO Jeffrey Schmid will address the press tomorrow. New York Fed President and CEO John Williams, Richmond Fed President and CEO Tom Barkin, and Minneapolis Fed President and CEO Neel Kashkari will address the press separately the day after tomorrow. In conclusion, these economic events are likely to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency industry. A potential drop in US Core PPI or inflation rates could bolster Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as reduced inflation signals lower interest rates. Retail sales date may indicate shifts in consumer spending, influencing crypto adoption . The speeches by Fed officials could hint at future monetary policies, impacting investor sentiment toward risk assets like cryptocurrencies. If housing starts or manufacturing indices show growth, they may counter crypto gains, as traditional markets may seem more stable. This week’s date will be crucial in shaping the crypto market’s trajectory. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This positions Ethereum ahead of its competitors, further solidifying its dominance in the decentralized ecosystem. Meanwhile, Solana secured the third position with a revenue of $374 million, showcasing strong performance but still trailing Ethereum by a significant margin. NOW: Ethereum ranked 1st in 2024 for the highest revenue among blockchains, with $1.9B. Solana finished 3rd with $374m in revenue last year. pic.twitter.com/xOVO8lRhHv — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) January 10, 2025 Ethereum Retests Key Channel Ethereum is currently retesting a crucial price channel, a formation that could signal a major market shift. Historical data suggests that when Ethereum follows the path of converging consolidation and channel patterns, it often leads to significant price surges. If this trend holds true, investors might see a substantial upward movement in the coming months. Ethereum Spot ETF Outflows Despite Ethereum’s revenue success, on January 10, Ethereum spot ETFs experienced a total net outflow of $68.48 million. The largest contributor to this outflow was Fidelity’s Ethereum ETF (FETH), which saw a notable $65.43 million exit in a single day. This could indicate a temporary shift in investor sentiment or a response to broader market conditions. On January 10, the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETFs was $68.4788 million. The Ethereum spot ETF with the largest net outflow in a single day yesterday was Fidelity ETF FETH, with a net outflow of $65.43 million in a single day. https://t.co/Tvs2oCS03I pic.twitter.com/XK8da93TOA — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2025 Looking Ahead As Ethereum continues to retest key levels, the market is closely watching for potential breakout opportunities. While recent outflows from Ethereum spot ETFs have raised concerns, the larger narrative of Ethereum’s dominance and historical price patterns remains bullish. With a strong revenue performance and potential for a surge, Ethereum’s prospects in the coming months look promising. #Ethereum is currently retesting the channel If $ETH follows its history of the formations of converging consolidation and channel patterns, a massive surge could occur in a few months. pic.twitter.com/cw7UTbp20l — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) January 11, 2025 Conclusion Ethereum’s revenue performance in 2024 places it firmly at the top of the blockchain sector. While short-term outflows from Ethereum ETFs may cause some hesitation, long-term investors are likely to remain optimistic about Ethereum’s future, especially given its historical patterns and current market behavior.

Darunter versteht man grundsätzlich Investoren, Unternehmen oder institutionelle Anleger, die über enorme Mengen an der jeweiligen Kryptowährung verfügen. Ihre Käufe und Verkäufe haben großen Einfluss auf die Kryptomärkte. Das gilt vorwiegend dann, wenn sie große Mengen ihrer Assets bewegen. Reich und mächtig Ihre Bezeichnung ist eine Analogie zum Meer. Dort sind die Wale so mächtig, dass sie die Wassermassen in Bewegung setzen können, das gilt auch für ihr Krypto-Pendant. Die Größe, ab wann ein Investor als Wal bezeichnet werden kann, ist nicht festgelegt. Doch wenn jemand zumindest 1.000 Bitcoin in seinem Besitz hat, kann man von einem Wal sprechen. Immerhin handelt es sich dabei um einen Vermögenswert von rund 100 Millionen Dollar. Diese Definition gilt sinngemäß auch für andere Kryptowährungen, egal ob es sich dabei um Ethereum, XRP oder kleinere Coins handelt. Die drei größten Bitcoin-Wale sind: Satoshi Nakamoto: Der Gründer von Bitcoin verfügt über 1,1 Millionen Bitcoin Binance: Die Kryptobörse hat rund 550.000 Bitcoins in ihrem Bestand BlackRock: Der größte Vermögensverwalter der Welt hält rund 300.000 Bitcoins Während Satoshi Nakamotos Bitcoin-Bestand seit Langem unverändert ist, zählen Binance und BlackRock zu den beiden wichtigsten Playern am Markt. Ihre Aktivitäten werden genau beobachtet und analysiert, schließlich geben diese Aufschluss über die jeweilige Unternehmensstrategie. Stabilitätsfaktor und Geldmagnet Egal, ob sie große Transaktionen durchführen, die Liquidität beeinflussen, oder neue Produkte auf den Markt bringen, Krypto-Wale dominieren den Markt. Ihre Aktivitäten können auch zu verstärkter Volatilität führen, was jeder Anleger zu spüren bekommt. Doch der Einstieg von Finanzgiganten wie BlackRock hat den Markt auch stabilisiert und weiterentwickelt. Ein wesentlicher Faktor dabei waren die ersten Bitcoin-Spot-ETFs, die vor rund einem Jahr in den USA zugelassen wurden. Seither fließt viel Kapital in Bitcoin und hat dafür gesorgt, dass die Mutter aller Kryptowährungen neue Kursrekorde erreicht hat. Von den wertvollen Hinweisen profitieren Die Beobachtung der Krypto-Wale liefert also wertvolle Hinweise auf mögliche neue Trends und löst Signale aus. Doch nicht jeder Anleger hat die Zeit und Mittel, den Markt konsequent zu beobachten. Hier setzt eine neue Kryptowährung auf, die dem einfachen Privatanleger jene Informationen zur Verfügung stellt, über die Krypto-Wale verfügen. Hier steigt Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) in den Markt ein. Der Pepe im Nadelstreif setzt nicht nur auf die populären Pepe-Coins, sondern hat sich primär zum Ziel gesetzt, seine Investoren mit den heißesten News der Kryptowelt zu versorgen. So sollen die Anleger in den Genuss jener Informationen kommen, die Krypto-Wale für ihren Erfolg an den Kryptomärkten nutzen. Die Wall Street Pepe-Community bekommt Zugriff auf Live-Handelssignale ebenso wie den Zutritt zu privaten und exklusiven Telegram-Gruppen, in denen die Anleger ihre Erfahrungen und ihr Wissen teilen. Mit Profi-Tools am Puls der Zeit Daneben warten eine innovative Analyse-Plattform und praktische Tools für den privaten Gebrauch. Dazu zählen Charting-Werkzeuge ebenso wie Kursindikatoren und eine Presales-Übersicht. Damit wollen die Wall Street Pepe Emittenten ihren Investoren jene Werkzeuge in die Hand geben, die für Krypto-Wale längst selbstverständlich geworden sind. Professionalität im Trading ist schließlich eine Grundvoraussetzung für den Erfolg. Das haben auch die Anleger von Wall Street Pepe erkannt und bereits mehr als 47 Millionen Dollar im Presale investiert. Noch kostet 1 $WEPE nur $0.00036646 , doch die nächste Preiserhöhung steht bereits bevor.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Krypto-Wal,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-13 10:10:10

Here are some organizations and analysts' Bitcoin price predictions for 2025. Fundstrat’s famed Bitcoin bull Tom Lee remains extremely optimistic, predicting that Bitcoin could surge to as high as $250,000 by 2025. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, expects Bitcoin to reach $180,000. His forecast is based on Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and its growing appeal to institutional investors. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” has one of the highest predictions, expecting Bitcoin to reach $350,000 by 2025. Kiyosaki cites distrust of fiat currencies and Bitcoin’s growing appeal as “people’s money” as key drivers. Investment research firm Bernstein predicts Bitcoin will climb to $200,000. Wainwright analysts predict that Bitcoin will reach $225,000 by 2025 due to increased institutional interest and its role in diversifying portfolios amid global economic uncertainty. Standard Chartered Bank remains bullish with a $250,000 price target. Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex echoes Bernstein's prediction, expecting Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by 2025. Veteran trader Peter Brandt offers a more conservative but optimistic range, predicting that Bitcoin will peak between $125,000 and $150,000 in August 2025. *This is not investment advice.

If confirmed for the position, the investor who co-founded Key Square Group says he will resign from the company and divest his investments. Bitcoin Exposure Through IBIT A document released on Saturday by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) revealed Bessent’s ownership of the stake in a BTC ETF. It showed that the prospective government official held between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) shares. The document also highlighted other investments made by the 62-year-old, including interests in the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, Invesco’s QQQ Trust, and its S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF. It also listed a residential property in the Bahamas worth $5 million and an art collection priced at at least $1 million. In total, Bessent revealed holdings estimated at about $521 million, although analysts believe his portfolio could be worth much more as he is only required to list the value of his assets within broad ranges. U.S. laws require high-ranking government officers to disclose their investments as well as plans for divestments if any of their holdings may pose a conflict of interest. Bessent, who was nominated to the powerful Treasury docket by Trump on November 22, 2024, is a well-known crypto supporter, previously describing digital assets as “integral to economic freedom and innovation.” He beat out a long list of contenders, including Cantor-Fitzgerald CEO and co-chair of the Trump transition team Howard Lutnick, ex-Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, Tennessee lawmaker William Hargety, and Apollo Global executive Marc Rowan. Lutnick was picked to lead the Commerce Department. Trump has also appointed several other crypto supporters to key positions in his administration, including Robert F. Kennedy as Secretary for Health and Human Services, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead a new department to streamline government efficiency, and David Sacks as his crypto and AI czar . Will Bessent Liquidate BTC Position? According to the OGE filing, Bessent will resign from his position as Chief Investment Officer at Key Square Group immediately following his confirmation by the Senate as Treasury Secretary and wind down his interest in the company within 90 days. A Bloomberg report also indicates that, like the assets held through his macro hedge fund, Bessent will liquidate his crypto ETF position. However, Matthew Sigel, head of digital research at VanEck, has questioned Bloomberg’s reporting, pointing out that while Bessent footnoted his divestment of other assets, he did not do the same for his IBIT holdings, suggesting he might be keeping it. This view was reinforced by Swan Bitcoin’s Steven Lubka, who asserted in a January 12 post on X that the Treasury Secretary nominee will not be disposing of his Bitcoin position but will continue to hold it.

Where Next? It has been another interesting week for the cryptocurrency market, during which numerous leading digital assets experienced enhanced volatility. Ripple’s XRP was no exception, with its price plunging below $2.25 on January 9 but soaring to almost $2.60 two days later. The most recent market decline affected XRP, and it is currently worth approximately $2.41(per CoinGecko’s data), representing a mere 1% increase on a weekly scale. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko One popular X user who has observed XRP’s recent performance is CRYPTOWZRD. The analyst suggested that the token “has flipped previous resistance to support” of around $2 and is now ready to pump to a new all-time high of $4 and then $8. The X user said such a scenario would mirror the pre-bull run in 2017 and the subsequent rally the following year. For their part, WSB Trader Rocko described XRP’s price chart as “the most bullish in crypto.” The X user claimed that the recent launch of Ripple’s stablecoin (RLUSD) and the company’s potential connections with Donald Trump’s upcoming administration could fuel a fresh peak for the token’s valuation. Last month , the veteran trader Peter Brandt also maintained that XRP has “the most powerful chart in all of crypto world.” Earlier this month, he chipped in again, predicting that the asset’s market capitalization could explode above $500 billion, citing the formation of a “half-mast flag.” It is interesting to note that Brandt’s renewed optimism about XRP contrasts with his predominant skepticism in the past. In November 2020, shortly before the US SEC issued the lawsuit against Ripple, he opined that the asset “would have been declared as a security” if the watchdog “understood cryptos.” Brandt continued his bashing manifest in the following years. Last spring, he assumed the XRP/BTC chart “is headed toward zero.” XRP Whal es on the Move One important factor signaling that Ripple’s native token could indeed head north in the near future is the whale activity. As CryptoPotato reported over the weekend, such large investors accumulated roughly one billion XRP (equaling almost $2.5 billion) in the span of 48 hours. Continuous efforts in that field will reduce the circulating supply of the asset, potentially triggering upward pressure on the price (assuming demand doesn’t decline). Additionally, this move signals confidence in the coin, possibly encouraging retail investors to follow suit and direct further capital into the ecosystem.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $8.56 in 2025. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $1.829, resulting in a correction to $1.388. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO price down today? JTO’s price lost its momentum around $3.5, resulting in a minor correction. Buyers are currently defending a drop below $3. Will JTO’s price recover? If JTO’s price faces buying demand around the current price level, we might see a strong rebound and JTO might surge toward $4. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2025 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/opinion on JTO news Solana staking pool Jito clocked monthly revenue from priority fees and tips of more than $100 million in November and December, according to a Dec. 26 note from Kairos Research, a cryptocurrency researcher. Jito price prediction January 2025 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a hold above $100K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $4.2 and a minimum of $2.8, with an average value of $3.1 throughout January.

This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $7.14. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

The development shows growing support for digital tokens built on the Ordinals principles. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November rising above the $35 mark and crossed in December trading at $48 The coin crossed into 2025 trading at $35.70.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-13 11:37:20

Reportedly, top cryptocurrencies are constantly failing to hold their value above their important support levels, highlighting rising uncertainty in future price action. With the market turning unpredictable, investors are closely watching their portfolios with various doubts. In this article, we have covered the market sentiment, price analysis, and possible short-term price targets of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) memecoins. DOGE Price Retests Its Important Support Trendline! The Dogecoin price is hovering close to its important support level of $0.3250 with an intraday drop of 3.76% and a trading volume of $1.835 billion. Moreover, with a market cap of $48.281 billion, it has secured the 07th position. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) records a rising red histogram with its averages experiencing a bearish convergence. Moreover, its EMA 50-day indicator acts as a resistance to the Dogecoin price chart, suggesting a negative outlook. Maintaining the price above its support level of $0.3250 could set the stage for the DOGE price to retest its upper high of $0.440. However, if the bears gains dominance, this meme coin could retest its low of $0.2650. Wondering if DOGE Memecoin will reach $1 this 2025? Read our Dogecoin Price Prediction to explore the possible long-term mysteries! Shiba Inu Price Records Increased Bearish Sentiment The SHIB price has maintained its bearish action by dropping 4.43% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $401.42 million. Furthermore, it has plunged 12.92% in seven days and 26.74% in 30 days. This highlights an increase in the negative influence. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a bearish curve in its daily time frame with its average displaying a negative reversal. Further, with its SMA indicator constantly acting as a resistance, the SHIB price may continue losing value this week. If the bulls regain momentum, the Shiba Inu price could breach its resistance of $0.00002350 and head toward its upper high of $0.00003080. Conversely, an increase in the bearish action could pull the price toward its low of $0.0000170. Planning on investing in SHIB memecoin but concerned about its long-term projection?

Zircuit (ZRC) soared to $0.079 on Jan. 13, a 24.8 rally from its weekly low of $0.063, while bringing its market cap to over $160 million at press time. The altcoin’s price rally came as its daily trading volume rose 69% from $32 million early Monday morning to over $56.8 million. ZRC’s sharp rally on Monday followed an announcement by Bithumb, a major South Korea-based crypto exchange, that it would list the altcoin on its platform with a KRW trading pair on Jan. 13. Listings on popular exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb have often led to sharp rallies in the associated crypto assets. However, it’s important to note that rallies ahead of exchange listings often experience a reversal, as investors typically sell their holdings in a “sell the news” scenario. One such instance can be seen in Safe Wallet’s SAFE token, which rallied 20% ahead of its listing on Bithumb on Jan. 10, as reported earlier by crypto.news. However, the altcoin has since reversed most of its gains and is now down 15.8% from its intraday high reached on the day of the announcement. The listing also positioned ZRC as a top trending token on CoinGecko. ZRC’s recent rally has also gained traction due to a surge in demand among derivatives traders. Data from CoinGlass shows that open interest for ZRC in the futures market surged by 115% over the past day, reaching $10.98 million—substantially higher than the $981k recorded in January. You might also like: Cardano slips as founder claps back against claims on X A lot of investors’ interest in ZRC has also been driven by its impressive growth in the DeFi sector. According to DeFiLlama , Zircuit’s total value locked has surged to $725 million at the time of writing, far exceeding the $256 million recorded at the end of 2024. Most of its TVL is currently held in its staking protocol. However, there remains one potential concern for ZRC, as a larger proportion of traders appear to be moving their holdings to exchanges, potentially creating selling pressure and risking a reversal of recent gains. According to CoinGlass data, approximately $3.35 million worth of ZRC was sent to centralized exchanges on Jan. 13, compared to $3.28 million withdrawn. Indeed, ZRC has already given up most of its recent gains, falling 12.4% from its intraday high of $0.6994 when writing. Will ZRC continue its rally? ZRC price, Bollinger Bands and MACD chart — Jan. 13 | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators, however, suggest that ZRC might soon resume its rally. On the daily chart, the altcoin’s price has risen above the middle Bollinger Band at $0.71, indicating a potential shift back to a bullish trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator supports this outlook, with the MACD line pointing upward and appearing poised to cross above the signal line, a sign of bullish reversal in technical analysis. As such, ZRC could potentially retest the $0.8 psychological resistance level, which the altcoin struggled to breach in late December. However, if bearish sentiment prevails, it could push its price down to the $0.064 support level. At press time, the altcoin remains 24.4% below its all-time high of $0.097, recorded in November of last year.

On January 13, Chaincode Consulting announced its collaboration with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) to digitize the travel experience for millions heading to the MahaKumbh Mela, a Hindu pilgrimage held once every four years. The tickets will be minted as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Polygon blockchain, creating a unique and verifiable digital identity for each passenger. Alok Gupta, CEO of Chaincode Consulting, shared the importance of this initiative: “By partnering with IRCTC and leveraging the Polygon blockchain, we are enabling a digital-first experience that complements the spiritual and traditional significance of the MahaKumbh while introducing a new level of engagement through NFTs.” Why Polygon? The Polygon blockchain was chosen for its high-speed transactions and low gas fees, ensuring scalability and environmental sustainability. This makes it an ideal platform for managing the expected influx of travelers. Currently, IRCTC processes an average of 1.2 million train ticket bookings daily, making the integration of a scalable blockchain crucial for a seamless user experience. The NFT-based tickets, made available via the NFTtrace platform, will not only serve as digital passes but also as collectible souvenirs for travelers. With the MahaKumbh Mela being a UNESCO-recognized cultural event, the initiative is expected to attract participants and enthusiasts from across the globe. Notably, India has seen massive crypto growth and adoption in the past few years, as per data. This comes despite the government’s strict 30% tax on crypto gains. NFTs Beyond Tickets This isn’t Indian Railways’ first foray into NFTs. In March 2024, the organization launched a limited-time NFT ticketing campaign during the Holi festival. These tickets celebrated the vibrant culture of cities like Lucknow and Delhi, marking a precedent for using blockchain in commemorating cultural events. The NFT tickets for the MahaKumbh Mela offer both practical and symbolic value. Passengers and authorities can verify them on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and traceability. This approach builds on Indian Railways’ earlier experiments with Hyperledger blockchain for record-keeping and smart contracts to manage ticket traceability.

Hong Kong ‘s digital banks are exploring the possibility of opening physical branches as the local regulator introduced new rules allowing them to do so, the South China Morning Post has learned . According to the report, WeLab Bank, Mox Bank, and crypto-friendly ZA Bank, are among the banks considering setting up physical locations. The new Hong Kong Monetary Authority rule permits digital banks to operate a limited number of physical branches. ZA Bank, the largest digital bank in the city, supported the introduction of physical branches, with a spokesperson for the bank told SCMP that face-to-face interactions would enhance the customer experience and help resolve complex issues more efficiently.

Crypto startups in Hong Kong have faced difficulties opening bank accounts due to strict regulations and traditional banks’ cautious stance toward crypto. A report from the HKMA noted that out of over 120 web3 firms that were set up in Hong Kong in 2022, about 95% had trouble opening accounts with virtual banks. Additionally, 70% of these firms were asked to have shareholders or directors visit Hong Kong multiple times, 60% had to maintain fixed deposits, and 54% took more than six months to open an account. Nearly 20% took between two and five months, while 3% were outright rejected.

In the next 48 hours, though, BTC slumped by more than ten grand and dropped to $91,250 (on Bitstamp) on Thursday. The bulls finally managed to intervene at this point and didn’t allow further declines. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover some ground and jumped toward $96,000 on a couple of occasions. The last such attempt came earlier this morning, but it saw zero success. BTC was rejected almost immediately and pushed south to $93,000, as reported earlier. The landscape has worsened since then, with bitcoin dumping below $91,000 minutes ago for the first time since late November. In fact, the cryptocurrency went to $90,700, which became a nearly two-month low. The altcoins have suffered badly as well. Ethereum is under $3,100 after a 6% daily correction. A similar price drop for XRP has taken it to under $2.4. More painful price drops are evident from the likes of ADA, SOL, SUI, AVAX, LINK, SHIB, XLM, ICP, AAVE, and many others. This massive volatility and correction has liquidated over 200,000 traders in the past 24 hours. The total value of wrecked positions is up to nearly $500 million within the same timeframe.

The report noted that asset managers have filed 12 ETF applications with the SEC to date, and that ETFs that could receive approval include the ProShares ETF, which pegs the S&P 500's return as Bitcoin, a combined Bitcoin/Ethereum ETF, Litecoin, XRP and Solana ETFs. At this point, Laser Digital analysts said that the Bitcoin/Ethereum ETF will likely be the first to receive approval.

BTC is down 2%, changing hands in the key support zone of $90,000 and $93,000, with alternative cryptocurrencies posting bigger losses as usual. ETH has dropped to the lowest since Dec. 21 and the risk-off has clouded XRP's bullish technical outlook (see TA section). Whales likely accumulated XRP over South Korea-based Upbit over the weekend. AI coins is the worst performing sub-sector of the past 24 hours. In traditional markets, futures tied to the S&P 500 point to negative open alongside continued downside volatility in the British pound and emerging market currencies. The risk-off sentiment, however, didn't stop Michael Saylor from indicating a potential for another bitcoin purchase as he shared an update on MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchase tracker. If it would put a dent into the negative market sentiment, is another story. ""The firm's purchase last Monday amounted to approximately $100 million, which had limited market impact, but underscores the firm's ongoing demand,"" Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN said. Other things being equal, the risk of BTC losing the support zone appears high as some investment banks believe the Fed rate-cutting cycle is over, with Bank of America suggesting a potential for a rate hike. Per some observers , the consensus is that prices will deflate to $70K, followed by a renewed rally. Meanwhile, the 30-day moving average of the Coinbase-Binance BTC price differential, which has a knack of marking major price tops, has slipped to the lowest since at least 2019, a sign of weaker stateside demand. Over the near term, the crypto market is likely to focus on President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20 and the ongoing FTX claim distributions, according to Coinbase Institutional.

The cryptocurrency fell 3.3% to $91.1K as at 6:44 am ET. The fall comes on a day when other risk assets have also come under pressure, including the U.S. stock index futures. ""Bitcoin’s continued declines come amidst a lack of catalytic factors, in addition to a climate of low-risk appetite. The weak appeal of risk assets is causing the stock market to continue to decline, which in turn is driving the overall trends of the cryptocurrency market,"" Samer Hasn, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com, said. The latest jobs report, that landed on Friday, came in hotter than expected and further supported a case for fewer Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 256K nonfarm payroll additions to the economy in December 2024, easily outstripping the consensus of +157K. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%, coming in lower than the expected figure of 4.2% The blowout report also prompted Goldman Sachs to predict only two more interest rate cuts this year. Bank of America went one step further and said it sees no more rate cuts at all, adding that there appeared to be greater risks toward policymakers now raising rates. So far into the new year, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) seemed to take a breather, and has only hit the $100K mark twice.

Major DOGE and SHIB holders have transferred millions to DTX Exchange, in what could be a strategic shift to a profitable venture. The rising star of the crypto space, DTX Exchange, has gained significant attention due to its hybrid layer-1 blockchain, merging efficiency with advanced interoperability. This model promises faster transactions, reduced fees, and a suite of decentralized applications catering to institutional and retail investors alike. Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Market Challenges Amid Declining Volume Dogecoin (DOGE), the first meme coin created in the crypto space, is struggling. Its price has dropped by 15% since early December 2024 and currently trades at $0.38 . Aligning with the broader market trend, its decreased momentum signals waning investor confidence despite its strong social media presence. This recent downturn is fueled by seasoned investors taking profits and redirecting such funds to alternative opportunities. Without renewed support from whales, DOGE risks further declines. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whales Suddenly Become More Active Despite Stagnant Price Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is seeing a notable spike in whale activity as large transactions make up 6.42 trillion SHIB, approximately $175 million , recently. This sudden surge has created speculation of an imminent breakout, even when SHIB remains at $0.000024 . Experts remain optimistic; if the digital currency stays in the bullish trend, SHIB can pull up to $0.000035. However, investors are worried due to the current market volatility. As such, they are now looking for stable projects that can provide considerable benefits. DTX Exchange (DTX) Could Become A Top Hybrid Trading Platform of 2025 DTX Exchange (DTX) is capturing significant attention in the crypto space thanks to the remarkable success of its presale. Having raised over $11.3 million so far, early investors have recorded upwards of 600% gains in their investments (from an initial $0.02 to the current price of $0.14 per token). The project further serves as an innovative hybrid trading model. Here, users will be able to trade a wide range of financial assets. They include stocks, cryptos, forex pairs, and more than 100,000 other asset classes all on one platform. With transaction speeds reaching 100,000 TPS (transactions per second) and the possibility of leveraging up to 1,000x, DTX Exchange positions itself as the most innovative solution for retail and institutional traders. At the heart of this ecosystem lies DTX, the utility token which will power the network. Currently, at its presale stage 7, the token is valued at $0.14 but will increase to $0.16 when it finally hits stage 8. Interestingly, 50% of the total supply is available in its ongoing presale, a factor that has evoked enthusiasm among whales. Industry experts are optimistic about DTX Exchange’s future, with predictions of a 40x price surge once the token is listed on a tier-1 exchange later this year. The platform’s combination of high-speed trading, extensive asset coverage, and hybrid layer-1 infrastructure has created a strong foundation for long-term growth. As the presale continues to gain momentum, DTX Exchange is solidifying its reputation as a rising star in the crypto market. If the current trajectory holds, DTX could soon become a household name in the world of online trading and blockchain innovation. Final Verdict: DTX Exchange (DTX) Marks A Promising Shift Toward Innovation The move by DOGE and SHIB whales to redirect funds into DTX Exchange signals a growing appetite for utility-focused crypto projects. This strategic pivot highlights the market’s shift from speculative assets to platforms that deliver innovation and tangible benefits. With its hybrid layer-1 blockchain, DTX Exchange is well-positioned to redefine trading experiences by combining scalability, speed, and extensive asset options.

This technology promises unmatched ease, but it raises questions about user control over devices and apps. Local players like Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, and Honor are involved in this agenda . Honor’s tagline, “The more AI, the more it understands you,” captures both the potential and risk of this transformation. This is the danger: if AI-driven decision-making is based on personal data collected without explicit consent, it becomes less about enhancing user experience and more about intrusive surveillance. Apparently, during the October 2024 launch of Magic 7, CEO George Zhao used the phone to order 2,000 cups of coffee live on stage without requiring a single tap. The audience was awestruck, but questions persisted: How did the tech know Zhao’s preferences, select the application, and authorize payment? This remarkable demonstration of convenience prompts a confrontation of a critical problem: To what extent does this innovation compromise user autonomy and privacy? George Zhao’s live performance could only have been possible if the phone accessed private data to follow commands. What is more important to users, convenience or privacy? How far does the risk of privacy invasion go? An examination of Magic 7 demonstrated that it exploits Android’s accessibility permissions. This feature is intended to assist users with disabilities. Honor and certain other Chinese technology firms obtain access to sensitive user data in ways that are both opaque and unregulated by bypassing traditional consent processes. AI-driven decision-making could be readily weaponized if the phones end up in the wrong hands. Secondly, hackers could exploit these systems to gain access to users’ financial data, messages, and even private photographs. The convenience of the intelligence tech risks becoming an instrument for surveillance and control if there are no robust safeguards in place. The implications could not be more serious. If left unchecked, the current trajectory may lead to a future where cell phones not only serve their users but also monitor, manage, and commercialize their actions without their knowledge. Notably, the challenge for both manufacturers and regulators is to balance responsibility with innovation. The question is not whether AI will dominate our devices; it already does. Still, the potential of devices that are powered by the intelligence tech is undeniable. These devices have the capacity to revolutionize lives by simplifying daily duties and improving accessibility. Meanwhile, Apple introduced Apple Intelligence in June 2024, an on-device AI system that transformed Siri into a more intuitive assistant. Nevertheless, Apple’s “revolutionary” action in China failed to generate a significant impact. What does the law say about privacy invasions? Privacy invasions are not lawful. In fact, in 2021, Chinese app developers were subjected to legal action. They were accused of developing tools that exploited permissions to intercept digital transactions. In addition, during Lunar New Year celebrations, applications such as Red Packet Hunter automatically intercepted WeChat red envelopes. The developers were issued fines and even prison sentences after the court determined that these actions violated competition laws. Also, unlike Chinese firms that have accepted these risks as part of the creative process, Western competitors tread carefully. For instance, Microsoft encountered criticism for its Recall feature earlier this year. This is because it uses periodic screenshots to evaluate user behavior and recommend actions.

Digital asset investment products saw $48 million in net inflows, but nearly $1 billion that poured in earlier in the week was offset by $940 million in outflows as fresh economic data and hawkish Federal Reserve minutes rattled investors, said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, in a Jan. 13 research report . Bitcoin ( BTC ) led with $214 million in inflows but faced the largest outflows among digital assets later in the week. Butterfill notes that despite the outflows, BTC remains the “best-performing asset with $799 million in inflows year-to-date.” Weekly crypto asset flows | Source: CoinShares Ethereum ( ETH ) faced a challenging week, with $256 million in outflows, which Butterfill linked to the broader tech sell-off rather than issues specific to Ethereum. At the same time, Solana ( SOL ) remained resilient, attracting $15 million in inflows. XRP ( XRP ) attracted $41 million in inflows, driven by “political and legal factors,” Butterfill says, noting that inflows suggest “heightened optimism ahead of the Jan. 15 SEC appeal deadline.” Several altcoins posted inflows despite weak price performance. For instance, Aave ( AAVE ), Stellar ( XLM ), and Polkadot ( DOT ) were standouts, drawing $2.9 million, $2.7 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.

Analysts opine that there is no surprise in this month’s price drop, emphasising how the Bitcoin market reacted in January in post-halving years. Expressing the optimistic outlook about the growth potential of BTC in 2025, analysts predict that the market could mirror the performance of previous cycles with an impressive rally of 130% this year. The big question is: how high could the market rise? Curious to know more? Read on! Why Bitcoin Price Drops in January In the last seven days, the Bitcoin market has dropped by at least 7.4%. In the last 24 hours alone, it has slipped by 2.9%. The month-to-date performance of BTC stands at -3.38%. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin typically experiences price drops in January during post-halving years. In January 2013, the BTC market showed a performance of 49.9%; in January 2017, the market demonstrated a change of +0.70%; and, in January 2021, the market showcased a performance of +14.3%. Bitcoin’s Historical Performance in Halving and Market Cycles Analysts point out that in the peak year of the previous halving cycle, the Bitcoin market experienced a bullish rally of 130%. Additionally, BTC generally shows exceptional performance in the third year of a four-year market cycle. In 2013, the third year of the first four-year market cycle, the market showed a growth of 5,435%. In 2017, the third year of the second four-year cycle, the market displayed a rise of +1,369%. The third year of the previous cycle, in 2021, even though the market was under the threat of a pandemic, it showcased a surge of 56.6%. 2025 is the third of the present cycle, which began in 2023. Analysts’ Optimistic Projections for BTC Analysts forecast that if the historical trends continue, the price of Bitcoin could touch as high as $200,000 this year.

LTC, which has already fallen by 35% from its highest level this year, has more room to fall as the odds of a spot LTC ETF fell on Polymarket, active users dropped, and the coin formed a head-and-shoulders pattern. Litecoin Price Could Fall As Odds Of LTC ETF Approval Falls One catalyst for the ongoing Litecoin price crash is the fact that many Polymarket don’t expect a spot ETF to be approved this week. One poll with $54,000 in assets has predicted that odds of the ETF being approved by July 31 have fallen to 24% by July 31st. Another poll with $8,000 has a 42% chance of the fund being approved. Only one company, Canary Capital has applied for a spot LTC ETF , but the number could increase if the SEC becomes friendlier to the crypto industry. In a recent note, Eric Balchunas, the head of ETF strategy at Bloomberg has predicted that the SEC will approve a spot ETF since LTC is a Bitcoin Fork. LTC ETF Approval Odds LTC Transactions Are Falling Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that Litecoin’s activity is falling as the price continues falling and sentiment in the crypto industry worsens. According to Bit Info Charts , the number of Litecoin transactions have fallen to the lowest level since 2023. Litecoin Sent From Addresses 2 Another data shows that Litecoin’s hash rate has fallen after reaching a record high of 1.95 Phash/s earlier this month. It dropped to 1.71 Phash/s, a sign that the network is not seeing a lot of activity. The average transaction fee in the Litecoin’s network has also been in a downtrend this month. LTC Price Has Formed A Small H&S Pattern The other reason why the Litecoin price could fall sharply this week is that it has formed a small head and shoulders pattern. This pattern comprises a head, which is at around $117, two shoulders, and a neckline, which is at $96.78. The H&S pattern is one of the most bearish signs in the market. Litecoin has dropped below the 50-day moving average and found support at the 100 EMA level. It has also moved below the key support at $112.67, the highest swing in March last year. Therefore, a drop below the 100-day moving average will point to more downside of the LTC value , with the initial support being at $86.50, its lowest swing on December 20th, which is about 10% below the current level. A break below that level will bring the next support to $76.65. This is its highest point on July 26 and 20% below the present price.

According to a report by The Korea Times on Jan. 13, Bithumb will be changing its deposit and withdrawal service provider bank from NH NongHyup Bank to KB Kookmin Bank starting from March 2025. South Korea’s Financial Intelligence Unit, the nation’s financial watchdog, recently approved the exchange’s application to change partner banks. According to the report, Bithumb’s partnership with Nonghyup will end on March 23. By South Korean law, crypto exchange’s are only allowed to have one partner bank to facilitate Korean won transactions. As a result, investors who wish to trade virtual assets on Bithumb must open a Kookmin Bank account using their real name and link it to their Bithumb account. They can no longer use a NongHyup Bank to trade on Bithumb starting from March 24 at 11:00 AM KST. You might also like: ZRC surges over 19% on Bithumb listing, can the rally hold? On the other hand, users can start linking their Kookmin Bank accounts on the same day, starting from Jan. 20 at 09:00 AM KST, according to a Bithumb official who added that more details on how to do so will be provided in a separate notice. Bithumb CEO Lee Jae-won thanked NongHyup Bank for its long partnership with Bithumb and ensured users that the crypto exchange will ensure a smooth transition process, with the addition of corporate accounts from Kookmin Bank. “Moving forward, both companies will do the best to ensure the healthy and stable growth of the virtual asset market,” said Lee. Bithumb’s decision to switch partner banks from NongHyup Bank to Kookmin Bank is believed to stem from the crypto exchange’s desire to expand their market reach, specifically towards younger users. According to a yearly survey , Kookmin Bank is ranked as the second most popular bank among South Koreans in their 20s, falling behind only to KakaoBank, which is rooted in the social messaging app KakaoTalk. Last September, Kookmin launched the “So Young” debit card program, which offers special discounts for businesses favored by teenagers. In addition, Kookmin Bank is one of the four largest banks in South Korea, alongside Shinhan Bank, Hana Bank and Woori Bank. At the time of writing, Korbit is the only other crypto exchange in South Korea that holds a partnership with a big four bank, Shinhan Bank.

The company's 21/21 plan aims to raise $42 billion to buy more Bitcoin, enhancing shareholder value through increased Bitcoin yield. The net asset value per share is estimated at $111.13 as of 12/31, but shares trade at a premium due to expected high Bitcoin yield growth. Despite volatility, I believe MicroStrategy is a buy, as its Bitcoin yield strategy promises substantial long-term returns if Bitcoin prices continue to rise. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) shares were one of the top-performing equities here in the US in 2024 with shares up 479.68% over the last 12 months. At the end of 2024, MicroStrategy was added to the NASDAQ 100 index, representing how the company as both a Bitcoin treasury and software technology firm has reached a new paradigm. I think the biggest question in front of investors for MicroStrategy is why shares should deserve to trade at a premium. On the surface, the company looks like a closed-end Bitcoin fund that issues a combination of debt and equity securities in order to accumulate Bitcoin. I think this grossly understates what Chairman Michael Saylor’s plans are. MicroStrategy plans to be far more than just a closed-end Bitcoin fund. As Bitcoin prices move higher, MicroStrategy is able to monetize their access to debt markets in order to split the risk of Bitcoin into a series of ‘tranches’ based on which security investors buy. In essence, MicroStrategy is looking to give convertible bond investors a risk-adjusted return to invest in Bitcoin with. For common stockholders, MicroStrategy is aiming to act like a leveraged Bitcoin fund that is trying to grow the amount of Bitcoin per share by a rate of 6-10% per year for the next 3 years. As MicroStrategy shares move higher (powered by Bitcoin’s rise), this enables management at MicroStrategy to issue new stock in the company at progressively higher prices. The cash proceeds from these stock offerings simultaneously raise the average net asset value per share, providing more benefit to existing shareholders. It’s a weird form of dilution that is actually net beneficial. As shares become more valuable because they contain more Bitcoin, investors are buying into these shares at a premium above net asset value because they believe that Saylor will be able to increase the amount of Bitcoin through debt offerings and equity offerings. With this, I am a buy on MicroStrategy. While shares promise to be volatile, I think as Saylor rolls out his strategy, investors will be rewarded with the amount of Bitcoin he can accumulate per share. As Bitcoin itself compounds, shares should continue to do well. Background Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy in 1989 alongside co-founders Sanju Bansal and Thomas Spahr. A $250,000 consulting contract from DuPont in 1989 allowed MicroStrategy to kickstart its business. By 1992, MicroStrategy signed its first major client, McDonald’s, to a $10 million deal . Saylor, who served as the company’s CEO from its inception in 1989 to 2022 (and now as Chairman), is a major advocate of Bitcoin. As of their 8K filed on January 6th, the company owns 447,470 Bitcoin. As seen in an earnings presentation from Q3, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stockpile has been growing significantly. Keep in mind, this was before their large purchases in Q4 (up to the 447,470 Bitcoin I mentioned before). Bitcoin Treasury Growth (MSTR Earnings Deck) So, MicroStrategy has clearly been successful in building up its Bitcoin holdings. But what is this all worth? For this, I think we first need to look at what the net asset value is today via balance sheet analysis. Balance Sheet Analysis For us to truly understand what MicroStrategy is worth, we need to analyze their balance sheet and assets. Since MicroStrategy has reported via an 8K their most current Bitcoin holdings, we will use these figures. In the 8K filing, MicroStrategy noted they own 447,470 Bitcoin. Using the valuation provided in the 8K, the Bitcoin treasury company pegs their Bitcoin valuation of $41.789 billion. MSTR Bitcoin Holdings (MSTR) Throw in the cash the company had at the end of Q3 of $46.3 million, accounts receivable as of Q3 of $115.1 million, and property, plant and equipment (as of Q3) of $82.8 million and we get total assets of roughly $42.03 billion. On the liabilities side, the company had current liabilities as of Q3 of $288.1 million, debt liabilities as of December 31st of $10.379 billion (including a small secured loan of $9.8 million), and capital leases of $57.5 million. The company’s total liabilities are roughly $10.72 billion. I am doing this math to get a rough estimate of what the net asset value for shares is. The rough net asset value of the company as of 12/31 appears to be $31.31 billion. On a diluted basis (including convertible notes) the company has 281.735 million implied diluted shares outstanding. MSTR Capital Structure (MSTR 8K) In essence, this implies an approx. net asset value of $111.13/share as of 12/31. So, from here, I think the main question is straightforward: why should we pay roughly 2.95x net asset value for Saylor’s company? I think the answer has to do with how MicroStrategy management is monetizing the debt and equity markets. Issuing Stock Grows Their NAV As Bitcoin Rises Based on our balance sheet analysis using the fair value of Bitcoin, each share of MicroStrategy has a net asset value of $111.13 per share. While each share currently has $111.13 in value right now, we have to consider Saylor’s 21/21 monetization plan that he’s looking to get shareholder approval for and then execute on over the next three years. Yahoo Finance explained in detail what Saylor’s 21/21 monetization plan entails. ...the ""21/21 Plan,"" is to raise $42 billion, then use it to buy more Bitcoin. Half of the funds, or $21 billion, would come from at-the-market offerings of new shares in the company. The other $21 billion would come from new fixed-income offerings, primarily in the form of convertible debt. While the strategy includes convertible debt, I want to focus for a second on the common stock offerings that, I think, are a key part of this equation. MicroStrategy wants to increase its common share count (class A) from 330 million shares to 10.33 billion shares (or a 10 billion share increase) through shareholder approval and then common stock offerings. What this means is that as MicroStrategy proceeds to issue more class A shares, the cash proceeds from each share sale will increase the average net asset value of all shares. Because, if shares are offered (and purchased) by the public at $300/each, the company receives roughly $300/share in cash that is then available to be used to purchase Bitcoin. Previously, the company has been successful in issuing shares well above their net asset value. In November, MicroStrategy completed an at-the-market offering of 7.854 million shares of common stock. These shares were sold for well above net asset value at the time based on the amount of Bitcoin that was on their balance sheet and also the going price of shares at the time of the sale. Given this, we know the market has some appetite to buy shares above net asset value. The reason (I believe) is because as each share is issued, current shareholders know they will see their net asset value grow (hence the ‘Bitcoin Yield’ metric). While this new offering will cause a lot of dilution of common shares, I think it's safe to assume that this new offering will continue to help enhance Bitcoin yield. I expect Bitcoin per share to continue to grow. If we look at the company’s Q3 earnings call, their goal was 6-10% per year in Bitcoin Yield. However, since the election with the run-up in the price of Bitcoin, their Bitcoin yield in Q4 alone was a strong 48.0% according to their 8K. This yield is key. The company’s projected Bitcoin yield helps us determine what net asset value premium the company should be trading at. Valuation Currently, shares trade at roughly 2.95 times their net asset value. In order for us to figure out what tangible book value ratio the shares should trade at, we should think about the expected CAGR of Bitcoin over the next 10 years. Over the last 14 years, Bitcoin has had a CAGR of 142% . Saylor, in his Q3 earnings call , believes Bitcoin is now compounding at roughly 50% per year. We are built on an asset, bitcoin, which is growing 50% a year and we are growing with that asset. So basically, if we take the company’s projected Bitcoin yield growth per year, and multiply it by the growth in the price of Bitcoin per year, we should arrive at the growth rate of the net asset value of the company per year. Saylor mentioned earlier in his call he was targeting 6-10% per year in Bitcoin yield. Over the course of 10 years, growing an asset at 50% per year vs. growing an asset at 60% per year results in the 60% CAGR asset reaching 190.67% of the value of the 50% CAGR asset. In essence, the market is applying this 2.95x multiple on net asset value because it expects Saylor and the management team at MicroStrategy to grow their Bitcoin per share at a rate that gives shareholders a return 2.95x greater than Bitcoin over the next 10 years. The way you do this is to give each shareholder 2.95x more Bitcoin per share over the next 10 years. Using this math, in order to get this level of growth, investors are implying a CAGR Bitcoin yield of roughly 11.42%. This is only slightly higher than Saylor’s conservative 6-10% Bitcoin yield growth estimates. Again, keep in mind that the company’s Bitcoin yield in Q4 alone was 48%. In essence, this is why you pay a premium for MicroStrategy shares over buying Bitcoin directly. You are betting that Saylor can grow your Bitcoin per share at a rate greater than 11.42% annually. I personally think he can as well. I think his 6-10% target is conservative and the company (especially with the 21/21 plan) can grow its Bitcoin per shareholder at 15% per year for the next 10 years. As I mentioned above, share offerings accelerate Bitcoin yield. That is what we saw in Q4. That is what I think we will see again. If we saw the company generate a Bitcoin yield of 15% per year for the next 10 years, each shareholder would have 4.05x more Bitcoin per share than they do right now. In essence, net asset value would grow by 4.05x over the next 10 years. Compared to the 2.95x net asset value premium on shares, this means shares have roughly 37% upside from here (if they were to converge on this net asset value premium that represents what I think the company can generate in Bitcoin yield). Risks I think the biggest risk for MicroStrategy is that their 21/21 plan does not get approved. MicroStrategy’s goal is to become a Bitcoin treasury company. Because their goal is to become a Bitcoin treasury company, they are highly dependent on debt and equity offerings in order to fund the purchase of additional Bitcoin. Currently, the company is bumping up near their class A share count limit. In essence, in order for the company to continue to grow their Bitcoin yield, the firm has to raise their Class A and Class B share count limits. However, if we look at data from Polymarket, we can see that Polymarket is currently pricing in a greater than 95% chance that shareholders will approve this 21/21 offering. This makes me optimistic. From here, the 21/21 plan (because it is so dilutive) should allow the company to hit this 15% target Bitcoin yield that I mentioned before. Bottom Line While MicroStrategy shares have experienced an incredible run-up over the past year, I think it’s key to dive in and understand why investors are paying a net asset value premium for shares. The answer is this Bitcoin yield that I mentioned above. Saylor’s plan to buy more Bitcoin via the 21/21 offering plan should allow investors to see their Bitcoin yield compound at a rate faster than the 6-10% Saylor thinks the company can hit over the next 3 years. The faster this Bitcoin yield compounds, the faster shares could move up. Really, what Saylor is doing is raising money for an investment that he believes will compound at 50% YoY on a CAGR basis. This is no different than any company raising money for cash flowing assets that compound value at 50% year over year. While some investors may be concerned about Saylor’s leverage through these convertible notes, it's important to note that just $9.8 million of the $10.379 billion in debt liabilities are secured. This means that MicroStrategy does not face an effective ‘margin call’ if their debt to equity ratio becomes concerning for some investors. With this, while shares are incredibly volatile (and risky) I think they are a buy. As long as the price of Bitcoin continues to move higher over time (which I believe it will over most 5, 10 year horizons) MicroStrategy should be able to benefit as well.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-13 12:15:44
38892607,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674512,1736770547,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Un famoso trader prevede un possibile crollo di Bitcoin prima di un nuovo rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/italia/un-famoso-trader-prevede-un-possibile-crollo-di-bitcoin-prima-di-un-nuovo-rally/,"Dopo aver toccato il suo massimo storico sopra la soglia dei 100.000 dollari, Bitcoin (BTC) continua a far parlare di sé, con tanti che si chiedono se ci siano ancora guadagni in arrivo. Alcuni trader, però, prevedono che prima di un nuovo picco ci possa essere un crollo. Tra questi c’è Peter Brandt, un nome di riferimento nel mondo del trading, che ha suggerito che Bitcoin potrebbe attraversare un ultimo “dump” o un periodo di consolidamento prima di continuare la sua ascesa. Nel suo ultimo post pubblicato il 12 gennaio, Brandt ha condiviso la sua analisi, mostrando le performance passate della crypto di maggior valore e descrivendo le fasi che lui chiama “pump”, “hump” e “dump”. In particolare, un “pump” è un periodo in cui l’asset cresce rapidamente, come l’incredibile ascesa di Bitcoin da 70.000 a oltre 100.000 dollari alla fine del 2024, spinta da forti acquisti e dall’effetto Trump. Successivamente arriva la fase “hump” , in cui il rally rallenta e si scontra con resistenze, come si è visto nel plateau di dicembre di Bitcoin, che ha portato l’asset crypto a consolidarsi intorno al livello dei 95.000 dollari. Infine, il “dump” rappresenta una correzione al ribasso, spesso causata da prese di profitto o dalla perdita di slancio. In questo caso, Brandt suggerisce che, se Bitcoin non dovesse tenere il supporto chiave, potrebbe scendere fino a 73.018 dollari. Brandt ha esaminato l’andamento di Bitcoin e ha notato un fenomeno ricorrente nei mercati: i forti movimenti di prezzo accadono spesso quando i trader al dettaglio cominciano a stancarsi, segnando il punto di svolta prima di importanti oscillazioni di prezzo dell’asset. “La domanda che mi pongo è se Bitcoin subirà un altro crollo (o un’altra lunga fase di consolidamento) prima di registrare un pump. Ricordiamo che in genere i mercati non si inaspriscono finché i trader al dettaglio non si stancano”, ha detto. Bitcoin potrebbe raggiungere i 140.000 dollari ? Anche un altro noto analista crypto, Ali Martinez, ha condiviso una previsione simile per Bitcoin. Nel suo post su X, pubblicato l’11 gennaio, l’esperto ha stimato che l’asset potrebbe salire fino al livello di 140.000 dollari o subire un forte crollo fino al livello di 67.000 dollari. Le sue previsioni si basano su due modelli tecnici osservati nel grafico relativo a 12 ore di BTC: un bull pennant e la formazione del pattern head-and-shoulders. Il bull pennant è un pattern che si forma quando Bitcoin registra un rally, per poi stabilizzarsi in un range sempre più stretto, con le linee di tendenza che si avvicinano. Solitamente la formazione di questo pattern indica che l’asset potrebbe continuare a salire. Invece, il pattern head-and-shoulders , con un picco centrale (la testa) e due massimi più bassi ai lati (le spalle), segnala che potrebbe esserci una inversione ribassista.Nel frattempo Bitcoin si sta stabilizzando intorno al livello di 95.000 dollari, un momento decisivo per capire in che direzione si muoverà. Bitcoin: analisti divisi tra previsioni rialziste e rischi di un forte calo Le prospettive per Bitcoin restano incerte, con scenari contrastanti tra gli analisti. Alcuni vedono un futuro roseo per l’asset, prevedendo un raddoppio del suo valore nel 2025. L’ottimismo è alimentato in parte dall’elezione di Donald Trump, che ha promesso di trasformare gli Stati Uniti in un hub per gli asset crypto. Per esempio Standard Chartered prevede che Bitcoin possa raggiungere i 200.000 dollari, spinto dal crescente interesse degli investitori istituzionali. L’analista Gert van Lagen , invece, è ancora più audace, con una previsione che punta a un Bitcoin a 300.000 dollari entro il 30 marzo 2025, basandosi sulla teoria delle onde di Elliott, che analizza i cicli ripetitivi dei mercati. Ma non tutti sono bullish. Attualmente Bitcoin è sotto la soglia dei 100.000 dollari e alcuni analisti, come Alan Santana , sono preoccupati. Temono che, se l’asset dovesse continuare a rimanere al di sotto di questo livello, potrebbe scivolare fino a 40.000 dollari. Nel complesso, supponendo che Trump sostenga il settore crypto, come promesso durante la sua campagna elettorale, è probabile che Bitcoin subisca ulteriori impennate, spinto dall’entusiasmo per un possibile quadro normativo chiaro, che potrebbe attirare gli investitori istituzionali. Nel frattempo, cresce la pressione affinché le grandi aziende mettano parte delle loro riserve in Bitcoin come protezione contro l’inflazione. Dopo che gli azionisti di Microsoft hanno bocciato l’idea, l’attenzione si è spostata su Meta, la controllante di Facebook. Un azionista ha infatti proposto di destinare una parte dei 72 miliardi di dollari di riserve liquide di Meta in Bitcoin. Se la proposta venisse accolta, Meta potrebbe diventare una delle prime grandi aziende tradizionali a detenere Bitcoin, un passo che potrebbe dare una forte spinta al prezzo dell’asset. Analisi del prezzo di Bitcoin Al momento Bitcoin sta scambiando al livello di 93.026 dollari, con un ribasso dell’1,28% in 24 ore. Anche negli altri grafici è in rosso. Negli ultimi sette giorni ha accumulato una perdita del 6,26%, mentre ha subito un ribasso dell’8,58% nel corso del mese. Bitcoin si consolida mentre gli investitori puntano su nuovi progetti in prevendita Mentre Bitcoin continua a consolidarsi intorno ai 93.000 dollari, con rialzisti e ribassisti pronti a sfidarsi per la prossima mossa, gli investitori stanno guardando anche altri nuovi progetti in prevendita che potrebbero offrire opportunità di crescita al riparo dalle oscillazioni del mercato. Uno di questi è Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) . Il progetto ha avviato la sua prevendita all’inizio di dicembre e ha superato le aspettative, raccogliendo oltre 47 milioni di dollari. $WEPE non è solo una meme coin, ma un progetto con un vero caso d’uso. I titolari del token hanno accesso a una community esclusiva, chiamata $WEPE Army , e a risorse uniche, tra cui strategie di trading avanzate, segnali alfa e gare settimanali. Tutto è progettato per aiutare gli investitori a orientarsi meglio nel mercato crypto e sfruttare al massimo le opportunità. La community di WEPE cresce ogni giorno, grazie al supporto reciproco tra i suoi membri, che si sostengono a vicenda nel perseguire il successo.",Italia|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-13 12:15:47

Meanwhile, Catzilla is drawing attention from major investors with its impressive growth prospects. This emerging player in the crypto scene hints at substantial potential returns. The contrasting paths of these digital assets are stirring curiosity among market watchers, sparking intrigue about what lies ahead. Trump’s comeback sparks meme coin uprising: Catzilla leads The crypto market is abuzz following Donald Trump’s electrifying return, with meme coins surging as the unexpected winners. While major coins inch forward, Catzilla (CATZILLA) is poised to pounce, armed with unparalleled growth potential and a narrative that resonates with the masses. Trump’s pro-crypto agenda sets the stage for a historic bull run, and meme coins like Catzilla are ready to ride the wave. But Catzilla isn’t just another meme coin, it’s a DeFi disruptor with the power to reshape the market. More than just a cute feline face, Catzilla is a warrior in the fight for financial freedom. It blends the chaos of meme culture with a mission to break barriers, empower its community, and deliver legendary profits. As meme coins like PNUT and GOAT fade into history, Catzilla rises as the next dominant force, backed by an ambitious roadmap and a hunger for market dominance. Catzilla roars into the market with an unmatched presale strategy. Starting price: $0.0002 Current price: $0.0006 (Stage 4/14) Final price: $0.0016 Each stage brings a 16.67% price increase, offering early investors an 88% discount and the chance to secure massive returns before the public launch.

Its architecture supports quick transactions and diverse programming languages. Unlike Ethereum or Cardano, Solana avoids sharding for scalability. Instead, it offers a high-capacity network. SOL, the native cryptocurrency, is key to this ecosystem. It facilitates transactions and rewards participants. SOL also allows access to various projects on Solana. Currently, Solana has fallen by 5%, now trading at $176.19, with its market cap reaching $85.32b. However, its trading volume has also increased in the last 24 hours by 69% to $2.83b, signaling strong investor interest as the market fluctuates. Conclusion With the bull run gaining momentum, coins like SOL have less potential in the short term.

Finbold then looked into Bitcoin historical returns and price patterns to forecast a potential target for January 31. Previously, BTC closed December and November 2024 with 2.85% losses and 37.29% gains, respectively, following the expected results. In November, we published the BTC price prediction targeting a monthly close between $75,275 and $100,334, while the leading cryptocurrency was trading at $69,495. Bitcoin closed November 30 at $96,451, validating the method. Nevertheless, December’s results came slightly worse than predicted, missing our forecasted range of $94,782 and $101,273. BTC closed 2024 at $93,401, but still within the now adjusted historical median for the month. Bitcoin historical returns in January since 2013 As January develops, Finbold again retrieved data from Coinglass , calculating Bitcoin’s average and median historical returns for each month. Notably, BTC’s monthly performance in January, dating back from 2013, has accumulated 3.06% gains on average. However, with six negative years out of twelve, January also has a median return of minus 0.04%. These returns are measured from opening to closing, or January 1 to 31. For example, Bitcoin’s historical best January was in 2013, up 44.05%. Something similar also happened in 2023, with 39.63% gains, after a 3.59%-losing December 2022. Conversely, 2015 was January’s worst year after one of December’s worst yearly performance in 2014, with -33.05% and -15.11%, respectively. Overall, there are no notable correlation between the previous year’s December and January’s historical returns for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Monthly returns (%). Source: CoinGlass / Finbold Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction by January 31, 2025 As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,150, below the December 2024’s closing price and January 2025’s opening. The leading cryptocurrency now experiences significant short-term losses, bringing a bearish sentiment to its traders despite an impressive year-over-year performance. Bitcoin (BTC) year-over-year price chart. Source: Finbold Based on its historical returns and January 1’s opening price of $93,401, BTC could trade between $93,027 and $96,259 by January 31. The prediction projects Bitcoin’s price from the monthly open using the median and average historical returns if BTC keeps its pattern. In the meantime, the crypto and stock trader Jelle , points out to Bitcoin testing strong support for the seventh time, suggesting a move upwards if the bulls are able to “defend it again,” in his words. There we go – #bitcoin retesting the key level for the seventh time. So far, it's been defended well.

Today Bitcoin price today is down No data found for bitcoin on 1 minute ago% and trades at No data found for bitcoin on 1 minute ago. As a result, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) have also dropped No data found for ethereum on 1 minute ago% and 2.4%, respectively. One reason for Bitcoin’s recent crash can be attributed to the strong jobs market, which has further decreased the odds of a rate cut in 2025. In the recent FOMC meeting, the US Federal Reserve slashed the anticipated rate cuts in 2025 from five to two. However, after the recent Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) report, markets have not been optimistic about rate cuts. As a result of this hawkish outlook, Bitcoin has shown uncertainty over the past few weeks and no directional bias whatsoever. The second reason for this crash is Bitcoin’s technicals. The rally that began on November 3, 2024, pushed BTC’s value from a low of $67,000 to $100,000 in just 30 days. This sudden uptrend has left many inefficiencies, so technicals indicate that a reversal is likely due to exhaustion and profit-taking. The third reason is a mix of investor sentiment connected to profit-taking and President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. The exponential rally that began in November 2024 was mainly driven by speculations of Trump’s victory. Hence, these traders are likely to close their positions ahead of the January 20 inauguration ceremony. This speculation of January 20 being a sell-the-news event failed as Bitcoin or crypto markets lacked 2024’s bullish momentum. From a technical standpoint, key support level where investors could watch for a reversal is $90,804. If price fails to hold this level, then a crash to $89,355, 85,083, & 73,646 levels can be expected. Hinting at a collapse is Deribit’s Head Lin, who points out that options market shows a 32% probability of “BTC breaking through 100,000 by the end of the month.” Options traders echo this bearish sentiment due to uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin and crypto. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, also added a similar bearish outlook for Bitcoin . Brandt noted BTC was forming a “classic H&S top pattern” and could “complete and trend to target.” The popular trader’s Bitcoin price prediction notes a target of roughly $77,000. He also added two more narratives that could unfold, where the pattern could “fail with bear trap” or “morph into larger pattern.” On the other hand, if Bitcoin bounces off the $90,804 support level, it could target the buy-side liquidity resting above the equal highs formed at the $102,810 level. Beyond this, the next critical level is the current ATH of $108,374.

The number of Bitcoin ATMs keeps growing, making it easier for people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Recent reports show this trend is continuing. Just like regular ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs let you add cash to your crypto wallet, so the process is quick and simple. So, what exactly are Bitcoin ATMs? These machines work like regular ATMs but are made for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and sometimes other tokens can be bought using cash or a bank card. Some machines even allow selling crypto for cash, though the fees are usually higher than when buying. The first Bitcoin ATM appeared in Vancouver, Canada, in 2013. It was a big moment for making crypto more accessible to the public. Since then, Bitcoin ATMs have grown rapidly, with over 37,500 machines in more than 70 countries. According to the latest research by Finbold, which cites data from Coin ATM Radar, 2024 was a standout year, with a 6% increase in the number of Bitcoin ATMs. Number of Bitcoin ATMs in 2024 | Source: Finbold Bitcoin ATMs mainly landed in US The U.S. is still the leader in Bitcoin ATMs, holding over 81% of the global market share. As of Jan. 13, there were more than 31,500 Bitcoin ATMs in the U.S., a gain of over 1,000 machines compared to the start of 2024. The global total hit 38,768, bouncing back from a dip in mid-2023 when the number dropped to around 33,000.

Although it’s not as big as the U.S., Europe’s number of ATMs has been steadily rising, even during crypto downturns, the report reads. In 2024, the region added 116 new machines, a 7.5% increase from 2023. This steady growth is unique, as many other regions saw declines during the crypto winter, the report notes. Most of the ATM growth in 2024 happened in the first half of the year. By late April, 1,942 new machines were installed globally, averaging 485 machines a month between January and April. However, growth slowed down in the second half, with only 34 machines added per month between May and December. The slowdown came even though Bitcoin hit new all-time highs in November when its price neared $100,000. Diverse regulatory approaches In most places, Bitcoin ATMs are legal, though regulations vary. For example, in the U.S., they are regulated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Operators must register as money services businesses and follow AML and KYC rules for larger transactions. At the state level, operators often need a money transmitter license and must follow consumer protection laws like fee transparency and data security. Local zoning laws can also impact how crypto ATMs function. Internationally, regulations around crypto ATMs vary by country, with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority stepping up its oversight. In September 2024, crypto.news reported that London-based Olumide Osunkoya pleaded guilty to five offenses for running an illegal network of crypto ATMs across the U.K. This marked the country’s first conviction of its kind. Earlier that year, in August, German authorities confiscated 13 crypto ATMs and seized nearly $28 million in cash from 35 locations across the country. The operation, led by BaFin, targeted machines operating without proper licenses, raising concerns about money laundering. Bitcoin ATM scams surge, with older adults most affected While most Bitcoin ATMs are run by legitimate companies, regulators are concerned they could be used for fraud or money laundering. New data from the Federal Trade Commission shows a huge rise in the amount of money consumers report losing to scams involving Bitcoin ATMs. Since 2020, the reported losses have nearly increased tenfold, reaching over $110 million in 2023. The Federal Trade Commission also found that fraud losses linked to Bitcoin ATMs topped $65 million in the first half of 2024. People aged 60 and older were more than three times as likely to lose money to Bitcoin ATM scams compared to younger adults. Across all age groups, the median loss was an eye-watering $10,000. Most of the scams involved government impersonation, business impersonation, and tech support scams, the FTC said.

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $4.13. In 2031, FLOW will range between $10.63 to $12.56. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.67 Market Cap $1.28B Trading Volume $83.3M Circulating Supply 1.55B FLOW All-time High $46.16 Apr 05, 2021 All-time Low $0.3921 Sep 12, 2023 24-hour High $0.74 24-hour Low $0.70 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $2.70 (227.56%) Volatility 15.46% 50-Day SMA $0.856444 14-Day RSI 52.30 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 76 Green Days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.660596 Flow price analysis: FLOW faces bearish pressure as price drops below key support levels TL;DR Breakdown Flow price analysis is bearish today. Support for FLOW is currently at $0.70. Flow is facing rejection at $0.74. Flow (FLOW) for January 13 is currently trading around $0.67, reflecting a significant downward trend over the observed period. The price has broken through multiple support levels, with $0.70 failing to hold as key support, signalling increased selling pressure. Resistance was observed near $0.74, where the price briefly tested but failed to sustain upward momentum. The ongoing decline suggests bearish dominance, with the next critical support likely near $0.65 if the downward trend continues. Flow 1-day price chart: FLOW faces strong bearish pressure with declining momentum The Flow (FLOW) daily chart shows a significant bearish trend, with the price experiencing an 8.40% decline, currently at $0.665. The cryptocurrency faced strong selling pressure after failing to sustain its previous support around $0.72, leading to further downside movement. This decline suggests that sellers are dominating the market, and unless buying momentum picks up, the price could test lower support levels near $0.65. FLOW faces strong bearish pressure with declining momentum The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is at 37.37, indicating that the coin is approaching oversold territory, which could trigger a potential reversal if buyers step in. However, the RSI moving below its signal line reflects the current bearish momentum. The CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) at -0.17 suggests weak buying pressure, with capital outflows dominating the market. These indicators collectively highlight the dominance of bearish sentiment in the short term. Flow 4-hour price chart: Bearish trend with potential for rebound The hourly chart of Flow (FLOW) indicates a continued bearish trend, with prices hovering around $0.664. The price has faced significant resistance near $0.700, while support seems to be forming close to $0.660. Despite minor upward movements, the overall trend suggests a struggle to maintain higher levels, with sellers dominating the market. Bearish trend with potential for rebound The RSI on the hourly chart is at 27.16, indicating an oversold condition, which suggests that the selling pressure may be overextended and a reversal could be possible. The CMF at -0.21 highlights negative money flow, reflecting more capital exiting the market than entering, further reinforcing the bearish sentiment. Combined, the indicators suggest that while FLOW is under selling pressure, a short-term rebound might occur if oversold conditions persist. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.871076 SELL SMA 5 $0.84753 SELL SMA 10 $0.77933 BUY SMA 21 $0.778186 BUY SMA 50 $0.85644 SELL SMA 100 $0.705804 BUY SMA 200 $0.660596 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.777293 BUY EMA 5 $0.809776 BUY EMA 10 $0.869058 SELL EMA 21 $0.9048 SELL EMA 50 $0.83604 SELL EMA 100 $0.751518 BUY EMA 200 $0.723499 BUY What to expect from Flow? The overall analysis of Flow (FLOW) reveals a bearish trend, with the price experiencing a consistent decline in recent days. On both the daily and hourly charts, the coin shows lower highs and lower lows, reflecting increased selling pressure and difficulty maintaining upward momentum. The current price movements suggest that Flow struggles to hold its support levels while resistance levels remain strong, limiting any recovery attempts. This downward trend highlights a cautious sentiment in the market, with the possibility of further declines if the selling pressure continues. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Why is Flow down? Flow’s decline can be attributed to sustained selling pressure, as reflected in its lower highs and lows across both daily and hourly timeframes. The inability to hold key support levels suggests weak buyer interest, while resistance levels limit upward movements. Broader market conditions and reduced demand for FLOW may also contribute to the bearish momentum, as traders appear hesitant to re-enter at current levels. This combination of weak demand, strong resistance, and market uncertainty has driven the coin’s price downward. Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market’s current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines. Close monitoring is crucial as market dynamics remain volatile. Will FLOW reach $2? Yes, Flow coin is projected to reach $2 by 2026, with a potential peak of $2.00. This indicates that FLOW is a cryptocurrency market expected to hit and surpass the $2 mark within the next few years. Will FLOW reach $5? Flow will reach $5 by 2029, with a projected peak of $5.91. This suggests significant growth potential, positioning the price of Flow for a leap above the $5 mark soon. Will FLOW reach $10? Based on current predictions, the price of Flow coin is likely to reach $10 by 2031. The maximum projected price for 2031 is $12.56. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $12.56 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, the asset has been rejected from the $100K resistance level twice in the last couple of months. This failure to continue higher has led to a drop toward the $92K support zone, which is now getting broken to the downside. If this level is lost, a decline toward the $85K area and even a deeper correction toward the $80K zone could be expected. The 4-Hour Chart As the 4-hour timeframe suggests, the price is currently attacking the $92K support zone with massive bearish momentum. With the $92K level already holding the price on three occasions in the last few weeks, the level has definitely weakened, and there’s a high probability that the market will drop lower. The RSI also shows values below 50%, further increasing the likelihood of a deeper correction in the short term. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Index While Bitcoin’s price is currently breaking a significant support level to the downside, it might be useful to identify where the selling pressure is coming from. In this case, the Coinbase Premium Index can be a very useful tool. This metric measures whether American investors are buying or selling heavier than those based in other nations by comparing the price of the BTD/USD pair on Coinbase and the BTC/USDT pair on Binance. As the chart suggests, the index has been deeply negative for the past month, which indicates that the US market is now selling Bitcoin more aggressively. As long as this metric remains negative, the correction can be expected to continue.

Now stabilized above $2.40 and now launched its $RLUSD stablecoin, investors anticipate further growth for the XRP price. In the midst of a positive Ripple (XRP) market, savvy investors are exploring low-cap gems with equal or more growth potential than Ripple coin. As a result, many are stumbling upon Lunex Network , as it positions itself as a solid DeFi contender with robust features including a multichain DEX, designed to allow wide interoperability over 40 blockchain networks. Ripple Coin Shows Bullish Strength By Surges By Over 10% In The Past Week Having progressed by over $2 from a lower range around $0.5 in October 2024, it’s safe to say Ripple (XRP) has held itself strongly and also rode the bullish wave excellently this market cycle. Although its price has fallen by over 3% what where it was in the past month, XRP token has risen by over 11% in the past week, climbing over the $2.40 range. Several crypto analysts are already bullish on Ripple due to the latest launch of its stablecoin, $RLUSD, which is poised to increase liquidity on the Ripple network. SirRobArtll1, anonymous crypto analyst, highlighted the possibility of Ripple coin hitting $4 very soon. Another analyst, Mr Xoom discussed the growth potential of Ripple on X (formerly Twitter), where he highlighted that Ripple price will potentially hit a target of $6 or $7 by the end of January. Investors are generally confident that Ripple coin can break higher levels this year as Bitcoin continues to rise this year, presenting it as a top crypto to buy this year. Lunex Network Poised To Surpass Some Of The Top DeFi Platforms This Year The Lunex Network (LNEX) has shown that it has the strength needed to transverse through the DeFi market successfully. Given its non-custodial and multi-chain DEX, which comes with extra features that will allow it challenge the likes of Binance (BNB). With additional cheaper transactional rate, surplus liquidity, B2B payment gateway and a Portfolio Tracker, this new DeFi platform is slated to dominate a considerable size of the DeFi market. Its unique B2B payment gateway tackles the issues that merchants face with cross-border payments, so Lunex Network enables merchants to accept crypto as payment worldwide. Moreover, its DEX protocol allows users to trade over 50,000 cryptocurrencies pairs across up to 40 or more blockchain networks while also allowing users to store their assets in a safe, secure and transaction wallet. With regular market insights that come from its Portfolio Tracker, the platform also allows users to manage their assets strategically. As the DeFi market grows, Lunex Network is poised to skyrocket its growth especially as it continues to gain traction. To top it all, its native token is built with a deflationary nature which automatically generates more value through its reduction in supply. The LNEX is currently sold for $0.0054 after rising over 350% from $0.0012 to accumulate over $6.2 million in presale revenue. Its projected massive rise after its presale has also added to its value as a top crypto to buy. Is Ripple A Tough Challenge For Lunex Network to Surpass? Ripple has already established its dominance in the DeFi market and with its $RLUSD stablecoin launch, it serves as a befitting challenge for Lunex Network. However, Lunex’s innovative DeFi features and rapid presale success could help it carve out a surpass Ripple easily if its momentum spikes.

While UFD has enjoyed an 8.1% increase in the last 24 hours, bringing its price to $0.1844, both SWARMS and PIPPIN have witnessed sharp declines, with losses of 33.3% and 33.1% respectively over the same period. Unicorn Fart Dust (UFD) hits a new ATH Unicorn Fart Dust, known for its whimsical name and meme-driven appeal, has recovered from a recent decline that saw it drop to $0.06. With a current market cap of $184,431,814, UFD has shown resilience, with a 41.8% increase over the last week and a significant 140.2% jump in the past 14 days. This surge has brought UFD to a new all-time high of $0.2367 on January 12, 2025. Despite this, the token’s price range over the last 24 hours from $0.1655 to $0.2367 indicates there’s still volatility at play, but overall, UFD seems to be capturing the imagination (and wallets) of investors looking for the next big meme coin. The trading volume has also been substantial at $42,706,671, suggesting robust activity around this token. Swarms (SWARMS) struggles under bearish pressure Conversely, Swarms (SWARMS) has not been as fortunate, experiencing a downturn that has shaved off 33.3% of its value in the last 24 hours, dropping to $0.1865. The token, which hit an all-time high of $0.6055 just days ago on January 07, 2025, has seen its market cap reduce to $186,967,805 from a higher peak. Swarms price chart by CoinGecko The 7-day performance for SWARMS is down by 47.3%, which paints a picture of a rapid descent from its recent highs. This bear pressure might be attributed to profit-taking by investors or perhaps a broader market correction. Despite the 14-day performance showing a hefty 232.5% increase, the immediate trend suggests SWARMS is struggling to maintain its earlier momentum, with a 24-hour trading volume of $171,170,859 indicating significant market activity, but much of it likely being sell orders. Notably, Swarms price drop comes after a whale reinvested $8 million in the token betting on another bull run after reaping big with the previous Swarms price surge. Pippin hit hard by the bearish market Pippin (PIPPIN) has also been hit hard by the bearish market, dropping 33.1% in the last 24 hours to $0.1497. With an all-time high of $0.3186 hit only two days ago on January 11, 2025, the token’s rapid fall is stark. Pippin price chart by CoinGecko The 7-day performance, however, tells a different story with a 214.3% increase, showcasing how quickly fortunes can change in the crypto world. Over 14 days, PIPPIN has seen an incredible 1645.7% rise, but this meteoric rise seems to have precipitated an equally swift fall. The market cap now stands at $147,945,241 with a 24-hour trading volume of $85,357,050, reflecting the high interest in the token even as its value decreases. The volatility of meme coins This divergence in performance among UFD, SWARMS, and PIPPIN underscores the speculative nature of investing in meme coins. While UFD has managed to capture the zeitgeist of the moment, SWARMS and PIPPIN are reminders of the crypto market’s inherent volatility, where rapid gains can be quickly eroded by market corrections or shifts in investor focus. As these memecoins navigate through the choppy waters of investor sentiment and market dynamics, the only constant seems to be change itself.

Meanwhile, Remittix is quickly emerging as one of the most promising new crypto tokens, attracting significant attention for its potential to deliver 20x returns. This article examines the factors behind these price predictions and why RTX could be the standout opportunity this year. Investors are buzzing about Remittix As the crypto market matures, identifying projects with very strong use cases and scaling is how investors reap outsized returns. Remittix is a new crypto that has gained interest over the last few weeks because of its value proposition in closing the gap between digital assets and fiat payments. At the heart of Remittix's value proposition is its crypto-to-fiat integration. This essentially means that users can instantly turn over 40 kinds of cryptocurrencies into fiat and send money to any bank account in the world. Remittix offers a flat-fee structure with no hidden costs for foreign exchange or wire transfers, making the user experience unparalleled and positioning it as a go-to option for cross-border transactions. Remittix is equally beneficial for businesses. With the Pay API on the website, online vendors can receive cryptocurrency payments but instantly settle in fiat currency. Moreover, the ability to manage funds in more than 30 kinds of fiat currencies and over 50 pairs of digital coins adds yet another layer of flexibility. Given the expanding market and the continuous rise in crypto adoption, Remittix emerges as an investment opportunity with the potential to grow by 20x for savvy traders and institutions alike. BNB could shoot past the $1,000 mark Binance Coin (BNB) might see huge growth in 2025. According to CoinCodex, BNB could record almost a 100% price increase before Q2 2025. This means its ATH could go well over $1,250 per BNB token. Bullish indicators by BNB's moving averages and momentum oscillators support the optimistic outlook. Furthermore, the recent integrations by Binance to provide fiat-to-crypto payment solutions are making BNB more useful, gaining interest from both institutional and retail investors. The token recorded positive net flows and an average of 22 green days out of 30, a sign of good market confidence in the BNB's long-term potential. TRX on track to new heights? TRX is also one of the coins with good potential for growth in 2025. It is already above $0.23, indicating a potential increase for TRX. Technical analysis shows that it has been going on a bullish trend, supported by its MACD line and the RSI. Moreover, the growing use of TRX in cross-border settlements adds strength to its position in blockchain finance, making it a favorite among traders. TRX has projections of registering $0.8 in 2025. Investors should keep an eye on market dynamics and TRON's technological advancements to evaluate TRX's prospects. Conclusion While BNB and TRX are on track to register 2x and maybe 3x gains, Remittix has a potential of up to 20x. With its presale price of just $0.0199, Remittix offers an opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth. Invest early and cash in on RTX rewards!

Critical Level Exceeded! Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-mining-difficulty-milestone-critical-level-exceeded-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) mining difficulty has reached a historic milestone, climbing to an all-time high of 110.45 trillion. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits Record High, Marking Eighth Consecutive Positive Adjustment This marks the eighth consecutive positive adjustment in difficulty and underscores the increasing competitiveness of the mining environment. Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks, approximately every two weeks, to ensure that blocks are mined at a consistent pace of every 10 minutes. The latest adjustment means that mining is currently 110.45 trillion times more difficult than it was when Bitcoin's first block was mined in 2009. The steady increase in difficulty reflects the increasing hashrate, or computational power, of the Bitcoin network, which has averaged 775 exahashes per second (EH/s) over the past seven days. Analysts suggest the network could surpass 1 zettahash per second before Bitcoin’s next halving event. Historical Context of Positive Adjustments While consecutive positive adjustments are not unprecedented, they often coincide with key moments in Bitcoin's market cycles. Bull Market 2021: Following the mining ban in China, Bitcoin difficulty rebounded with nine consecutive positive corrections, peaking in November 2021 when BTC reached a new all-time high of $69,000. 2018 Bear Market: From the $20,000 peak in December 2017, the network recorded 17 consecutive positive adjustments, followed by a sharp decline to a low of $3,000 in late 2018. These historical patterns suggest that long streaks of positive difficulty adjustments can signal impending cycle tops or bottoms. Increasing difficulty creates challenges for miners as the rewards for successfully mining blocks become harder to obtain. This has led some publicly traded mining firms, such as MARA Holdings (MARA), to diversify their operations, for example by issuing convertible bonds to mine bitcoin and optimizing their revenues through bitcoin lending. Additionally, many mining companies are expanding into the high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors to offset the decreasing margins in Bitcoin mining. *This is not investment advice.

It continued to drop on Monday of this week and is now down more than 15 percent on growing market caution, driven by surging US Treasury yields and consistent outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Notably, ETFs saw seven days of outflows in the past 12 trading days, with $718 million exiting in just two days, a sharp reversal from the early January inflows of almost $2 billion. Rising US Treasury yields have hit a 14-month high at 4.79 percent, drawing institutional money away from riskier assets like Bitcoin. Historically, BTC reacts quickly to yield spikes, but this time the impact was compounded by the news that the US Department of Justice plans to liquidate $6.5 billion in seized Bitcoin. Despite macro pressures, Bitcoin remains resilient —still up 42 percent since the US election—outperforming equities, which have erased post-election gains. However, with the Federal Reserve signalling fewer rate cuts and financial conditions tightening, Bitcoin may face more volatility in the short term. Optimism around pro-crypto regulation under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump could, however, still limit deeper losses and keep BTC in a strong long-term position. The latest economic data shows that the US economy ended 2024 with a resilient labour market and unexpected growth in the services sector. In December, the labour market added 256,000 nonfarm jobs, surpassing forecasts and marking the strongest monthly gain since March. Key industries such as healthcare, retail, and leisure led the way, with unemployment falling to 4.1 percent and wages rising by 3.9 percent year-over-year. This solid job growth , coupled with steady wage gains, is underpinning strong consumer spending, a cornerstone of the US economy. The resilient labour market has also eased pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, delaying any potential reductions until mid-2025. The services sector added to this positive momentum, with the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reporting an increase in its Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) to 54.1 in December. This growth was fuelled by rising production and new orders, signalling continued expansion across key industries such as finance, education, and hospitality. However, employment in the services sector dipped slightly , highlighting a nuanced labour landscape with sector-specific challenges. In the latest cryptocurrency news, the UK Treasury’s decision to exempt crypto staking from collective investment scheme (CIS) regulations offers clarity and flexibility for blockchain businesses, fostering innovation and solidifying the UK as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, the launch of the Supervisory Incubator for Distributed Ledger Technology by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority provides banks with a structured environment to adopt blockchain solutions like tokenised deposits while managing associated risks, setting a global precedent for balancing innovation and regulation. Crypto markets still faced some uncertainty, however, following news that the Department of Justice has been authorised to liquidate $6.5 billion worth of Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road marketplace. News of the sale contributed to the 7.2 percent price decline in Bitcoin, amplifying market concerns about potential volatility. This event, to an extent, challenges the pro-crypto sentiment that fuelled Bitcoin’s rally to its recent all-time high and reintroduces regulatory uncertainty, underscoring the delicate interplay between policy decisions and market sentiment.

This token is said to play a significant role in the Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and will primarily work towards rewarding the use of their contribution to the same. Interestingly, there is more, but first, let’s discuss the possible Treat coin price and other key details for the project. Treat Token Launch Date & Airdrop Details Shiba Inu’s new token will launch on Tuesday, January 14, 2025, at 11:00 UTC worldwide except USA due to regulatory constraints. As per the Shib Daily , the token will go live on Ethereum, with further plans to bridge it to Shibarium and Shiba Inu layer two solutions in the future. Top crypto exchanges , such as Bitget Gate.io, Kucoin, and others, have confirmed their listing for the token. Treat is paired with USDT on these exchanges, and trading will begin on January 14. Deposits have already started, but withdrawals will begin on January 15. A significant crypto airdrop will also go live, where Bitget users ( old or new before January 14) can access the 87.45M TREAT airdrop. Here, the users who have participated in locking BGB or USDT will be eligible for the Treat airdrop. People preferring BGB lock will receive their tokens from the 79.5M TREAT allotment, whereas the USDT staker will receive their designated tokens from the 7.95M TREAT tokens allotment. Additional steps include account creation, KYC verification, and wallet connection on these crypto platforms. What Will Be Shiba Inu’s Treat Coin Price at Launch? Till the time of publication, the details about the Treat coin price are undisclosed. The team has not revealed much crucial information to build hype around the Trat token launch and its performance on the charts. However, certain factors may influence the Treat’s initial valuation, including the Shiba Inu exosystem integration, which will positively aid the price performance. The Kucoin, Gate.io, and Bitget exchange listings will help the token gain much-needed marketing visibility. Many more exchanges will likely follow the hype and listing of the token. Eventually, it could fuel investor sentiments, contributing to price appreciation. Last but not least, the token’s connection with one of the most prominent and influential meme coins in the market is developing its demand. Bottom Line The Treat token pre-listing highlights showcase the high demand for the token before launch. Although the token is getting listed just after today, many crucial details are still a secret. Eventually, this builds investor enthusiasm, especially around Bitget airdrop, where users can access the 87.45M TREAT allocation. Apart from all these exciting details, US crypto users cannot access the token due to regulatory constraints. For the rest of the world, the Treat coin will go live on January 14, 2025, at 11:00 UTC. Lastly, it could grab decent attention and price performance due to integration with the Shiba Inu ecosystem, exchange listing, etc. The post Treat Token Launch Date: What Could Be the Shiba Inu’s Treat Coin Price? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Crypto Airdrop|shiba inu,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-13 13:46:22

The pullback has wiped out the gains incurred in the past couple of days and may create a massive FUD among the market participants. Meanwhile, the technicals suggest the ADA price is currently consolidating but may soon trigger a massive rebound above $1. Now the question arises: whether the Cardano price will be able to sustain above $1? In recent times, it is evident that the ADA price rally has failed to defend the support at $1 and faced a pullback each time it surged above $1. This supports the claim of bears capitulate the rally at these levels and hence, after constantly exerting pressure at this range, they may soon turn weak. This may be when the price breaches the resistance but a notable rise in the volume is also required to do so. Adding icing to the cake, the technicals flash bearish signals that may drag the levels still lower. However, this move may trap the bears as a huge rebound is fast approaching. The weekly price action of ADA appears to be bearish as the token is testing the lower support without enough buying pressure. Secondly, the MACD displays a drop in the selling pressure with the lines about to undergo a bearish crossover. Besides, the RSI failed to surpass the upper threshold, resulting in the levels dropping below 70. At this point, if the bulls manage to hold the support, then the bull flag pattern could be in play, which may initiate a strong rise to the resistance. Otherwise, a failure could force the price to test the lower support close to $0.7, exhausting all the selling pressure. Therefore, the ADA price may then trigger a strong rebound, while the bulls may try hard to maintain a healthy ascending trend later. This could delay the token to reach $1, which may further differ the possibility of marking a new ATH in 2025. Hence, the upcoming week could be pretty important for the Cardano (ADA) price rally, as a weekly close within the range may revive the bullish possibilities.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 13:50:40

In 2028, the coin could be worth between $28.69 and $34.15, with an average price of $33.15. By 2031, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $55.76 Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks Overview Cryptocurrency Cosmos Token ATOM Current Price $6.43 Market Cap $2.51B Trading Volume $480.94M Circulating Supply 390.93M ATOM All-time High $ 44.70 on Sept 19, 2021 All-time Low $1.13 on Mar 12, 2020 24-hour High $6.79 24-hour Low $6.41 Cosmos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 8.60 (32.84%) Volatility (30-day variation) 11.63% 50-Day SMA $7.71 14-Day RSI 45.33 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74 (Greed) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $6.59 Cosmos (ATOM) technical price analysis TL; DR Breakdown: ATOM trades near $6.09 with downward pressure and oversold RSI levels. Resistance is at $6.85, while support is near $5.87 based on Bollinger Bands. A break above $6.50 may push the price to $7, while a drop below $6 could lead to $5.80. ATOM/USD 1-Day price chart ATOM 1-Day price chart ; Tradingview Based on the 1-day chart for Cosmos (ATOM) on January 13, the price is trading at $6.04 and on a bearish trend declining by 6.56%. The Bollinger Bands show increased volatility, with resistance at $7.47 and immediate support at $5.87. The RSI is at 37.69, which means ATOM is in oversold conditions, which could lead to a possible reversal if buying pressure increases. The price is below the 20-day SMA of $6.67, further confirming bearish sentiment. If the price breaches $5.87, it may drop further, but recovery above $6.67 could signal consolidation or a bullish turnaround. Traders should monitor key support and resistance levels closely. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOM 4-hour price chart ; Tradingview On the 4-hour chart, Cosmos (ATOM) is trading at $6.09, showing a minor recovery of 1.56%. The price remains below the 20-period SMA at $6.50, suggesting bearish dominance in the short term. Bollinger Bands indicate reduced volatility with resistance at $6.85 and support at $6.14, which could define the near-term trading range. The Balance of Power at 0.80 hints at buyers trying to regain control, but MACD remains bearish, with the histogram showing downward momentum. A breakout above $6.50 could lead to further gains, while failure to hold $6.14 may push the price toward lower support levels around $5.87.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour charts for Cosmos (ATOM), the price faces downward pressure, trading near $6.09 with the 1-day RSI at 37.69, indicating oversold conditions. On the 4-hour chart, the price is below the 20-period SMA at $6.50, suggesting bearish momentum. Bollinger Bands indicate key resistance at $6.85 and immediate support near $5.87. The MACD shows bearish momentum on both timeframes, while the Balance of Power on the 4-hour chart suggests minor bullish attempts. If ATOM breaks above $6.50, it could test $7, but a failure to hold $6 may drive the price toward the $5.80 range. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo’s current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $50 by 2029. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will unlikely reach $100 soon. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $73.66 by 2030, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $74 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base.

During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos is trading between $7.2 to $7.5.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-13 13:51:00

This confirms that the correction is in motion and could continue unless support levels hold. ETH is currently down by more than six percent and is trading slightly above the $3000 levels. Ethereum’s Downtrend: Testing Key Support Areas Currently , Ethereum is experiencing a pullback in what appears to be part of a larger ongoing uptrend. As the price moves deeper into the support zone, it may present buying opportunities. However, this could be the final chance for bulls to regain momentum before further downside pressure takes hold. If Ethereum’s price fails to hold at key support levels, further downside is expected, and altcoins are likely to follow Ethereum’s lead. Critical Support Levels to Watch Ethereum’s price is under pressure, with a key resistance level at $3,613. If the price remains below this mark, further declines are likely. The next critical support levels to watch are around $2,920 and $2,840. These Fibonacci support areas could provide potential reversal points, but unless the price shows clear signs of an upward shift, the downtrend is likely to continue. Potential Early Reversal at Fibonacci Support There is a possibility that Ethereum’s correction could end earlier than expected. The Fibonacci extension at $2,840 is seen as a potential point for the correction to complete. However, if the downtrend lacks strong momentum or appears choppy, it may mean that the correction will finish sooner than anticipated. An early turnaround would be positive for altcoins, potentially leading to quicker recovery. Market Behavior to Watch in the Coming Sessions Over the next few days, the price action will reveal whether the current downtrend remains strong or if momentum begins to wane. If Ethereum’s price shows signs of weakening, it could signal that the correction is nearing its end, potentially allowing for a rebound. Altcoins would likely follow suit in this scenario.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 13:54:13

Over the past day, the cryptocurrency declined by almost 4%, extending its monthly losses to 11%. The downturn marks a subdued period for BTC and the entire market. During this time, the whale activity also appears to have taken a tumble. Subdued Bitcoin Market Activity In his latest update , crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a steep decline in large transactions on the Bitcoin network, suggesting reduced activity among “whales.” According to his tweet, the number of large Bitcoin transactions plummeted by 51.64% over the past month, dropping from 33,450 to 16,180. Such a dramatic reduction in whale activity often signals a cooling market, as these large players are typically seen as key drivers of Bitcoin price movements. Additionally, the Bitcoin network has witnessed a sharp decline in activity, with the number of active addresses dropping to 667,100 – its lowest level since November 2024. This reduction reflected a significant slowdown in user engagement and transactional activity across the network, which could be a sign of declining interest from both retail and institutional participants. Despite this, many argue that Bitcoin’s January slump is not unusual. January Declines Expected in Post-Halving Years Crypto analyst Axel Bitblaze provided a broader historical perspective, suggesting that the crypto asset’s downtrend so far this month is not unusual, particularly in post-halving years. In his tweet , Bitblaze pointed to similar patterns in January 2017, 2021, and now 2025, where Bitcoin experienced significant declines before pulling off notable bull runs. For instance, Bitcoin dropped from $1,185 to $800 in January 2017 and from $42,000 to $28,000 in January 2021. Hence, this year’s drop from $103,000 aligns with these precedents. Bitblaze also discussed the implications of Bitcoin dominance – the percentage of BTC’s market cap relative to the entire crypto market. Historically, the metric peaks nearly three years after a halving event. In recent months, it fell from 62% to 54%, with altcoins surging in response. Going forward, the analyst emphasized liquidity as a critical factor for the crypto market and speculated that potential economic policies, such as calls for lower interest rates as well as increased capital injection, could provide a bullish backdrop for Bitcoin. Meanwhile, on-chain indicators such as SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) suggest accumulation opportunities during periods of market pain, further aligning with historical patterns that have preceded significant price recoveries. YouTuber and analyst Crypto Rover echoed a similar sentiment and noted that the leading crypto asset has consistently declined in the first half of the month for the past year. Describing the ongoing dip as “small,” he predicted that the “bounce” in the second half of the month is “inevitable.” The post Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges to $90,600 Amid Declining Whale Activity: What’s Next? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Halving|Bitcoin Whales,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-13 13:54:56

Users owed up to $50,000 worth of digital assets have until January 20, 2025, to meet the pre-distribution requirements necessary to receive their repayments. According to Sunil , a prominent FTX creditor and member of the FTX Customer Ad-Hoc Committee, repayments are unlikely to begin before the January 20 deadline. “FTX has given until Jan. 20 to fulfill pre-distribution requirements for the initial distribution. Repayments likely won’t start before then,” Sunil stated in a January 11 post on X (formerly Twitter). FTX Repayment to Inject Significant Capital into Crypto Market The upcoming repayments could inject significant capital into the crypto market, potentially fueling further growth. Some industry watchers predict that Bitcoin’s value could surpass $200,000, driven by market activity surrounding FTX repayments and increased regulatory clarity in the United States. FTX’s restructuring plan, approved in October 2024, outlines that users claiming up to $50,000 will be the first group to receive repayments. Notably, 98% of users are expected to be reimbursed 119% of the declared value of their funds. However, the repayment model has faced criticism, as it reimburses creditors based on cryptocurrency prices at the time of FTX’s bankruptcy. Since November 2022, Bitcoin prices have surged over 370%, leading some claimants to question the fairness of the valuation. Despite this, the repayments represent a crucial step in rebuilding trust within the cryptocurrency sector. Anndy Lian, a blockchain expert, highlighted that the impact on the market will vary based on individual investor strategies. “Smaller investors might sell for financial security, while others could hold onto their funds, betting on long-term growth,” Lian noted, drawing parallels to the Mt. Gox bankruptcy case. FTX repayments Initial Distribution Schedule Claims Jan 20th: FTX has given until 20th Jan to fulfil pre distribution requirements for initial distribution Repayments likely won’t start before then Feb 25: Likely (up to 4th Mar) — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 12, 2025 The Mt. Gox collapse, a defining moment in cryptocurrency history, saw creditors receive significant Bitcoin distributions. Despite a remarkable 8,500% increase in Bitcoin’s value since the exchange’s collapse, many creditors chose to hold onto their assets, underscoring the diverse reactions of investors to such events. BitGo and Kraken to Assist with FTX Repayments Crypto firms BitGo and Kraken have announced their involvement in assisting with FTX’s repayments. If all eligible users file complete claims, FTX could distribute approximately $16 billion in total recoveries. Last week, Backpack Exchange, a cryptocurrency trading platform founded by former FTX and Alameda Research employees, claimed that it has officially acquired FTX EU , the European arm of the collapsed FTX exchange. However, FTX denied the claims, saying that the deal has not been approved by the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Meanwhile, in the US, the Justice Department is seeking the return of up to $13.25 million in political contributions linked to former FTX executives, as revealed in a recent federal court filing. Judge Lewis Kaplan, who is overseeing the criminal proceedings against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates, approved the government’s request for an extension until January 15 to negotiate with various political action committees (PACs).

Why Ethereum Seems To Be Cursed Speaking to his 178,000 followers on X, Adam pointed to a striking increase in Ethereum-related open interest, remarking: “ETH having the title of the most cursed coin in existence is well deserved because open interest in coins increased by 110% since August, yet the price is trading 20% below the 2024 highs; that’s genuinely quite bad.” In his view, this divergence between trader enthusiasm and the coin’s ongoing price stagnation indicates a fundamental gap that cannot be explained away simply by market volatility. He underscored that this dynamic seems to have brought about a paradox: while higher open interest often suggests growing market confidence, Ethereum’s price trajectory has failed to mirror such optimism, potentially because of selling pressure from the spot market. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $1.4 Billion In Exchange Outflows This Week – Strong Accumulation Trend? Adam went on to characterize many of Ethereum’s most faithful supporters as “delusional,” – especially those who are still longing ETH on the futures market – pointing out that they appear ready to increase their ETH holdings whenever the asset’s value dips. Though his stance was critical, he also acknowledged that this resilience from buyers could set the stage for a more pronounced future move. “At the same time, you can see how delusional these people are, and instead of giving up, they rather buy more every time they have a chance,” he said, capturing both his skepticism toward what he interprets as blind faith and his recognition of a potential trading opportunity in the making. By presenting two possible scenarios—one in which a sudden liquidation event could drive ETH below the $3,000 threshold and another in which the market holds steady until a potential “blind bid” around $2,700—Adam outlined the triggers he believes could define Ethereum’s medium-term trajectory. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery “Because I am some of a retard myself, I think this could set up as a great long with two possible plays, one being a liquidation event sub $3k; if that does not happen, I will probably bid sub $2.7k blindly as we have quite clear support there,” he explained, indicating a willingness to position himself in what he perceives as a high-risk, high-reward environment. This viewpoint of patience and strategic entry has resonated with other technical analysts, notably Ali (@ali_charts), who weighed in with a relatively similar price range in mind. “$2,700 to $2,800 sound like a probable scenario,” Ali stated, reflecting a sentiment that Ethereum may be poised for a correction to around these levels before any significant rebound can take place. Expanding on this, he stated that Ethereum might be tracking along an ascending parallel channel, where temporary price dips can serve as catalysts for larger movements. “If Ethereum is following an ascending parallel channel, a dip to the lower boundary at $2,800 could act as a launchpad for a move toward $6,000,” he commented. At press time, ETH traded at $3,082.

MicroStrategy bought an additional 2,530 Bitcoin ( BTC ), spending approximately $243 million on its latest acquisition, according to executive chairman Michael Saylor. The purchase marks the company’s 10th straight weekly buy, signaling no shift in Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy.

Whale Alert meldde een dump van 30,17 miljoen XRP op Coinbase, terwijl CryptoQuant een stijging van 34 miljoen XRP in exchange reserves registreerde. Tegelijkertijd worstelt XRP met technische weerstand rond $2,60 en een cruciaal steunniveau op $2,30. In dit artikel gaan we dieper in op de oorzaken van deze situatie en de mogelijke gevolgen voor de koersverwachting van XRP. Whales dumpen miljoenen XRP op Coinbase In een post op X meldde Whale Alert dat een onbekende wallet een aanzienlijke hoeveelheid van 30,17 miljoen XRP-tokens, ter waarde van $76,34 miljoen, heeft gedumpt op de exchange Coinbase. 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 30,171,667 #XRP (76,341,868 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/K86Ql4cAjQ — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 12, 2025 Daarnaast heeft het on-chain analysebedrijf CryptoQuant opgemerkt dat de exchange reserves in de afgelopen 48 uur met 34 miljoen XRP zijn toegenomen. Deze metric laat zien dat lange termijnhouders hun bezittingen naar exchanges beginnen te verplaatsen, wat kan duiden op een mogelijke sell-off en toenemende verkoopdruk. Exchange reserves. Bron: CryptoQuant Hierboven op, vinden deze sell-off signalen en opmerkelijke XRP-transacties plaats terwijl de altcoin ook technisch aan kracht lijkt te gaan verliezen. XRP crasht richting cruciale steunniveaus Na XRP’s recente uitbraak boven een cruciale dalende trendlijn verwachtten traders een grote rally. De koers keert echter terug naar $2,40, wat suggereert dat het momentum eerder afneemt dan toeneemt. Laten we de oorzaken van deze plotselinge vertraging onderzoeken en de mogelijke gevolgen voor de markt. Hoewel XRP erin slaagde door de dalende trendlijn te breken, wist de rally geen aanhoudend momentum te behouden. Dit duidt erop dat er na de uitbraak weinig koopdruk was, wat essentieel is om een rally voort te zetten. XRP is nu kwetsbaarder voor verkoopdruk door onder andere whales, die eerder besproken zijn, omdat het niet overtuigend boven de $2,50 wist af te sluiten, wat het vertrouwen van bulls heeft ondermijnd. XRP koers. Bron: TradingView Op de bredere crypto markt is een fase van risicoreductie gaande, waarbij handelaren winst nemen na recente stijgingen. Dit patroon is vooral zichtbaar bij activa zoals XRP, die al aanzienlijke winsten hebben geboekt. De verminderde risicobereidheid beperkt de kapitaalinstroom in XRP, wat de prijsstijging verder belemmert. Rond $2,60 ondervindt XRP een aanzienlijke weerstand, die de opwaartse koers belemmert. Deze weerstand, gecombineerd met een dalend volume, geeft aan dat handelaren terughoudend zijn om de prijs verder te verhogen zonder krachtigere aanjagers. Een belangrijk steunpunt om in de gaten te houden is het $2,30-niveau, dat overeenkomt met de 50 EMA. Als XRP deze grens doorbreekt, kan het lagere steunniveaus testen, zoals $1,69 of zelfs $1,20. Momenteel is de RSI neutraal rond 57, wat aangeeft dat de markt onzeker is. Als de verkoopdruk aanhoudt, kan XRP verder dalen, vooral als de bredere markt voorzichtig blijft. Een sterk herstel vanaf het $2,30-steunniveau kan echter het optimisme nieuw leven inblazen en een nieuwe poging tot uitbraak mogelijk maken. Het lijkt dan ook verstandig om opkomende crypto te ontdekken die er beter bij liggen: Mogelijke alternatieven voor XRP Ondanks de sterke stijging van Ripple in november lijkt de coin nu aan momentum te verliezen, terwijl andere crypto er aantrekkelijker voorstaan. Vooral coins die zich nog in de presale fase bevinden, bieden investeerders een unieke kans om vroeg in te stappen tegen lage prijzen en zo potentieel een veel hoger rendement te realiseren. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) Mensen die Pepe the Frog kennen, weten maar al te goed hoe groot het verdienpotentieel van deze meme is. De originele PEPE meme coin heeft een marktkapitalisatie van meer dan $7,4 miljard. Dit is precies de reden waarom de presale van Wall Street Pepe (WEPE), het slimme alternatief van de traditionele Pepe the Frog, een opmerkelijk succes is geworden. Momenteel heeft WEPE meer dan $47 miljoen aan fondsen binnengehaald. Deze prestatie toont nog maar eens aan hoe aantrekkelijk een meme coin als WEPE is. Wat deze presale echter onderscheidt, is dat het veel meer biedt dan alleen het meme aspect. De makers van deze cryptocurrency hebben een privé community opgericht die uitsluitend toegankelijk is voor WEPE-handelaren. Binnen deze community bieden ze nauwkeurige begeleiding over de optimale timing voor het kopen van de munt. Nadat jij en andere handelaren de munt hebben gekocht, promoten ze deze vervolgens op openbare platforms. Deze strategie resulteert in een prijsstijging, waardoor je de mogelijkheid krijgt om je WEPE snel te verkopen voor winst. Naar de officiële website van Wall Street Pepe Solaxy (SOLX) In een cryptovaluta landschap dat grotendeels wordt beïnvloed door meme coins, is het eenvoudig om het bestaan ​​van cryptoprojecten die verschillende functies vervullen en voordelen bieden aan zowel handelaren als ontwikkelaars, over het hoofd te zien. Gelukkig laat Solaxy (SOLX) zien dat utility-driven munten een waardevolle investeringsmogelijkheid kunnen vertegenwoordigen. Solaxy functioneert zowel als een netwerk als een cryptovaluta. Het Solaxy-netwerk fungeert specifiek als een layer 2 solution die is gebouwd op de Solana blockchain. Zoals je wellicht weet, wordt het Solana-netwerk gekenmerkt door zijn snelle transactie snelheden en lage kosten, waardoor het bijzonder geschikt is voor de ontwikkeling van meme coins. Het is echter minder effectief voor decentrale financiële (DeFi) toepassingen vanwege frequente transactiefouten en onvoldoende liquiditeit. Door zowel de Solana-blockchain als Ethereum te gebruiken, heeft Solaxy deze problemen succesvol aangepakt. Bijgevolg wordt het netwerk gekenmerkt door snelheid, kosteneffectiviteit en betrouwbaarheid. Het is dus slechts een kwestie van tijd voordat een aanzienlijk aantal DeFi-ontwikkelaars overstapt op Solaxy. Dit zal vervolgens een positieve invloed op de prijs van de token hebben. Naar de officiële website van Solaxy Best Wallet (BEST) Net als Solaxy vertegenwoordigt Best Wallet (BEST) een project dat ook utility biedt binnen de markt. In tegenstelling tot Solaxy richt Best Wallet zich echter niet op een specifieke blockchain of netwerk; het omvat eerder een uitgebreid crypto-ecosysteem. Dit ecosysteem omvat een cryptocurrency-wallet, een gedecentraliseerde exchange en een debitcard met 8% cashback. De huidige snelle groei van dit platform is opmerkelijk, aangezien het de honderdduizend gebruikers op zowel Android als iOS heeft overschreden. Deze ontwikkeling voorspelt veel goeds voor de waarde van BEST, de native token van het platform. Een toename van het aantal gebruikers dat met Best Wallet bezig is, correleert met een toegenomen vraag naar BEST. Het bezitten van $BEST biedt gebruikers talloze voordelen. Dit maakt lagere transactiekosten mogelijk, zowel op de beurs als via de debitcard, terwijl het ook toegang geeft tot exclusieve presales van de nieuwste munten die alleen beschikbaar zijn op Best Wallet.

Cardano (ADA): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Platform Cardano is a blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, enabling the development of decentralized finance applications, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the Cardano network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is more energy-efficient compared to the traditional proof-of-work model. The blockchain is divided into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contract computations. This design enhances its transaction processing capability, potentially up to a million transactions per second. The potential of Cardano and its cryptocurrency ADA lies in its sustainable approach and scalability. By utilizing proof-of-stake, Cardano reduces energy consumption, addressing environmental concerns associated with blockchain technology. The separation of transaction and computation layers allows for higher efficiency. In March 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens, offering secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. In the current market cycle, ADA presents an option for those interested in scalable and sustainable blockchain solutions. Its focus on innovation and energy efficiency may make it attractive to investors and developers in the cryptocurrency market. Solana’s SOL: A Scalable Blockchain for Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dapps) with a focus on scalability. It competes with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana stands out with architectural choices aimed at faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL, the native cryptocurrency of Solana, is central to its ecosystem. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards network supporters. The SOL coin holds value by underpinning the operation of the Solana ecosystem. It rewards network participants and allows users to access a range of projects on the platform. Unlike some other blockchains, Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. It aims to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network capable of hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, the coin’s technology and ecosystem may appeal to those interested in scalable blockchain solutions. Conclusion As ADA and SOL reach new heights in the bull run, XYZVerse stands out , aiming for 20,000% growth by uniting sports fans in a unique, community-driven memecoin movement.

Bitcoin has plunged to $92,000, while the market cap of all coins has fallen by 3.5% in the last 24 hours to $3.15 trillion. XLM’s futures open interest and weekly transactions have fallen, pointing to more downside this week. Stellar Price Falls As Open Interest Retreats The XLM price continued its downtrend amid waning demand in the spot and futures market as the crypto sentiment worsened. According to CoinGlass , the futures interest has dropped to over $224 million, down from the year-to-date high of $307 million. Futures open interest is a gauge that looks at all open call and put trades in the market. A call option gives a trader a right but not the obligation to sell, while a put gives them the right and not to sell at the strike price. In most cases, cryptocurrency futures open interest rises when a coin is in an uptrend. In other instances, some contrarians take the falling open interest as a good buying opportunity. For example, as shown below, the interest almost dried up in the third and some part of the fourth quarter of last year. The coin then went parabolic in November, soaring by almost 500%. Stellar Open Interest Stellar price has also fallen as on-chain data show that the number of weekly transactions continued falling. These transactions peaked at over 90 million in 2023 and have dropped to below 40 million. Stellar’s Weekly Operations XLM Price Analysis: Technicals Send Mixed Signals The daily chart shows that the Stellar price is sending mixed signals. On the positive side, the token formed a falling wedge chart pattern between December 2 and 31, explaining why it made a strong bullish breakout earlier this month. Also, the XLM price has continued to be supported by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Further, there are signs that it is forming a small bullish flag pattern. This popular pattern comprises a vertical line and some consolidation and is a common continuation sign. Therefore, while the coin has pulled back, it is likely to bounce back and possibly move to the psychological point at $0.50, up by 26% above the current level. On the risky side of the bearish XLM price prediction , there are signs that it has faced substantial resistance at $0.4850. Stellar Price Chart As such, a drop below the 50-day moving average at $0.3160 will point to more downside, potentially to the 100-day moving average at $0.3163.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) crashed by 16% from its highest level in December and is hovering near its lowest point since November 19. Other altcoins like Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ) also continued falling. The ongoing crypto crash is largely attributed to rising expectations that the Federal Reserve will adopt a more hawkish stance this year. These expectations grew after the U.S. published strong nonfarm payroll data on Friday. The data showed that the unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% in December as the economy added over 256,000 jobs. These figures led to lower stock prices and higher government bond yields . The first potential catalyst for a Bitcoin rebound is the upcoming U.S. consumer inflation data, scheduled for release on Wednesday. Economists expect the data to show that inflation rose from 2.7% in November to 2.9% in December. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to remain at 3.3%. You might also like: Crypto market inflows plummet more than 50% by end of 2024: analyst Bitcoin and other altcoins may rebound if inflation numbers come in lower than expected. For instance, if the headline and core Consumer Price Index drop to 2.5% and 3.0%, respectively, it could spark a recovery in crypto prices. Another key factor to watch is the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump, which could impact the crypto market. Trump campaigned on making the U.S. the global crypto capital and has already made some moves toward that goal. He appointed Paul Atkins as the next Securities and Exchange Commission chief and started forming a crypto panel of experts. Therefore, his upcoming inauguration and Gary Gensler’s resignation may lead to hype in the crypto industry. All this is happening as companies like MicroStrategy and Semler Scientific continue buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin price technicals BTC chart | Source: crypto.news Another potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s price is its technical setup. BTC is holding at a key support level of $90,100, a point it has not breached since December. This suggests that bears are hesitant to place short positions below this level. Additionally, the accumulation and distribution indicator has been rising, signaling ongoing accumulation. While the $90,100 support level forms the neckline of a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern, Bitcoin is likely to bounce back this week.

However, the greatest benefits are often found in smaller altcoins. The new IntelMarkets (INTL), Cardano (ADA), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are some of the digital currencies that are ready to give great investment opportunities. IntelMarkets, however, is still in the presale phase, but the hype has already started with money pouring in from investors. So, let’s talk about these three best altcoins and how they are different from each other. Cardano (ADA): A Strong Contender One of the best altcoins in the digital currencies industry is Cardano (ADA). This, along with the emphasis on the scientific method and modern use of blockchain, has made it the talk of the town. In January 2025, Cardano’s price ranged from $1.05 to $1.13 in the first week. It then fell the second week of January to around $0.80 to $90. However, because the further development of ADA demands flexibility and toughness, this decline did not scare or intimidate investors. Source: CoinMarketCap Another solid aspect of Cardano (ADA) is the involvement of Ouroboros proof-of-stake. This allows not only security but also energy efficiency. Additionally, Cardano (ADA) is a flexible player in the cryptocurrency market because it is suitable for both smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Potential buyers should be attracted to the fact that this altcoin is currently below 1$. It can be very valuable as an investment in the future. However, the architectural design of Cardano and its slower adoption can be a challenge. Because of that, the AI-focused strategy and easy trading platforms of IntelMarkets are more preferred. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin Struggles What started as a joke housing the ‘DOGE’ meme has now turned into a serious contender in the altcoins universe. However, it has been quite a bumpy ride during the volatile existence of the platform. In early January 2025, the price of Dogecoin was around $0.40, but this is still much lower than its price during the last cycle, which was $0.74. DOGE must hold above $0.32 to avoid such a fall in the Dogecoin price, as the DOGE could be below $0.16 if the meme coin trades below this crucial resistance level. Source: CoinMarketCap The key attraction of DOGE has always been the significant community backing and the meme token’s claim to be the ‘people’s cryptocurrency.’ One can use it for tipping and small purchases, making it valuable in the real world. However, there is not much technological growth compared to rivals such as Cardano or IntelMarkets , which may act as a problem for its further development. IntelMarkets: The Emerging Powerhouse Unlike the above two, IntelMarkets is a relatively new platform that has yet to enter the market. Even though it is in the presale phase, it is bringing innovation. IntelMarkets is currently in stage 9 of its presale. The cost of each altcoin is only $0.08, making it one of the most promising and economically feasible altcoins. The project has raised over $6.5 million in the presale stage, proving that IntelMarkets provides great prospects for further development. Source: IntelMarkets The main difference lies in the fact that IntelMarkets combines AI technology with blockchain. The technical implementation of the platform includes an AI-based blockchain for instant data processing, better trading access, and self-learning trading robots that improve strategies daily. IntelMarkets also supports the multi-chain approach that allows users to engage in operations through both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. It is an outstanding opportunity for processing data from different markets within seconds and the most effective trading system. IntelMarkets is potentially one of the best altcoins, and the future of trading is based on its artificial intelligence, blockchain, and DeFi technologies. Through its presale and unique features, IntelMarkets is gradually becoming one of the best altcoins that cost less than $1. Conclusion A comparison of Dogecoin price (DOGE), IntelMarkets, and Cardano (ADA) shows that each coin has benefits. While Dogecoin is well-known and has its own fan base, Cardano (ADA) has a strong technological foundation and has grown steadily over time. However, IntelMarkets might be considered superior to its rivals and potentially one of the best altcoins in terms of innovation and pricing. Its successful presale and incorporation of advanced AI technology rank it as a promising cryptocurrency under $1. For those searching for the best cryptocurrencies, IntelMarkets can be considered an early-stage investment in a modern initiative.

According to the company, the move was taken to improve its compliance framework and ensure stringent measures against misuse by malicious actors. Mudrex CEO Edul Patel defended the move, saying: “As an accountable platform, we must have healthy systems to tackle malicious activities and improve customer services.” Patel had given the move the spin of pre-emptive compliance, which has left quite a few people surprised by a sudden freeze in withdrawals. Critics noted that there had been no such advance notice before the compliance upgrade was implemented. Community Backlash Intensifies The news was attracting a broad spot in the limelight as crypto trader Vivan Live issued a warning on X Social Media platform to urge users to immediately withdraw their funds. “Congrats! Mudrex disables Crypto Withdrawals! Take your funds now or lose them!” Other members of the crypto community expressed their skepticism about Mudrex’s operations, claiming the platform was not transparent. One such member, Aakash Athawasya, went so far as to state that Mudrex is offering “price exposure, not ownership,” adding that he would not “go near the platform with a ten-foot pole. These apart, Mudrex is one of the few Indian exchanges that facilitate crypto withdrawals – a feature mostly not supported by the country’s restrictive crypto environment. Growing regulatory pressure in India Mudrex’s decision comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny in India. The country’s evolving regulatory landscape has already prompted some exchanges, such as Bybit, to scale back operations. Bybit recently announced it would halt key services, including trading and new account openings, for Indian users starting January 12. These developments highlight the ongoing challenges faced by crypto platforms navigating India’s complex compliance requirements while maintaining user trust. CoinDCX: A Positive Shift As Mudrex is amidst a controversy, its competitor CoinDCX launched the phased rollout of crypto withdrawal functionality for 1.5 million users. The CEO, Sumit Gupta, said on X that the expansion will be gradual over time. Users, however, can enable crypto withdrawals only after they deactivate Indian rupee deposits permanently. INR withdrawals, however, remain active. The move by CoinDCX marks a significant step forward in addressing the demands of users for better withdrawal options, setting a potential benchmark for Indian crypto exchanges navigating regulatory pressures.",Blockchain|India|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-13 15:33:03

This marks the eighth consecutive increase in the difficulty adjustment level. Mining difficulty describes how challenging it can be for Bitcoin miners to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to mine the flagship asset. It adjusts after every 2,016 blocks, approximately every two weeks, to ensure that the average block mining period stays around 10 minutes. Bitcoin Mining Difficulty (Source: CoinWarz) However, the increase in mining difficulty is unsurprising given the increase in Bitcoin Hashrate over the last few months. Hashrate refers to the amount of computing power on the Bitcoin network, and its increase usually contributes to positive adjustments in mining difficulty. According to data from Coinwarz, Bitcoin hashrate is now at 847 exahash per second (EH/s). Although this is slightly far off from the peak of 955 EH/s on January 2, 2025, it is still very high and highlights the heavy competition among miners. What does BTC Difficulty mean for its price? With Bitcoin mining difficulty increasing, Crypto analyst James Van Straten has noted that this is not the first time that Bitcoin mining difficulty will increase consecutively for such a lengthy period. In the past, there were nine consecutive positive adjustments in 2021 and 17 consecutive increases in 2018. The nine positive adjustments in 2021 coincided with the bull run, with the ninth one marking the market top, and this was when Bitcoin hit $69,000. There are now concerns that the new increase could signal that BTC is near its top for this cycle, particularly given how the flagship asset price has performed over the last few weeks. However, there is not enough historical data to justify such a theory. The longest period of consecutive positive adjustments happened in 2018, during a bear market. At the time, Bitcoin saw 17 positive adjustments from its cycle top in December 2017, when it was worth $20,000, to June 2018, when it had fallen to around $6,000. Even Van Straten admits that November 2021 was the last time a positive adjustment marked a cycle top, and consecutive positive adjustments can either mark a cycle top or bottom. Still, many believe we are not close to the top yet and expect Bitcoin to rip higher in 2025. Miners remain profitable despite the increase in difficulty Meanwhile, the increasing difficulty has not significantly impacted miners’ profitability. According to Bitinfocharts data, miners are still profitable at around $0.048 per day for one Terahash per second (TH/s). ASIC Miner Value also shows that most machines remain profitable for Bitcoin miners. The profitability is likely because of the price of BTC. Despite falling over 8% in the last seven days, Bitcoin remains over $90,000. Nevertheless, the increasing difficulty of mining could pose a problem for miners, especially if BTC continues to fall in value. This already highlights Bitcoin miners’ struggles, adding to several pressures, including high energy costs, increasing competition, and reduced mining rewards. This explains why many Bitcoin miners have opted for a new and more stable revenue stream in the form of hosting high-performance computers (HPCs) for AI developers to offset their dependence on BTC. Interestingly, many are also joining the holders, choosing to keep their BTC instead of selling it for cash, as they tend to do in the past. Collectively, they now hold over 92,000 BTC; some, like Marathon Digital, even bought BTC.

This innovative project combines artificial intelligence and blockchain, offering both scalability and real-world utility. With $10.6 million raised in its presale and tokens priced at $0.00525, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction among savvy investors. As it continues to gain momentum, many are predicting that this token could deliver explosive returns, making it the next big investment opportunity in the crypto space. Solana’s Success Story- Turning Small Investments into Big Wins In 2021, a buyer changed a $577 bet in Solana (SOL) into $171,000, showing the power of early buys in new digital coins. Right now, this buyer is looking at Rexas Finance (RXS), called the Solana Killer, trying to copy past wins. Rexas Finance aims to turn real-world goods into tokens, giving a presale cost of $0.07 for each token which interests buyers wanting big gains with low first spending͏ RXS has caught a lot of eyes, getting $26,375,000 fast in its ninth presale step. While the charm of big gains is tempting its important to do deep research and judge the risks that come with putting money into fresh and shaky crypto projects. The Search for the Next SOL-Like Opportunity The search for the next SOL-like opportunity in crypto is centered around projects with groundbreaking technology and strong growth potential, and Lightchain AI fits that description. Like Solana, which rose to prominence for its scalability and speed, Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence, addressing key challenges like data privacy, scalability, and decentralized governance. With over $10.6 million raised in its presale and a well-defined roadmap, Lightchain AI is poised for explosive growth. As industries increasingly adopt decentralized AI solutions, Lightchain AI could become the next major player, offering substantial returns for early investors. Lightchain AI- Promising Substitute for Recreating Massive Gains Lightchain AI presents a promising substitute for recreating massive gains with its innovative approach to blockchain and artificial intelligence. The presale has already raised over $10.6 million, showcasing strong investor interest. The tokenomics allocates 40% of the total supply to the presale, with 28.5% reserved for staking rewards and 15% for liquidity, ensuring long-term growth. As the platform progresses through key stages, including its Testnet Rollout (Jan 2025) and Mainnet Launch (Mar 2025), Lightchain AI offers a unique opportunity for exponential returns, making it a prime choice for investors seeking high potential in the evolving crypto space. So, while SOL may have already delivered impressive gains, Lightchain AI offers a new avenue for investors to recreate those successes. With its innovative technology and strong growth potential, this SOL substitute is one to watch in the rapidly expanding blockchain landscape. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

This innovative project combines artificial intelligence and blockchain, offering both scalability and real-world utility. With $10.6 million raised in its presale and tokens priced at $0.00525, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining traction among savvy investors. As it continues to gain momentum, many are predicting that this token could deliver explosive returns, making it the next big investment opportunity in the crypto space. Solana’s Success Story- Turning Small Investments into Big Wins In 2021, a buyer changed a $577 bet in Solana (SOL) into $171,000, showing the power of early buys in new digital coins. Right now, this buyer is looking at Rexas Finance (RXS), called the Solana Killer, trying to copy past wins. Rexas Finance aims to turn real-world goods into tokens, giving a presale cost of $0.07 for each token which interests buyers wanting big gains with low first spending͏ RXS has caught a lot of eyes, getting $26,375,000 fast in its ninth presale step. While the charm of big gains is tempting its important to do deep research and judge the risks that come with putting money into fresh and shaky crypto projects.

Those upgrades included the long-awaited Nakamoto update that dramatically increased the project’s speed and achieved 100% finality on Bitcoin for all its transactions. According to Ali, a new orientation for Stacks is even more appropriate given that crypto is now firmly in the throes of a bull market, powered by the election of Donald Trump and what is expected to be a more favorable environment for crypto development. “The bio change was a signal to the community that, ‘hey, we understand that these times are different, and you need to move much faster and be much more aggressive,’” Ali said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Not that there won't be product upgrades in 2025, but I would say the product stops being the focus of the work.” Here, Ali discusses what he would have done differently with the Nakamoto upgrade if he could, his frank thoughts on Lightning’s slow progress at enabling payments via bitcoin, where he sees bitcoin’s price going in 2025 and his ultimate goal of getting one billion people on-chain via Stacks.

I still think Bitcoin needs a really, really good L2. One reason is that Bitcoin's UX is not going to change at the L1 level; you're never going to have fast, cheap transactions at the L1. And that's why a lot of people were interested in Lightning. It’s been around for a while, it has had some adoption, but not a ton. Let's be real about it. So I think there's still a need for extremely fast, great UX Bitcoin transactions. I would say even Solana has achieved that way better than Lightning or anything else. So one of the things that we want to do is have a Solana-like Bitcoin L2, where you can move any amount of capital super fast, and it's a great UX experience. And I think that's one goal that we are hitting with Nakamoto. Is there anything you would have done differently with respect to Nakamoto’s rollout if you could? So the Nakamoto launch happened in a lot of phases. First, the core consensus capital moved in April. Then we launched the fast blocks, but the more complex transactions couldn't benefit from it. And then we did another release where the more complex transactions could also benefit. But looking back, it's like there was a trickled release. So people had high expectations at every step, and then they're like ‘oh, it's not here yet, it's not here yet.’ So by the time it fully launched, I think it took away some of the excitement, frankly. Do you think we'll continue to see interest swing back to building and programming on Bitcoin as opposed to Ethereum and other chains in 2025? I think so. Bitcoin is like one of those things that is like a class of its own in a way; it just never goes away. Even if you think about what's happening in the public markets and how many public companies are now building Bitcoin treasuries, Bitcoin is so far ahead of anything else in terms of adoption. So there was more excitement about Bitcoin L2s maybe a year ago, and it seemed to have cooled down a little bit. But I think Bitcoin is so fundamental that people will just come back to it. How do you think Donald Trump will affect the course of Bitcoin? A lot. Look at the people he's picking, like David Sachs as crypto and AI czar. He’s a big LP at Multicoin Capital and fully updated on crypto and Solana, so I think it makes a huge difference. And the same is true for some of the other people that Trump is picking as advisors. In the U.S. for the last four years, the government and the regulatory bodies were literally just fighting us. Now I think they're actually going to actively support and encourage things, which is a huge 180. It helps a lot. Also, if any of the Bitcoin Reserve [plans] happen, that's going to be a huge, huge signal throughout the world. Even if they happen [just] at the state level, like in Texas or Wyoming, it will send a huge signal around the world. What’s your guess on where bitcoin's price might be at the end of year? I'm still a believer in the four year cycle, with the current cycle I see as ending in Q4 2025. And even though there are some reasons to believe that maybe the cycles won't be that intense, I'm personally still a believer. I'd be surprised if we don't see $150,000 by the end of the year, and I do think we can see $200,000. That would be my high range. When are we going to see fast and efficient payments via bitcoin? We're trying to make it happen ourselves. And I think Lightning deserves a lot of credit — there are a lot of die-hard fans that use it. But the technology was complex and not very easy to integrate, and the Bitcoin community really just got behind one project. And I think the way to do this is you let dozens of experiments happen and see what attracts attention. One of the things I like about Bitcoin L2s with so many different projects getting started is that finally we are seeing multiple experiments happen. If Lightning was too hard to integrate, let other projects have a go at it. If you go to a Bitcoin conference or hear from some of the top people like [MicroStrategy Founder] Michael Saylor, there’s this attitude that Lightning is the solution and the only solution. They wouldn't talk about any other L2s, and I think some of that has to do with the fact that some of these L2s have their own tokens. The bitcoin community doesn't like that. But I think they're slowly now at least opening up. What are you excited about discussing at Consensus Hong Kong? How do we take Bitcoin to a billion people? That's something that excites me and drives some of the technology decisions that we make. If that’s your goal, you almost immediately start looking for L2s, because on L1, a billion people can't even own UTXOs [ Unspent Transaction Outputs ]. I don't know that a lot of Bitcoiners even realize that a billion people cannot own a UTXO on-chain on Bitcoin alone. That’s something that probably doesn't get talked about that much in our industry. People have made peace with onboarding people to Bitcoin through Coinbase and Binance and maybe through ETFs. But that’s not what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin is about decentralization and self-custody and people being in control directly. We can't forget that mission.",Consensus Hong Kong 2025 Coverage|chk2025|Muneeb Ali|Stacks|Lightning Network|Bitcoin Price,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-13 15:36:12

PEPE is trading bearish, slipping below its key support levels as Bitcoin’s performance influences altcoin trends. Currently, Bitcoin hovers below $95K, raising concerns of further declines. Will the PEPE price crash 50% as Bitcoin weakens further? Could Pepe Coin Price Crash 50% Following BTC Recent Weakness? PEPE price is trading at $0.00001625, with a 8% decrease in the past 24-hours. Bitcoin’s recent price weakness has raised concerns among analysts about its key support levels and broader market impact. Crypto analyst speculates that BTC holding $93,000 remains critical. However, aggression from sellers could increase significantly if this level is lost. Based on technical analysis, there is a high likelihood of Bitcoin falling below this mark. If $93,000 gives way, the next target for Bitcoin is $85,000, but a brief dip further could unsettle potential buyers. Pepe Coin price has also felt market pressure. Over the past week, the meme coin broke below the $0.00002 mark. This signals growing weakness as Bitcoin’s performance heavily influences altcoin movements. If Bitcoin continues to falter, Pepe Coin may see further declines. For Pepe Coin price, maintaining $0.000015 as a support level is crucial. A break below this threshold could lead to a 50% price crash, signaling a bearish trend. Source: X Pepe Coin Price Structure Hints Crash Pepe Coin price faces a critical moment on the 3-day chart as it breaks below a significant trading range. The Volume Profile reveals the Value Area High (VAH) at $0.00001450, marking the next key support. A breakdown below VAH could lead to a 45% crash, while a rebound might trigger a 100% rally to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. On-chain metrics highlight intriguing signals about Pepe’s potential movement, underscoring the importance of investor vigilance. Source: Tweet On-chain Metrics Support PEPE Bears Bitcoin currently trades at a critical support zone between $90,000 and $92,000. Market analysts suggest flipping this level could trigger a broader market correction. If this occurs, PEPE and other altcoins might face severe downward pressure, with some forecasting potential price drops exceeding 50%. The recent PEPE market activity has sparked speculation among investors, especially as non-exchange holders continue to offload their holdings. Whale transactions exceeding $1 million have steadily declined, indicating diminished interest from large investors. This trend is coupled with a visible reduction in the supply of PEPE held on exchanges. These signals often precede significant market volatility, raising questions about the token’s near-term trajectory. Santiment The 365-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for PEPE highlights that the token is nearing capitulation levels. Historically, these levels often precede market reversals as selling pressure dissipates. However, traders remain cautious, with current metrics suggesting that the token may still have room to drop before finding a stable floor. Santiment The price of Pepe Coin faces significant risk amid Bitcoin’s weakening. A breakdown below $0.000015 could trigger a 50% crash. On-chain metrics and technical analysis highlight bearish signals, emphasizing investor caution as market volatility threatens further declines for PEPE.

The partnership integrates Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ) and Euro Coin ( EURC ) into BDA’s platform, allowing customers to use these stablecoins for deposits, withdrawals, and payments. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a consistent value by being backed 1:1 by traditional currencies like the euro or U.S. dollar. USDC and EURC, issued by Circle, are backed entirely by cash or cash-equivalent assets held at regulated financial institutions, according to a company release. This ensures that customers can exchange them for their equivalent value in fiat currency at any time.

Find Out Why,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/dogecoin-doge-unlikely-to-sustain-its-position-in-2025-as-the-number-one-meme-coin-find-out-why,"Dogecoin has long been an icon in the meme coin world, almost becoming a metaphor for the broader genre. Having offered unparalleled returns to early adopters, the playful meme coin may now struggle to stay relevant in 2025 as the cryptocurrency market evolves. With increasing competition, questions about utility, and new innovative projects, Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself between a rock and a hard place. Many investors are now turning to one emerging investment opportunity with the potential for sizable returns: Remittix. This advanced project takes a unique approach to addressing the inefficiencies in the cross-border payments space, and its presale is racking up some serious attention. So how will these two projects fare in 2025? Dogecoin Price Drops As It Struggles To Keep Up The Pace Dogecoin (DOGE) gained notoriety due to its quirky branding, dedicated community, and major endorsements, perhaps the most significant of which was made by Elon Musk. It famously surpassed $0.73 in 2021, turning ordinary crypto enthusiasts into overnight millionaires. Zooming forwards to January 2025, much of that momentum has died down, with Dogecoin trading at $0.3341. Last month saw a further 18.9% Dogecoin price drop, reflecting waning enthusiasm. Speculation continues around Musk’s potential integration of Dogecoin (DOGE) into his X platform (formerly Twitter), but concrete applications remain scarce. Meanwhile, the meme coin market has grown fiercely competitive. New entrants with advanced ecosystems, utility-driven innovations, and token burn mechanisms threaten to outshine Dogecoin, pressuring it to evolve or risk irrelevance. For investors who once relied on Dogecoin’s speculative appeal, the search for more utility-driven projects is becoming more commonplace. Remittix Sets New Standards For Cross-Border Payments As Dogecoin wrestles with uncertainty, Remittix (RTX) is carving out a reputation as a project rooted in real-world utility, with the potential to disrupt the $190 trillion cross-border payment market. By streamlining inefficiencies, Remittix bridges the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional fiat systems with precision and purpose. Users can convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send funds directly to bank accounts globally. Unlike traditional payment systems bogged down by slow processing and hidden fees, Remittix (RTX) employs a transparent flat-fee model, delivering substantial cost savings and ease of use. What truly sets Remittix (RTX) apart is its accessibility. Designed for simplicity, it allows recipients to receive payments as standard bank transfers, bypassing the need for cryptocurrency knowledge. This user-friendly approach makes it a standout option for individuals, businesses, and merchants aiming to integrate digital assets seamlessly into their financial workflows. By solving these fundamental problems in the space, Remittix is redefining what could be possible for global payment systems. For businesses, the Remittix Pay API facilitates the acceptance of crypto payments while enabling fiat settlement. Additionally, merchants can use dedicated accounts to manage over 50 crypto pairs and 40 fiat currencies, offering flexibility and control in an increasingly digital economy. The RTX token is central to the Remittix ecosystem, serving key functions such as in governance and staking. As the presale progresses, Remittix (RTX) has already attracted over $2.5 million in investments, with tokens currently available to early adopters for just $0.0199. By the end of the presale, experts expect an 800% increase in value, and gains could be even greater once the project scales post-launch. As Remittix starts to tap into the cross-border payments industry, it is poised to disrupt the PayFi space in 2025.

Today, January 13, 2025, ETH has witnessed a price decline of over 7.5% in the past 24 hours, making it the largest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies . Source: Coinglass Traders Lose $171 Million Worth of Ethereum (ETH) This massive price decline has resulted in the liquidation of a significant $171.50 million worth of traders’ open positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Source: Coinglass However, the majority of the liquidation occurred in the past four hours, during which traders have lost nearly $100 million worth of positions. Of this substantial liquidation, $85 million comes from traders holding long positions, while short sellers have witnessed $14 million worth of liquidation. This liquidation that the overall market witnessed occurred when ETH failed to hold the crucial support at the $3,200 mark and also breached the support provided by the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Given the significant price decline, expert technical analysis suggests that ETH has shifted toward a downtrend, with a strong possibility of reaching the $2,850 level. The potential reason for this bold speculation is the breakdown of the crucial support level and the current market sentiment. Source: Trading View Earlier, on January 9, 2025, ETH broke down from a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern and later entered consolidation. During this period, bulls, hopeful of further upside momentum, built heavy positions. However, today, with the bearish market sentiment, ETH has failed to hold the support and has fallen significantly. Current Price Momentum Currently, ETH is trading near $3,020 and has witnessed a price decline of 7% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume increased by 170%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Along with ETH, the overall cryptocurrency market has been witnessing a bloodbath, with traders holding long positions being the ones most severely affected. Besides ETH, the overall crypto market has witnessed a massive $700 million worth of crypto liquidations, with $593 million coming from traders holding long positions and $108 million from traders holding short positions.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 15:46:07

Established crypto tokens such as Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) have noticeably increased in value; however, some recent estimates suggest that Rexas Finance (RXS), an emerging altcoin currently priced at $0.175 during its Stage 11 presale, may offer a more lucrative return on investment (ROI) in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Quiet Contender Breaking Barriers Rexas Finance is quite different from other cryptocurrencies because it is a powerful and cutting-edge project. Through Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, RXS enables anyone to own fractions of valuable high-worth assets, such as real estate, arts, or even commodities. This approach seeks to solve a $16 trillion market problem by integrating tangible assets into a blockchain-based system. RXS has multiplied sixfold in value, exceeding 483 percent, which has primarily been achieved owing to the investment in the first presale stage, which was $0.03. The numbers speak for themselves. Over 392 million tokens have already been sold in Stage 11, raising $35.5 million and achieving 92% completion. At this pace, early investors could see prices hit $0.20 before the presale concludes, setting the stage for explosive growth once RXS goes live. Ripple's astounding surge exemplifies the blockchain revolution. With innovative strategies, circulation, and usefulness, Rexas Finance has all the ingredients to replicate and outperform XRP / SOL’s success. Investors could achieve a similar growth of 39,000% in 2025. Investors expect RXS's growth trajectory to be among the most spectacular features, much more than the others offer. Rexas Finance’s affiliation with CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko enhances its credibility and visibility. Investors can monitor market changes in real time, which promotes transparency. Furthermore, the project's decision not to seek venture capital further glamorizes its commitment to empowering retail investors. The RXS Momentum: Outperforming Solana and Ripple RXS has established itself as a mainstream alternative to Solana and Ripple crypto assets, even as an emerging crypto. Firstly, this year, Solana has already suffered from seven outages in its network, which makes it doubtful of its capabilities as a scalable network. On the other hand, Ripple continues to be a leader in international payment. Still, its legal brawls, especially in the US, hold it back from making significant strides in the market. Ripple (XRP) has suffered another 46.16% decrease in 24-hour trading volume, with its price at $2.44. On the other hand, Rexas Finance has maintained an uptrend, increasing by 483% over the last 60 days. RXS was only $0.030 when the presale commenced; in September 2024, it was priced at $0.175, having crossed level 11 stages and given a 6x return on investment. RXS: A Time-Sensitive Opportunity RXS stands at a promising position at the moment; while the presale is ongoing, the clock is ticking for investors looking to acquire tokens. A historical trend can be observed from tokens such as Solana and Ripple, witnessing a market return of 20,000%; such scenarios are less likely for latecomers. The presale is nearing completion, so now is the right time to secure RXS before the price surges. The token is still below $0.20 and quite affordable; Savvy investors looking for long-term gains should grab hold of RXS now to avoid missing out on what could easily be one of the most profitable investments of the year. Conclusion Due to its presale and never-ending giveaways, Rexas Finance is on a path to becoming one of the leading contenders in cryptocurrency. Moreover, unlike other platforms, it shows a promising focus on the future through technology. Its sustainability and adaptability remain evident due to its dedication to changing the decentralized finance world and real estate tokenization. In this new world of opportunity, Rexas finance is one of a kind due to the new perspective and investment propositions it brings to the table; alongside delivering extensive rewards to the early investors, it has the potential to change unsparing for good. Considering the projection of a 57x return on investment by the end of 2025, RXS will parallel the exceptional advancement of Ripple and will help many investors change their lives for good.

With President-elect Trump hinting at pro-crypto policies, the industry is gearing up for a game-changing year packed with new ideas. Paul Veradittakit, managing partner at Pantera Capital, has shared his take on what’s next for crypto in 2025 in an email newsletter shared with crypto.news. Pulling insights from the Pantera team, he’s spotlighted eight key trends — some already gaining traction, others just starting to emerge. Here’s a simple glimpse of what might take off this year. Table of Contents Real-world assets surge on-chain Bitcoin-Fi finds momentum Gateways Unichain to lead l2 transactions NFTs will make a comeback Restaking protocols to debut mainnets Bringing web2 data on blockchain Crypto-friendly regulatory shift Real-world assets surge on-chain RWAs like private credit, Treasury bills, and commodities are gaining traction. In 2024, RWAs grew over 60%, reaching $13.7 billion in value. Veradittakit predicts RWAs will make up 30% of the on-chain total value locked in 2025, up from 15% as of January. “There are specialized companies that manage wallets, minting mechanisms, Sybil sensing, crypto neo-banks, and more, meaning it may finally be possible and feasible to introduce stocks, ETFs, bonds, and other more complex financial products on-chain.” Paul Veradittakit Private credit is leading the charge, with platforms like Figure adding $4 billion in assets last year. T-bills, too, are increasingly attractive since they generate yield. According to Veradittakit, there’s also potential for more complex financial products like stocks and bonds to join the on-chain space. Bitcoin-Fi finds momentum Bitcoin ( BTC ) has long held its ground as a layer-1 core network, standing apart from competitors like Ethereum, which moved toward decentralizing its architecture with layer-2 solutions to address scalability issues. But 2025 could mark a shift, with protocols like Babylon potentially driving 1% of all BTC into “Bitcoin-Fi,” Veradittakit says. “This year, pushed by Bitcoin-native finance protocols that do not require bridging (like Babylon), high returns, high bitcoin prices, and increased appetite for more BTC assets (runes, Ordinals, BRC20), 1% of Bitcoins will participate in Bitcoin-Fi,” Veradittakit notes. Gateways Apps like PayPal, Venmo, WhatsApp, and TON — the latter of which is financially supported by Pantera Capital — are quickly becoming key entry points for crypto users, according to Veradittakit. He points out that these platforms make it easier for users to access crypto without locking them into specific protocols. For instance, WhatsApp users can now send money via stablecoins , thanks to services like Felix, while Venmo has integrated crypto purchases through MetaMask. Veradittakit suggests that given current trends, fintech could soon rival smaller crypto exchanges in the near future: “Whether intentionally or because of their ability to support third-party apps, every fintech will become a crypto gateway. Fintechs will grow in prevalence and may perhaps rival smaller centralized exchanges in crypto holdings.” Paul Veradittakit Unichain to lead l2 transactions Uniswap ‘s influence in the layer-2 ecosystem could make its upcoming network, Unichain , the leader by transaction volume. The platform currently accounts for a significant share of activity on existing l2s like Arbitrum — also backed by Pantera Capital — and Base. Veradittakit suggests that if Unichain manages to capture “just half of Uniswap’s volume, it would easily surpass the largest l2s to become the leading l2 by transaction volume.” NFTs will make a comeback Non-fungible tokens are evolving beyond collectables. Per Veradittakit, they’re now being used in gaming, artificial intelligence, identity verification, and consumer apps. Examples include Blackbird’s restaurant rewards app and Sofamon’s web3 bitmojis. Veradittakit notes that NFTs can be used not just as ID transactions, transfers, ownership, and memberships but can also be used to represent and value assets, leading to monetary, possibly speculative growth. “This flexibility is what brings NFTs power,” he added. Restaking protocols to debut mainnets Restaking protocols like EigenLayer and Karak are set to launch their mainnets in 2025, potentially expanding the value and use cases of staking across multiple networks. Restaking allows investors to earn from additional networks, creating value as protocols continue to evolve. Veradittakit admits that while attention on restaking has waned recently, the industry still remains “a multi-billion dollar market.” You might also like: Nuffle Labs and Wormhole launch cross-chain restaking solution Bringing web2 data on blockchain A new cryptographic approach is emerging that allows websites to validate and share their data on-chain, without revealing sensitive information. The method, called zkTLS, is still in development. However, Veradittakit believes the technology could unlock significant opportunities, particularly for oracles and data services, by changing how information is verified and processed across blockchain networks: “This is a new idea, but we predict that companies will step up to begin building this and integrating it into on-chain services, like verifiable oracles for nonfinancial data or cryptographically secured data oracles.” Paul Veradittakit Crypto-friendly regulatory shift For the first time in years, the U.S. regulatory landscape appears to favor crypto. Gary Gensler, an anti-crypto SEC chair, will resign in January. His likely successor, Paul Atkins, is currently perceived as a pro-crypto advocate. President-elect Trump has also announced plans to create a legal framework for crypto, led by David Sacks, who will serve as “AI & crypto czar.” Veradittakit hopes the new environment will reduce lawsuits, clarify crypto regulations, and simplify tax considerations. Pantera’s predictions suggest that crypto might become more integrated into mainstream finance and technology. As Veradittakit puts it, these trends “will only accelerate,” making 2025 a pivotal year for crypto.

Bold predictions are emerging as DOGEN, Shiba Inu, and Cardano target dramatic gains, with DOGEN set to soar 700% by presale’s end. Table of Contents DOGEN unleashed: The alpha meme token of crypto Shiba Inu faces obstacles Cardano dips amid market downturn Conclusion Bold predictions are emerging in the cryptocurrency world, suggesting dramatic gains for certain altcoins. DOGEN might soar from a mere $0.0015 to an astonishing $100. At the same time, Shiba Inu aims for a rise to $0.1, and Cardano could reach $5. These potential leaps have captured the attention of investors watching the market closely.

Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous creator Ryoshi, it began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, who donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply. In the past 24 hours, SHIB has experienced a dip, falling by 6% to reach a current price of $0.00002052. This price movement has caused the coin’s market cap to now reach $12.1b. However, trading volume has climbed, with SHIB seeing a rise of 60% in 24-hour volume, indicating a growing demand among traders. Despite the current drop, experts are speculating that there could be a sustained rally, with gains expected in the short term. Cardano dips amid market downturn Cardano is a flexible blockchain platform designed for smart contracts. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, allows users to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. Cardano uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to proof-of-work models. The blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. ADA has seen notable fluctuations in recent days, currently trading at $0.9314, a decrease of 6%. Despite this pullback, the market cap remains strong at $32.74b, and trading volume has held steady at $1.34b. Investors are closely monitoring this coin’s movement, as it remains within a crucial support zone. With market sentiment remaining positive, analysts are forecasting a potential rebound, which could push the price of ADA back toward its previous highs in the coming days. Conclusion While SHIB and ADA have limited short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow huge by presale’s end and potentially thousand-fold during altcoin season, DOGEN follows the success of tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of leaders, it offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters. To learn more about DOGEN, visit the official website, Twitter , and Telegram.

According to an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, the company spent approximately $243 million between January 6 and January 12, purchasing Bitcoin at an average price of $95,972 per coin. This marks the firm’s tenth consecutive week of Bitcoin acquisitions. Last week, MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 1,070 BTC for $101 million in cash, averaging $94,004 per coin. These transactions follow the sale of 710,425 company shares during the same period, which generated funds for further Bitcoin purchases. The self-proclaimed Bitcoin treasury company aims to raise $42 billion by 2027 through at-the-market stock sales and convertible debt offerings to fund further Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy has already achieved more than two-thirds of its equity-raising target in under three months since unveiling its ambitious plan. MicroStrategy’s “21/21” plan expansion The latest acquisitions are part of MicroStrategy’s ambitious “21/21” plan, revealed in late October 2024, to raise $42 billion through equity and fixed-income securities offerings by 2027. These funds are earmarked for Bitcoin investments. Earlier this year, the company doubled down on the plan, with a proposed $2 billion perpetual preferred stock offering. The stock, senior to its A-class common stock, includes provisions for conversion to common shares, cash dividend payments, and redemption options. Benchmark equity analyst Mark Palmer suggested this approach could attract institutional investors such as insurance companies, pension funds, and banks. MicroStrategy made headlines in 2024 with record Bitcoin purchases totaling 90,079 BTC, valued at over $6 billion. Significant acquisitions included 27,200 BTC in November for $2 billion and 18,300 BTC in September for $1.11 billion. On the final day of 2024, the company announced it had spent $209 million to acquire 2,138 BTC at an average price of $97,837. This followed a $509 million Bitcoin purchase earlier in December. As of January 13, MicroStrategy holds 450,000 BTC, representing approximately 2.1% of Bitcoin’s total supply of 21 million coins. The firm’s total holdings, acquired at an average price of $62,691 per coin, amount to a total expenditure of $28.2 billion, including fees and expenses, executive chairman Michael Saylor reported . Is buying Bitcoin an unnecessary risk? MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisition strategy has sparked quite a debate among market analysts across all financial sectors. Some investors have raised concerns about the sustainability of its equity—and debt-funded purchases. The firm’s $81 billion market cap trades at a significant premium to its Bitcoin net asset value, a point of contention for skeptics. Despite criticisms, the company has spent over $18 billion on Bitcoin in the past ten weeks alone. Its strategy relies heavily on Bitcoin’s price appreciation, with financial analyst Jacob King warning of potential risks. “ The cycle only works if BTC keeps rising. If BTC stalls or crashes, the loop collapses. This is unsustainable and is a giant Ponzi ,” King said . On the other hand, proponents like Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, dismissed concerns about the strategy, stating, “ It would take a world-ending catastrophe to bring MicroStrategy down. ” MicroStrategy only goes bankrupt if an asteroid hits Earth. For 15 years, #Bitcoin has never dropped below the cost basis of long-term whales, which currently stands at $30K. $MSTR debt is $7B and its $BTC holdings are worth $46B. Based on BTC alone, the liq price is $16.5K. pic.twitter.com/cTwwTGYif4 — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 17, 2024 Some analysts believe MicroStrategy’s vast Bitcoin holdings could offer unique advantages. “ There’s potential to make profits out of that huge liquidity pool of Bitcoin ,” said Alexander Panasenko, head of product management at VixiChain. “ When you are holding a huge amount of that inflationary-proof asset that actually stores value, you can make money just from holding it or through lending and borrowing. ” MicroStrategy (MSTR) stocks were down about 3.8% pre-market trading, changing hands at $327.91. However, the equity has been up by almost 10% in the last week, with an 8.24% uptick from its year-to-date values, per Yahoo Finance updates .

Bitcoin mining difficulty hit an all-time high, but an even more notable occurrence is that this uptick is the eighth consecutive one, which could mean several things for the budding crypto network. Data from the Bitcoin analytics platform CoinWarz shows that the current Bitcoin mining difficulty is at an all-time high (ATH) of 110.45 trillion. This difficulty adjustment took place on January 13 at block height 878,976, representing a 0.61% increment from the previous value. Mining Difficulty Hits New ATH Bitcoin mining difficulty indicates how difficult it is to mine a new block on the crypto network. The adjustment happens every 2,016 blocks, approximately every 14 days, to ensure blocks are mined on average every ten minutes. The difficulty must increase to ensure the blocks are not generated too quickly, especially with more hashing power and mining machines added to the Bitcoin network. The difficulty has increased by 6.29% in the past 30 days and 19.99% in the last 90 days. However, data from CoinWarz indicates that the next adjustment, occurring in the next 13 days, would take the difficulty from its ATH of 110.45 trillion to 109.54 trillion, representing a 0.83% decline. Bullish or Bearish Signal? Historical data shows that consecutive spikes in Bitcoin’s difficulty could be considered a bullish or bearish signal. Per a Coindesk report , at some point during the last bull cycle, Bitcoin’s difficulty witnessed nine consecutive positive adjustments. The last one coincided with the market’s top–bitcoin (BTC), hitting $69,000 in November 2021. Afterward, the bear phase began. However, in 2018, Bitcoin made similar adjustments without rallying like it did in 2021. After BTC hit its bull market top at $20,000 in December 2017, the crypto network made 17 consecutive positive adjustments until mid-2018. By the time of the next negative adjustment, BTC was worth around $6,000. This means that while Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increased, the value of BTC declined . In the current cycle, the Bitcoin mining difficulty began this uptrend on October 9 at 92.04 trillion. Since then, the difficulty has increased seven more times over the last 96 days. Although analysts insist BTC is still in a bull cycle and has room to grow, the asset has been struggling since the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen if BTC has hit its peak for this cycle. At the time of writing, it was changing hands at $91,00.

Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ) was trading at $0.0030 on Monday, Jan. 13, where it has been stuck for the past few days. The token has dropped about 78% from its all-time high, bringing its market value to $200 million. In a post on X, Hamster Kombat’s developers revealed plans to launch a new layer-2 blockchain in collaboration with Tycho. A layer-2 network is a secondary framework built on top of an existing blockchain, like Bitcoin ( BTC ) or Ethereum ( ETH ), to enhance scalability and speed. In Hamster Kombat’s case, the layer-2 network will be built on the TON Blockchain. “I Have to Become More…” One superman once said..and so do we!

You might also like: IOTA price plunges as new governance vote starts They also aim to provide additional utility to the HMSTR token to bolster its struggling price. However, historical data suggests that launching a layer-2 network does not always guarantee success in attracting developers or boosting token value. For instance, the dYdX token has underperformed compared to other decentralized exchange tokens since the launch of the dYdX Chain in 2023. Similarly, Shiba Inu’s price has lagged behind other meme coins like Pepe and Bonk following the launch of Shibarium, its scaling project. Uniswap’s token price has also struggled ahead of the launch of UniChain , its own layer-2 network designed to support a multi-chain trading ecosystem. Hamster Kombat was one of the most popular players in the Telegram tap-to-earn industry in 2024 with over 300 million users. Its popularity waned after its airdrop as most of the airdrop recipients sold their tokens. According to IntoTheBlock , the number of its holders has dropped to 3.8 million. Hamster Kombat price could rebound HMSTR price chart | Source: crypto.news Hamster Kombat’s token was trading at $0.0030 on Monday, hovering around the 50-period and 25-period moving averages. Its daily trading volume and futures open interest have continued to decline, signaling low demand. On a positive note, the token has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern. The upper boundary of this triangle connects the highest levels since Nov. 10, while the lower boundary links the lowest swings since Nov. 2. This pattern indicates that the token may experience either a bullish breakout or a bearish breakdown. A bullish breakout could push the price to the next resistance level at $0.003580, its highest swing on Jan. 6. Conversely, a bearish breakdown could bring the psychological support level of $0.0025 into focus.

At press time, the token was priced at $0.000000103, giving early investors an opportunity too capitalize on any future price increase. General Crypto Market: Volatility Amid Economic Tensions The crypto market is undergoing sharp volatility affected by global economic challenges. Bitcoin (BTC) is trading below $100,000 and Ethereum (ETH) is at or below $3,400. This coincides with bad economic conditions and rising US bond yields. The monetary policy of the US Federal Reserve continues to impact market confidence, prompting caution among investors. Combined with other global stress factors, the financial environment remains uncertain, contributing to increased selling pressure and market instability. Pepeto’s Utility-Driven Ecosystem Pepeto is more than just a meme-based project. Its features are designed to provide real utility while fostering trust within its community. A central component of its ecosystem is the PEPETO Exchange, which promises zero listing fees, enhanced security, and cross-chain functionality. By rejecting scam-prone tokens, the exchange aims to create a safer trading environment for users. The project also includes staking rewards with returns of up to 400%. These rewards provide an incentive for investors while increasing the token’s overall utility. Over 20 trillion tokens have already been staked indicating strong backing from the crypto community. PepetoSwap, an upcoming feature, will further enhance the ecosystem by enabling seamless token swaps across the platform. Presale Growth And 2025 Price Outlook The presale offers ongoing, giving investors the opportunity to buy a token at a lower price which is supposed to rise through different stages. $PEPETO will be listed on any comes exchange after presale ends, increasing visibility and potential demand. The price forecast expects $PEPETO to range between $0.000002 and $0.000005 at the end of 2025. Early adopters stand to receive 20x to 50x return of this range. For example, marketing, LSPs, exchange listings and overall community involvement may have a stake in how this growth occurs. Why Pepeto Could Be The Best Crypto For January 2025 Pepeto’s plans extend beyond its presale and initial roadmap. The project intends to introduce new features, including a cross-chain bridge and additional exchange listings. These updates are likely to draw users from other ecosystems and expand the project’s reach. Long-term projections for Pepeto are equally ambitious, with some analysts suggesting a 1,000x price increase by 2030. The project’s combination of innovation, transparency, and utility could help it maintain momentum even in challenging market conditions. Pepeto’s focus on blending entertainment with utility makes it stand out from other memecoins. Its zero-fee exchange, staking features, and commitment to community safety give it a competitive edge. The strong performance of its presale and the potential for significant price growth make it an attractive option for investors looking for the best crypto for January 2025.

According to analysts, by December 2024, the cryptocurrency could surpass $100,000 . Some platforms are even accepting bets on Bitcoin’s future price. Most participants on Polymarket predict that next year the cryptocurrency will soar to between $114,000 and $127,000. However, by December 2024 and in the following months, Bitcoin's price is expected to peak and then start to decline, potentially dropping to as low as $87,000. It is worth recalling that in 2010, when Bitcoin first appeared on the exchange, it was valued at just $0.003. Since then, its value has increased by thousands of times.In 2013, the price of 1 BTC exceeded $100, and in November of the same year, Bitcoin reached $1,000 for the first time. Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise: A Triumph or a Ticking Time Bomb? Bitcoin has once again grabbed headlines with its surge to record-breaking heights , a rally fueled by a mix of global economic shifts and renewed investor enthusiasm. Yet, beneath this shining achievement lies a stark reality: the cryptocurrency market is fraught with unpredictability, and every boom carries the shadow of a potential bust. As Bitcoin soars, seasoned experts urge caution, warning that the patterns of the past may well repeat themselves. Over the years, Bitcoin has navigated a rollercoaster of price movements, with sharp rises often followed by equally dramatic falls. Take 2017, for example, when the cryptocurrency hit nearly $20,000, sparking a frenzy of speculation. But by the end of 2018, Bitcoin’s value had plunged below $4,000, leaving many investors nursing heavy losses. These cycles of boom and bust have become a hallmark of the digital asset, a reminder that what goes up can—and often does—come down. Investing in cryptocurrencies is not for the faint-hearted. The market's inherent volatility means prices can swing wildly, sometimes within hours. This unpredictability requires a level-headed approach and a clear understanding of the risks involved. For every success story of early adopters striking it rich, there are countless tales of overzealous investors losing everything in a flash. The political landscape also plays a role in shaping Bitcoin’s future. Some analysts suggest that Donald Trump’s return to the U.S. presidency could pave the way for greater adoption of cryptocurrencies in global payments. However, such predictions hinge on a leader known for his unpredictability. Optimistic forecasts often inflate speculative bubbles, creating an illusion of stability in a market that thrives on uncertainty. For those considering entering the world of Bitcoin, caution is key. While its potential for high returns is undeniably alluring, the risks are equally substantial. New investors, in particular, must approach the market with a clear strategy, setting realistic expectations and being prepared for significant price fluctuations. In the end, Bitcoin’s allure lies in its dual nature—a symbol of financial innovation and a cautionary tale of unchecked speculation. As the cryptocurrency climbs to new heights, the question remains: will its ascent mark the dawn of a new financial era, or is it just another bubble waiting to burst? Investors would do well to tread carefully, for in the high-stakes world of digital assets, fortune favours the prepared, not the reckless. Bitcoin Casinos: The Future of Online Gambling? The world of online gambling has undergone a revolution in recent years, and Bitcoin casinos are at the forefront of this transformation. Combining the thrill of traditional online casinos with the innovative power of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin casinos offer players a unique and potentially lucrative gaming experience. But what exactly are Bitcoin casinos, and why are they becoming so popular? What Are Bitcoin Casinos? According to Twin.com online casino , several of gambling platforms accept BTC (and other cryptocurrencies like TRC20 or Etherium) as a form of payment. Unlike traditional casinos that rely on fiat currencies like dollars or euros, these platforms leverage blockchain technology to enable secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Many Bitcoin casinos also allow players to wager and withdraw in Bitcoin, providing a seamless crypto gambling experience. Why Choose Bitcoin Casinos? Privacy and Anonymity:One of the most appealing aspects of Bitcoin casinos is the level of privacy they offer. Players can make deposits and withdrawals without sharing sensitive financial information, such as credit card details or bank account numbers. This is particularly attractive for those who value anonymity in their online activities. Speedy Transactions:Traditional banking methods can be slow, often taking several days to process withdrawals. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, are typically completed within minutes, regardless of the amount being transferred. This speed makes Bitcoin casinos an ideal choice for players who want instant access to their winnings. Global Accessibility:Bitcoin casinos are not tied to a specific country or currency, making them accessible to players worldwide. This global reach allows individuals from regions with strict gambling regulations to enjoy online gaming without worrying about legal barriers. Provably Fair Games:Many Bitcoin casinos implement ""provably fair"" technology, which allows players to verify the fairness of each game. This transparency builds trust and ensures that outcomes are genuinely random, a feature often missing from traditional online casinos. The Downsides of Bitcoin Casinos While Bitcoin casinos offer numerous advantages, they are not without their challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin's value can be a double-edged sword. Players may win big but find their winnings worth significantly less if Bitcoin’s price drops. Additionally, the lack of regulation in some Bitcoin casinos can expose players to scams or fraudulent platforms. It's essential to choose reputable casinos with positive reviews and proven track records. Popular Games in Bitcoin Casinos Bitcoin casinos offer a wide range of games, from classic slots and poker to live dealer games and sports betting. Many platforms also feature exclusive Bitcoin-based games, adding a unique twist to the gambling experience. The Future of Bitcoin Casinos As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, Bitcoin casinos are likely to grow in popularity. The integration of blockchain technology ensures secure transactions, while innovations such as smart contracts could further enhance the gaming experience. In conclusion, Bitcoin casinos represent a bold new frontier in online gambling. They combine the convenience of digital currencies with the excitement of casino gaming, appealing to a tech-savvy audience looking for privacy, speed, and transparency. However, as with any form of gambling, players should approach Bitcoin casinos with caution, ensuring they gamble responsibly and choose trustworthy platforms.

As per sources, whales have bought $2.698 billion worth of both these assets. It’s estimated that these buyers bought $2.5 billion worth of XRP and 470M Dogecoins.

If you’re looking for the best meme coins to invest in, you’re at the right place.

38905006,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/a-history-of-bitcoin-forks,1736789279,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/38905006.jpeg,A History Of Bitcoin Forks,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/a-history-of-bitcoin-forks,"Bitcoin (BTC) has undergone several forks in its long history. These splits in the blockchain happen when the community has different views about the transaction history. These disagreements within the community lead to a hard fork, a protocol change that creates a new set of rules for the nodes (computers) that make up the blockchain network. If a hard fork is implemented without the agreement of network participants, it can cause the network to split in two. However, not all forks lead to a split in the network. This guide will take a closer look at hard and soft forks and discuss Bitcoin’s history of hard and soft forks. What Is A Fork In Blockchain? Bitcoin is powered by decentralized open software that anyone can contribute to. This software must periodically be upgraded to address security issues or implement changes proposed by developers or the community. Sometimes, these changes are supported by everyone in the community, and sometimes, differences and disagreements may emerge about the changes and the direction of the protocol. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, have independent development teams responsible for making changes and improving the network. Sometimes, these teams implement changes to add certain features or make the cryptocurrency more secure. These changes lead to a soft fork. Sometimes, developers may use a fork to create a new cryptocurrency and ecosystem. Such forks are called hard forks and typically occur if there is a disagreement about the direction of the protocol. Soft Fork A soft fork changes the underlying software protocol where only previously valid transaction blocks are made invalid. Think of a soft fork as a software upgrade for the underlying blockchain. It introduces a new set of standards that must be adopted by all users on the blockchain. Soft forks are generally implemented to introduce new features and functions. Additionally, all changes made during a soft fork are backward compatible. Hard Fork A hard fork occurs when the code changes result in the new version no longer being backward compatible with earlier blocks. In such a scenario, the blockchain splits into the original and the new blockchain that implements the rules introduced during the hard fork. This leads to the creation of new cryptocurrencies and ecosystems. Bitcoin has seen several hard forks over the years, creating cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Forks: A Glimpse Into the Past Bitcoin has seen several forks, hard and soft, since its creation. This section will examine some of the most prominent ones and how they impacted the Bitcoin ecosystem. The list is divided into soft and hard forks. Soft Forks Bitcoin has witnessed several soft forks, of which the most prominent are Segregated Witness (SegWit) and Taproot. SegWit SegWit is one of the most crucial upgrades in Bitcoin’s history, proposing reducing the bloat in the Bitcoin blockchain by removing bulky signature data and storing it in a sidechain. SegWit was an extremely controversial fork that ultimately led to the Bitcoin-Bitcoin Cash hard fork. SetWit divided transactions into two segments, reorganizing data in such a way that signature data was no longer stored with transaction data. It offered several benefits like a significant boost in block capacity, increased transaction speeds, and preventing transaction malleability. Taproot The Taproot upgrade was initiated to improve the privacy and efficiency of the Bitcoin network. It also encourages the implementation of smart contracts on Bitcoin, clearing the way for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Bitcoin network. The Taproot upgrade received a 90% critical consensus mark on June 21, 2021, indicating strong support. However, it was not finalized until a soft fork at block 709,632 on November 14, 2021. Hard Forks Bitcoin’s evolution has seen multiple hard forks, each presenting a compelling vision for the future of the cryptocurrency. Here are some of the most significant hard forks. Bitcoin XT Bitcoin XT is widely regarded as one of the first notable hard forks of Bitcoin. It was launched by Mike Hearn in 2014 to include several new features. Bitcoin XT set a target of up to 24 transactions per second to Bitcoin’s 7. It proposed increasing the block size from one megabyte to eight megabytes to accomplish its goal. Bitcoin XT saw initial success. However, interest gradually waned, and the project was abandoned in 2018. Bitcoin Classic Bitcoin Classic increased the block size to 2 megabytes, compared to Bitcoin XT’s 8 megabytes. It also saw initial interest and is still active today, with a core group of developers supporting the project. However, most of the community has moved on to other projects. Bitcoin Cash The Segregated Witness soft fork led to considerable disagreements within the Bitcoin community. As a result, some developers initiated a hard fork to avoid protocol updates brought on by the soft fork. The result of this hard fork was Bitcoin Cash. The hard fork was initiated in August 2017, allowing a block size of 32 megabytes, significantly increasing transaction speeds and processing times. Bitcoin Cash is the most successful hard fork of the flagship currency and is the 20th largest cryptocurrency in the market. Bitcoin Gold Bitcoin Gold was also initiated in 2017. The idea behind the hard fork was to bring mining back to graphic processing units (GPUs) because developers felt mining had become too specialized and the hardware required was costly. Bitcoin Gold introduced a unique feature called “Post Mine.” This process allowed the developer team to mine 100,000 coins after initiating the hard fork. These coins were placed in a special endowment to grow and finance the Bitcoin Gold ecosystem and pay developers. Bitcoin SV Bitcoin SV is not technically a hard fork of Bitcoin because it resulted from a split in the Bitcoin Cash community by supporters of Craig White, a controversial individual who claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin. Wright proposed increasing the block size hundreds of times, enabling cheaper transactions and greater throughput for decentralized applications. Bitcoin SV only attracted a small following. Today, it retains only a fraction of that following and transaction volume compared to Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. White’s claims about being Satoshi Nakamoto have also been dismissed. Other Notable Bitcoin Forks The soft and hard forks listed above are not the only ones undergone by Bitcoin. There are several notable forks like Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcore, and Super Bitcoin, initiated in 2017. 2018 saw four more hard forks: Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Atom, Bitcoin Zero, and Bitcoin Post Quantum. Bitcoin Unlimited was released in 2016, but its developers did not specify what type of fork it would require. Bitcoin Unlimited raised the block size to 16 megabytes but failed to garner considerable interest. In Closing As Bitcoin evolves, it will continue to see soft and hard forks as developers implement new features and upgrades. The forks it has already undergone have attempted to make it better or have arisen out of differences within the community. We have only briefly touched on the most prominent forks undergone by Bitcoin, and each has played a crucial role in shaping it into what it is today.

In a strategic move, the platform has finally acquired Helio , Solana’s premier payment app, in a deal valued at $175 million. The acquisition was announced earlier today. This move underscores MoonPay’s growing ambition to be central in bridging the gap between traditional and digital payments. This further solidifies its presence in the rapidly growing crypto space. Helio To Make Crypto Payments Easier for the Future Helio, a crypto e-commerce platform, has gained traction since its launch in 2022. It has quickly emerged as a leader in simplifying crypto payments with its tools. With its innovative tools, it has made accepting digital currencies like Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin (BTC) easier for merchants and developers. The company has quickly become a top crypto checkout app, with over 6,000 merchants and millions of users, according to MoonPay. The Helio platform has processed over $1.5 billion in transactions, demonstrating its growing influence in the crypto payment ecosystem. Its capabilities extend beyond mere transactions. Helio offers integrated solutions that connect with leading digital platforms such as Discord, WooCommerce, and Shopify. The Solana Pay plugin has further solidified its role in streamlining crypto payments for businesses and creators alike. MoonPay Strengthens Mission to Bridge Fiat and Crypto MoonPay aims to bridge the gap between fiat and crypto by making it easier for people to buy digital assets. Its collaboration with Mastercard in 2023 has allowed users to purchase crypto using traditional payment methods like debit and credit cards. This acquisition is a natural next step for MoonPay as it strengthens its position in the payment services market. MoonPay has grown by forming key partnerships with major firms like PayPal , BitPay, and Onramper in recent years. These integrations have helped expand its reach in the crypto space. Most recently, the crypto payment giant has integrated Ripple’s newly launched RLUSD stablecoin on its platform, further broadening its offerings. In a statement, Ivan Soto-Wright, co-founder and CEO of MoonPay, emphasized the importance of the acquisition. He stated that with the addition of Helio, MoonPay now offers the most complete product for on-chain payments. The Crypto Payment Revolution: MoonPay Joins a Growing Trend MoonPay’s acquisition of Helio highlights a wider movement where financial companies integrate crypto payments to meet rising demand. Industry players like PayPal, Square, and Stripe have ventured into crypto services, allowing users to buy, sell, and spend digital currencies on their platforms. Through strategic partnerships, traditional payment giants like Visa have also jumped on board to expand services by integrating crypto transactions. Even Shopify is enabling merchants to accept crypto payments. This shift signals that digital currencies are becoming a core part of the future of finance.

The upcoming launch of TREAT and the negative exchange netflow also suggest potential price pump for the second-largest meme coin. Is It Time for the Bears to Step Down? The last 24 hours have been quite painful for the cryptocurrency market. The entire capitalization of the sector has plummeted by 5.5% and currently stands below $3.3 trillion. For their part, leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) , are well in the red on a daily scale. The popular meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) is also among the losers. Its price has fallen by 7% in the past 24 hours and, as of this writing, is worth around $0.00002023 (per CoinGecko’s data). SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Contrary to the bearish landscape, one important metric suggests good days ahead for the bulls. This is Shiba Inu’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) , which measures the change and speed of price movements. The technical analysis tool varies from 0 to 100 , and any ratio below 30 indicates that the asset might be oversold and undervalued. For its part, this signals a potential buying opportunity. The RSI has been hovering between 30 and 55 for the past five days, most recently dropping to as low as 29. Additional Factors Another element suggesting that the price of the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer might rally in the short term is the asset’s exchange netflow . According to CryptoQuant’s data, SHIB outflows have significantly surpassed inflows in the past week. This signals a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods and could be viewed as bullish since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. Last but not least, we will touch upon the upcoming launch of TREAT . The reward token part of Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is scheduled to go live later this week. The development could spur enthusiasm across the community, potentially leading to more people jumping on the bandwagon and a subsequent price rally for SHIB. It is worth mentioning that TREAT’s launch has already caught the attention of some leading crypto exchanges that have announced they will allow trading services with the meme coin. Examples are KuCoin and MEXC Exchange.

The pressure is on, and Beijing knows it. With a housing market crisis, a plummeting yuan, and shaky consumer confidence, the government is throwing out one promise after another to keep the country’s economic ship from sinking. Regulators are rolling out plans to steady the property and equity markets, push fiscal policies into overdrive, and put out the fires in their financial system. The stakes are high. With Trump’s trade war threats looming, Beijing is working overtime to control the narrative—and the numbers. Housing market chaos meets government’s bold promises The housing sector is at the center of the storm. Property prices have nosedived, home sales are collapsing, and people’s savings are vanishing faster than you can say “real estate bubble.” Dong Jianguo, a vice minister at the housing ministry, announced plans to stimulate demand and rein in land supply. This move, he claimed at a weekend conference, could help the sector recover, but no one’s betting their house on it just yet. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance is stepping up with promises of “sustained and effective” fiscal policies in the coming year. They’re gearing up to issue more local government bonds and expand the areas where those funds can be invested. Essentially, Beijing is pouring money into the economy and hoping it’ll stick. But not everyone’s convinced this is enough. The Central Economic Work Conference—a gathering of top officials led by President Xi Jinping—vowed to raise the fiscal deficit target for 2025 and focus on boosting domestic demand. They’ve made consumption a top priority for the first time in a decade. Sounds ambitious, but the clock is ticking, and the results need to show up yesterday. Credit slowdown and monetary policy roulette If China’s housing mess wasn’t bad enough, credit expansion numbers just slapped policymakers in the face. November saw credit growth hit its lowest level for that month since 2009. Loans to the real economy, which excludes financial institutions, dried up despite an increase in government bond issuance. The result? A brutal combo of weak credit and frail economic confidence. Wang Xin, a research bureau director at the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), says the central bank has plans to cut interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio next year. The idea is to flood the system with liquidity and make borrowing easier for businesses. Wang also mentioned loosening financing conditions for the real economy, which could mean cheaper credit for manufacturers and entrepreneurs trying to keep their heads above water. That’s not all. The Politburo recently committed to a “moderately loose” monetary policy for 2025, signaling more rate cuts and easier credit access. But whether these moves can shake off deflationary pressure remains to be seen. Yuan struggles under trade war fears The yuan is in freefall, and Beijing knows it’s a problem. The currency has been sliding since mid-October, and last week it took another hit after reports suggested authorities might let it depreciate further. The potential trade war with Washington isn’t helping, as fears of tariffs and sanctions weigh heavily on currency markets. Zou Lan, head of the PBOC’s monetary policy department, says the central bank is doubling down on managing exchange rate expectations. “We’ll respond vigorously to external shocks,” he said in an interview, adding that the PBOC would prevent “overshooting risks” in the exchange rate. Sounds nice on paper, but markets aren’t exactly reassured. To prop up the yuan, the PBOC and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange just increased the macroprudential adjustment parameter for cross-border financing. Translation: businesses and banks can now borrow more foreign debt, which could help stabilize the currency. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng said, “We have the confidence, conditions, and ability to maintain a stable foreign exchange market.” Exports boom while domestic economy sinks Here’s the paradox: China’s domestic economy is in rough shape, but its exports are on fire. Last year, the country racked up a $1 trillion trade surplus. Exports totalled $3.58 trillion, while imports barely hit $2.59 trillion. Factories are cranking out goods like there’s no tomorrow, from solar panels to electric vehicles, keeping China’s global trade dominance intact. But the domestic picture isn’t so rosy. The middle class is holding back on spending due to job losses, a housing market crash, and dwindling savings. Even with government support, consumption remains weak, and deflation is a lingering threat. Despite these issues, the government isn’t giving up. Measures to revive factory output and boost consumer confidence are in motion, but they’re not delivering quick results. While the bond market saw a record-breaking rally last week, the stock market didn’t get the memo. Yields on China’s 10-year government bonds dropped to an all-time low of 1.77%, attracting a flood of funds into bonds. Longer-term bond yields also fell sharply, reflecting investor caution. On the flip side, the CSI 300 Index of Chinese stocks had its worst day in three weeks, tumbling 2.4%. The contrast between the bond and stock markets highlights just how divided investor sentiment is right now.

The move comes in the wake of new guidelines from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority that now allow digital banks to operate limited physical locations. The reason , he said, was to smoothen transaction processes and improve customer experience on various touchpoints where virtual banks generally struggle. This shift by HKMA reflects the growing awareness of the need to integrate the best of traditional and digital banking. Allowing for physical branches-in the case of a digital bank like ZA Bank, for instance-allows it to give more personalized service and solve complex customer issues, going toward overall satisfaction. What Does This Mean for Crypto-Friendly Banking? That is a game-changer, according to ZA Bank, which proudly claims crypto-friendliness. “Face-to-face interaction in physical locations can serve the customers much better while going through complex financial needs, especially in the crypto market,” it said. A lot of startups in the Web3 and blockchain areas had really bad onboarding processes, which were often very restrictive and with huge delays. Having physical branches would arguably make such processes much easier and thus further facilitate the access to financial services from crypto-oriented businesses. All of this interaction would make for a considerably improved customer experience and give credibility to digital banking, according to a ZA Bank representative. Industry Reactions at HKMA’s Decision Other Hong Kong virtual banks, including Mox Bank and WeLab Bank, have also cheered the shift. Among them, the CEO of the Mox Bank, Barbaros Uygun, discussed how physical branches could raise customer trust and ensure greater financial inclusions. However, the WeLab Bank Chief Executive, Tat Lee, added that it was an opportunity to provide diverse offline means to reach more people and develop digital banking. Support for Hong Kong’s Crypto Sector But perhaps most exciting for crypto startups in Hong Kong, ZA Bank could expand to physical locations. Crypto companies have long had to jump through hoops-like required fixed deposits and several shareholder visits-to secure banking services. In-person branches might make the onboarding process more seamless and less opaque, further solidifying Hong Kong as one of the friendlier cryptocurrency destinations around.",Blockchain|HongKong|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-13 17:46:00

So I just don’t feel great about Bitcoin.” Similar to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Dimon was a longtime opponent of bitcoin. Unlike Fink — who underwent a 180 degree reversal in his views a couple of years ago — Dimon has continued holding the same negative outlook even as the bank he leads has profited off of bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, including serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. JPMorgan also recently rebranded its blockchain platform , formerly Onyx, to Kinexys as it aims to double down on real world tokenization. The goal, according to JPM’s co-head of Payments Umar Farooq, is to reduce limitations of the current financial infrastructure, like tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The banking giant said in November that it plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities on its platform as soon as the first quarter of 2025. Dimon's most recent comments came just days ahead of Donald Trump reassuming the U.S. presidency.

Savvy investors are looking for innovative and speculative tokens to invest in. Particularly, BlockDAG and Rexas Finance holders are quietly accumulating 1Fuel tokens. 1Fuel just entered its third presale stage at $0.015 per token; over 134 million tokens have already been copped. Analysts are starting to talk about 1Fuel in discussions about the best cryptocurrency to buy this year. Why are top cryptocurrency wallets moving towards 1Fuel? Read on to find out more. Why is 1Fuel turning investors’ heads? 1Fuel is quickly gaining potential as a token with immense potential for a couple of reasons. First, it is a utility-driven token with a robust ecosystem. 1Fuel was built to address scalability and speed issues that older mainstream tokens like Bitcoin and ETH are dealing with. The crypto project leverages its cutting-edge cross-chain technology to enable seamless transactions. Investors in other top cryptocurrency wallets like BlockDAG and Rexas Finance (RXS) are looking to add 1Fuel to their portfolios for its usefulness and growth potential. The token's low entry price and massive gain potential perfectly align with the goals of those looking for high returns in the crypto market. BlockDAG’s role in the 1Fuel hype BlockDAG (BDAG) is a hybrid concept that combines features of both traditional blockchains and DAGs. The difference is it retains high scalability and fast processing time while integrating the security and trust of blockchain consensus mechanisms. BDAG investors are drawn to 1Fuel because it aligns with their values. As more people talk about this move, the hype surrounding 1Fuel continues to grow. They're betting on 1Fuel's ability to disrupt the crypto market as we know it. With a cross-chain functionality that lets users buy tokens without ever having to switch wallets, 1Fuel is gearing up to be the best cryptocurrency to buy in 2025. Rexas Finance adds credibility to 1Fuel RXS is an underdog in the crypto world. The token has a way of latching on to undervalued assets before they break out. This cluster of value investors has shown serious interest in 1Fuel. Both tokens have aligned values in utility and multiple product offerings. As far as value is concerned, Rexas Finance adds a layer of credibility to 1Fuel. With 1Fuel now on their radar, RXS investors are positioning themselves for yet another round of substantial returns. All of this further amplifies 1Fuel as one of the hottest cryptocurrencies of 2025. How to secure 1Fuel tokens Are you looking to follow in the footsteps of BlockDAG and RXS investors? Then, securing some 1Fuel tokens is paramount. You can use any of the more than 100 cryptocurrency options available. Visit the website to join the 1Fuel presale .

Conclusion Clearly, the growing interest from BDAG and RXS is telling us that 1Fuel has a bright future. The token's potential to change how we see blockchain utility makes it a compelling choice for forward-thinking investors.

Bloomberg reports that New York District Judge Paul Engelmayer on Wednesday set the schedule of the trial, which will begin on January 26th, 2026 and is anticipated to last from one to two months. Kwon is facing criminal fraud charges that arose from the 2022 collapse of the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin and LUNA token. US prosecutors allege that the 33-year-old misled investors about the stability of the crypto assets, which led to the $40 billion collapse of the Terra ecosystem. The development comes following Kwon’s extradition from Montenegro. He was arrested at the Podgorica Airport in March of 2023 while attempting to board a flight to Dubai using a fake Costa Rican passport. The South Korean software engineer is facing charges in both the US and his native country, but Montenegrin authorities decided to extradite him to the United States. He arrived in the US on December 31st. Kwon is charged with eight counts, which include conspiracy to defraud, two counts of commodities fraud, two counts of securities fraud, two counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to defraud and engage in market manipulation. Kwon faces a maximum penalty of 130 years in prison if found guilty of all the charges.

Established names like Toncoin (TON), Ripple’s XRP, and BNB Coin have consistently performed well, but a new player, Lightchain AI , is rapidly gaining traction. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI has raised over $10.6 million, with a token price of $0.00525, making it an intriguing option for those looking to capitalize on early-stage investments. Toncoin vs. Ripple (XRP) Blockchain Innovations with Unique Strengths Toncoin (TON) and Ripple's XRP are two big coins, each giving different blockchain ideas. Toncoin works on a Open Network (TON), a free multi-blockchain place first made by Telegram. Its design, with many layers of splitting and a main chain with as much as 2³² work chains, lets it grow big and handle millions of trades each second. TON helps tools such as shared storage, secret network use with TON Proxy and easy-to-use names through TON DNS. Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) is about smoot͏h cross-border payments. XRPL uses a agree method for fast deals, usually settling in moments with small costs. New changes include a Automated Market Maker (AMM) to help cash flow and trading speed, plus RLUSD, a dollar-linked stablecoin meant to give a steady, liquid digital thing. While TON emphasizes scalability and diverse decentralized services, XRP prioritizes transforming financial transactions and liquidity management. BNB Coin Powerhouse of the Binance Ecosystem BNB Coin, the native token of the Binance exchange, has cemented itself as a utility coin with multiple use cases, including trading fee discounts, staking opportunities, and participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Established names like Toncoin (TON), Ripple’s XRP, and BNB Coin have consistently performed well, but a new player, Lightchain AI , is rapidly gaining traction. Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI has raised over $10.6 million, with a token price of $0.00525, making it an intriguing option for those looking to capitalize on early-stage investments. Toncoin vs. Ripple (XRP) Blockchain Innovations with Unique Strengths Toncoin (TON) and Ripple's XRP are two big coins, each giving different blockchain ideas. Toncoin works on a Open Network (TON), a free multi-blockchain place first made by Telegram. Its design, with many layers of splitting and a main chain with as much as 2³² work chains, lets it grow big and handle millions of trades each second. TON helps tools such as shared storage, secret network use with TON Proxy and easy-to-use names through TON DNS. Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL) is about smoot͏h cross-border payments. XRPL uses a agree method for fast deals, usually settling in moments with small costs. New changes include a Automated Market Maker (AMM) to help cash flow and trading speed, plus RLUSD, a dollar-linked stablecoin meant to give a steady, liquid digital thing. While TON emphasizes scalability and diverse decentralized services, XRP prioritizes transforming financial transactions and liquidity management.

The new iShares product will trade through CBOE Canada. BlackRock is expanding the offering for its iShares Bitcoin-based ETF. This time, BlackRock Asset Management Canada, Ltd. will offer a new version of the product through CBOE Canada . Since 2015, the market operator has been the Tier 1 stock resource for top issuers. Years after Canada became one of the most crypto-friendly markets, the market operator finally added a crypto-derived asset. The iShares Bitcoin ETF, which became the biggest crypto-derived product on the market, trades on CBOE Canada under the symbol IBIT, while US dollar-denominated products trade as IBIT.U. For the Canadian market, the product is known as ‘The iShares Fund’, which will track the performance of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The CBOE-traded iShares Fund will invest all its assets into the existing Bitcoin trust, meaning all buyers will gain access to BTC coins in the wallets of Coinbase Custody. ‘ The launch of the iShares Bitcoin ETF in Canada underscores BlackRock’s commitment to innovation and providing clients access to an expanding world of investments. The iShares Fund provides Canadian investors with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, ’ said Helen Hayes, Head of iShares Canada, BlackRock. The expansion to a new market arrives just as the original batch of ETFs completed their first and dramatically successful year . The ETF buying, along with the series of purchases by MicroStrategy and MARA Digital, boosted mainstream adoption. CBOE already trades several BlackRock products based on traditional markets. The exchange is home to ETFs from Canada’s biggest issuers, including those based on Canadian Depositary Receipts, as well as Canadian and global companies. CBOE carries 15% of all securities volume from listings in Canada. The new BTC-based products can trade in their exchange-listed units through the usual CBOE investor channels, such as discount brokerage platforms and full-service dealers. CBOE has fulfilled the demand for crypto exposure through exchange-listed wrappers, explained Rob Marrocco, Global Head of ETF Listings at CBOE. New product arrives after outflow from BlackRock buyers The listing of the new CBOE product may translate into a new source of BTC buyers through BlackRock’s ETF. The market operator also powers ETF Market Canada, a user-oriented platform for investors and advisors with one-stop access to ETF data and analysis. The educational and analysis platform combines 1,200 Canadian ETFs, tapping the trend of newer cohorts of investors that prefer to perform their own research and carefully select their exposure to products. BlackRock’s buying behaviour has been closely watched, as the iShares Trust was a net buyer for most of 2024. Any slowdown or selling from BlackRock is seen as a sign of shifting market sentiment. In the past 30 days, BlackRock was still a net buyer, though the seven days of selling added to the negative market sentiment. As of January 13, BlackRock made deposits to Coinbase Custody, which coincides with investors selling. ETF users may have different patterns of buying and selling compared to crypto insiders, though the ETF flows are closely watched for signs of market optimism. The announcement for the new product also comes on a day when BTC dipped under $90,000 while still seeking reassurance that the bullish trend is intact. BTC briefly dipped to $89,800 before recovering above $91,715.44 on signs of renewed buying. BTC sees news of renewed large-scale buying as the major driver for the ongoing 2025 rally. The buying from ETFs raises the possibility that there will not be enough BTC for all investors, given the scale of the traditional market. All ETFs drew in more than $36B into BTC, surpassing the demand for gold-based products. ETFs helped produce one of the new cohorts of long-term holders, as BlackRock holds more than 557.57K BTC.

While nearly $1 billion flowed in during the early part of the week, outflows of $940 million in the latter half reversed much of the gains. This shift followed the release of new macroeconomic data and the Federal Reserve’s minutes, which signaled a stronger US economy and a more hawkish stance. According to CoinShares, this could indicate that the post-US election honeymoon has ended, with macroeconomic indicators regaining their influence on asset prices. Modest Inflows Amid Renewed Macroeconomic Concerns The latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report’ revealed that Bitcoin attracted $214 million in inflows last week, maintaining its lead as the best-performing digital asset with $799 million in inflows year-to-date, despite also seeing the largest outflows later in the week. Inflows to short Bitcoin products stood at $1.8 million. Ethereum, on the other hand, struggled the most, with $256 million flowing out, which CoinShares attributes to a general tech sector downturn rather than asset-specific concerns. Solana, by contrast, remained strong, pulling in $15 million in new investments. XRP amassed significant inflows of $41 million last week, driven largely by political and legal developments. The inflows reflect growing optimism as the January 15th SEC appeal deadline approaches. Multi-asset products followed suit with $21.1 million in inflows. Interestingly, altcoins attracted investments despite lackluster price performance. Leading the way were Aave, Stellar, and Polkadot, which recorded inflows of $2.9 million, $2.7 million, and $1.6 million, respectively. Additionally, Cardano, Litecoin, and Chainlink also saw inflows of $1.2 million, $0.7 million, and $0.4 million, respectively, during the same period. Switzerland Tops Outflows In terms of geography, the US stood out with $79 million in inflows, followed by Germany with $52.4 million over the past week. Canada, Brazil, and Australia also observed inflows of $37.1 million, $21.9 million, and $10.3 million, respectively. Switzerland saw the highest outflow for the week, recording $85.3 million. A similar sentiment was seen across Hong Kong and Sweden as the two countries witnessed outflows of $36.6 million and $33.2 million, respectively.

The decision aligns with the firm’s commitment to supporting cryptocurrency adoption in emerging markets, while capitalizing on El Salvador’s crypto-friendly environment. Tether Secures DASP License for El Salvador Operations Tether has officially announced its intention to set up its physical office in El Salvador following the issuance of the DASP license. This license enables the company to legally engage in activities as a stablecoin issuer, and a digital asset service provider within the country. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, said that this is a new step for the company. “We are partnering with a country that has our vision for financial freedom, innovation and stability,” said Ardoino. To achieve this, the firm has decided to shift its base of operations with the aim of innovation and concentrating on emerging markets. Since El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, the country has attracted many cryptocurrency companies. The country’s policies are progressive, which makes the country a friendly environment for the crypto and blockchain industry. Collaboration with El Salvador’s Government The USDT issuer Tether said that it will collaborate with the Salvadoran government and enterprises to expand financial access and popularize stablecoins. The company plans on giving businesses and people the ability to transact through decentralized financial solutions which it will provide through its USDT stablecoin. The move will allow Tether to expand its activities in El Salvador where there is an increasing number of people who understand Bitcoin. Other Tether executives, including Ardoino and Chief Operating Officer Claudia Lagorio, have already invested in real estate and become citizens of El Salvador in 2024. Subsequently, the government of El Salvador is open for business to crypto companies as it seeks to become one of the world’s leading nations in digital currency. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has been very supportive of cryptocurrency and has stated that it is crucial for the economic development of the country siding with Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy BTC strategy. El Salvador and Tether Plans For Crypto Mining The shift comes after Bitfinex Derivatives, another big cryptocurrency company, also obtained a DASP license in El Salvador. Besides, El Salvador has also adopted favorable policies that have increased tourism and attracted foreign investments. According to a report published by Santander US Capital Markets, the country’s tourism is continuously increasing, and this is because of the acceptance of Bitcoin like in the US by Trump. The USDT issuer is shifting its base as part of its strategy to operate in areas that have friendly policies towards cryptocurrencies. The company thinks so because the proposed move will enable it to concentrate on creating new digital financial products. As of now, Tether has over $137 billion in USDT in circulation making it the largest stablecoin issuer globally. The company has said that moving its operations to El Salvador will allow it to expand its services and make digital assets more easily available around the world with plans of more BTC buying . Tether also revealed that it will support renewable energy projects in El Salvador, such as the geothermal power plant that captures energy from volcanoes. These projects are intended to enhance the nation’s energy infrastructure whilst also ensuring that sustainable crypto mining is achieved.

However, DOGE investors are taking profits and jumping ship, driven by the FOMO we see over new presale crypto Remittix. Readying DeFi for mainstream adoption, Remittix has institutional and retail investors excited, with many dubbing it the ‘next XRP’. The parallels are there, but if they’re right, what next for Ripple Labs and its supposed token for the banking industry of the future? Investors FOMO-ing into Remittix. Is It The Next XRP? Since it first launched in 2013, that narrative around XRP as the top crypto for banks and remittance companies seemed legitimate. However, after limited adoption, followers of the Top 3 crypto are starting to worry as investors flock to the new remittance platform of choice, Remittix. A brand new contender and still in its presale, Remittix has exploded onto the crypto scene with a fresh approach to making transfers. By utilizing a decentralized PayFi protocol, Remittix is set to bridge cryptocurrencies and fiat in a far more efficient and user-friendly way than any platform or token before. Banks and remittance companies are looking at Remittix, and even individual users will be able to send crypto to their global bank of choice and convert it into a local fiat currency. This eliminates the need for expensive middlemen or paperwork, significantly reducing costs and processing times. Remittix has recently launched its presale, and as it gains traction, the market is making it clear which token is the preferred solution for cross-border payments. Remittix’s token $RTX is already up 32% at $0.0199 and over 73% of tokens have been sold, so time left to lock them in is running out. XRP No Longer Top Crypto in Remittance Industry XRP has long been touted as the token for cross-border remittance payments, but with the rise of Remittix is this the end for one of crypto's oldest and biggest tokens? In response to the competition, Ripple Labs recently launched a USD stablecoin $RLUSD, but this has nothing to do with XRP, which has rightfully raised concerns among XRP holders. It’s a tricky time for XRP holders because while it remains a top crypto for now, if it cannot prove its utility, how long can it hold its position? DOGE Investors FOMO Into New DeFi Protocol Standard Dogecoin investors enjoyed one of the biggest run ups in Q4, 2024, but with a heavy correction since December, it’s clear they're taking profits as many FOMO into new cryptos such as Remittix. While DOGE remains the top crypto in the meme coin market, it’s clear investors are looking for the next big thing, and with the market maturing and demanding utility, it’s no surprise Dogecoin is now being ignored by smarter crypto investors. Conclusion Every cycle, the crypto space evolves. Dogecoin was once one of the top crypto assets, but as investors flee the meme coin industry, its market cap is collapsing.

DeFi Integration: Unlike XRP, FXGuys leverages DeFi’s full potential, providing staking rewards and token utility. These advantages make FXGuys a smart choice for those seeking exposure to high-potential altcoins .

The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an appeal from Binance and former CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao to squash a class action lawsuit from investors claiming the company sold unregistered securities. The complaint, filed by crypto traders, accuses Binance of inadequate risk disclosure tied to tokens such as Tron ( TRX ), EOS ( EOS ), among others. Recouping funds invested in these tokens is one of the primary objectives outlined in the lawsuit. Binance and its legal team refuted the allegations, arguing that the exchange’s operations fall outside the jurisdiction of U.S. securities laws. Based on this argument, Binance initially sought to have the case dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. You might also like: Tether to establish HQ in El Salvador However, the Appeals Court ruled that Binance was liable for the transactions, noting that investors purchased the tokens within the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, according to a Jan. 13 report . The news could be another legal blow to crypto’s largest centralized exchange, which has already faced court battles on U.S. soil. In November 2023, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice over federal anti-money laundering violations. CZ resigned as CEO and spent four months in prison as part of the deal. The DOJ case was unrelated to the class action lawsuit filed by investors. CZ’s company is also embroiled in a securities court case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

FDIC Vice Chairman Hill , who is expected to be among those in contention for the job once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, is calling for the U.S. banking regulator to issue new guidance for digital assets. He wants to shed the agency's current, one-by-one approach to directing banks' cryptocurrency ties. ""It has stifled innovation and contributed to a public perception that the FDIC is closed for business if institutions are interested in anything related to blockchain or distributed ledger technology,"" Hill said in Jan. 10 remarks, which also noted the controversial ""pause"" letters dug up by a Freedom of Information Act court battle with Coinbase Inc. He suggested those letters illustrated how — in its piecemeal approach to supervising crypto in the banking system — the agency steered many banks away from digital assets business lines. ""I continue to think a much better approach would have been — and remains — for the agencies to clearly and transparently describe for the public what activities are legally permissible and how to conduct them in accordance with safety and soundness standards,"" he said. ""And if regulatory approvals are needed, those must be acted upon in a timely way, which has not been the case in recent years."" Hill, who was a Republican appointee to the board two years ago, also criticized the FDIC's role in pressuring banks to shed crypto clients. ""A longstanding goal of the FDIC’s has been to decrease the number of people who are unbanked,"" he said. ""Efforts to debank law-abiding customers are unacceptable, regulators must work to end it, and there is no place at the FDIC for anyone who has pushed — explicitly or implicitly — banks to stop serving law-abiding customers. "" Current longtime Chairman Martin Gruenberg has told agency employees he'll step down on January 19, the day before the inauguration of Trump. In the absence of a chairman, the vice chairman steps into that role on an interim basis.

The move highlights Trump Jr.’s growing interest in technology and financial innovation. Kalshi, founded in 2018, allows users to bet on real-world events, including politics, weather, and current affairs. The platform gained prominence after U.S. courts approved election betting last year. Kalshi secured court approval to list prediction contracts on U.S. Congressional control after a legal battle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission . A federal appeals court overturned the CFTC’s prior denial, allowing the regulated startup to offer these event markets. Don Jr.’s bold vision and deep expertise perfectly align with our mission to reshape how America engages with information. His guidance will help accelerate our expansion and push prediction markets into the mainstream. — Kalshi (@Kalshi) January 13, 2025 In a post on social media platform X, Trump Jr. explained his decision to join Kalshi, citing the platform’s accurate predictions during the 2024 presidential election. He noted that Kalshi provided clarity about the Republican victory hours before traditional media outlets reported it. “I immediately knew I had to contribute to their mission,” Trump Jr. wrote, praising Kalshi’s approach to delivering insights through prediction markets. Prediction markets like Kalshi allow users to wager on the outcomes of specific events. For instance, users can bet on the number of executive orders a president will sign or the likelihood of a Senate confirmation vote. Another notable prediction market in mainstream happenings is Polymarket . Both Kalshi and Polymarket use real-time data and crowd sentiment to generate probabilities, often providing faster insights than traditional polls or news outlets.

In contrast, Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market on blockchain that utilizes cryptocurrencies for transactions, covering diverse topics like politics and global events. It gained traction during the 2024 U.S. elections but has faced regulatory challenges in the U.S. Both platforms underscore the growing intersection of prediction markets and cryptocurrency within decentralized finance. While Kalshi adheres to regulatory guidelines, Polymarket leverages blockchain’s decentralized features, offering different approaches to event-based speculation in the crypto space.

After a year of innovation and adoption in 2024, the stage is set for massive opportunities, especially for those ready to take calculated risks. Among the best altcoins to invest in January 2025 , one project stands out: Qubetics ($TICS). Qubetics is reshaping the way the blockchain interacts with real-world assets and interoperability. Alongside it, projects like Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polygon are poised for significant growth, making them prime candidates for exponential returns this year. Here’s an in-depth look at why these altcoins are catching the spotlight. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics has captivated the crypto world with its ongoing best crypto presale . Now in its 17th stage, the project has raised over $9.5 million, selling more than 417 million tokens to a growing base of 14,300+ holders. At just $0.0455 per $TICS token, analysts are forecasting astronomical returns, with prices projected to hit $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 29,824% ROI. But what makes Qubetics so exciting isn’t just the numbers; it’s the problem it aims to solve. Qubetics focuses on interoperability, allowing disparate blockchain networks to communicate seamlessly. By enabling efficient cross-chain operations, it addresses one of the most persistent issues in the cryptocurrency world: fragmentation. Applications of Qubetics: Unlocking the Power of Interoperability Imagine a small business owner in Kazakhstan managing payments across multiple blockchains—Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Currently, they’d have to rely on centralized exchanges, which come with high fees and delays. Qubetics’ interoperability solutions would allow direct, seamless transactions between these networks, saving time and money while maintaining full decentralization. For individuals, the potential is equally transformative. A university student in Bishkek, for example, could pay tuition using a variety of cryptocurrencies, with Qubetics automatically converting and routing the payment to the appropriate chain. Professionals handling international contracts could also benefit from faster settlements and lower fees, using Qubetics to ensure cross-border transactions happen instantly and securely. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics is a game-changer, addressing a fundamental pain point in the blockchain space while offering unprecedented ROI potential. It’s no wonder it’s a top pick for the best altcoins to invest in January 2025 . 2. Filecoin: Decentralized Storage for the Digital Age Filecoin has firmly established itself as the leader in decentralized storage solutions, and its momentum is showing no signs of slowing down. The network’s ability to provide secure, cost-effective data storage makes it a critical infrastructure project in the Web3 space. Recent developments include strategic partnerships with cloud service providers, which have expanded Filecoin’s adoption among businesses and developers. With the rise of AI and machine learning, demand for reliable data storage is surging, positioning Filecoin as an essential player in the digital economy. Why did this coin make it to this list? Filecoin’s practical utility, combined with its expanding market presence, makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in January 2025. 3. Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Cosmos is living up to its nickname as the “Internet of Blockchains” by enabling seamless communication between different blockchain networks. Its innovative Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol has positioned it as a leader in interoperability, with more projects integrating into its ecosystem daily. Over the past year, Cosmos has rolled out significant upgrades to improve scalability and security. These enhancements have attracted new projects and solidified its reputation as a reliable platform for developers. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cosmos’ vision of a unified blockchain ecosystem and its steady progress toward achieving that goal make it a top contender for exponential growth in 2025. 4. Polygon: Scaling Ethereum to New Heights Polygon has become synonymous with scaling Ethereum, offering faster transactions and lower fees without compromising security. This Layer-2 solution has seen tremendous growth, with a surge in DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces migrating to its network. In 2024, Polygon unveiled zkEVM technology, a groundbreaking solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to enhance privacy and scalability. This development has further strengthened its position as the go-to platform for Ethereum scaling. Why did this coin make it to this list? Polygon’s consistent innovation and market adoption make it an undeniable choice for the best altcoins to invest in January 2025. Conclusion Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics ($TICS) and its unique interoperability solutions take center stage as the standout investment opportunity for 2025. Joining it on the list of best altcoins to invest in January 2025 are Filecoin, Cosmos, and Polygon—projects that bring practical utility and innovation to the table. With Qubetics offering unmatched ROI potential and these other projects addressing critical needs in storage, scalability, and blockchain communication, this year could be a turning point for savvy investors.

According to a CBOE press release , BlackRock has launched its iShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded fund to provide institutionally managed BTC exposure to Canadian investors. BlackRock already manages the largest U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, which has been crowned the fastest-growing fund in history, surpassing $52 billion in investor capital within its first year. Commenting on the launch, Helen Hayes, Head of iShares Canada at BlackRock, said that introducing a local product will simplify holding Bitcoin through a “convenient and cost-effective” channel. Rob Marrocco, Global Head of ETF Listings at CBOE, echoed Hayes’ sentiment, emphasizing that IBIT’s expansion into Canada will cater to rising investor demand for crypto exposure. Investors increasingly seek crypto exposure through exchange-listed wrappers, and Cboe intends to meet this demand by leveraging both our global listings capabilities and our derivatives expertise to broaden market access and grow the crypto ecosystem with new products. We are pleased to work with BlackRock and look forward to supporting their success on a global scale through our global listings network.

However, Lightchain AI , a rising contender in the blockchain space, is making significant strides with its focus on scalable, data-driven solutions. With $10.6 million raised in its presale and a token price of $0.00525, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of investors and developers alike. Solana Pioneering Speed and Scalability Solana is a fast blockchain site that solves speed and growth problems in apps that are not controlled by one party. By adding Pr͏oof of History, which acts like a clock that orders events, Solana lets people process deals quickly, reaching as much as 65,000 deals each second. This skill is made better by a block time of close to 400 ms. Also, Solana's design keeps low transaction cost, which is about $0.00025 for each transaction. These new ideas make Solana a strong pick for builders looking to create large and quick apps that work without control. Lightchain AI Revolutionizing Blockchain Adoption Solana may emphasize speed, but Lightchain AI takes blockchain innovation to the next level with AI-driven optimization at its core. Designed to handle the demands of modern decentralized applications, Lightchain AI is all about solving inefficiencies and unlocking new possibilities. Its adaptive scalability means the network grows alongside user demand without missing a beat. And while Solana stays confined to its own ecosystem, Lightchain AI breaks boundaries with cross-chain compatibility, making integration across multiple blockchains seamless and boosting interoperability. Two Leaders, Two Approaches Both Solana and Lightchain AI are driving blockchain innovation, but they cater to different needs within the industry. Solana’s speed and growing ecosystem make it a powerhouse for DeFi and NFTs, while Lightchain AI’s focus on scalability, interoperability, and privacy positions it as a transformative force in enterprise blockchain adoption. For investors and developers, Lightchain AI offers a unique opportunity to participate in a project that combines cutting-edge technology with practical applications, ensuring long-term growth and impact in the blockchain space. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Users will see their assets deployed on seven different yield layers. It includes Solv Season 2, Babylon, Berachain rewards, Kodiak, Dolomite and Goldilocks. Kodiak is a liquidity hub on Berachain,while Dolomite is a decentralized money market fund and DEX platform. Notably, funds deposited in SolvBTC.BERA will be subject to a 90-day lockup period starting from the Berachain mainnet launch. Berachain’s ecosystem taps into a tri-token model, with BERA the native gas token and HONEY the native stablecoin. The stablecoin’s issuance fees go to BGT holders – BGT is Berachain’s primary reward and governance token. BERA and HONEY tokens are both tradable. However, BGT is a non-liquid and non-transferable token.

His wild comments about annexing Canada, reclaiming the Panama Canal, and grabbing Greenland have sent shockwaves across the globe. Whether Trump’s remarks are serious or just another one of his infamous “jokes,” they’re forcing leaders worldwide to take him seriously. The Canadian ambassador to Washington brushed off Trump’s initial suggestion of turning Canada into America’s 51st state as “him having a bit of fun.” But Trump keeps talking , and the more he talks, the less it sounds like a joke. Canadian leaders had no choice but to respond, rejecting the idea outright. Trump clarified that he wouldn’t invade Canada but doubled down by threatening “economic force.” Meanwhile, his refusal to rule out military action against Greenland and the Panama Canal has raised international alarms. Europe takes Trump’s greenland threat seriously Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark, became another target of Trump’s ambitions. He’s talked about “taking back” Greenland with such intensity that European leaders are now on high alert. Germany’s chancellor and France’s foreign minister have warned that Greenland falls under the European Union’s mutual defense clause. Translation? If Trump makes a move on Greenland, the EU could legally defend it. That’s how serious this has become. And while Trump’s defenders are laughing it off, calling his remarks the “Donroe Doctrine”—a play on the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine—others aren’t amused. Republican Congressman Brandon Gill even joked that Canada, Panama, and Greenland should feel “honored” at the thought of becoming part of America. But no one is laughing in Canada, where 82% of the population recently rejected the idea of joining the US in a poll. Trump is the problem The rights of smaller nations aren’t a laughing matter. When bigger nations start talking about taking over smaller ones, it’s a red flag for global politics. It’s the kind of behavior that started both World Wars. Back in 1914, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George couldn’t ignore Germany’s attack on Belgium, calling it a moral obligation to defend smaller nations. A few decades later, Britain and France learned the hard way that appeasing Nazi Germany only encouraged further aggression. By the time they pledged to defend Poland, World War II was unavoidable. Trump’s defenders hate these comparisons. They argue that his talk of annexing territories is about strengthening the free world against autocracies like China and Russia. Trump himself has framed his ambitions as a matter of national security. But here’s the thing: his actions play right into the hands of America’s adversaries. Russia and China have long dreamed of weakening the Western alliance, and Trump is doing the work for them. If Trump argues that it’s strategically necessary for the US to claim Greenland or the Panama Canal, what’s stopping Russia from making the same argument about Ukraine? Or China about Taiwan? Trump’s rhetoric is setting a dangerous precedent, one that could destabilize the entire global order. Russia and China couldn’t have dreamed of a better scenario. Trump’s threats are driving wedges between the US and its allies, weakening the very alliances that have kept these adversaries in check. Canadian media are already running headlines like “Why America Can’t Conquer Canada,” reflecting growing fears of US aggression going rampant in the country. At home, Trump’s supporters continue to cheer him on, dismissing his rhetoric as strategic bluster. The state of the US economy Trump’s policies are also affecting the US economy. Growth projections for 2025 show a slowdown, with the economy expected to grow by just 2%. That’s down from previous years and could worsen if Trump’s tariffs add another point to inflation while cutting 0.7% off growth. Job losses are another concern. Reduced immigration under Trump’s policies could cost the US 100,000 payroll jobs a month, hitting productivity and consumer spending. Treasury yields are expected to remain high, between 4% and 5%. Key economic data points in the coming weeks will shed more light on the situation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports, set for release on January 15 and 14 respectively, will reveal how inflation is affecting consumers and producers. The US trade balance, which showed a deficit of $78.2 billion last month, remains a concern as imports continue to outpace exports. Major banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are also set to report earnings next week. These results will offer insight into how Trump’s policies are affecting the financial sector. While deregulation and tax reforms have boosted profits, market volatility and shifting trade policies could pose challenges.

The blockchain analytics platform announced the acquisition on Jan. 13, with details in a Business Insider report indicating Chainalysis completed the deal at $150 million. Chainalysis’ announcement did not disclose any financial details. Alterya’s AI-powered architecture allows it to identify scammers before they reach their victims. The startup is already collaborating with major industry players, including Binance and Coinbase. Through these partnerships, Alterya currently helps monitor over $8 billion in transactions, benefiting more than 100 million end users. The Tel Aviv-based company raised $9.8 million in a seed funding round that attracted venture capital firms Y Combinator, Battery Ventures, NFX, and Nyca.

Chainalysis sees Alterya as a key step in its mission to combat fraud and scams in the crypto industry. In 2024, the sector suffered massive losses of more than $3 billion due to hackers and scammers. Experts have warned that the increasing use of generative AI by attackers could result in even greater losses. In early December, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation cautioned that scammers are leveraging AI to make crypto-related scams more difficult to detect.

Alterya has already worked with major crypto exchanges like Binance, Block, and Coinbase. The acquisition will enable Chainalysis to improve its fraud detection capabilities, particularly in the Know Your Customer (KYC) process and real-time payment protection. Chainalysis aims for a “holistic” approach to financial crime, integrating prevention, compliance, and remediation. This includes tracing fraud origins from traditional finance into crypto. Alterya’s expertise in monitoring over $8 billion in monthly transactions across crypto and fiat rails will be crucial for Chainalysis to offer new services addressing the financial crime landscape. Generative AI Fuels Sophisticated Scams This deal comes amid a surge in crypto-related fraud , with scams costing the industry billions of dollars annually. According to Chainalysis, the rise of generative AI has further exacerbated the problem, making fraud more scalable and easier to execute: “Fraud and scams have long been a scourge on the financial services industry, from the rise of credit card fraud to today’s sophisticated social engineering scams. Scammers can easily produce high-fidelity fake content and identities, deceiving users across social media and communication platforms to authorize payments under false pretenses.” Generative AI makes it more difficult for financial institutions and crypto businesses to detect when scammers “quickly monetize through crypto and real-time payment systems”. Alterya itself detected $10 billion sent to scams in 2024 and found that 85% of scams exploit fully verified accounts, bypassing traditional identity checks. Effective fraud detection and compliance “rely on granular, real-time data,” and, by integrating Alterya’s technology with Chainalysis’ blockchain data, Chainlink tries to enhance both. Cryptocurrency Crime on the Rise Cybercriminals continued their relentless assault on the cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2024, stealing over $2.3 billion across 760 reported on-chain incidents, according to CertiK’s Web3 Security Report 2024 . This represents almost 32% increase compared to 2023, with criminals averaging $3.1 million per incident. The numbers from 2024 are in, and the Web3 ecosystem faces significant challenges. Over $2.36B was stolen across 760 incidents, marking a 31.61% increase from the previous year. Dive into the 2024 Hack3d Report to see the insights that shaped the year and what’s next. pic.twitter.com/86QyfYia8M — CertiK (@CertiK) January 2, 2025 Phishing attacks reigned supreme , emerging as the most prevalent and costly threat. Nearly 300 incidents, resulting in $1.05 billion in losses, were attributed to phishing scams, as per CertiK’s report. These attacks exploit unsuspecting victims by directing them to fraudulent websites designed to steal login credentials and gain control of their cryptocurrency wallets. Data breaches continue to fuel these attacks, providing cybercriminals with valuable information to personalize their phishing attempts. A recent example saw a revamped phishing campaign targeting Ledger hardware wallet users, leveraging data leaked in a previous breach . In December 2024, Ledger users reported that phishing scammers were spoofing the crypto hardware wallet provider’s support emails in a bid to trick users into revealing their wallet keys. These bogus emails claimed Ledger suffered a “recent data breach” and encouraged recipients to verify their private seed phrase under the guise of needing to “safeguard” their assets.

In a new interview with CNBC, Tom Lee makes his case for why he thinks BTC will be a top-performing asset this year after it falls a bit further. “Bitcoin is down roughly 15% from its highs, which for a hyper-volatile asset is a normal correction and follows global liquidity trends. We are early in the halving cycle.” According to Lee, Fundstrat’s crypto technicians think the crypto king may drop another $20,000 in value before correcting. “Our technician thinks $70,000 is where we make a stand. I think Bitcoin is one of the best-performing assets. When asked whether it will drop to $70,000 or if that’s the floor, the response was that $70,000 is one level of retracement, where Bitcoin might pull back from a rally.” However, according to Lee, BTC could potentially drop even lower. “It could go as low as the $50,000 [range], but that wouldn’t be a new level; it’s where it touches before beginning to rally again. For those considering buying Bitcoin at these prices, the suggestion is that Bitcoin is a long-term investment. If they’re trying to time the market, they might get lucky and it could reach $70,000.” Bitcoin is worth $91,731 at time of writing, down 10% during the week.

The HMSTR, recently experienced a 10% drop, raising questions about its potential recovery. Investors are speculating whether the upcoming DAO partnership vote could push its price towards a new all-time high, which was last achieved in November of last year. Can Hamster Kombat Price Hit ATH Following Its Tycho Collab? Hamster Kombat price has announced a groundbreaking partnership with Tycho to build an innovative Layer-2 blockchain ecosystem. The collaboration was approved by the Hamster DAO, marking a significant milestone for the project’s growth. The new blockchain will utilize the native HMSTR token for gas fees, streamlining transactions and improving user efficiency.

The project’s team expressed enthusiasm about the future, highlighting their commitment to building a cutting-edge platform for their community. The initiative reflects Hamster Kombat’s ongoing efforts to enhance its technological infrastructure and solidify its position in the blockchain space. Source- X HMSTR Price Analysis The HMSTR price is trading at $0.003063, showing a 3.24% daily gain. Current technical analysis suggests limited upward movement unless specific resistance levels are breached. The all-time high (ATH) of $0.010040 remains a distant target, with the nearest resistance identified at $0.005000. Meanwhile, support is maintained at $0.002800, offering a crucial safety zone for traders monitoring the top altcoins’ volatility . The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator signals minimal bullish momentum, with the MACD line crossing slightly above the signal line. However, the histogram reflects a potential slowdown, suggesting the need for further confirmation of bullish activity. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 48, just below the neutral 50 level. This reading indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, highlighting a lack of decisive direction in the cryptocurrency market. For bullish traders, breaking past the $0.005000 resistance could pave the way for a push toward the $0.010040 ATH. Conversely, a drop below $0.002800 support may indicate further bearish pressure, leading to new lower levels.

Degen Elon (ELONDEG), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONDEG is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Degen Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Degen Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Degen Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Degen Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Degen Elon by entering its contract address – DnjQgB68KcXAf9kHei6jEdaWgPrzy2fQUqyzB4NKeC3X – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONDEG. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 19:19:00

The surge in laundering activities coincides with the broader upward trend in cryptocurrency prices throughout the year. The total impact of crypto security breaches in 2024 exceeded $3.01 billion, representing a 15% increase from the $2.61 billion stolen in 2023. The scale of crypto security breaches Cryptocurrency hacks in 2024 surpassed 300 recorded incidents, with total losses reaching $2.15 billion. This is a 30% increase from the $1.51 billion stolen in 2023. May emerged as the most volatile month, with attackers stealing $574.6 million across 28 separate hacks. The Ethereum blockchain bore the heaviest losses, accounting for 47.3% of the total value stolen and 34.8% of all incidents. The gaming sector faced particular pressure, with losses totaling $502 million, primarily due to the PlayDapp exploit, which resulted in a $290 million theft. Source: PeckShield The data from PeckShield indicates a shift in attack patterns, with hackers increasingly targeting organizational infrastructure rather than protocol vulnerabilities. This trend now represents 46% of all attacks, up from 33% in 2023. Bitcoin-related thefts also increased, correlating with the cryptocurrency’s price appreciation throughout the year. Recovery efforts managed to secure $488.5 million of the stolen funds, though this represents only 23% of the total losses. The persistence of these attacks, despite enhanced security measures, underscores the ongoing challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry in protecting digital assets. Laundering mechanisms by crypto hackers PeckShield’s analysis reveals two primary methods criminals used to obscure stolen cryptocurrency in 2024. Chain hopping combined with centralized exchange (CEX) transfers accounted for 24.7% of laundering activities, processing approximately $452 million worth of stolen assets. Coin mixing services handled 25.5% of illicit funds, processing $468 million throughout the year. The rise in crypto prices created additional opportunities for laundering operations, as higher valuations made it easier to process large amounts through multiple smaller transactions. Criminals used increasingly complex routes, often splitting stolen funds across multiple chains and services to avoid detection. The analysis tracked money flows through more than 50 different platforms and services. On-chain data shows criminals frequently used cross-chain bridges and decentralized exchanges as intermediate steps before reaching their final destinations. The complexity of these operations often delayed fund recovery efforts, with law enforcement and security teams requiring extensive resources to track and freeze compromised assets.

These regulations are set to take effect during the Trump administration, allowing them to determine how or whether they will implement the policies. The curb , which has seen fierce resistance from the industry and will become active in one year, has put a cap on the amount of computing power that can be exported to most countries. However, entities in such countries can circumvent the national limits by setting up security and human rights standards. The White House is giving a four-month period to collect company feedback regarding the proposals. The period will be enough for the Trump administration to settle and allow consultations between President Trump’s administration, the companies, and other countries. Security concerns have triggered the curb The commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, said that the move by the Biden administration is trying to balance between national security and trade of chips. Not all chips will be affected as supply chain activities and gaming chips are excluded from the new curbs. Furthermore, Washington will not charge licensing fees for the sale of chips with low collective computing power targeting schools and research centers. China’s technological growth is raising concerns in the US, and the current move is meant to restrict the supply of AI technology to friendly nations that align with the standards of the United States. Biden and Trump’s teams have discussed the curb, and one US official agrees that the controls have largely been a bipartisan national security priority. The rules will apply to importing countries. However, US firms and its 20 allied nations can win permission to sell if they agree with the standards to ship to the restricted nations. For approval, the firms must maintain most of their computing power in friendly territories. The approval will not go to data centers in China, Russia, Macau, and some 20 other locations where the US has an arms embargo, as it has effectively banned AI chip shipments to those places. Nvidia feels targeted by the curb Nvidia has responded to the curb by saying that the rule aims to negate Americans’ gains in the technology sector by trying to determine market outcomes and encourage unfair competition. Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, said: As the first Trump administration demonstrated, America wins through innovation, competition, and sharing our technologies with the world—not by retreating behind a wall of government overreach. Ned Finkle Senators Ted Cruz and Maria Cantwell, the top Republicans and Democrats on the Commerce Committee, made similar comments in a December letter to Raimondo. They wrote that the restrictions are draconian and would negatively affect the sale of US technology abroad. They further added that they could drive foreign buyers to Chinese competitors like Huawei.

Highest Data in History,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-this-whats-stopping-bitcoin-from-soaring-highest-data-in-history/,"Cryptocurrency analytics firm Alphractal has revealed that Bitcoin miners moved the highest dollar value in history between November 8 and December 31, 2024. This unprecedented activity, largely characterized by significant outflows, has contributed to increasing selling pressure in the Bitcoin market as miners’ reserves continue to dwindle. This trend is due to increased competition in the mining industry. Bitcoin’s hash rate (a measure of computing power used to secure the network) has reached all-time highs, increasing operational costs for miners. To cover these increased costs and maintain profitability within tighter margins, many miners have resorted to liquidating their Bitcoin holdings. Chart shared by Alphractal showing the melting of miners' reserves. Related News: As Bitcoin Plummets, Giant Asian Company Announces Massive Bitcoin Purchase Despite this sell-off, recent data from January suggests a potential slowdown in miners’ selling activity. Alphractal’s analysis suggests that selling interest among miners has waned, possibly signaling a pause in market pressure. “The coming months will be crucial for assessing how the dynamics of rising costs and declining reserves will affect the price of Bitcoin,” the report said. *This is not investment advice.

According to CoinMarketCap, the total crypto market capitalization has dropped by 10% in one week to $3.18 trillion. The downtrend has caused a negative impact on flows in and out of the cryptocurrency market. According to analyst Ali Charts on X, capital inflows in the market have declined from $134 billion to $58 billion in just one month. (Source: X) This decline points towards reduced investment activity. Moreover, traders withdrawing their money from the market could indicate market uncertainty and a lack of conviction about the short-term price performance. One of the factors that could be behind the drop amid bullish catalysts such as the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump is the reduced demand for risk assets such as crypto and stocks. Dollar Strength Reduces Demand for Crypto Trump’s election win not only boded well for cryptocurrency prices but also for the US dollar. According to MarketWatch , the US Dollar Index (DXY) has increased to 110, marking its highest level since November 2022. The US dollar is inversely correlated with Bitcoin in that when the DXY is rising, crypto prices decline. Moreover, a stronger dollar tends to reduce the demand for assets like crypto as investors become risk averse. The weakened demand is also evident in the spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. This is after spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $732M in outflows in the last two consecutive trading days, per SoSoValue data. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $185M outflows last week. If institutions and retail traders continue to show reduced interest in Bitcoin and altcoins in preference for the US dollar, it could result in bearish pressure. Fear and Greed Index Shows Market is Still in Bull Territory Despite crypto prices retracing across the broader market, the Fear and Greed Index, a metric that measures the sentiment of traders, still shows a bullish sentiment. At press time, this index stood at 61, which shows a state of “greed” and that demand from investors remained significantly high. However, the level of demand from new buyers has dropped significantly, given that the index stood at 78 a week ago. Bitcoin traded at $91,690 at press time after a 10% drop in seven days, while the largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), traded at $3,108 after registering a 14% drop in one week.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Crypto Market|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-13 19:21:59

Despite the excitement, people should beware of fraudsters who offer fake services involving the meme coin. How to Claim the Tokens? Shiba Inu’s ecosystem continues to evolve, expanding beyond its origins as a meme coin. The most recent example of that progress is the upcoming launch of TREAT, scheduled for January 14 . The coin is designed to enhance utility and engagement across the network’s projects. It will also serve as a reward token within the ecosystem and provide liquidity for the proposed stablecoin SHI. Some leading cryptocurrency exchanges that have already embraced TREAT include KuCoin, Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC Exchange, and more. To celebrate the launch, three of those have also unveiled a special airdrop to users. LUCIE – Shibarium’s Marketing Strategist – explained in detail how people can claim TREAT tokens. First, they need to create a Bitget, KuCoin, or Gate.io account. Second, they should visit Shiba Inu’s official website, provide a user ID, and deposit the designated address. Once those details are submitted, the accounts will be whitelisted and “ready to receiv e TREAT tokens.” “Follow these steps carefully and always use official platforms. Shib is dedicated to maintaining a secure environment – stick to the trusted process and avoid shortcuts,” LUCIE added. Gate.io has promised to distribute 1,000,000 TREAT, KuCoin will airdrop 3,000,000 coins, while Bitget users will split 87,450,000 tokens. Stay Away From Scammers Besides announcing the details behind the airdrops, LUCIE also warned people to remain cautious due to potential fraudulent schemes surrounding the launch. The X users advised users not to click on any links on X (formerly known as Twitter) or connect their wallets. Earlier this month, Shibarium Trustwatch (an X account that aims to provide security) maintained that bad actors have used the ongoing excitement as an opportunity to offer fake TREAT services to unsuspecting victims: “They are now using SHIB socials linked to their FAKE TREAT. Please don’t be misled by these predatory scammers. They can be called vultures, circling and looking for their next feed. We ask with heaven on our side, please do not fall for these scams. Be clear: the TREAT launch is scheduled for the 14th of January 2025, not before. If you are unsure about anything at any time , check with us first.

This drop was driven by a significant sell-off by whales, with prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez noting that over the past 48 hours, whales had offloaded more than 70 million ADA. Despite the sell-off, ADA’s price showed strength, holding ground in the past 24 hours to reach $0.9 at press time. This movement followed a period of consolidation, with ADA finding robust support around the $0.85 level last week. The cryptocurrency bounced off this support, setting the stage for a potential bullish breakout. Analysts are now watching this support zone closely, with some believing it could act as a catalyst for higher price movements in the near future. In a video earlier this week, analyst “Investing Broz” discussed ADA’s bullish potential, addressing doubts surrounding ADA in a video and emphasizing that the project is far from dead. Notably, the pundit stressed that the current price action is just a “small blip” and reassured followers that “we’re early” in Cardano’s price growth. “People are saying ADA is dead, but we’re just getting started. This is the kind of market where the price is still finding its feet, but the long-term potential is undeniable,” he said. The pundit further expressed strong optimism regarding ADA’s future price trajectory, suggesting that the token could replicate the bull run seen in 2021. He pointed out that ADA’s recent dip in December to a low of $0.76 might have marked the bottom. “Back in March 2020, ADA dropped even lower, and many believed it was the worst investment. Yet, those same people watched as ADA skyrocketed from $0.018 to over $3—a 163x increase. Guess what? We could be at that same early stage right now,” he remarked. Elsewhere, analyst Alan Santana recently expressed optimism about Cardano’s (ADA) bullish prospects, noting that the recent retracement still maintains a higher low, indicating a potential upward trend continuation. In a tweet, he emphasized that ADA remains bullish above $0.76, and a new rally seems likely with its current price above $0.83. Additionally, analysts like Ali Martinez have previously pointed to the ADA chart forming a bullish “bull flag” pattern, suggesting a breakout could push prices above $1.87, potentially reaching as high as $6. Beyond technical indicators, there is growing optimism about a potentially favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrency under Trump. The upcoming Plomin hard fork, set for this month, is also expected to enhance decentralization on the Cardano network . Additionally, the recent launch of Binance’s ADA Earn staking program will likely increase demand from the exchange’s vast user base, potentially boosting ADA’s price.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-13 19:37:30

The Premier will deliver what is dubbed the AI Opportunities Action Plan, which is said to give a ‘decade of national renewal.’ According to the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology and the Prime Minister’s Office, the project is set to create dedicated AI growth zones to “turbocharge growth” and “boost living standards.” Starmer’s administration to increase compute capacity in the UK twentyfold A joint statement by the PM’s office and the Department of Science, Innovation, and Technology indicates that Culham and Oxfordshire will have faster planning approvals for data centers and better access to the energy grid, and establish the first growth zones. Matt Clifford, a venture capitalist made 50 recommendations in a report commissioned by the Labour Party government last year which were all adopted. The blueprint also proposes a 20-fold increase in state-owned AI computing capacity as well as the establishment of a National Data Library and a dedicated AI Energy Council. “Artificial Intelligence will drive incredible change in our country. From teachers personalizing lessons, to supporting small businesses with their record-keeping, to speeding up planning applications, it has the potential to transform the lives of working people,” said Starmer. “But the AI industry needs a government that is on their side, one that will not sit back and let opportunities slip through its fingers. And in a world of fierce competition, we cannot stand by.” Starmer. Last year, Starmer’s administration canceled a £1.3 billion pound taxpayer-funded commitment to two significant computing initiatives to prioritize fiscal plans. The projects, which included an AI Research Resource were pledges made under Rishi Sunak, Starmer’s predecessor. Now, the Prime Minister’s announcement comes as his government is hemorrhaging support after a mere six months in office as the economy is in a sluggish condition. With fears that the country might be headed for a second recession in the span of a year, the UK economy grew by 0% in the third quarter of 2024. According to an analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that found that AI could boost productivity by as much as 1.5 percentage points a year, the UK government has estimated that AI could be worth $57 million in economic gains each year over a decade. The UK ranks third in AI prowess globally, after China and the US, according to the 2023 Global AI Vibrancy Ranking compiled by Stanford University. UK will require partnerships including those with startups Referring to the six milestones he has set out for his government, including raising living standards for households and reducing hospital waiting lists, the Prime Minister said, “Our plan will make Britain the world leader. It will give the industry the foundation it needs and will turbocharge the Plan for Change. “That means more jobs and investment in the UK, more money in people’s pockets and transformed public services. That’s the change this government is delivering.” Starmer. According to Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, Peter Kyle investing in building a deep and continually updated understanding of AI capabilities mapped to their highest impact challenges and opportunities will improve livelihoods. “It will require appointing an AI lead for each mission to help identify where AI could be a solution within the mission setting, considering the user needs from the outset,” he said. The Labour-led government believes in a cross-government technical horizon scanning and market intelligence capability that understands AI capabilities and use cases as they evolve to work closely with the mission leads and maximize the expertise of both. “Two-way partnerships with AI vendors and startups to anticipate future AI developments and signal public sector demand will be set up with government.” Kyle. This plan involves the government meeting product teams to understand upcoming releases and shape development by sharing their challenges. It also includes rapidly developing prototypes or fast light touch procurement to spin up pilots in high-impact areas, robust evaluation, and publishing results. “This will require consistent use of a framework for how to source AI whether to build in-house, buy, or run innovation challenges, that evolve over time, given data, capability, industry context, and evaluation of what has worked,” added Kyle.

New data from market intelligence platform Coinglass shows traders saw liquidations during the last 24 hours to the tune of $716.05 million, mostly by those betting long on Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ). The flagship crypto asset dipped to a 2025 low of about $89,800 on Monday before returning to the $90,000 range. Bitcoin is trading for $91,701 at time of writing, down 3.5% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $3,019 at time of writing, down 8.1% in the last 24 hours. Several popular analysts are weighing in on Bitcoin after the sudden market dip. Crypto analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 763,200 followers on the social media platform X that he is leaning bullish on Bitcoin if it can hold $92,000 as support on the daily chart. “Bitcoin has taken all the liquidity and bounces up firmly. Good things happening. If this doesn’t close above $92,000 and we want to take liquidity again, brace for $85,000. However, changes are substantial that we’re going to test higher.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Next up, Glassnode and Swissblock co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Alleman, who share the social media handle Negentropic, say they are closely watching their Bitcoin Risk Signal metric as it suddenly shot up. The Bitcoin Risk Signal uses metrics like price data and on-chain data to attempt to determine the likelihood of a downside price action. “Price momentum is recovering after last week’s drop, this is the steepest shift to bearish territory since April, pre-halving. To confirm further decline, we need a risk spike – watch how rising risk aligns with falling momentum. Key change: The Risk Index has jumped to 12 after holding at 0 since September. This could signal volatility ahead. Bitcoin remains in a range between $92,000-$100,000, but emerging negative signals warrant caution.” Source: Negentropic/X Source: Negentropic/X Lastly, pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 255,600 followers on the social media platform X that he remains bullish on Bitcoin. “I am going to do the same with $90,000 as I said above $100,000. Bullish above until we get closer to midrange and potential highs, bearish below.

Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) price spikes have posted strong returns and have once again raised interest in the best altcoins. While XRP and ADA continue to capture headlines, the attention of the discerning in both cryptos and AI is likely being grabbed by Ozak AI . Experts advise Ozak AI, the up-and-coming innovative DeFi token, could see a surge of 1000x from its initial valuation. Given these claims, is Ozak AI going to be a force to reckon with in the crypto domain? XRP (XRP) XRP has seen a value increase from $2.52 to $2.59, marking a remarkable increase of 9.89%. Within the last 24 hours, XRP did register a fractional increase, tallying up to 1.94%. Additionally, trading volumes have made a larger leap, sitting around $7 billion, which now points at decent market interest. With the latest information in hand, XRP’s market capitalization has increased up to $146 billion, marking a 1.76% change. The fully diluted value for XPR currently stands at approximately $254 billion. The increase in XRP’s price can be associated with its growing adoption rates coupled with favorable regulatory changes that are expected in the near future. Cardano (ADA) Cardano is set to alter the experience of fans in partnership with FC Barcelona by utilizing blockchain technology. This objective, paired with the search for new revenue streams, addresses some of the issues that the football club is facing. It aims at improving the overall experience of the fans. New services will be more efficient and transparent. It can be assumed that this collaboration may allow Cardano to grow in the mainstream markets, increasing the level of awareness about them. The price of ADA stands at $0.9854, with the percentage increase being 3.26% despite the ADA struggling on the cryptocurrency charts for a while. Ozak AI ($OZ) As Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) continue to grow, it appears the crypto market is becoming increasingly competitive, with Ozak AI gaining more traction. The presale of the $OZ token that the project held managed to sell out during its Phase 1 and raised $200,000, with tokens currently priced at $0.002 each. As Phase 2 commences , early supporters are beginning to reap some benefits, with the price of the currency expected to sell at around $0.002, which is twice the amount of its initial worth. The valuation models predict an FDV of around $20 million considering the 200 million tokens that will be made available for Ozak AI, which is what appears to be gaining hype very fast. Furthermore, the project plans to list its token at $0.01, creating an attractive opportunity for early investors. Conclusion As the crypto market continues to gain traction, Ozak AI , together with XRP and Cardano, are making waves. XRP has experienced a surge in market price due to the increased usage of the product and potential growth of impact from the overhauling regulations. Cardano, on the other hand, via its partnership with FC Barcelona, is working to deploy advanced fan engagement via blockchain. In its initiative for decentralized AI analytics networks, Ozak AI is also attracting attention when it comes to the innovative token utilities and more stable growth prospects that it brings to the table.

As the firm announced on January 13, the BTC ETF product launched on CBOE Canada. This move came just a year after the BlackRock ETF went live in the U.S. The BlackRock ETF In Canada The firm announced that the Canada variant will trade under iShares Bitcoin ETF. It will also trade under the IBIT ticker symbol. As BlackRock pointed out, the Canadian offshoot will invest a substantial portion of its funds in the US-traded ETF. The Canadian Bitcoin ETF seeks to track Bitcoin’s performance pending the payment of its operational expenses and liabilities. While the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is one of the seven ETF products trading in Canada, the asset manager said users can gain different exposure to the BTC offering. These channels include discount brokerage platforms and full-service dealers in the country. “The iShares Fund provides Canadian investors with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to bitcoin and helps remove the operational and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly,” said Helen Hayes, Head of iShares Canada, BlackRock. The iShares Bitcoin ETF Milestone Bitcoin ETF launched in the United States in January of last year after about a decade of denial by the U.S SEC. The IBIT AUM crossed the $50 billion milestone in December and is currently worth $52 billion. The BlackRock BTC ETF has toppled some physical gold ETF milestones in 52 weeks of trading. Per an earlier Coingape report, four spot Bitcoin ETF products now rank among the t op 20 best ETF launches . The success of ETF products hinges on their wide adoption by top asset managers worldwide. While BlackRock holds shares in its Bitcoin ETF, other top firms, such as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, also have exposure. While he has to divest his holdings, Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent is also exposed to IBIT. Birth of New Crypto ETF Products The emergence of spot Bitcoin ETF products has also led to the launch of Ethereum funds. These funds have inspired the emergence of other crypto ETF products. The offerings lodged with the U.S SEC include Litecoin ETF, Solana ETF, and XRP ETF, respectively. Notably, the Gary Gensler-led US SEC showed reluctance to altcoin-based ETF products. However, the potential confirmation of Paul Atkins as the next Chairman of the SEC might change the prospect of these crypto ETF products. Multiple experts say Solana and XRP ETF applications may gain approval this year.

In a new thread, the developers of the decentralized peer-to-peer network warn investors about the breach but note that the team immediately regained access to Litecoin’s official X account. “Litecoin’s X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published. These were live only for a matter of seconds before being deleted. We’re still investigating the issue, but immediately found a delegated account that was compromised and removed it. We apologize for any confusion caused.” A screenshot of the incident shows that the scammer posted a message using Litecoin’s X account to falsely claim that LTC “is now [on] Solana.” The bad actor added a link that takes users to what appears to be a rug pull scam. According to data from blockchain tracker DEX Screener, the scam token – referred to as LTC/SOL on Raydium – saw a massive dip in price on January 11th, around the time the hacker promoted the coin on Litecoin’s X account. News of the breach had little impact on LTC’s price as it is trading for $104.10 at time of writing, a 1.4% increase on the day. Earlier this month, it was reported that losses from crypto-related hacks soared in 2024, coming in at $3.01 billion, a 15% increase from the previous year’s total.

Table of Contents Why Rexas Finance is the next big thing Market comparisons: Why RXS outshines XRP Conclusion Unquestionably, Ripple (XRP) has changed the landscape of cryptocurrencies.

With an outstanding 24-hour trading volume of $6,070,509, the token has gained 377.86% in the last 60 days alone, landing a live price of $2.41 as of writing. Although these are admirable achievements, forward-looking investors have been looking for the next great opportunity since market conditions have changed. Now, let’s consider Rexas Finance (RXS) , a novel initiative poised to alter the field of real-world asset tokenization and offer exponential development potential. RXS is poised for a 21,200% rally, so you should invest your money in 2025.

The Rexas Token Builder lets users create tokens without coding knowledge, simplifying the tokenizing process.

By spreading the campaign and finishing activities on the Rexas Finance website, participants increase their chances of winning additional entries.

Market comparisons: Why RXS outshines XRP While XRP’s historical gains are impressive, its growth potential may be limited compared to RXS. Here’s why: Unique Use Case: While XRP focuses on cross-border payments, RXS addresses a trillion-dollar market by tokenizing real-world assets. Community-Driven Growth: RXS’s reliance on individual investors fosters organic and sustainable growth. Exponential ROI Potential: With a projected price of $37.1 by 2025, RXS offers unparalleled growth opportunities for early investors, making RXS the best token for investment in 2025. Ecosystem Versatility: RXS’s support for multiple token standards and user-friendly tools, such as the Token Builder and Launchpad, make it a comprehensive solution for asset tokenization. Investing in Rexas Finance is straightforward. Interested participants can join the ongoing presale through the official Rexas Finance website. The process is secure, and with the token currently priced at $0.175 in Stage 11, there’s still time to capitalize on this high-potential opportunity. Conclusion Though Ripple may have created history, altcoins like Rexas Finance will shape the future. Predicted to rise 21,200% in 2025, RXS is positioned to become a market leader with its creative approach to real-world asset tokenization, strong community backing, and outstanding presale performance.

They are seeking compensation for their losses, claiming that the tokens were sold in violation of U.S. securities laws. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan previously ruled in March 2024 that U.S. securities laws could apply to Binance despite the company not being based in the U.S. The court noted that token purchases become irreversible in the U.S. once payments are made and noted that Binance uses local servers hosted by Amazon. Binance, which was founded in China, argued that its operations should not be subject to U.S. securities laws because of its international status. It cited a 2010 Supreme Court decision in Morrison v. National Australia Bank that limited the extraterritorial reach of U.S. securities laws. However, the Second Circuit’s decision allowed the case to proceed, stating that certain aspects of the transactions occurred domestically. Related News: BREAKING: And It Happened - Coinbase Announces That It Will Finally List The Hugely Popular Memecoin Binance argued in its appeal that the Second Circuit misapplied the Morrison precedent, arguing that the decision set a precedent to extend U.S. securities laws to foreign trading platforms like Binance.com. The company also said the case raises a question of “global importance” to international financial markets. This case is different from the one Binance was found guilty of violating money laundering and sanctions laws in November 2023 and fined $4.3 billion. In that case, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison and released in September 2024. *This is not investment advice.

38910416,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674593,1736798414,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Dogecoin Traders Remain Extremely Bullish Despite Price Crash, Here Are The Numbers",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-traders-bullish/,"Dogecoin has maintained its consolidation path into the last 24 hours, with price data reflecting a 14.5% decline in a seven-day timeframe. However, the price decline has done little to dampen the general sentiment surrounding Dogecoin, especially in a long-term timeframe. As part of the lingering optimism surrounding the meme coin, data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez reveals a strikingly bullish sentiment among Dogecoin enthusiasts on crypto exchange Binance. Majority Of Binance Traders Betting On Dogecoin Price Increase The majority of Dogecoin traders have remained bullish despite Dogecoin’s recent price decline from just below the $0.4 mark since January 7. This bullishness is highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez through trading positions on crypto exchange Binance. At the time, the long/short ratio showed that approximately 81.05% of all traders with open Dogecoin positions on Binance were betting on an upward price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles With Liquidity Blocks From $86,000 To $104,000, Analyst Reveals The Logical Thing To Do The bullish stance is further underscored by the Binance DOGEUSD_PERP ratio, which reveals that 90.43% of perpetual contract accounts are in long positions, according to Coinglass data. Perpetual contracts, which lack a fixed expiration or settlement date, reflect trader expectations over an indefinite time period. This imbalance toward long positions suggests that the majority of Dogecoin traders remain confident in the meme coin’s potential for long-term growth, particularly as they look towards another major bull run in 2025. Interestingly, on-chain data shows that Dogecoin whales are also capitalizing on the price decline to accumulate more DOGE tokens. This accumulation trend saw whale addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE tokens increase their collective holdings by around 470 million tokens within a 48-hour timeframe. DOGE Needs To Hold Above $0.3 At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.33 and is on a 3.35% decline in the past 24 hours. This downturn is part of a broader trend of lackluster price performance over the last 30 days, during which Dogecoin has consistently struggled to break above the $0.40 mark. The most recent example was when this price level acted as a significant resistance level during Dogecoin’s brief price surge in the first few days of January 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Case: Continued Rejection At $100,000 Increases Likelihood Of Breakdown The focus for Dogecoin traders and investors has now shifted away from breaking the $0.40 resistance level to defending the $0.30 support zone, which has become increasingly important in maintaining a long-term bullish narrative for the meme coin. For bullish momentum to remain intact, Dogecoin must hold firmly above this support level, as a breakdown could signal the start of a deeper correction. A successful hold above the $0.3 mark puts the bullish trajectory still in play, and Dogecoin could easily rebound upwards at any time. However, failure to maintain support at $0.30 could lead to more corrections towards the $0.25 mark. Such a scenario would not only weaken its technical outlook but also dampen the substantial returns even when the overall crypto market begins to recover.

Some analysts even believe the product poses a larger threat than the TikTok ban. According to Kyla Scanlon, Bloomberg’s opinion contributor, Meta AI’s generated content will flourish but might come at the cost of human livelihoods. Meta introduces AI influencers, which could push out human content content creators Meta still prioritizes AI integration into its social media platforms, hoping to attract younger users and edge out competitors like TikTok and Snapchat. One of its latest AI introductions is a tool that helps users create AI characters on Instagram and Facebook. However, users, particularly content creators, have pushed back against the AI product. Connor Hayes, Meta’s vice president of product for generative AI, said: We expect these AIs to actually exist on our platforms in the same way that [human] accounts do. ~ Connor Hayes This raised questions about the long-term impact that these AI influencers could have on human creators’ income streams. Kyla Scanlon believes Meta’s new AI characters could restructure the creator economy. She added that AI-generated content could easily thrive since it’s scalable, cheap, never rests, and perfectly controllable. However, its success could come at the expense of human creators. Scanlon does, however, believe that the biggest challenge for AI influencers is their inability to fully replicate the human experience, insisting that this aspect alone could preserve the human creator economy. She remarked how AI could not mimic real human faces with authentic stories, living in real places, or the little, messy, and beautiful imperfections of human creativity. TikTok could be banned in the United States Aside from the potential competition from AI influencers, human creators in the US will have to deal with a looming TikTok ban. On January 10, the US Supreme Court heard oral arguments concerning TikTok’s potential ban. US lawmakers want the social media platform to sell to a US company or risk losing the US market. If the court fails to intervene, the application will be banned across the country’s servers and devices on January 19. However, the Supreme Court might not favor Tiktok, especially after its judges appeared satisfied with the focus on its controversial Chinese ownership of the app’s parent company. On December 27, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump submitted a motion opposing the TikTok ban. He hopes to fight for a political resolution once he takes office. However, If Donald Trump wants to help Tiktok maintain its US market, he must do so within the law.

As we all know, Trump won the election and will take office one week from today. This leaves a major question on the minds of Bitcoiners: Will Trump actually pardon Ross? I believe Trump will 100% stay true to his word and free Ross from prison. I have not seen anything to suggest that Trump would do otherwise and have only seen things that make me confident he will follow through on this promise. It should be relatively easy for Trump to do, and given his continuous backing of the Bitcoin industry, I am confident Ross is going to be walking as a free man again soon. Judging by Ross’ X account , which is currently run by his wife, he is preparing to leave prison soon. “For my last monthly resolution of 2024, I intend to study every day and to get up to speed as much as I can as I prepare for freedom,” she recently posted on behalf of Ross. For those unfamiliar with the story, Ross has been in prison since 2013 for creating a website, Silk Road, where users could buy and sell things transacting in bitcoin. He was a non-violent, first-time offender, sentenced to double life plus 40 years without parole. At Ross’ trial, he was not prosecuted for causing any harm or bodily injury, and no victim was named. While Ross was not tried for selling drugs or illegal items himself, he was held responsible for what others listed on Silk Road, which included drugs. Now, 12 years later, the time has come for Ross to be freed. In 2022, Ross wrote President Biden a letter asking to be pardoned, in which he explained he did not create the website with any bad intentions and was simply promoting the libertarian ideology he believed in. He also shared that, if freed, he would not do anything to “break the law” again. President Biden ignored the letter, and kept him in prison. And now President Trump has the chance to let him live the rest of his life as a free man. Ross himself also believes that Trump will deliver on his promise. Immense gratitude to everyone who voted for President Trump on my behalf. I trust him to honor his pledge and give me a second chance. After 11+ years in darkness, I can finally see the light of freedom at the end of the tunnel. Thank you so much, @realDonaldTrump 🙏 — Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) November 12, 2024 I look forward to seeing Ross come home. This article is a Take .

Ethereum price predictions are optimistic as the cryptocurrency approaches key thresholds, potentially rallying towards a promising $10,450 target. Hedera traders are keenly observing HBAR’s price, which shows signs of fluctuation within crucial support and resistance levels, indicating possible future volatility. BlockDAG (BDAG) has gained significant attention with its impressive alliance with Inter Milan, one of the top football clubs globally. This partnership not only enhances BlockDAG’s global presence but also propels it towards achieving its $600M presale goal. Let’s delve into these developments and spotlight the top trending crypto. Hedera Traders Monitor Key Levels Amid Price Consolidation Hedera (HBAR) traders are tracking its price, which has seen a modest 3.8% increase over the past week, keeping its market cap above $11.5 billion. The mix of technical indicators suggests potential for either a rally continuation or a pullback. The Average Directional Index (ADX) stands at 35.9, signaling a strong, albeit weakening, trend. With buying pressure decreasing and selling pressure on the rise, Hedera traders are cautious, as the Ichimoku Cloud displays potential bearish movement with the price nearing the red cloud. Currently, HBAR is priced between a support at $0.274 and a resistance at $0.311. A drop below support could push HBAR down to $0.233, while surpassing resistance might spark further gains. Ethereum Price Prediction: Anticipating a Bright 265% Growth! Recent Ethereum price predictions are favorable as the coin exhibits a “golden cross,” a bullish sign where the short-term EMA surpasses the long-term EMA. Historically, February has been beneficial for Ethereum, suggesting potential substantial gains, though past results are not always indicative of future outcomes. Ethereum is approaching its 50 EMA, a critical juncture to sustain its upward trajectory. After bouncing back from December lows of $3,220, there’s a surge in buyer interest. According to Ethereum’s price prediction, surpassing the $4,000 mark could spark a surge towards its previous peak of $4,800 and potentially reach up to $10,000. Under favorable conditions, Ethereum could achieve a 265% rise from current levels to $10,450. BlockDAG & Inter Milan’s Partnership Targets $600M in Presale BlockDAG (BDAG), a rising star in the cryptocurrency market, has recently partnered with Inter Milan, one of the top football clubs worldwide. This collaboration has significantly boosted BlockDAG’s presence in the market. The partnership enhances visibility, engaging millions of soccer enthusiasts globally and leveraging Inter Milan’s robust social media influence. This venture between BlockDAG and Inter Milan is paving the way for new opportunities and potential for its community. It is set to accelerate BlockDAG’s progress toward its ambitious $600M presale goal. With $180 million already secured, early participants have enjoyed a remarkable 2380% ROI since the first batch. Priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is fast becoming a community favorite, holding over 17.8 billion coins. The next strategic step for BlockDAG is listing on premier exchanges, aimed at enhancing liquidity, expanding market access, and drawing institutional interest. With a mainnet launch planned for 2025, BlockDAG’s price could soar to $1. This presents a pivotal buying opportunity for those seeking significant returns. BlockDAG’s steady success through its presale phases highlights its growing demand and trust among buyers.As BlockDAG continues to evolve and advance, it is establishing itself as a top trending crypto currently. Emerging Leaders in the Crypto Space Ethereum (ETH), Hedera (HBAR), and BlockDAG (BDAG) are at the forefront of today’s cryptocurrency market with significant developments. Ethereum’s price prediction remains robust, solidifying its stature as a leading cryptocurrency, while Hedera presents opportunities for traders during its price consolidation stage. BlockDAG, however, is particularly notable for leveraging its partnership with Inter Milan to enhance its global visibility and credibility. With over $180M raised and a 2380% ROI for initial buyers, BlockDAG’s growth narrative is compelling. As it targets its $600M presale objective and anticipates robust growth post-listing, BlockDAG is poised to redefine the standards of a top trending crypto by 2025.

Chainlink’s price has neared a critical support level that could determine its next big move. On the other hand, Tron’s rapidly growing ecosystem and re-entry to the U.S. market have positioned it for a promising 2025 bullish outlook. The spotlight shines brightly on Remittix (RTX), whose presale momentum has continued to gain traction after its price increase to $0.0199 from its starting price of $0.015. Its unique, innovative PayFi protocol and high growth potential have captured attention, as analysts expect the new token to challenge existing giants in the crypto landscape in the next bull cycle. Chainlink (LINK): Bullish or Bearish Trends in 2025 After a disappointing year, the LINK token saw a dramatic 200% rally in November, only to pare off these gains in the December downturn. This has left LINK struggling to regain footing in 2025. The token has been hovering near its critical support level at $23, a pivotal area determining its next leg up. A breakdown below this level would invalidate its bullish prospects and potentially set the stage for a bearish trend for the year. Conversely, a breakout above this key resistance level could see LINK crypto test or hold this level before continuing higher. It would confirm that the previous breakout was a deviation if it fails to close above this level. Its technical indicators highlight declining momentum. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped below 70, and the MACD has formed three consecutive lower momentum bars. While its weekly chart casts doubt, Chainlink’s daily chart offers a more optimistic outlook. It indicates that the LINK price is on track for its fourth wave of a five-wave upward movement that started in August 2024, which is usually a correction. The sub-wave count has tipped towards the possibility of another dip, which could complete the sub-wave c. The most likely bottom is around the $17.95 and $20.45 levels. Once Chainlink’s price completes wave four, it is expected to rebound as wave five begins. A more apparent target will be established once wave four is completed. Why Tron Standouts As A Strong Player in 2025 Tron (TRX) has been on track to enter the price recovery phase of the macro bull run. Its robust Web3 ecosystem, which boasts over 7.2 billion in total value locked (TVL) and over 58 billion in the stablecoins market, has well-positioned Tron crypto as a promising player for 2025. Notably, the launch of the meme coin launchpad, SunPump , has increasingly bolstered Tron network’s revenue and active addresses. The network has also entered the U.S. market, highlighted by Justin Sun’s advisory role in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , which could further strengthen its position. Its USDD decentralized stablecoin was also recently upgraded to version 2.0 beta on the Tron network, enhancing stability and offering users a robust and reliable platform. Over the past two years, TRX price has risen steadily, with significant momentum gained since November 2024. Its bullish breakout from its ATH pushed optimism in its ecosystem, rallying beyond the $0.44 level in 2024. Despite the general market decline, the TRX token is expected to find support at the $0.20 level. A breakout from this level could trigger a rebound. With a rapidly growing ecosystem and its re-entry to the US market, the TRX coin is positioned for a promising 2025 outlook. Remittix Attracts Worldwide Attention After Being Dubbed “XRP KILLER” Remittix (RTX) is developing a new platform for international fiat currency transfers using advanced payment systems. This platform will allow users to instantly convert 40 different cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and send them to any approved global bank. It thrives in simplicity; recipients receive payments in their chosen fiat currency without knowing the transaction originated as a crypto payment. Unlike conventional banking with extra charges, Remittix utilizes a peer-to-peer approach with no hidden charges outside the flat fees. Besides crypto-to-fiat features, Remittix offers Pay API that enables businesses to accept cryptos as a form of payment from clients and settle transactions into any approved global bank. To ensure security, all transactions on the Remittix platform are stored in a public ledger, enabling transparency and traceability. Moreover, all transactions are immutable and tamper-proof, reducing unnecessary chargebacks. Remittix has followed advanced security protocols and frequent audits from SolidProof and BlockSAFU blockchain security firms, assuring its users of its reliability as a secure PayFi solution. Meanwhile, the RTX token will power significant processes within the ecosystem, including governance and staking. RTX holders will earn up to 8% APY rewards when they stake their tokens. For investors seeking to take their earnings to the next level, Remittix offers a VIP tier program that rewards users based on their investments. Tier three investors, for example, have voting privileges and earn as much as 18% APY. Investors Flock Into Remittix Presale With the next bull cycle approaching, Remittix has signaled itself among the best potential crypto investments for 2025. This ambition is backed by the over $2. million revenue it has raised in just a few weeks of its ongoing presale.

Meanwhile, a new rival, Remittix (RTX), is threatening to oust both with its revolutionary PayFi protocol, which is set to reshape financial transactions in the decentralized space. So as these projects tussle it out, who will prevail in the next quarter? Avalanche Dips 25% In 30 Days No stranger to the blockchain world, Avalanche (AVAX) is a proven network architecture that has long been embraced by blockchain enthusiasts for its fast and flexible architecture. Nonetheless, recent price dips have rattled Avalanche (AVAX) holders, who saw their shares drop by 25% in the last month. This leaves Avalanche with a 5.4% net loss over the last 12 months. Despite Avalanche’s impressive architecture, such as its unique Avalanche consensus which allows near-instant finality and thousands of transactions per second, some have complained that Avalanche (AVAX) lacks the modern features needed to keep pace with new projects. Looking forward to 2025, Avalanche plans to upgrade its Subnet architecture with automated scaling features so developers can deploy and manage decentralized applications on the Avalanche (AVAX) network. Sui Sees Gains Following Introduction Of The Sui Bridge Sui (SUI) powered through 2024 and continues its upward trend into 2025, having seen a 8.6% monthly price increase and a further 5% price jump in the last week. The recent addition of the Sui Bridge has enabled asset transfers between Sui and Ethereum while improving the level of interoperability within Sui’s ecosystem. Sui has also laid out its plans for 2025. Perhaps most notably, Sui plans to release the SuiPlay0X1 Handheld Gaming Device, aiming to integrate Web3 gaming with mainstream platforms like Steam and Epic Games, thereby expanding its ecosystem and user engagement. These technological advancements could see Sui (SUI) carve itself a niche in the Web3 space as it seeks to broaden its utility. Remittix Reaches Lofty Heights In Presale While Avalanche and Sui capture headlines, Remittix is preparing to steal the spotlight with its groundbreaking PayFi protocol. Positioned as a game-changer in global remittances, the PayFi protocol combines blockchain’s transparency with cutting-edge security features to offer seamless, instant cross-border payments. Unlike traditional remittance systems that involve high fees and long processing times, PayFi ensures real-time settlements with minimal costs. Beyond payments, the Remittix ecosystem integrates tools for compliance and anti-money laundering (AML), providing a robust framework for institutions and individuals alike. RTX tokens will fuel this ecosystem, ensuring liquidity and incentivizing user participation. The protocol’s focus on both retail users and institutional adoption could disrupt the global financial landscape, making Remittix a project to watch closely. Remittix’s vision extends beyond remittances, aiming to bridge the gap between blockchain and real-world financial applications. The modular nature of the PayFi protocol allows easy integration with different financial systems enabling future scalability and adaptation. Addressing pain points such as inefficiencies within traditional banking systems and limited access to affordable finance, Remittix is helping underserved communities worldwide. Remittix Poised To Disrupt PayFi In 2025 Remittix (RTX) is currently seeing dominance in its presale, with tokens on offer for a ripe price of just $0.0199. As utility-focused projects are becoming more of a focus in the crypto space, Remittix stands out for its ability to solve real world problems, and analysts predict a steep price gain of 800% in the presale alone. As it positions itself to dominate the lucrative cross-border payments space, Remittix is not a project to miss out on in 2025.

A Washington Post politics reporter has revealed that Trump plans to issue crypto-related executive orders on his first day in office, signaling a dramatic shift in regulatory priorities. The move comes as part of a broader effort to reshape the regulatory landscape, with significant contributions from leading venture capitalists (VCs) and technology leaders. Marc Andreessen, a prominent figure in the venture capital community, has reportedly been deeply involved in the hiring and interviewing of candidates for key roles in the administration, including positions at the Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. The collaboration reflects what insiders call a “Small Tech” agenda that aims to spur innovation by reducing restrictive regulations. Early victories on that agenda include the appointment of artificial intelligence and crypto chief David Sacks, who has been working with industry leaders on legislative strategies. Related News: Bad News for Binance and Changpeng Zhao from the U.S. - At Least 7 Altcoins Involved Sacks also pledged to repeal his controversial AI executive order in 2023, a move applauded by Andreessen Horowitz and other influential VC firms. The repeal is expected to be part of a broader effort to align federal policies with industry interests, particularly in the areas of AI and cryptocurrency. A key issue expected to be addressed in the Day One executive orders will be the de-banking of cryptocurrency companies. The orders could also repeal a controversial accounting policy that requires banks holding digital assets to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheets. “The Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority,” said a source familiar with the talks. The upcoming swearing-in ceremony is expected to draw significant attention from the tech and crypto communities. Another prominent VC, Peter Thiel, is reportedly planning a celebratory event, while a “Crypto Ball” is planned for later in the week. *This is not investment advice.

The incidents involved the official accounts of Litecoin, Foresight Ventures, and Holoworld AI being compromised to promote fraudulent cryptocurrencies and phishing links, exposing users to potential scams. The Incidents On January 11, Litecoin confirmed that bad actors had accessed its official X account, saying: “Litecoin’s X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published.” The attackers shared content promoting fake Litecoin tokens linked to the Solana blockchain. One reportedly read, “LTC is now in Solana.” It also included a contract address and a link to a scam token on Pump.fun. According to the update, the posts were deleted within seconds. The team also said it had identified a compromised delegated account as the source of the breach, which has since been removed. It also apologized for any confusion caused, notifying users that investigations into the incident are ongoing. Foresight Ventures also suffered an attack on Saturday. In that incident, hackers used the company’s account to promote a token called MingAI, which was described as an AI-powered crypto assistant. To build credibility, the bad actors also shared links to the token’s contract, a trading tracker, and a Telegram group. Min Xue, a partner at the company, acknowledged the incident, telling followers on X: “We regret to inform you that Foresight Ventures’ account has been compromised by hackers in the past 12 hours.” She advised users not to engage with any posts or click on links shared during the breach and reassured them that the issue was being addressed. Holoworld AI was another target. On January 10, suspected scammers posted misleading information about an airdrop for AVA tokens on its profile. “AVA Distribution Event 1, The Q1 Distribution is based on your current holdings and on-chain activity,” the fake post read. It also directed users to a portal to check allocations and claim tokens. In an update , the firm announced its X profile had been fully restored after quick action and assistance from BrainchainLLC. The team also reported that the phishing links and tweets were repeatedly flagged and taken down, with the attackers using sophisticated tactics to retain control. Holoworld also revealed that it had implemented enhanced security measures across platforms following a security audit to prevent future incidents. A Broader Issue The recent string of hacks is part of a broader rise in phishing attacks targeting crypto users on the social media platform. Research from Scam Sniffer, a blockchain security firm, indicates that phishing attacks reached unprecedented levels in 2024, causing approximately $494 million in losses and compromising more than 330,000 crypto wallet addresses. The firm attributed most of these incidents to impersonation accounts, which lured unsuspecting users to malicious websites through deceptive comments and private messages. Additionally, on-chain investigator ZachXBT previously reported that between November and December last year, a single hacker breached over 15 X accounts, stealing more than $500,000. However, to fight back against the growing menace, Binance recently announced that it had prevented more than $129 million from being lost to scams in 2024 using artificial intelligence and machine learning. The crypto exchange said it identified and blacklisted 47,000 malicious addresses, issued 15,000 daily alerts, and made over 30,000 phone calls warning users of potential harm.

The move comes after Tether obtained its second Salvadoran Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license in 2025. Tether Secures Operating License: Why El Salvador? The company announced this decision on January 13, citing El Salvador’s favorable regulatory environment and growing adoption of Bitcoin. In the statement, Tether mentioned that it had acquired a license to operate as a digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer in the Latin American nation. Tether has announced that the entire Tether group is going to be relocating and will now be HQ'd in El Salvador *TETHER WILL RELOCATE TO EL SALVADOR AFTER SECURING DASP LICENSE — db (@tier10k) January 13, 2025 Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, described the move as a strategic step for the company. Ardoino said; “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets.” He added that the relocation aligns with Tether’s financial freedom and innovation vision. “By rooting ourselves [in El Salvador], we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but is also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies.” Tether also announced plans to support renewable energy initiatives in El Salvador, including geothermal energy projects powered by the country’s volcanoes. These projects aim to enhance the nation’s energy infrastructure and ensure sustainable crypto mining. Ardoino has publicly supported El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele and his initiatives, sharing messages on social media encouraging investment and residency in the country. Move to El Salvador Europe has obnoxiously criticized El Salvador in the past few years and yet today it really feels that the once cradle of freedom and democracy is slowly falling into dark ages again. https://t.co/NiNml3Y79Y — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) August 25, 2024 Other Tether executives, including Chief Operating Officer Claudia Lagorio, have also invested in real estate in El Salvador and became citizens in 2024. The relocation follows a similar move by Bitfinex Derivatives, which recently obtained a DASP license in the country. Can Bitcoin Adoption Deliver for El Salvador? Bukele’s Candid Take El Salvador has gained attention in the cryptocurrency world since adopting Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021 under Bukele’s leadership. The government has embraced policies aimed at increasing tourism and attracting foreign investment. A 2024 report from Santander US Capital Markets highlighted the rise in tourism, attributed partly to the country’s Bitcoin-friendly policies. Tether plans to collaborate with the Salvadoran government and local businesses to expand financial access and promote the use of stablecoins. The company aims to enable businesses and individuals to transact using decentralized financial solutions supported by its USDT stablecoin. President Nayib Bukele, who was reelected in 2024, has described Bitcoin adoption as a positive development for El Salvador. However, in an August 2024 interview, he acknowledged that the benefits have yet to materialize fully. Bukele’s administration has also focused on expanding international relations through digital asset collaborations, including a recent agreement with Argentina and ongoing discussions with over 25 countries to promote global crypto adoption. Despite facing criticism over alleged human rights abuses and detentions of political critics, Bukele’s government has earned praise for policies credited with reducing crime rates. As of December 2024, El Salvador held over 6,000 Bitcoins , valued at more than $550 million at the time. And for Tether, it remains the largest stablecoin issuer globally, with over $137 billion in USDT circulation.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS.

While several multi-billion-dollar ecosystems such as ai16z and Virtuals have emerged over the past three months, these frameworks primarily target developers. Moemate differentiates itself by providing a platform where both technical and non-technical users can create highly capable AI agents. One such agent, Nebula ($Moe), has gained significant recognition as an internet celebrity. Moemate enables anyone to create and operate sophisticated AI agents without technical expertise. Moemate agents feature advanced capabilities including the ability to see the screen or through the camera, cross-platform presence across X / Telegram / Discord, integration with AR/VR and video games, with ever-increasing on-chain and off-chain skills like trading and using other applications. The platform focuses on entertainment and media, allowing users to build engaging AI personalities and content, and for businesses to build on top of. The AI agents currently showcased in the market often face limitations, including a lack of contextual understanding and accessibility, as they generally require advanced technical expertise to develop. “Moemate embodies our vision of a truly accessible AI agent ecosystem,” said Chris, Co-Founder of Moemate. “We’re proud to have built and scaled a complete infrastructure that serves millions of users daily. The launch of $MATES marks an exciting new chapter that will accelerate AI agent development and create opportunities for our vibrant community of creators and innovators. Moemate will revolutionise the future of media.” Moemate provides tools for both non-technical creators and experienced developers to design AI agents capable of enhancing applications in entertainment, media, creativity, and productivity. These agents can function as virtual assistants, companions, and internet personalities, with features that include AR/VR interaction and gaming capabilities.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 539,600 followers on the social media platform X that the crypto king could fall below $90,000 if it fails to hold the $91,000 level as support. However, the trader says the crypto king still has a chance to avoid such a scenario. “Bitcoin dropped into the range low of $91000 (blue) and even briefly rebounded from there. But price is once again back at the range low and even downside deviating below it for the time being. A daily close below $91,000 followed by a turning of it into new resistance would send [its] price into the $87,000-$91,000 range. However, this confirmation is not in and Bitcoin still has the entire day to preserve $91,000 as support by daily closing above it. Bitcoin remains in the $91,000-$101,000 range until confirmation proves otherwise.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital goes on to note that while BTC reclaimed the $91,000 zone as support earlier today, it still needs to close out the day above it to confirm it. “Bitcoin has reclaimed $91,000 as support. However, Bitcoin needs to daily close just like this to confirm the reclaim. This just shows that lots can still change throughout the day and that the upcoming daily close will be quite important in dictating the next move.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital concludes his analysis by saying that Bitcoin is in the fourth week of a price discovery correction. Historically, the trader says these types of corrections only last a month. “The first Bitcoin price discovery correction is in progress. They generally tend to last 2-4 weeks. This current retrace has been going on for 4 weeks now lengthwise, history therefore suggests this correction should be in its final stages.” BTC is trading for $91,767 at time of writing, a 3% decrease on the day.

The recent AAVE integration rolls out the V3 lending protocol on the Aptos testnet, a landmark expansion beyond Ethereum’s borders. Simultaneously, a mysterious $27M Dogecoin transfer to Binance has whipped up speculation around whale activities, capturing the attention of market watchers. Meanwhile, BlockDAG ‘s appeal is skyrocketing among developers due to its dual compatibility with EVM and WASM, enhancing its flexibility. Industry analysts are betting on its tech prowess as a key catalyst for growth, with forecasts seeing BDAG hitting $1 in the upcoming months. As the 2025 mainnet launch nears, the network’s robust $180 million presale is quickly advancing toward a colossal $600 million target. AAVE Integration Launches V3 on Aptos Testnet Aave Labs has kicked off its V3 lending protocol on the Aptos testnet, marking an exciting first step of AAVE integration outside Ethereum’s realm. This pivotal test phase is set to assess the security and effectiveness of AAVE V3 on the Aptos blockchain, which leverages the innovative Move programming language. Despite a recent near 10% drop in token value following the AAVE integration, Aave’s 2024 revenue trajectory remains robust, with December figures reaching a stellar $60.9 million, close to its 2021 zenith. Dogecoin Transfer Ignites Whale Watch A staggering $27M Dogecoin transfer to Binance has ignited intense speculation about possible whale maneuvers and their market implications. The transfer, involving 70 million DOGE from a newly minted wallet, has been under the close surveillance of platforms like Whale Alert. Market experts are dissecting the potential impacts of this Dogecoin transfer, with crypto analyst Ali Martinez signaling a possible price adjustment following Dogecoin’s 16% spike last Friday, which was shortly followed by a moderate decline. BlockDAG’s EVM & WASM Compatibility Charts Path to $1 by 2025 BlockDAG is rapidly becoming the go-to for developers, thanks to its seamless support for both the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and WebAssembly (WASM) frameworks. This potent combo promises unmatched flexibility and scalability, empowering developers to craft a wider array of decentralized applications (dApps). The integration with EVM ensures compatibility with Ethereum-based projects, while WASM boosts the execution speed and efficiency of smart contracts. Additionally, WASM supports coding in languages such as Rust, C, and C++, which broadens the developer pool and accelerates project development. This synergy between EVM and WASM positions BlockDAG as a top contender for high-performance applications. With the blockchain sphere expanding, BlockDAG’s capability to interface with diverse ecosystems sets it up perfectly to cater to the escalating demand. Industry visionaries believe BlockDAG’s tech strengths will significantly influence its growth trajectory, with projections placing BDAG at $1 by 2025. With BDAG’s price currently at $0.0248 in its 27th presale batch, the potential for substantial returns is palpable as the presale progresses and we edge closer to the mainnet unveiling. Moving forward, BlockDAG’s trailblazing technology is expected to underpin its swift ascent, establishing it as a top crypto project by 2025 and a dominant force in the blockchain arena. As dApp utilization spikes and the call for more efficient execution intensifies, BlockDAG is equipped to lead as the supreme network for developers. Who Will Be the Top Crypto Project in 2025? While Aave V3’s integration on the Aptos testnet broadens its ecosystem, the token’s recent decline paints a complex picture. Concurrently, the notable $27M Dogecoin transaction to Binance has sparked talks of potential whale influences, with some analysts anticipating a market correction for DOGE. Amid these unfolding scenarios, BlockDAG emerges as a formidable player in the blockchain field. Its capacity to integrate with multiple ecosystems prepares it to meet the growing demand for robust, high-performance platforms. With a substantial $180 million presale already underway, a solid technological base, and potential to hit $1 soon, BlockDAG is poised to be the top crypto project of 2025.

38913604,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-adoption-outlook,1736802000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Bitcoin ETFs: Better year or sophomore slump?,https://blockworks.co/news/bitcoin-etf-adoption-outlook,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . After hitting the one-year anniversary of US spot bitcoin ETFs launching, Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart told me that even the more bullish firms behind these products were surprised by the reception. Matt Horne, Fidelity Investments’ head of digital asset strategists, confirmed to me as much. He referenced demand exceeding the company’s “optimistic” expectations across retail investors, advisers and institutions. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) — with $12.2 billion of net inflows — trails only BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) in that category ($37.7 billion). But is the bitcoin ETF market due for a sophomore slump? Fidelity has so far had “productive conversations” across all client segments when it comes to rising bitcoin ETF usage in 2025, Horne explained. He also said about the 16-year-old asset: “A longer history will allow for continued portfolio research and a stronger understanding of investors’ risk tolerance and bitcoin’s role in a portfolio.” Horne mentioned the “adoption spectrum” of various client types. Related, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said during an X space Friday — using terms from Geoffrey Moore’s “Crossing the Chasm” — that we’re stepping out of the early adopter phase and into the “early majority.” Then, borrowing Winston Churchill’s words to describe bitcoin ETF adoption, Horsley added it feels like we’re at “the end of the beginning.” Exploring bitcoin as an opportunity remains “on the to-do lists” across firms within the $30 trillion US wealth management sector , he noted. But as Zacks Investment Research’s Neena Mishra told me Friday, whether BTC ETF inflows in 2025 can match/beat last year is likely to hinge on performance. US bitcoin funds suffered outflows of $569 million and $149 million on Wednesday and Friday, respectively, (markets were closed Thursday to honor Jimmy Carter) amid the BTC price plunge mentioned earlier. Casey brought up the possible US strategic bitcoin reserve — something Seyffart said would drive ETF demand. But a BTC pullback (and outflows) could come if Trump and the pro-crypto Congress fail to execute on crypto-related promises. “Though as more traditional investors use these ETFs, they will likely be a support on bitcoin’s price as they rebalance in downtrends by buying more,” Seyffart said. “Conversely, they will also likely be sellers in uptrends as they rebalance to their target allocation levels over the longer term.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

In a new article, IntoTheBlock says that the government is going to sell $6.5 billion worth of BTC associated with the Silk Road, a defunct online black market that was shuttered over a decade ago. “The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is about to make a significant move in the market, potentially shaking things up with the sale of a large chunk of Bitcoin. These funds are directly tied to the infamous Silk Road, the dark web marketplace shut down in 2013 for its role in facilitating illegal transactions.” According to IntoTheBlock, massive BTC sales have hurt Bitcoin’s price in the past. However, this time around, the crypto analytics platform expects the market to simply soak up the selling pressure without any major setbacks. “In the past, significant government Bitcoin sales have caused notable market fluctuations. As this substantial volume enters the market, traders are on high alert for a possible downturn in Bitcoin’s value. This sale, which has not yet been executed, appears manageable for the Bitcoin market which regularly processes daily trading volumes in the tens of billions of dollars. While the DOJ’s planned liquidation represents a significant amount of Bitcoin, the market could absorb this selling pressure without major disruption.” The crypto king is trading for $94,341 at time of writing, a marginal during the last 24 hours.

It’s the latest step in a push to become a global publishing powerhouse. According to a Bloomberg report , CEO Kim Changhan said that South Korean gaming giants are broadening their lineup of original content and continuing some of their years of work in artificial intelligence. Since Kim took over, the company’s AI team has hired 80 engineers and is looking to add another 35 this year. The 50-year-old engineer and executive, Kim, said, “We have ambitious plans to scale our business.” He said Krafton has spent about $680 million in the past two years investing in minority stakes in game studios and startups in Texas and Tokyo. The company’s shares in Seol have soared over 70% since the start of 2024 after it reached record-breaking revenue in the first nine months of the year. Source: company filings, Bloomberg. Also a partner of Tencent Holdings Ltd, it produces and operates one of the world’s most successful gaming franchises and derives almost all its income from outside of Korea. In the third quarter, the company achieved an operating margin of 45%. Krafton’s future is built on AI Krafton and Nvidia Corp. revealed a new AI feature for making non-player characters (NPCs) more realistic at CES in Las Vegas last week. Known as a “co-play character,” NPCs will change the way they behave depending on a player’s attributes and situation. The feature, based on Nvidia’s small language model, will launch in Krafton’s Inzoi life simulation game in early access form for PC in March. Krafton is trying to bring similar AI features to the PUBG franchise. While the game can be playable on systems without advanced graphics cards that can accommodate AI, Krafton is still working to avoid any pesky compromises. The PUBG developer plans to expand in India Both Kim and Krafton founder Chang Byung-gyu, graduates of two of Korea’s best schools of engineering, said they have increased investments in India. PUBG was banned from the country in 2020, and Krafton stepped in to take over publishing responsibilities. The game returned in 2023. Now, the PUBG developer has 100+ people dedicated to growing its business in India. More than 1,000 gaming studios have been evaluated and met with Krafton. It has acquired EF Games, based in Madrid; Tango Gameworks, located in Japan; Ruckus Games, located in Texas; Wolf Haus Games, located in Montreal; and Day 4 Night Studios, based in the United States.

Notably, Web3 technologies, like blockchain and crypto, have seen a user growth average of 80% annually, far above the internet’s 33% yearly growth in its initial years. Impressively, by the end of 2025, it’s anticipated that over a billion users will have embraced crypto! This swift uptake underscores the significance of projects that are spearheading this shift. It’s widely discussed that a significant number of people are gathering around these four leading cryptos: Web3Bay, Artificial Super Intelligence, Arweave, & Chainlink. Let’s look into how these projects are shaping Web3’s future and the potential benefits they offer to people. Web3Bay: Transforming Online Shopping with High Return Potential Web3Bay (3BAY) is recognized among the best-performing cryptos, revolutionizing online shopping. It has established a decentralized e-commerce platform utilizing blockchain technology. By accepting cryptocurrency for payments, Web3Bay guarantees that transactions are safe, clear, and free from centralized oversight. This platform allows users to keep full control of their data while benefiting from perks like a 5% discount on purchases made with 3BAY coins. Moreover, Web3Bay’s community-led governance model allows every user a say in its future direction. Web3Bay’s presale data is quite telling of its initial success. Through just three presale stages, the platform has garnered over $630,000 and distributed more than 175 million coins. The current price of 3BAY tokens at stage 3, just $0.0039675, marks it as an accessible option for those looking to experience the advantages of decentralized platforms. Early backers of the 3BAY token are even positioned for a potential 6,340% ROI by its launch, underscoring the platform’s growth and profit potential. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance: AI Joins Crypto The Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASI) is advancing rapidly by merging artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its recent collaborations with top tech firms underline its expanding role across sectors like healthcare and finance. These partnerships reflect the Alliance’s commitment to bringing sophisticated AI features to decentralized platforms, which make solutions smarter and more efficient for everyday challenges. Yet, this progress isn’t without its trials. A recent 21.63% price fall, bringing ASI’s value to $1.33, reminds us of the volatility present in this area. Despite this, ASI’s practical applications keep it among the top web3 cryptos currently. Arweave: A New Way to Store Digital Content Arweave’s “permaweb” provides a novel way to permanently store digital content. Since its 2018 debut, Arweave has become vital in protecting digital archives by emphasizing decentralization. Recent partnerships with Web3 projects like 4EVERLAND underscore its role in the blockchain realm, establishing a secure, enduring data storage framework. Even with Arweave’s solid ecosystem, a recent 28.39% price drop to $15.49 points to challenges in maintaining market trust. Still, Arweave’s innovative storage concept ranks it among the best-performing cryptos, attractive to those valuing decentralized data solutions. Chainlink: Facilitating Blockchain Network Connections with CCIP Chainlink has turned into a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, thanks to its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This innovation facilitates smooth interactions among various blockchain networks, addressing a major challenge in decentralized finance (DeFi). Furthermore, Chainlink’s proof-of-reserve services increase transparency for stablecoins and tokenized assets, a function that has become increasingly important across sectors. Despite a 10.53% price reduction over the last month, Chainlink continues to be a leading figure in the Oracle sector. Its inventive solutions and expanding collaborations cement its status as a project to keep an eye on among the top web3 cryptos. Best Performing Cryptos- Final Say The projects discussed here exemplify the innovation and utility powering the Web3 movement. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance is at the forefront of AI and blockchain integration, Arweave secures the future of digital storage, and Chainlink facilitates blockchain network connections with its advanced tools. However, Web3Bay stands out among the best-performing cryptos with its novel approach to decentralized e-commerce and a successful presale raising over $630,000. Web3Bay’s secure transactions, community-focused model, and cost-effective entry point make it a top pick for those looking to capitalize on Web3’s expanding reach!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While DOGE and XRP could turn $750 into $1m by 2030, Rexas Finance has the potential to do it by 2026. Table of Contents The power of real-world asset tokenization DOGE and XRP Why RXS dominates Conclusion The crypto market constantly evolves, but some projects stand out for their ability to disrupt the status quo. While tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP capture attention, waiting until 2030 for massive returns is no longer necessary. Rexas Finance (RXS) emerges as a game-changer, promising remarkable growth by 2026. With a unique approach to real-world asset tokenization, cutting-edge tools, and a strategic presale structure, RXS is reshaping investment opportunities. The power of real-world asset tokenization Rexas Finance seeks to transform how people invest in tangible assets by bridging blockchain technology and the physical world. Through tokenization, assets like real estate and gold will become accessible to everyone. Investors will be able to own a fraction of a global property portfolio with minimal effort. Imagine a professional in Asia owning part of a restaurant in Europe, earning steady passive income. The possibilities extend beyond investing. Owners can tokenize and sell their assets to a global audience, maximizing value and liquidity. Rexas’s token builder will simplify this process, enabling anyone to create tokens for their assets. The platform will also include a launchpad to help users raise funds for new tokens, democratizing access to capital. Rexas Quickmint Bot and GenAI will enhance accessibility further, while the AI Shield will ensure security. Rexas Finance aims to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain networks, positioning RXS as a leader in tokenization innovation. DOGE and XRP DOGE and XRP have earned their reputations, but their growth projections pale compared to RXS. DOGE’s meme-driven culture and XRP’s banking sector focus limit their scalability. Neither offers direct access to tangible asset ownership like RXS. DOGE relies on community-driven hype while XRP’s adoption hinges on institutional partnerships. By contrast, RXS democratizes wealth creation, giving retail investors tools to participate in lucrative markets. You might also like: Cardano’s ADA targets $8, but analysts insist a rival under $0.20 could get there first Why RXS dominates Rexas Finance operates as an ERC-20 token, ensuring compatibility and trust. With 1 billion total tokens, its allocation balances accessibility and growth. 42.5% of the supply is dedicated to the presale, with a notable $35,908,583 raised so far. Marketing, staking pools, liquidity, and partnerships are strategically funded, ensuring robust support. The public presale, unlike VC funding, allows investors worldwide to join the project.

38913003,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=642771,1736802482,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38913003.jpeg,"Ethereum falls under $3,000 as bears gain more territory – The crypto market is in trouble",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-falls-under-3000-as-bears-gain-more-territory-the-crypto-market-is-in-trouble/,"Ethereum just can’t catch a break. The top altcoin nosedived below $3,000, slicing through this key psychological level like butter. It’s down 8%, leaving $100 million worth of realized losses in its wake. Panic selling is in full swing, and all eyes are now on the $2,817 support level. If that cracks, Ethereum could be headed for even darker days. Coinglass data shows $182 million in Ethereum futures liquidations in the last 24 hours. Long traders got absolutely wrecked, accounting for $152.5 million of those liquidations. Shorts weren’t entirely safe either, with $29.84 million wiped out. Add to that the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio dipping below -10%, and there’s a faint signal of a potential price rebound. Historically, MVRV levels this low have been where ETH found its footing. But this market doesn’t do optimism well, at least not right now. Ethereum ETFs are bleeding, and investors aren’t happy The carnage isn’t limited to direct ETH trading. U.S. Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had a brutal week, recording their largest outflows since July. Over $186 million poured out in a clear sign that even institutional players are losing their nerve. BlackRock stood alone, pulling in $124.1 million in net inflows, but that’s just one bright spot in a very dark landscape. The Network Realized Profit/Loss metric adds another layer of misery. Investors cashed out $100 million in losses in just 24 hours. That’s a lot of red for one day. Yet, oddly enough, the Mean Coin Age metric—tracking how long ETH sits in wallets—has been creeping up. What does that mean? Some brave souls are buying the dip, hoping for a bounce. But whether that’s genius or folly will depend on what happens next. ETH’s technical patterns are adding fuel to the bearish fire. A rounding top and double-top were completed before the token plummeted below $3,000. The $2,817 support level, which held strong between April and July, is now the market’s last hope. If it fails, Ethereum could plunge further into uncharted waters. Bitcoin drags down crypto and tech stocks Ethereum isn’t the only one bleeding out here. Bitcoin, the big brother of crypto, briefly slipped under $90,000 before clawing back to $92,177.79. That’s a 9% drop for the week. And Bitcoin even touched $89,259 at one point. The crypto market as a whole is on shaky ground. Tech stocks linked to crypto are also in trouble. Coinbase shares dropped 4%. MicroStrategy, which holds a mountain of Bitcoin, fell 3%. Mining firms weren’t spared either—Mara Holdings slid 6%, and Core Scientific lost 4%. The sell-off is part of a broader market reaction to stronger-than-expected payroll numbers that pushed bond yields higher. Add President Donald Trump’s tariff plans into the mix, and the dollar has gained strength, putting even more pressure on risk assets like crypto. Coming into 2025, crypto enthusiasts were pumped. A pro-crypto Congress and White House sounded like a dream. That hype overshadowed any concerns about macroeconomic hiccups. But last week’s events have changed the narrative. Investors are bracing for a rocky first quarter as market turbulence shows no signs of easing. Bitcoin’s stellar 120% gain in 2024 feels like a distant memory now.

Binance, the powerhouse of crypto exchanges, continues to expand its ecosystem with tools for traders and developers alike. Tron, on the other hand, is leading the charge in decentralized content and entertainment. But there’s a rising star that’s taking the blockchain world by storm: Qubetics ($TICS). Qubetics combines cutting-edge blockchain features with practical tools that cater to businesses, professionals, and everyday users. At the heart of its innovation is QubeQode IDE, a revolutionary tool designed to streamline blockchain development. This presale-stage project is rapidly gaining traction, raising over $9.5 million and selling more than 417 million tokens to over 14,300 holders. Let’s dive into what makes these three coins stand out and why they’re the best coins to buy this month . Qubetics ($TICS): Empowering Blockchain Developers with QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform built to drive the future of blockchain development. Currently in its 17th presale stage, Qubetics has already made waves, offering $TICS tokens at just $0.0501. But it’s not just the presale success that’s turning heads—it’s the platform’s focus on providing practical, user-friendly tools for blockchain innovation. One standout feature is QubeQode IDE, an integrated development environment tailored for blockchain programming. For developers, this tool is a game-changer. Imagine coding for multiple blockchain ecosystems—Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana—using a single platform. QubeQode simplifies the process, offering pre-built templates, debugging tools, and cross-chain deployment capabilities. Let’s put this into perspective. A small tech startup looking to launch a decentralized app (dApp) could save weeks, if not months, of development time using QubeQode. It eliminates the steep learning curve typically associated with blockchain coding, making it accessible to both seasoned developers and newcomers. Qubetics doesn’t stop at development tools. Its partnership with SWFT Blockchain ensures seamless cross-chain asset transfers , enhancing the interoperability of the platform. This makes Qubetics a one-stop solution for anyone looking to build, deploy, and manage blockchain applications. By addressing real-world challenges in blockchain development, Qubetics is setting a new standard for innovation. It’s not just a coin; it’s an ecosystem designed to empower the next generation of blockchain builders, making it one of the best coins to buy this month. Binance: The Titan of the Crypto Ecosystem Binance is a household name in the crypto industry, and for good reason. As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, it’s more than just a trading platform—it’s an entire ecosystem designed to cater to every type of crypto enthusiast. At its core, Binance offers unmatched liquidity and trading volume, making it a favorite for both beginners and professional traders. But the real magic lies in its ecosystem. From Binance Launchpad for new token sales to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for dApps, the platform provides endless opportunities for users and developers. Consider Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain that rivals Ethereum with its low fees and fast transactions. It’s become a hub for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces. Developers flock to BSC because it offers scalability without compromising security, making it ideal for high-demand applications. For traders, Binance offers tools like futures, options, and staking, catering to a wide range of investment strategies. Imagine being able to trade, stake, and participate in new token launches—all from a single platform. It’s this all-in-one approach that keeps Binance at the top of the crypto game. Despite regulatory challenges in some regions, Binance has shown resilience, continuously expanding its services and adapting to new markets. Whether you’re a developer, trader, or long-term investor, Binance remains a cornerstone of the crypto ecosystem and one of the best coins to buy this month. Tron: Pioneering Decentralized Content and Entertainment Tron has carved out a unique niche in the crypto world by focusing on decentralized content and entertainment. Founded by Justin Sun, Tron’s mission is to revolutionize the way we consume digital media, making it more accessible and rewarding for creators and users alike. What sets Tron apart is its emphasis on decentralization. Unlike traditional platforms like YouTube or Spotify, where a few corporations control the flow of content and revenue, Tron puts power back into the hands of creators. Through its blockchain, artists, musicians, and developers can distribute their work directly to audiences without intermediaries taking a cut. Let’s say you’re a musician looking to release an album. With Tron, you can tokenize your music, allowing fans to purchase and stream directly from you. This not only increases your earnings but also creates a more authentic connection with your audience. Tron’s high throughput and low transaction costs make it ideal for this type of application. Its blockchain is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second, ensuring a seamless experience for users and developers alike. The network has also embraced decentralized finance, offering platforms for lending, borrowing, and staking. Its active community and ongoing development make it a strong contender in the crypto space, and for anyone looking to support decentralized innovation, Tron is one of the best coins to buy this month. QubeQode IDE: Revolutionizing Blockchain Development Before wrapping up, let’s take a closer look at QubeQode IDE and why it’s a game-changer for blockchain development. Blockchain coding can be intimidating, especially for newcomers. Each ecosystem has its own set of rules, languages, and protocols, creating a fragmented experience. QubeQode simplifies this by offering a unified platform where developers can write, test, and deploy smart contracts across multiple blockchains. Here’s how it works: QubeQode provides a suite of tools, including code templates, debugging features, and a user-friendly interface, making it accessible even for non-coders. Developers can focus on creativity and functionality without getting bogged down by technical complexities. Imagine a freelance developer creating a cross-chain app that connects Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem with Binance Smart Chain’s NFT market. With QubeQode, this process becomes streamlined, saving time and resources while ensuring compatibility. For businesses, QubeQode opens doors to blockchain adoption. Small and medium enterprises can deploy blockchain solutions without needing a team of specialized developers, lowering the barrier to entry and accelerating innovation. QubeQode IDE is more than a tool; it’s a catalyst for growth in the blockchain industry, solidifying Qubetics’ position as a leader in the space. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Stands Out Among the Best Coins to Buy This Month While Binance dominates the crypto ecosystem and Tron redefines digital content, Qubetics is paving the way for a new era of blockchain development. Its QubeQode IDE addresses one of the industry’s biggest challenges, making blockchain accessible, efficient, and user-friendly. With over $9.5 million raised and more than 417 million tokens sold, Qubetics is proving to be more than just hype—it’s a transformative force in the crypto world. If you’re searching for the best coins to buy this month, Qubetics ($TICS) deserves a spot on your radar. Don’t miss the chance to be part of a project that’s shaping the future of blockchain technology.

The partnership aims to provide access to stablecoins that comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. Circle Joins Forces with Bison Digital Assets for MiCA-Compliant Stablecoins According to a recent report, Circle has integrated its USDC and EURC stablecoins into Bison Digital Assets’ platform. The collaboration ensures that transactions meet the regulatory framework set forth by MiCA. These regulations will standardize cryptocurrency activities within the EU. Additionally, USDC and EURC are fully reserved stablecoins backed by liquid cash or cash-equivalent assets. These reserves are held at regulated financial institutions and undergo monthly third-party audits. This ensures that customers can redeem the stablecoins for their equivalent value in U.S. dollars or euros, offering both transparency and trust. Notably, the partnership comes as the EU’s MiCA and Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) Travel Rule take effect, aiming to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Circle’s Policy Head, Patrick Hansen, clarified misconceptions, highlighting that CASPs must now collect and exchange sender and receiver data for transactions over €1,000. These measures, including encrypted info sharing, enhance security and transparency in the crypto space. Enabling Secure and Regulated Blockchain Transactions The partnership allows Bison Digital Assets to leverage Circle’s issuance and redemption platform for deposits, withdrawals, and payments. This integration simplifies cross-border blockchain transactions by ensuring they are compliant, cost-effective, and secure. Circle has processed over $19 trillion in transactions since USDC stablecoin launch in 2018, reflecting its reliability and efficiency. The collaboration enables Bison Digital Assets customers to access faster and cheaper financial services. António Henriques, CEO of Bison Bank, emphasized the transformative potential of stablecoins in financial services. CEO of Bison Bank emphasized, “We are thrilled to establish this partnership between BDA and Circle, offering our customers regulated and secure stablecoins. We believe these will play a fundamental role in the future of financial services.” A Milestone in European Crypto Regulation Bison Digital Assets, known for being the first Portuguese bank to establish a crypto-focused subsidiary, is bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. The company’s Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license from the Bank of Portugal further strengthens its impact. Sanja Kon, Circle’s VP of Partnerships and Business Development in Europe highlighted the importance of this collaboration. Sanja Kon added, “This collaboration reflects our shared vision to enable the global movement of money in a secure, compliant, and internet-native way. By integrating USDC and EURC, BDA customers gain robust, seamless, and regulated digital payment solutions.” More so, the partnership comes just days after the stablecoin issuer announced its $1M USDC donation to Donald Trump’s inaugural fund. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire highlighted the move as proof of USDC’s growing acceptance, reflecting its role in mainstream financial transactions.

V2E는 커뮤니티 멤버가 거버넌스 투표를 행하면 암호화폐를 획득하는 탈중앙화된 거버넌스 유형을 제공한다. 신규 토큰이 계속 증가함에 따라 이 모델의 가치가 오를 것으로 예상된다. 보트투언 시스템은 프로젝트의 미래를 투자자들이 직접 설계하고 참여에 대한 보상을 얻을 수 있는 수단이며 암호화폐의 탈중앙화 정신을 새로운 차원으로 끌어올린다. 신규 토큰 늘어날 수록 V2E 가치 높아질 것 V2E 개척 프로젝트 플로커즈 는 V2E 메커니즘을 구현한 최초의 밈 코인이다. V2E는 커뮤니티 구성원($FLOCK 보유자)이 프로젝트의 경영 방식에 참여할 수 있도록 한다. $FLOCK 토큰은 보유자에게 프로토콜 업그레이드, 거버넌스 규칙, 파트너십 등 주요 결정에 대해 투표할 수 있는 권한을 부여한다. 게다가 투표를 하면 암호화폐를 보상으로 지급한다. V2E 메커니즘을 통해 보유자는 자신이 지지하는 프로젝트의 경영에 참여하고 그 과정에서 암호화폐를 획득할 수 있다. 플로커즈의 V2E 메커니즘은 밈 코인 시장에서 최초다. 미래에는 V2E 메커니즘이 암호화폐의 본질적인 가치인 ‘탈중앙화’에 충실하면서 밈 코인의 거버넌스에 그치지 않고 업계의 다양한 분야에서 프로젝트들의 표준으로 거듭날 수 있다. 플로커즈는 V2E를 최초로 선보이며 새로운 유형의 프로젝트들을 탄생시킬 수 있다. 이후 어떤 V2E 토큰도 $FLOCK의 선구자로서의 입지를 따라잡기 어려울 것이다. 플로커즈 런칭 예정 ··· 프리세일 8일 남아 기사 작성 당시 FLOCK 프리세일이 종료까지 8일 11시간 남았다.

38913588,https://nulltx.com/?p=138837,1736803409,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (January 13) – BTC Targets $85k For Short-term Correction But Now Looks Calm,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-prediction-january-13-btc-targets-85k-for-short-term-correction-but-now-looks-calm/,"Bitcoin’s lower low and lower high formation have stirred many bearish sentiments among swing traders, but the whales are still optimistic, as the market bias remains bullish in the long term. It is down 6% weekly. Bitcoin’s key support and resistance levels have remained intact over the past week. However, it attempted to resume bullish but failed to reclaim the previous high due to bearish interception around the $103k level. This led to another serious drag down, but the primary crypto managed to hold above the $91k level last Thursday. The bulls took advantage of the temporary hold and pushed back, but the $96k level posed a strong threat today and is now dropping—trading at $64k at the time of writing. Losing the mentioned holding level could trigger a serious dump into the rising trendline, which has been acting as diagonal support since August 2024. That area is a key entry point that the bulls patiently wait for. As seen on the daily chart, the support line has produced a bounce thrice. If the price respects this support line again, we can anticipate a strong buy capable of bringing the bulls back on track. A breakdown there may cause a serious decline, which could later bring an end in the bull run. That said, it is noteworthy to say that Bitcoin’s overall market structure remains bullish on the macro-outlook. The price must break above the previous high before confirming a bullish continuation. But as it stands now, the bears are in charge. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Dropping off $91,000, the next key support level to watch is $85,000, followed by $81,500 – sitting above the support line.

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Defies the Crypto Trend Today, January 14, 2025, while major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, are struggling, FARTCOIN has defied the market trend, surging 40% and topping the crypto market. Source: Coinglass Current Price Momentum FARTCOIN has experienced a massive price surge after witnessing a decline of over 57% and finding support at the $0.75 mark. With a significant surge in the past 24 hours, FARTCOIN is currently trading near $1.06, attracting considerable attention from traders and investors, resulting in a 145% jump in trading volume. However, some investors see FARTCOIN as the next BONK or Dogwifhat (WIF) as it builds on the Solana blockchain. Rising Open Interest (OI) This rise in interest has not only increased trading volume but also boosted FARTCOIN’s open interest (OI), as reported by the on-chain analytics firm CoinGlass. Data revealed that the newly launched meme coin’s OI has surged by 44% in the past 24 hours, indicating a buildup of new open positions. However, this significant price rally has led to the liquidation of $2.11 million worth of traders’ open positions, with $1.90 million coming from short sellers and only $0.30 million from long positions. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, FARTCOIN has successfully found support at the $0.75 mark and has broken out of a trendline it had been facing since the beginning of January 2025.

The court found the SEC’s denial of Coinbase’s 2022 rulemaking petition “arbitrary and capricious,” finding it “unsufficiently reasoned.” As a result, the court granted Coinbase’s petition in part and remanded the case back to the SEC for more comprehensive clarification. “We appreciate the court’s careful consideration,” Grewal said, noting that Judge Bibas agreed.

Bitcoin momentarily broke the all-important $100,00 level, a near 500% recovery from the 2022 Crypto Winter lows, and optimism for crypto is even reaching Congress, where talks of a U.S. National Bitcoin Reserve are gaining serious steam. If stock market bull runs are marathons, crypto bull runs are breakneck sprints. But buyer beware: when crypto surges and FOMO takes hold, scammers seize the moment, turning hype into a goldmine for illicit activity. With no clear regulatory framework yet in place, the risks are amplified. As former President Trump returns to office with a more pro-crypto Congress, regulatory change feels imminent. But what risks do investors face if enforcement measures are not adequately funded? The 2024 election results could mark a pivotal chapter in crypto’s history. Can the new Trump Administration rise to the challenge to not just unlock greater innovation in crypto, but also better protect its users and investors? Why Enforcement and Protection Should Still be a Priority Crypto bull runs are often accompanied by a surge in scams and fraud. In 2023 alone, a period of rising prices, the FBI’s Crypto Fraud report showed that there was $5.6 billion in reported losses tied to crypto scams and fraud. A staggering 70% ($3.9 billion) of these losses stemmed from investment scams. While phishing scams are prevalent in a digital world, the tenfold rise in Bitcoin ATM scam losses from 2020 to midway through 2024 paints the issue in a tangible way . $65 million in just the first six months of 2024 was stolen via Bitcoin ATMs, with the average loss at about $10,000 according to the Federal Trade Commission. Collectively, these figures show the financial damage and expose gaps that must be addressed to protect consumers and deter bad actors – especially if crypto is going to continue to gain traction and popularity. The U.K. has shown how government policy can adapt to address the rise in crypto-related crime directly. In 2024, legislative updates were made to allow law enforcement to more effectively investigate, seize, and recover illicit crypto assets . Key measures include allowing asset seizures without prior arrests, confiscating investigation-related items like passwords, transferring assets to law enforcement-controlled wallets, destroying certain cryptoassets like privacy coins when necessary, and enabling victims to reclaim their funds. The challenge is finding a balance between the measures implemented in the U.K., while also ensuring the privacy and sovereignty of crypto users. To maintain its reputation as a global leader in financial regulation, the U.S. must establish frameworks that foster innovation while safeguarding market participants from bad actors, and refocus efforts on investigating criminal activity. At the heart of the problem lies regulatory ambiguity, which has plagued the crypto industry for years. In 2024, despite spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs gaining approval, enforcement actions against major crypto institutions intensified, something critics cite as a contradictory approach to oversight. This uncertainty stifles innovation and leaves companies struggling to navigate an inconsistent regulatory landscape. For the incoming Trump administration, there is an obvious starting point to solving high-level compliance issues: creating a clear division of responsibilities between agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to eliminate regulatory overlap or opaque rules. But that only partially solves the larger problem. Protecting Investors Protects Crypto’s Growth Potential Compliance frameworks are only as strong as those investigating and enforcing them. Effective compliance requires investment — not only from individual companies but also from enforcement agencies. If nobody is there to enforce the rules, bad actors have little to fear. Historically, regulatory agencies have lacked the specialized resources necessary to oversee the fast-evolving digital assets landscape, especially at the state level. The Trump administration now has an opportunity to prioritize investment in specialized enforcement capabilities, equipping agencies with the tools, talent, and technology to stay ahead of sophisticated bad actors. For example, this could involve creating deeper channels for law enforcement collaboration and facilitating public-private partnerships to monitor and prevent illegal activities in the digital asset space. It could also significantly reduce the heavy-handed enforcement approach currently being applied to the crypto industry. By allocating funds to train personnel and develop resources tailored to digital assets, agencies can better track, investigate, and prosecute illicit activities. Additionally, public and private investments in blockchain analytics tools could enable more effective tracking of transactions, deterring bad actors and aiding in asset recovery in cases of fraud. This bolstered enforcement strategy would not only protect consumers but also enhance the legitimacy and reputation of the U.S. digital asset market on the global stage. What will crypto look like under a pro-crypto President and Congress? To me, the future is exceptionally bright. However, the way forward will require active dialogue, strategic investments, and a commitment to collaboration between industry leaders and regulators. This moment has the potential to redefine the digital asset landscape in the U.S., setting a high standard for the world.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-13 21:26:08

The court found that the SEC’s decision to deny Coinbase’s 2022 petition for rulemaking on crypto and securities regulations was “arbitrary and capricious,” according to Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal Coinbase’s petition requested the SEC establish rules to clarify how securities laws apply to digital assets. The SEC denied the petition in 2023 without providing a comprehensive explanation, prompting Coinbase to appeal. A three-judge panel ruled that the SEC’s denial lacked sufficient reasoning and ordered the agency to reconsider and provide a detailed explanation for its decision. “We properly remand to the SEC to explain itself; it should not give yet another poor explanation in an already-long line of them,” the court stated . While the ruling did not require the SEC to initiate new crypto-specific rulemaking, it emphasized the harm caused by regulatory uncertainty.

According to the court, sporadic enforcement of regulations that are poorly suited to digital assets targets the entire industry and poses a risk of effectively banning it. This decision adds to the growing judicial scrutiny of the SEC’s stance on digital assets, with courts increasingly calling for greater transparency and clarity in the agency’s approach to crypto regulation. We further appreciate Judge Bibas' concurrence, in which he speaks forcefully about the looming constitutional concerns ""with ex post enforcement without announcing ex ante rules or guidance."" It's an impressive piece of work. 2/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 13, 2025 Coinbase and other crypto firms have long argued that current securities regulations do not adequately address the unique nature of blockchain-based technologies, creating significant compliance challenges for the industry. Last week, Coinbase received a significant legal opportunity to contest claims made by the SEC. Judge Katherine Polk Failla from the Southern District of New York approved Coinbase’s request for an interlocutory appeal, which temporarily halts the ongoing court proceedings. An interlocutory appeal allows a party to challenge a specific legal issue before the entire case is concluded. In this case, Coinbase will seek a ruling from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on the validity of the SEC’s allegations against it under current securities laws.

A temporary hold in that range brought a little relief but is now losing momentum amid fresh market drops today. Ethereum started this month strong as the entire crypto market recovered from late last month’s shockwave that sent several altcoins to a new multi-week low. The recovery brought a little relief for the bulls as they aim to resume a fresh rally, but their hope was short-lived last week. A lot has happened since then as Ethereum initiated another major sell from $3,745 after a three-week recovery. The $3,158 level provided support with a slight bounce and the price consolidated around $3,300 for three days. It rejected $3,339 today and slowly lost momentum. It just dropped off $3,200 amid rising supply and now aims to retest the $2,810 level that flipped as key resistance during last November’s surge. However, the monthly $3.1 low is considered a close support to watch as it will likely pose a threat on the way down. A strong hold above it could trigger a bounce capable of restoring the bullish action. However, the current bearish pattern appears to be shaping the phase of the market daily as the price declines. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Losing the $3.1k low could drive us back to the crucial $3k level before retesting $2,810. Lower supports to watch for a broader retracement is $2,600 and $2,485. The $3,307 level is currently marked as resistance. An increase above it could trigger a recovery to the $3,550 and $3,830 resistance levels. The main resistance level for a break-up is $4,107.

To read full editions, subscribe . Donald Trump is yet to take office, but the presumed increase in crypto M&A deals under his presidency already appears to be underway. Crypto on- and off-ramp platform MoonPay has acquired Solana payments startup Helio in an all-equity deal valued at $175 million, Helio CEO Stijn Paumen confirmed today. Paumen added that the entire Helio team will be joining MoonPay. There could be more M&A action on the horizon, especially in the emerging field of crypto payments. Two other founders in the crypto payments space confirmed to me that they’ve seen recent acquisition interest. MoonPay is a popular service for users trying to purchase crypto using bank accounts, credit cards or PayPal. Helio is more e-commerce focused, most recently making headlines for its Shopify plugin that lets merchants accept payments via the Solana network. In acquiring Helio, MoonPay is showing an aspiration to expand beyond buying and selling crypto into providing infrastructure for people to pay for goods and services with crypto, Ben Mills, CEO of the on-ramp company Meso, told me. By combining forces, MoonPay is becoming one of the most vaunted outfits in onchain payments, Paumen said. MoonPay’s Helio deal is one of the crypto sector’s more notable recent acquisitions, joining Stripe’s October purchase of the stablecoin infrastructure company Bridge for a reported $1.1 billion. It feels notable that both of these deals involved crypto payments — which is the technology’s original use case but not one that has caught on very broadly just yet. Crypto still believes in payments. In Lightspeed’s recent Solana Founders poll, a plurality voted that payments are Solana’s most underrated sector. Still, how big of a deal this all is remains a matter of perspective. Stripe buying Bridge was a validation for crypto because Stripe isn’t a crypto company, Mills said. The intra-industry deal of MoonPay buying Helio “feels more like internal consolidation which is probably healthy, but doesn’t tell us much,” he added.

With a market capitalization of more than $50 billion, this meme-inspired coin—which is presently trading at around $0.34—has grown to be a key participant in the cryptocurrency market. Given recent price swings, many are guessing about the direction of Dogecoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction Historical Patterns And Future Growth There is considerable cause for excitement around Dogecoin. Analyst Cephii has concentrated on historical trends, particularly the notable 1,107% increase in Dogecoin following the January 2021 inauguration of US President Joe Biden. Cephii speculates that something like this could occur following Donald Trump’s January 20, 2025 election. History will most likely repeat itself, hence the value of Dogecoin will grow significantly and reach roughly $4.15. Last cycle, $doge pumped about 1100% a week after inauguration. Interesting.

In contrast to previous administrations, his victory has already positively influenced the whole crypto market. The values of other cryptocurrency assets, including Dogecoin, surged immediately upon the confirmation of Trump’s victory. Market Predictions And Sentiment Market sentiment about Dogecoin is caution and optimism all mixed together. While some analysts would call for a more cautious approach to pricing, others join Cephii in his bullish stance. There are vast variations in predictions of the future price of Dogecoin, with some even hitting modest increases while others believe the meme coin has a big chance of reaching $5. The latest 14% increase has been primarily credited to large investors, or “whales.” This is an indication of a rising confidence that Dogecoin will soon cross the much-anticipated $1 threshold. The Bitcoin Connection Investors in the volatile cryptocurrency market need to be ready to deal with a wide range of challenges and opportunities. While some analysts are pessimistic about Dogecoin’s long-term prospects, experts like Cephii are bullish on the prospect of significant price gains. Though Cephii’s research points to a fascinating potential for value growth, investors should proceed with care due to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.

In the current market, artists and writers often get only a small share of the profits. TRON wants to change that by connecting creators directly with consumers. This means no middlemen like YouTube or Facebook taking a cut. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, allowing anyone to build and share content. In today’s market, TRON stands out by focusing on rewarding creators directly. With its own network and support for dApps, it offers an alternative to platforms like Ethereum. As more people look for decentralized solutions, TRON’s approach could become more popular.

This makes Kaspa’s network fast, currently processing one block every second, with hopes to reach ten or even a hundred blocks per second in the future. In the current fast-paced crypto market, speed and efficiency are key. Kaspa’s unique approach could give it an edge over other cryptocurrencies that struggle with slow transaction times. Features like easy network querying and data pruning make it even more appealing.

According to local media outlet Prime, the surge is due to the country’s decision to legalize Bitcoin mining in 2024. Bitcoin mining became legal in Russia in November 2024 after President Vladimir Putin signed a law legalizing the activity in late 2024. The law settled years of regulatory uncertainty around mining activity and enabled the industry to thrive in the country . According to data from the Hashrate Index , Russia ranks second in Bitcoin mining, accounting for 16% of the global hashrate market share as of December 2024. This is significant from the 4.66% hashrate share from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance data. The growth in the Russian Bitcoin mining sector is unsurprising, given its energy resources and the flexibility of its new mining law. Under the law, any individual or entity using less than 6,000 kWh per month for mining BTC does not have to register, while those using more must register. Beyond allowing mining, the country also amended its tax law to accommodate BTC mining with a 15% tax imposed on mined assets based on their value at the time of mining. With this regulatory clarity, industry experts claim that there has been renewed interest from individuals and institutions within the country in investing in Bitcoin mining. Serge Bezdelov, the director of the Industrial Mining Association, told Prime that Bitcoin mining has provided an opportunity for asset diversification. He said that interest in mining Bitcoin is not just from residents but also from foreign investors, including those in the BRICS countries. Nevertheless, Russia continues to balance its need for energy security with Bitcoin mining and exercise caution regarding Bitcoin mining. Its ban on Bitcoin mining in the six North Caucasus regions and seasonal restrictions in four other regions went into effect on January 1, 2025. Bank of Russia imposes reporting regulations on foreign transactions of crypto Despite the permissiveness of crypto and Bitcoin in Russia, regulators still maintain a tight grip on activities, particularly foreign transactions. The Bank of Russia recently published new regulations that require the registration of contracts for foreign trade that involve digital rights. According to the regulations that became effective on January 11, digital rights include electronic records like cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and tokenized securities. With the regulation now in place, residents of the country have to register any foreign trade contracts that involve digital assets with an authorized bank. However, there is a reporting threshold of 3 million rubles ($29,197) for imports and 10 million rubles ($97,352) for exports. By having a threshold, the regulator aims to maintain its oversight without imposing an unnecessary reporting burden on businesses and individuals. The regulation reads: “Foreign trade contracts, including those providing for settlements using digital rights, must be registered with authorized banks. The thresholds for the registration of these contracts remained unchanged.” Meanwhile, regulations, policies, and even public statements from Russian authorities over the past year highlight how the country has changed from ambivalent about crypto to finding ways to enable the industry. This is likely influenced by the plethora of Western sanctions against it due to its invasion of Ukraine and its desire to become less reliant on the US Dollar by adopting BTC. The country’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, revealed a few weeks ago that its companies are using Bitcoin for cross-border transactions.

Among the many innovations that have emerged, meme coins have gained significant traction, capturing the hearts and wallets of investors around the world. These playful tokens, often inspired by internet culture, not only provide a sense of community but also offer unique investment opportunities that can yield impressive returns. As the market continues to mature, the role of meme coins in shaping modern economies is becoming increasingly clear. In recent years, meme coins have surged in popularity, often turning casual investors into crypto millionaires. Take Dogecoin, for example. Initially launched as a joke, it has transcended its origins to become a serious asset, proving that even the most whimsical ideas can yield substantial profits. Now, BTFD Coin is stepping into the spotlight, ready to take meme coin popularity to new heights. With its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game , an enticing referral program, and a staggering 90% annual percentage yield (APY) on staking, BTFD Coin is not just a meme; it’s a serious investment opportunity.

The move aligns with the country’s goal to position itself as a hub for cryptocurrency trading, according to CEO Paolo Ardoino. Alongside the company's relocation, Ardoino and other co-founders will also move to the country. El Salvador made headlines three years ago when President Nayib Bukele declared Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. Now, Tether is leveraging this crypto-friendly environment after receiving a digital asset service provider license in the country. Ardoino emphasized this would mark the company's first-ever physical headquarters , though most of Tether's 100+ employees will continue working remotely. Previously, Tether operated from the British Virgin Islands. Stablecoins, including Tether's USDT, have become a critical link between cryptocurrencies and traditional financial markets. Designed to maintain a steady value by pegging to fiat currencies, they facilitate crypto transactions without exposing users to volatile price swings. Tether's USDT accounts for roughly two-thirds of the $212 billion stablecoin market, which has grown by 45% over the past year, according to CoinGecko data. However, this rapid growth has attracted scrutiny from regulators, who are concerned about potential risks to the broader financial system. Stablecoins, acting as a bridge between crypto and mainstream markets, could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed. Tether has faced criticism for limited transparency regarding its reserves but maintains that the majority of its holdings are in U.S. Treasury bills managed by Wall Street brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald. ""The vast, vast majority of the T-bills are in Cantor,"" Ardoino said, with additional liquidity held in other banks. To address regulatory concerns, Tether has stepped up monitoring of its token usage to prevent illicit activities. While exploring options for its headquarters, Ardoino noted the company does not hold a license in the European Union and currently has no plans to operate from the United States. He described the U.S. as an unlikely location, citing regulatory uncertainties and noting it was ""quite premature"" to speculate on changes under a Trump presidency. Trump’s election has fueled optimism in the crypto sector, with promises of a more favorable regulatory climate and plans for a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve. The relocation reinforces El Salvador's ambitions to attract global crypto players. Tether’s presence will likely boost the country’s visibility as a crypto hub. Despite concerns from regulators, the firm continues to play a pivotal role in the stablecoin ecosystem.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-13 21:58:58

Experts have found that this includes many well-known people, firms as well as key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the crypto industry. OpenSea Breach According to the latest update shared by SlowMist’s pseudonymous chief information security officer, “23pds,” the leaked data included the email addresses of numerous crypto industry professionals, such as Binance founder and former CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao. 23pds tweet read, “The amount of leaked data reached 7 million, including a large number of email information of overseas cryptocurrency practitioners, including many well-known people, companies and key opinion leaders (KOLs) in the industry, which may pose further threats to the privacy and asset security of the cryptocurrency industry in the future.” OpenSea – which happens to be one of the largest NFT marketplaces in the world – initially alerted its customers to the breach on June 29, 2022, during which it identified that an employee of Customer.io, its email automation vendor, had leaked the email addresses to an external party. Customer.io later confirmed that the breach also compromised the customer data of five other companies, although it did not disclose their identities. Although the breach took place more than two years ago, this information wasn’t publicly disclosed until recently, allowing attackers to exploit it for phishing and scams. Billions Lost to Phishing Attacks CertiK’s recent report revealed that phishing emerged as the most costly attack vector in 2024, which led to $1.05 million in losses from 296 incidents, including three cases where losses surpassed $100 million. This accounted for nearly half of the total stolen value that year and 39.1% of the total incidents, indicating that phishing generally results in higher losses per attack compared to other vulnerabilities. The blockchain security firm explained that phishing remains popular among attackers because it is simple and effective. It exploits human weaknesses rather than just targeting technical systems. Through deceptive emails, fake websites, or fraudulent messages, attackers manipulate users into sharing sensitive data like passwords, private keys, or wallet addresses. In the crypto industry, phishing is especially devastating due to the irreversible nature of transactions, as stolen funds cannot be recovered unless returned by the attacker. As such, quarterly losses from phishing were highest in the second quarter of 2024, recording over $433 million.
