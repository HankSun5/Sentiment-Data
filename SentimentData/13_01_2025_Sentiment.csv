Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:04:00

The response came after a user claimed that Litecoin's emergence and Charlie Lee's actions represented an early example of a pump-and-dump scheme. The user compared the project negatively to Solana, claiming that Charlie Lee founded Litecoin, set aside a significant amount of supply for himself, and sold it at the height of the 2017 bull run. The comment accused the Litecoin founder of using the project for personal gain and argued that Solana deserves more respect for his contributions to the crypto space. In response, the Litecoin team issued a detailed refutation, defending the project’s transparency, decentralization, and longevity since its inception in 2011. The team noted that Charlie Lee publicly announced Litecoin ahead of its launch, allowing the community to determine the launch date. Unlike many modern projects, Litecoin had no pre-mined supply, no initial coin offering (ICO), and no venture capital funding. Charlie Lee, like other participants, mined and purchased Litecoin and did not maintain a “founders stash.” He later sold his holdings in 2017 to avoid a conflict of interest while continuing to develop and defend the project. Contrary to claims, the team noted that Lee sold his Litecoin at an average price of $205, below the peak of the 2017 bull market. Related News: Famous ETF Expert Made 10 Predictions for the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 - “XRP, Solana...” The response detailed Charlie Lee’s ongoing financial and technical support for Litecoin: He has invested millions in Litecoin through the Litecoin Foundation and partnerships. He has supported marketing campaigns including collaborations with the Miami Dolphins, UFC and others. It holds its annual Litecoin Summit, costing $250,000 and up per event. He actively contributed to Litecoin's core code and encouraged its adoption among businesses and regulators. The team rejected comparisons to Solana and other projects, stating that Litecoin remains unique in its decentralization, lack of founder-controlled reserves, and lack of venture capital influence. They noted that Litecoin has consistently ranked in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap for over 13 years, despite market volatility and the collapse of thousands of other projects. In their closing remarks, the team questioned Solana’s main use cases and claimed that its ecosystem is frequently used to create tokens that are involved in scams and fraud. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s administration is promising to turn it into a cornerstone of US economic strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the same company holding over half a million Bitcoins valued at $52.81 billion through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has its own battles to fight — with regulators breathing down its neck. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) isn’t cutting BlackRock any slack. And Trump’s big Bitcoin plans? Let’s just say they don’t make things any easier for Mr. Larry Fink. But hey, at least BlackRock’s a Bitcoin whale now. BlackRock vs. FDIC Here’s what is going down with the FDIC. BlackRock was supposed to meet a January 10 deadline to address concerns about its influence on US banks. However, It didn’t. Instead, it asked for more time—until March 31—to review a proposed agreement, claiming it needed at least two more months. The FDIC wasn’t buying it. The agency not only rejected the extension but also added more demands. They want more transparency about how BlackRock makes decisions and details about its bank-related holdings. If BlackRock doesn’t act fast, things could get worse, and fast too. Sources familiar with the matter say the FDIC might issue subpoenas or take other mandatory actions to force the firm’s compliance. This isn’t a minor dispute. BlackRock’s sheer size, combined with its massive stakes in banks, has some regulators worried it could have too much control over the financial system. Jonathan McKernan, a Republican FDIC board member, and Rohit Chopra, the Democratic head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have both called for tighter oversight of big asset managers. Their main argument is that BlackRock could sway how banks operate, making them less independent. BlackRock’s defense has so far been calling the FDIC’s demands disruptive, arguing that new rules could wreck index funds—one of its flagship offerings—and make it harder for banks to raise cash. The company also says the FDIC needs to coordinate its efforts with the Federal Reserve, which already oversees its operations through a passivity agreement. Trump’s Bitcoin play Trump, along with Bitcoin-friendly figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis, is pushing for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Here’s the plan: Senator Lummis has introduced a bill proposing the US Treasury and Federal Reserve acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years. That’s 200,000 Bitcoins a year, adding up to about 5% of the total global supply. The goal? To reduce America’s reliance on traditional financial systems and keep up with rivals like China and Russia. Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the Satoshi Act Fund, spilled the details. The reserve would partly come from Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, giving the government a head start. Trump’s team believes this reserve could help stabilize the dollar while tackling the US’s enormous $36 trillion national debt. BlackRock, despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, isn’t on the same page. The firm has been making headlines for other reasons, like its withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). BlackRock pulled out of NZAMI on January 11, under pressure from Republican-led states that weren’t happy with its climate-focused investments. The company insists it will continue to consider climate risks in its investment strategies, but the decision shows how political tensions are forcing it to adapt.

On January 11, Mango Markets shared on its X account: “We are shutting down. It’s time for users to close their positions.” The decision follows governance proposals that unanimously supported adjustments to interest rates and collateral requirements, effectively terminating borrowing and lending services. These changes will take effect on January 13. SEC Settlement The shutdown comes after a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On September 27, 2024, the SEC filed charges against Mango DAO and the Blockworks Foundation for selling unregistered securities. According to the SEC, Mango raised over $70 million in August 2021 by selling MNGO governance tokens in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also accused Mango Labs of operating as an unregistered broker, breaching the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of the settlement, Mango DAO agreed to pay $700,000 in penalties, destroy its MNGO tokens, and request the delisting of these tokens from exchanges. “Since the inception of our crypto enforcement program, our view has been that the label ‘DAO’ does not change the reality of who is behind a project,” said Jorge Tenreiro, chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. Legal and Financial Struggles Mango Markets’ difficulties date back to an October 2022 exploit by crypto trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who drained over $100 million from the platform. Although Eisenberg returned $67 million as part of a governance vote, he kept $40 million. US authorities arrested Eisenberg in December 2022, charging him with fraud and market manipulation. He faces up to 20 years in prison, with his sentencing delayed multiple times due to legal complexities. Mango Markets was launched in August 2021, offering fast and affordable trading and lending services using its MNGO governance token. At the time of writing, the platform holds $9 million in total value locked, a sharp decline from its $210 million peak in November 2021, according to DefiLlama.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:24:01

Even more alarming is that these scammers don’t fit a specific profile or background. That’s precisely what happened to Ministerio Apostólico Profético Tiempos de Poder parishioners in Pasco, Washington, when they fell for a cryptocurrency scam run by their pastor. According to the US Department of Justice, the Eastern District of Washington has formally charged Francier Obando Pinillo , a 51-year-old Miami resident and pastor, with 26 counts of fraud. The DOJ released a document stating that the pastor masterminded a crypto scam from November 2021 to October 2023, costing unsuspecting investors millions of dollars. Solano Fi Came To The Pastor “In A Dream” Pinillo was the pastor of the Ministerio Apostólico Profético Tiempos de Poder in Pasco, Washington, with its Spanish-speaking congregation. According to the charge sheet, the scam was called “Solano Fi.” This was not your ordinary crypto scam that you’ve read many times online. According to multiple sources, the idea to offer a crypto investment came to Father Pinillo in “a dream.” Pinillo used the pulpit and his authority in the parish to sell the investment to his congregation, assuring that Solano Fi was safe and offered guaranteed payouts. The pastor reportedly dangled a monthly return of 34.9%, and to attract more investors, he ran a social media blitz. Pinillo allegedly launched a Telegram group, the “Multimillionarios SolanaFi,” with more than 1,500 members, and a Solano Fi Facebook page. Solano Fi Investment A Ponzi-Scheme According to investigators, investors lost their money while Pinillo’s personal wealth continued to increase. Instead of staking the funds, the authorities learned that they were funnelled into the personal accounts of the pastors and other scammers. Authorities also discovered that Pinillo offered a 15% Referral Bonus to motivate others to join and invest their money, creating a Ponzi-like program . Under this scheme, the pastor used the new investors’ funds to pay off the “profit” of earlier investors. Reasons Instead Of Profits Pinillo and his partners also launched an online platform that investors can supposedly check to track their investments. However, according to the DOJ, the online platform only showed fake balances and did not allow investors to withdraw their money. Investors’ woes worsened when they started to request payouts. After asking for their funds, they were often told that withdrawals were not possible because of a faulty website or a bearish crypto market. Some investors shared that Pinillo will only refund the investment unless they can bring in new investors to “buy out” the accounts. If found guilty, Pinillo will serve a maximum of 20 years.

Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-350000-top-crypto-influencer-makes-bold-prediction/,"Jeremie Davinci, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency domain, has garnered attention with his audacious forecast that Bitcoin may attain an extraordinary value of $350,000. This forecast, lately disseminated on social media, is predicated on historical trends and the present dynamics of Bitcoin mining expenses. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path The current expense for miners to generate one Bitcoin is approximately $70,000. Davinci indicates that historically, under positive market conditions, Bitcoin has frequently surpassed its mining cost by a ratio of five. This association indicates that, if historical trends persist, a price of $350,000 is feasible. The Cost Factor Of Mining The basis of Davinci’s approach is the relationship between mining costs and market price of Bitcoin. The mining process requires electricity and advanced technology among other resources. These costs build the basis for Bitcoin’s value as they rise. Currently spending over $70,000 to extract one BTC, miners may open the path for significant price increases in the future, claims Davinci. It costs miners about $70k to produce 1 #Bitcoin now, less with better hardware or cheap energy. In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has hit over 5x the mining cost. Huge potential ahead! — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 11, 2025 He underscores that this forecast lacks a defined timescale and instead embodies an optimistic perspective grounded in historical performance. He asserted, “Significant potential lies ahead!” in reference to Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bitcoin: Institutional Impact And Market Forces Davinci’s prognosis is set against a landscape of growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Prominent corporations have commenced the acquisition of substantial quantities of BTC, indicating assurance in its long-term growth prospects. Companies such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have made substantial investments in Bitcoin, contributing to the optimistic feeling around the cryptocurrency. In addition, the recent halving event in April 2024 cut the block payment for miners to 3.125 BTC. This made it harder for new coins to enter the market. Around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 2 million to be made. This could cause prices to rise as long as people want them. A Prudent Optimism Although Davinci’s projection is undeniably ambitious, it is crucial to regard such forecasts with prudence. The bitcoin market is famously unstable and can undergo significant fluctuations in value. Analysts have observed that although Bitcoin may realize considerable increases over time, it has also had huge corrections in previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead As we approach 2025 and beyond, numerous investors are closely observing how these dynamics will develop. The interplay between mining expenses, institutional acceptance, and market mood will be a major determining factor in ascertaining the feasibility of Davinci’s prediction. Bold predictions like Jeremie Davinci’s are being debated as the crypto market continues to evolve. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $350,000 reflects both reliance on historical trends and a sense of optimism.

Why BTFD Coin Is the Best New Meme Coin to Join for Short-Term Gains,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-sleeping-on-dogecoins-ico-why-btfd-coin-is-the-best-new-meme-coin-to-join-for-short-term-gains/,"When Dogecoin first launched, nobody could have predicted that a meme-inspired cryptocurrency would go on to make such a huge impact on the market. From being a fun and quirky joke coin, Dogecoin quickly rose to fame, attracting an army of passionate holders and garnering massive attention from celebrities and influencers alike. The ICO was priced so low that it was a goldmine for early investors, with some even making millions from what was once just a silly meme coin. With Dogecoin currently holding a place as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in the world, its price has seen explosive growth over the years, and its future seems to be filled with even more promise. But for those who regret not getting in at the right time, there’s still hope. Enter BTFD Coin—a new player in the meme coin world that’s making waves with its exciting presale numbers and its standout feature: a jaw-dropping 90% APY on staking ! The Missed Opportunity: Dogecoin’s ICO and Rise to Fame Let’s talk numbers. When Dogecoin first hit the market in 2013, its initial price was virtually pennies—$0.0002047 per coin. Early investors, especially those who believed in the coin’s fun-loving culture, watched their investments grow exponentially as Dogecoin became more mainstream. In fact, as of 2025, Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70 per coin. That’s a massive jump for a coin that started as a joke. With over $49 billion in market cap, Dogecoin’s growth has solidified its place in meme coin history. And while Dogecoin’s story is one for the books, many missed out on that golden opportunity. Investors who saw its potential too late are left with nothing but “what ifs” and “could’ve, should’ve, would’ve” thoughts. But don’t sweat it! The world of meme coins is far from over, and if you’re still hungry for that early investor magic, BTFD Coin could be your golden ticket.

The price for BTFD Coin is still incredibly affordable, making it a prime candidate for anyone looking to jump on a meme coin early, just like Dogecoin investors did. But it’s not just the presale numbers that should have you excited—it’s the insane 90% APY on staking! That’s right: by staking your BTFD Coins, you could be looking at some seriously juicy rewards. With staking rewards this high, BTFD Coin could provide you with a passive income stream while you hold onto your tokens , watching their value grow.

At the same time, Foresight Ventures’ X account was hacked, linked to $500,000 raised through 15 compromised accounts, showing rising security risks. Crypto hacks happen, but the market bounces back There has been so much hacking from the Mt. Gox hack in 2014 up to hacks on Litecoin and Foresight Ventures’ X accounts in 2025. Each hack is similar; it starts with chaos, breaking trust, and lowering the market prices. Time heals most wounds as prices tend to bounce back usually stronger than before. Litecoin’s official X account was hacked on January 11, 2025. An attacker released a fake token based on the Solana network, named using the ticker LTC, via the said account. Litecoin's X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published. These were live only for a matter of seconds before being deleted. We're still investigating the issue, but immediately found a delegated account that was compromised and removed… — Litecoin (@litecoin) January 11, 2025 A post including a Solana contract address and a scam link briefly propelled the fake token’s market cap to $27,000. The value of the token, however, cratered to $3,400 after a scam alert was published. The Litecoin team regained control, deleted the post, and removed the hacked delegated account. They assured users that investigations are currently being done on the issue. At the same time, hackers accessed Foresight Ventures’ X account. It was used for promoting fraudulent activity with cryptocurrencies tied to AI. Such a hack was alarming, as Foresight Ventures has close ties to blockchain and AI projects. Yet, the team acted fast: it issued warnings and solved the problem. At the end of December 2024, hackers broke into the Cardano Foundation’s X account. They falsely claimed a lawsuit with the SEC and sold a scam token called “ADAsol.” It has been reported that one hacker managed to raise $500,000 by exploiting more than 15 hacked X accounts for meme coin scams during late 2024 and early 2025. These hacks are often phishing emails masquerading as legitimate messages, tricking victims into sharing their credentials. Hacks have been a bane in the crypto industry for years. In 2014, the Mt. Gox hack resulted in over $450 million worth of Bitcoin being stolen, causing the collapse of what was then the largest exchange. The Bitfinex hack in 2016 led to the loss of 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time. In 2018, $530 million in NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck. Such occurrences demonstrate the impact hacks can have on the crypto market. In the case of 2020, hackers hijacked the Twitter accounts of influential people such as Elon Musk and Joe Biden, displaying them with fake Bitcoin giveaways. Although the financial loss was not too massive, it highlighted the need to protect influential accounts. In 2022, the hack of the Ronin Network targeting Axie Infinity stole $625 million and marked one of the biggest crypto robberies ever; it was said to question a centralized blockchain gaming ecosystem. The WazirX hack in 2024 joined the list of concerns regarding centralized exchanges. From hacks to altseason Most hacks lead to short-term market drops due to users panicking and withdrawing funds. These, however, happen at the worst time when the crypto market prepares for an altseason in which altcoins tend to do way better than Bitcoin. This might, therefore, be an opportunity for the market to get over such shocks and enjoy substantial growth. The attacks that Litecoin and Foresight Ventures experienced may be minor in comparison but show a possibility of going wrong in the crypto space. However, growth in the market may still be true, especially around the time of altseason and with bettering security in security. There is a bright long-term future for the crypto market. Whether hacks would be in the way of problems or growth will depend on whether these incidents can be studied and leveraged to improve security.

SUI ATH & ETC Poised for Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/get-6-on-every-purchase-with-blockdags-affiliate-program-sui-ath-etc-poised-for-growth/,"As we step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is teeming with potential. Key highlights include the anticipated rise in Ethereum Classic (ETC) price to $49.07 and SUI nearing a peak at $5.35, coupled with robust investor interest. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a notable layer-1 blockchain entity, rolls out its referral program, offering up to 10% in USDT rewards, significantly fueling the demand for its tokens. Here’s an analysis of these pivotal market elements to gauge the top crypto gem for 2025. Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Targeting $49 in 2025! Forecasting a significant upturn, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is predicted to escalate to a peak of $49.07 by 2025. Investors need a thorough technical analysis to navigate this potential. Currently, ETC is trading at $25.28, with market reactions mixed and a transaction volume of $326.06 million in the last 24 hours. Analysis of the weekly trends shows a bullish reversal, hinting at lucrative opportunities ahead. The coin might retest its highest resistance at $167, potentially triggering a bullish trend. Predictions suggest ETC’s price could oscillate between $22.38 and $49.07, averaging around $44.74. Will SUI Achieve a New ATH as TVL Soars? The SUI token recently marked a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.35, propelled by an upsurge across the market. Despite a significant rally of 10.39% and reaching new highs, SUI has since corrected to $4.59. Closing 2024 with a robust increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) from $1.75 billion to more than $2.6 billion in early 2025, SUI continues to draw attention. Initiatives like DeepBook V3 and Sui Bridge, along with institutional backing, have spurred this growth. The continued DeFi boom and SUI’s ATH underscore its strong market stance.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 22:01:00

These Bitcoin mining devices aim to simplify cryptocurrency mining for individuals while incorporating unique dual-purpose functionality. According to the official press release , the Avalon Mini 3 combines high-performance Bitcoin mining with home heating, boasting a hash rate of 37.5Th/s and a user-friendly app-controlled interface. Meanwhile, the Avalon Nano 3S is an upgraded version of the popular Nano 3 which features a hash rate of 6Th/s and is being marketed as a beginner-friendly entry point into Bitcoin mining . Key advantages of the products include a plug-and-play setup for ease of use and a focus on energy efficiency. The Avalon Mini 3 addresses environmental concerns by recycling computational energy into home heating, allowing users to offset energy costs while minimizing waste. Canaan CEO NG Zhang spoke about the company’s vision of combining practicality with sustainability and added, “The Avalon Mini 3 and Avalon 3S represent our vision of user-friendly, practical mining solutions for the modern individual. We’re reimagining how technology can create value while minimizing environmental waste. The Avalon Mini 3’s ability to generate cryptocurrency while heating your home is a perfect example of our vision for sustainable, multi-purpose technology.”​​​​​​​ Transforming cryptocurrency mining rigs into household devices is not a new concept. Back in 2017, Avi Aisenberg, who operated South Florida Distillers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, created a heating system that used ASIC miners to mine crypto while accelerating the rum-distillation process. In 2018, the French start-up Qarnot introduced the QC-1, a heater designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining.

Notably, Bitcoin has been unable to hold substantially above the $100,000 price level since it first broke through in early December, and multiple breakouts have been followed by rejections. The most recent rejection came last week when the price peaked at $102,000 on Monday, only to reverse sharply and fall to $92,000 by Thursday. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead This continued tug-of-war has brought the bearish case for BTC into sharper focus, with technical analysis highlighting a 50/50 chance of a further drop or a bounce. $90,000: A Pivotal Support Zone Under Threat Recent Bitcoin price action has significantly put the $90,000 price point as the most notable support level for the bulls. Although the crypto has largely held above the $90,000 support level even during the recent corrections, the bearish outlook hinges on its ability to defend this level. According to technical analysis by crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has made five different attempts to test a support trendline around $90,000, which further reveals the importance of the level. This repeated retest increases the chance of weakening the support strength and is gradually making Bitcoin more vulnerable to a sharp decline. With this in mind, the major task for Bitcoin bulls would be to hold above the $90,000 and break resistance levels above $100,000 in order to invalidate a bearish outlook. Should Bitcoin fall below $90,000, it could cascade to a further price drop to the $87,000 range or even lower. A fall below $87,000 could, in turn, cause a quick fall through a $12,000 gap to reach $75,000. Resistance Levels To Break: $103,000 To $108,500 As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin could continue to pose a bearish threat until it closes above a few resistance levels. These resistance levels are situated at $103,000, $106,400, and $108,500, and consistent daily closes above these thresholds are required to confirm a bullish trend. The third resistance of $108,500 is the most notable, as a break above it would see Bitcoin trading at new all-time highs. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, current technical indicators suggest that the chances of a pump are low at the moment. For instance, Bitcoin has now lost the support of the 21 EMA on the daily candlestick timeframe, and sentiment is now in a neutral zone on the Fear and Greed Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, the biggest factor that could see bullish momentum return to Bitcoin is the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th and the anticipated crypto-positive policies that during the new administration. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the event could either trigger a short-term rally or exacerbate the ongoing decline. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400.

Despite some circulating rumors, Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead, has confirmed no early launches occurred. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning decentralized e-commerce platform, has successfully exceeded $590K in its presale. This achievement signals its potential to reshape the future of online shopping, highlighting the evolving nature of web3 commerce. Uniswap Update: Anticipating the 2025 Launch of V4 Uniswap’s forthcoming V4 update is drawing community focus, with its release anticipated this year.

The Uniswap update will introduce the “Hooks” system, allowing developers to insert custom codes around swap functions. Although the exact release date is still under wraps, the anticipation around V4 confirms Uniswap’s leadership in the decentralized exchange arena. SHIB’s Leadership Addresses Misinformation Ahead of TREAT Launch In the latest SHIB news, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is preparing for the significant rollout of its governance token, TREAT, officially scheduled for January 14. Recent false claims about a secret launch two years ago have been refuted by Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous leader of the ecosystem. Kusama has emphasized the importance of community vigilance against potential scams using the TREAT name. Despite these challenges, the imminent launch of TREAT stands as a key advancement for the Shiba Inu community, promising new governance capabilities and enhanced utility.

Recently, FTX unveiled new details about its $16 billion creditor repayment plan , offering some clarity to those affected by its collapse. The plan prioritizes smaller creditors, with the first payments soon scheduled. This update marks the beginning of financial relief for many, causing anticipation to build among creditors and the broader crypto community. However, the challenges, such as phishing scams and unresolved legal disputes, still loom large. Small Creditors to Get Early Relief FTX’s bankruptcy reorganization plan emphasizes fairness, starting with creditors whose claims are below $50,000. These smaller creditors will share an initial repayment pool of $1.2 billion. This information was disclosed by FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri in an X post earlier today. FTX repayments Initial Distribution Schedule Claims Jan 20th: FTX has given until 20th Jan to fulfil pre distribution requirements for initial distribution Repayments likely won’t start before then Feb 25: Likely (up to 4th Mar) — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 12, 2025 The record date for these claims was set as January 3, with repayments expected to commence in February. To streamline the process, the trading platform has asked creditors to complete essential pre-distribution requirements by January 20. These include submitting W-8BEN tax forms and passing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Importantly, creditors have a 60-day deadline to file their tax forms or risk forfeiting their repayments. FTX has stressed the importance of meeting these requirements to avoid delays. Phishing Scams and Legal Confusion Add to FTX Worries While the repayment plan brings hope, it has also created new risks. A wave of phishing scams and fraudulent claim portals has been targeting creditors. FTX has urged caution, reminding stakeholders to verify all communications and rely only on official channels for information. In addition, unresolved legal issues are complicating the process. Claims surrounding the acquisition of FTX EU by Backpack have been flagged as inaccurate. FTX clarified that FTX EU remains fully owned by FTX Europe AG. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court oversees FTX’s Chapter 11 case and has not approved any share transfers. These legal disputes highlight the ongoing complexities in FTX’s path to recovery. A Boost for the Crypto Market? The repayment plan could have a significant impact beyond FTX creditors. Market analysts are optimistic that many creditors may reinvest their funds in the crypto market once repayments are distributed. Kraken recently offered selected creditors seamless ways to reinvest in the market, a no-fee trading initiative. This influx of capital and a favorable stance from the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration could trigger a rally for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. The crypto market, still reeling from the collapse of major exchanges like FTX, needs positive momentum. If the trading platform successfully executes its repayment plan, it could restore some confidence in the industry and set a precedent for managing future crises.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 23:22:00

Speaking to the Russian news outlet Prime , Sergey Bezdelov, the head of the Industrial Mining Association said that “in the fourth quarter of 2024,” the demand for industrial mining equipment and services in Russia “increased threefold compared to the same period in FY2023.” Bezdelov was speaking in the wake of comments from a top lawmaker who said Moscow was ready to “soften” its stance on crypto regulation. Crypto Mining Hardware a Hit in Russia? The Industrial Mining Association chief added that there was “also high interest” in Russian crypto mining projects “among foreign market participants.” The estimated percentage change in Bitcoin Mining difficulty over the past seven days. (Source: Dune/@mitchklee_) Bezdelov said that some of this “interest” in Russian crypto mining was now coming from “fellow BRICS member states.” In May last year, Bezdelov claimed that the Russian industrial crypto mining market “doubled in size” in 2023 . The expert hinted that recent legal changes had helped boost the popularity of mining in Russia. A law that came into force on November 1, 2024, allows both “legal entities” (private companies) and “individual entrepreneurs” (private citizens) to mine crypto “legally” if they do not consume more than 6,000 kWh of energy per month. “Individuals can mine cryptoassets without being included in a state-run register, but within the limits of the electricity consumption threshold. If they go beyond this threshold, citizens must register as an individual entrepreneur and apply for inclusion on the register.” Bezdelov With the help of a two-story clock in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, the Baltics are counting down the minutes until they leave Russia's energy grid on Feb. 8. https://t.co/eNgeDsdKGa — Bloomberg (@business) January 11, 2025 Crypto Taxes Incoming? At present, the register only requires companies and individuals to submit data on transactions and energy consumption. However, as the body that controls the register also operates Russia’s taxation system, it is highly likely that any miner using more than 6,000 kWh will soon have to pay tax on their earnings. However, Bezdelov noted that before last year’s legal change, crypto mining was in a “gray” legal zone. Until November, mining had no legal status. Now, however, Russian law recognizes it as a form of “entrepreneurship.” While Bezdelov and others have previously said that most (around 90%) of domestic miners focus their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC) , Cryptonews.com has seen evidence that suggests many Russian home-based miners prefer Ethereum (ETH) . Last year, Bezdelov said that Litecoin (LTC) is also popular among a smaller group of Russian miners. Litecoin prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Russian Media, Lawmakers Change Tune on Crypto The same media outlet wrote that mining is a “good source of additional income.” It added that Russian companies and individuals could use crypto as an “opportunity to diversify their assets.” It also suggested that firms could use the crypto they mine as a settlement tool “when conducting foreign economic activity within the framework” of the Central Bank’s sandbox. This type of positive talk about crypto was once almost unheard of in Russian mainstream media outlets.

And the Central Bank has led several attempts to issue a China-style crypto crackdown in Russia. However, President Vladimir Putin last year spearheaded a crypto pivot when he began to speak about crypto mining in glowing terms. And while many energy-poor areas have issued bans on crypto mining until 2031, Putin has urged other parts of the Russian Federation to mine crypto “if they have surplus energy.” Tax Boost The association has claimed that the Russian Treasury could expect to earn over $500 million per year from taxing crypto miners. Others claim that Russia’s desire to become an AI “powerhouse” has inspired Putin’s crypto pivot . Bezdelov advised Russian qualified investors to “allocate up to 5% of their portfolios to mining services and digital currencies.” China warmly welcomes the new addition to the BRICS family, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday, in response to Brazil, as the BRICS chair 2025, releasing a statement on Monday night announcing the official entry of Indonesia as a full member into BRICS.… pic.twitter.com/XqZycI9onG — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 7, 2025 Softer Crypto Stance Possible, Lawmakers Says Meanwhile, TASS reported that the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation has “allowed for the possibility of softer regulation” for domestic companies using crypto to avoid US, UK, and EU-led sanctions . The state-run news agency quoted Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, as explaining that crypto “market players” are complaining of “over-regulation” in the Central Bank’s sandbox. Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets. (Source: Secretariat of the World Russian People’s Council/YouTube/Screenshot) The Central Bank wants all Russian firms who use crypto as a payment tool to exchange coins using the sandbox, rather than dealing directly with overseas partners in crypto. “We need to quickly launch an experimental [sandbox]. We then need to see how the standards we have adopted in this market work. And then we can make further adjustments later. Quite possibly, we will move toward a softer regulatory [position].” Lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets Aksakov also said that firms are not happy with the Central Bank’s protocols. Many, it seems, think these protocols are over-complicated. The lawmaker said: “Many companies are suggesting that we need to somehow simplify the turnover of cryptocurrencies so that the market can develop successfully. As [crypto settlements] are new and mobile, this is proving to be the case.” The post Crypto Mining Hardware Sales ‘Triple’ in Russia as Moscow Teases ‘Light Touch’ Regulation appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto Mining|Russia,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-12 23:30:00

Travis Ford, 35, of Glenpool, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with his role as CEO, co-founder, and head trader of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC. The purported investment firm operated from January 2023 to August 2023, promoting itself through its website, social media, and other internet platforms.

Ford admitted that he knew such returns were unattainable but made promises to lure investors anyway. He misappropriated the funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, leaving investors with significant financial losses. The Justice Department announced the plea on Friday, Jan. 10, with Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Wible and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Inspector in Charge Eric Shen highlighting the fraudulent scheme’s scope. Ford now faces up to five years in prison, with sentencing to be determined by a federal district court judge. The court will consider the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors before issuing a final sentence. A sentencing date has not yet been set. The news came just two days after a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Washington charged a former pastor with 26 counts of fraud, alleging he masterminded a cryptocurrency scheme.

On January 12, several users in Singapore reported being unable to access Polymarket. Alex Zuo, Vice President of Investment and Custody at Cobo Global, commented on X: “Polymarket is officially defined as a gambling website in Singapore. If you want to place a bet, you can only go to a state-owned gambling company. Otherwise, you will face fines and imprisonment.” Users attempting to visit Polymarket are greeted with a warning under Section 20 of the Gambling Control Act 2022. The act imposes penalties of up to SG$10,000, jail terms of up to six months, or both for gambling with unlicensed operators. The warning from the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) reads: “You have attempted to access an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider. Singapore Pools is the only licensed online gambling operator in Singapore.” Regulatory Landscape The GRA, established on August 1, 2022, oversees all forms of gambling in Singapore. It was created by restructuring the Casino Regulatory Authority to address the changing nature of gambling products and services. Polymarket operates on the Polygon blockchain, allowing users to bet on global events using USD Coin (USDC). From January 1, the Singapore Police Force assumed enforcement authority for illegal gambling. According to the GRA, Singapore Pools is the sole operator licensed to offer remote gambling services. Violators face fines of up to SG$500,000 and imprisonment of up to seven years, with repeat offenders subject to harsher penalties.

FET Trends Look Uncertain While Chroma Drives Web3 Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-presale-tops-590k-fet-trends-look-uncertain-while-chroma-drives-web3-growth/,"Various market movements are drawing attention in the blockchain field. FET trends are showing mixed signals, with the possibility of surpassing the $1.71 resistance level, yet inconsistent network activities temper these gains. In parallel, the Web3 sector is expanding, enhanced by tools like Chroma’s Crocket app which simplifies blockchain interaction through enjoyable, cost-free activities, showcasing seamless integration of technology and practical usability. Concurrently, Web3Bay ‘s presale is performing well, accumulating over $590,000. This indicates its potential to innovate the traditional e-commerce sector by integrating decentralized blockchain technology with accessible crypto pricing, creating an inviting environment for participants in its growing ecosystem. FET Trends Surge By 25%: What’s Next? FET trends are capturing attention, having surged by 25% before descending to $1.29. This rise was a temporary boost, and a deeper analysis reveals possible bearish patterns that might affect its stability. The Price DAA Divergence, showing a mismatch between increasing prices and diminishing network activities, suggests impending adjustments. Despite some concerns, the weakening of the downward momentum indicated by the Average Directional Index suggests FET might be stabilizing. Investors are keeping an eye on the crucial $1.71 resistance level, which, if broken, could propel FET toward $2.00. As these trends develop, the market remains vigilant of FET’s direction. Web3 Adoption: Chroma’s Crocket Redefines Access Web3 adoption is widening, led by platforms that ease access to blockchain technology. The Chroma Crocket app, for instance, enhances user engagement through reward-based activities like quizzes and games, eliminating transaction fees with its Chroma ID, thus broadening the blockchain’s reach to novices. The influence of Web3 is not confined to apps; it’s spreading across gaming, e-commerce, and finance sectors. Developers are dedicated to lowering technological hurdles, enabling effortless user involvement. Crocket’s successful strategy illustrates how Web3 can link real rewards with enhanced functionality. As Web3 becomes more accessible, it’s clear that user-friendly tools are crucial for its mainstream acceptance. Web3Bay Presale Catalyzes E-Commerce Transformation! Web3Bay is emerging as the premier platform for online transactions of digital assets, revolutionizing e-commerce through blockchain technology. With its native coin, the 3BAY token presale creating significant buzz, it has successfully raised over $590,000 and sold more than 180 million coins. This impressive performance highlights the rising interest in Web3Bay’s potential to transform how users buy, trade, and sell assets online. Beyond simply facilitating e-commerce, Web3Bay’s vision includes launching an NFT marketplace where users can both create and trade tokenized assets, thereby enhancing the platform’s value. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with DeFi platforms are set to introduce staking, lending, and borrowing opportunities, broadening the ways 3BAY holders can increase their assets. Additionally, Web3Bay plans to implement cross-chain compatibility to ensure smooth operation across various blockchain ecosystems. This adaptability is crucial as it positions Web3Bay to excel in both the crypto and e-commerce sectors. The affordability of the 3BAY token, priced at just $0.0039675, coupled with an ambitious growth plan, continues to attract traders. Many see Web3Bay not merely as a platform to sell digital assets but as a gateway to a vast ecosystem that integrates NFTs, DeFi, and Web3 technologies. As such, Web3Bay is setting itself up as a key player in advancing decentralized commerce, a project that merits close attention as its adoption progresses. Final Verdict! Cryptocurrency initiatives are progressing, promoting broader adoption and routine use. FET trends reflect a guarded optimism, with investors watching resistance thresholds for potential advances. Meanwhile, web3 adoption is gaining strength, supported by platforms like Chroma’s Crocket app which simplifies daily blockchain interactions. Web3Bay stands out with its commitment to providing a safe, inclusive, and decentralized marketplace for users to buy, trade, and sell digital assets. Its thriving presale, now over $590,000 with 180 million coins sold, underscores increasing trust in its vision.

BlockDAG Targets $1 with Exchange Listing Talks Heating Up — Dogecoin Whales Shift & AVAX Targets Climb,https://thecoinrise.com/next-big-crypto-blockdag-targets-1-with-exchange-listing-talks-heating-up-dogecoin-whales-shift-avax-targets-climb/,"The crypto market thrives on big gains, and three key contenders are aiming for impressive growth this year. But which one has the potential to be the best crypto investment for 2025? This week, Dogecoin increased by 22.83% after a recent 14% decline. This rise is largely due to Dogecoin whales moving over $1 billion in DOGE. Analysts have identified a crucial Avalanche (AVAX) target at $126, which could lead to significant gains if AVAX overcomes existing resistance levels. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under discussion with ten prominent exchanges for listings. The potential of BlockDAG securing major exchange spots has attracted more participants to the presale, already surpassing $179.5 million. As the presale advances towards its $600 million goal, the outlook for BDAG reaching $1 sooner than anticipated this year remains optimistic! Dogecoin Whales Propel DOGE’s Market Value This week, Dogecoin’s price ascended to $0.3921, marking a 22.83% increase. The spike is mainly attributed to Dogecoin whales, who shifted over $1 billion in DOGE, increasing liquidity and buyer interest. Elon Musk’s recent activities and tweets, known to influence Dogecoin’s market previously, are believed to have lifted market confidence. Furthermore, a rise in trading volume across major exchanges shows escalating interest from both individual and larger scale buyers. Yet, while Dogecoin whale activities have led to positive growth, the coin’s fluctuating nature remains a concern for some analysts. Avalanche (AVAX) Target: Crucial Points to Monitor Avalanche is currently trading at $43.48 and might be poised for growth, with a significant Avalanche (AVAX) target set at $126.03. If it breaks through the $126 mark, it might escalate to $243, a 468% jump from current figures. However, overcoming crucial resistance levels is essential for these gains. Failure to surpass $126 could impede the bullish trajectory, keeping the price from reaching higher AVAX targets. Therefore, analysts continue to watch these levels closely to gauge AVAX’s momentum and price goals. BlockDAG Poised for $1 as Exchange Listing Talks Progress! BlockDAG’s promising $179.5 million presale surge, consistent growth, and high ROI projections mark it as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. Currently in discussions to list BDAG on ten exchanges, these initiatives further boost excitement around BlockDAG’s trajectory, pushing its presale towards the $600 million mark and offering substantial value to BDAG holders. Globally, the project is gaining attention, notably through strategic partnerships, like its collaboration with Italian football titan Inter Milan, which has introduced a new wave of sports enthusiasts to the crypto realm. This alliance has significantly enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility and credibility in both the crypto and sports arenas, fostering a broad base of supporters and holders. With these strategic moves and a rapidly expanding community, BlockDAG is on track for significant achievements in 2025 and beyond. Given its strong presale results and ongoing exchange talks, analysts believe BDAG could reach $1 this year. With its price currently at $0.0248, this indicates considerable return potential for current buyers. Those who bought in early, during the first batch, have already seen returns increase by 2380%. Smart traders are quickly seizing this promising opportunity, as the 26th presale batch has sold out. With BDAG’s price rising batch by batch, now is an ideal time for enthusiasts to engage for substantial gains in the upcoming months. Best Cryptos to Buy for 2025– Final Verdict DOGE’s recent price surge, spurred by Dogecoin whales and Musk’s influence, suggests growing interest, though its volatility remains a point of caution. Meanwhile, if Avalanche can break the critical resistance at $126, its price might soar, but failure could stall its bullish run. Currently at $43.48 with a 15.22% drop this month, the realization of Avalanche’s (AVAX) targets is up for debate. However, BlockDAG, with the largest presale to date, emerges as a highly promising contender. Its notable partnerships and imminent listings enhance its potential, with analysts predicting a $1 valuation in the near months. At just $0.0248 currently, BlockDAG offers an enticing opportunity for significant future returns, positioning it as the best crypto to buy for 2025 .

Since the price patterns are forming up, Ethereum price seems appealing to analysts and investors. However, it is the emergent DTX Exchange that is holding the spotlight moment. It has witnessed explosive momentum with the significant development in the case of Ripple vs. SEC. Could DTX be the evolutionary platform that changes the face of the crypto trade? Keep on reading to dig deeper into the details. DTX Exchange - The New Force in Crypto Trade While Ethereum and XRP get all the buzz, DTX Exchange is secretly becoming the new big hype in the crypto scene. A hybrid trading platform that bridges the centralized and decentralized world, DTX offers a smooth trading experience appealing to a broader audience. Let’s take a review at what makes DTX stand out: The Hybrid Model Combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges, user-friendliness with security and autonomy, DTX Exchange allows traders to benefit from both ends. This innovation appeals to experienced traders looking to be more effective and newer ones wanting the safest crypto entry. DTX is in a league of its own since it doesn't stop at the mere provision of cryptocurrencies. With over 120,000 available financial instruments on the platform, tokenized stocks, ETFs, and commodities, to name a few, users have options unparalleled in variety and scope for portfolio diversification as never before. Fair Tokenomics The DTX tokenomics model is all about inclusivity. Unlike other platforms that heavily favor institutional players, DTX Exchange ensures a fair launch, giving both retail and institutional investors equal opportunities to participate. This balanced approach fosters a more equitable ecosystem, which resonates strongly with the crypto community. Proven Growth All said, the DTX presale has been nothing short of a blockbuster, garnering more than $11.2 million and presenting a 600% return to early participants. It further indicates that the value of the token has gone up from $0.02 to $0.14, which depicts the immense confidence investors have in the platform's vision. Upcoming Catalysts Industry leaders have been keeping close tabs on DTX's performance. With tier-one exchange listings expected within the next few months, analysts predict that the token is set to multiply 10x to 100x. These statements have raised anticipation and interest in DTX Exchange , especially for traders looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP vs SEC: A Revolutionary Case for Crypto Regulation The history of cryptocurrency shows the XRP vs SEC case as the most significant happening till now. This lawsuit has been a battleground between innovation and regulation for years: the SEC believes that XRP is not a security, while Ripple maintains that it is. This partial recent victory for XRP brought much-needed clarification to its legal status, thereby eliciting a powerful price rally with the consequent restoration of the market's trust in the token. Such an outcome reverberated across the entire cryptocurrency system. It actually bonded optimism among altcoins and pushed the notion further that digital assets can somehow find a route toward acceptance in America. The Ripple vs SEC case has created a ripple effect in investor sentiment. Reduced regulatory uncertainty typically translates to more aggressive market participation, which has encouraged traders and investors to explore promising altcoins and innovative projects. Ethereum Price Action: The Market's Compass Investors are keeping a close eye on the Ethereum price. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and crypto enthusiasts often refer to it as a ""compass"" for market movements. The fluctuation in Ethereum price reflects the general mood in the cryptocurrency industry, right now. ETH has traded at over $3600, as of 4th January 2025 and has demonstrated remarkable resilience to market volatility. Source: CoinMarketCap It has been noticed that Ethereum favors the long-term investor due to the upgrades it is expected to go through, along with dominating the DeFi and NFT markets. According to analysts, continuous improvement of scalability and institutional adoption will lead to the revisiting of all-time highs, possibly surpassing it. Why Is DTX Gaining Momentum? The rapid success of DTX Exchange is not merely a case of smart marketing; it has deep roots in tangible innovation and timing. A new phase in the crypto market is opening its doors, with investors no longer content with the traditional exchanges, which are limited in flexibility and security. DTX fills in these gaps with features that traders genuinely need. But it is also because the larger industry dynamics are in DTX's favour. The crypto market is now looking forward to the next bull cycle. So, with the hybrid model of DTX, diversified assets and an approach for all, the platform is sitting on the most ideal ground. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investors Ethereum price and XRP continue to play pivotal roles in setting the stage, but the emergence of platforms like DTX Exchange signals the dawn of a new era. At its next cycle, the question in the market won't be about whether crypto is going to keep growing but, rather, who will lead. With innovative features and unstoppable momentum, DTX Exchange is most definitely one of them. With its promising tokenomics, proven success, and upcoming catalysts, DTX is already poised to lead the market. It’s set to be more accessible to crypto investors through its enlightened, flexible way of trading.

From its humble beginnings as a meme coin in 2020, Shiba Inu turned into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the world. People who got in early saw massive returns, with Shiba Inu’s price soaring from fractions of a cent to the moon. Those who missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO watched their friends become rich from what was once just a dog-themed joke. But here’s the good news for anyone feeling left out: you don’t have to regret missing Shiba Inu’s ICO anymore. The market is brimming with fresh opportunities, and the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term is right here: BTFD Coin. While Shiba Inu may have taken the world by storm, BTFD Coin is fast gaining traction with a standout feature: its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which offers real utility and rewards, making it the perfect new meme coin for those who want to get in on the action. The Shiba Inu ICO: A Missed Opportunity Many Regret to This Day Back in 2020, Shiba Inu was launched at a fraction of a cent, with an initial price that made it practically impossible to ignore. As early investors took a chance on this meme-inspired project, the coin’s value surged, making it one of the most recognizable meme coins in the space. By 2021, Shiba Inu’s price had risen to a crazy degree, creating millionaires out of those who took the plunge early. The meme coin industry was never the same, and Shiba Inu set the bar for what could happen when meme coins gain massive popularity. Unfortunately, for those who didn’t take the chance when Shiba Inu’s ICO was available, the dream of grabbing cheap coins at ground level quickly slipped away. The price soared, and those who entered after the initial hype missed the boat on those massive gains. But don’t worry, the good news is that BTFD Coin is the fresh opportunity you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a meme coin with a fully developed Play-to-Earn game that gives holders something tangible and valuable to look forward to, making it the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term right now.

This gives BTFD Coin an edge over other meme coins, adding a layer of fun and financial opportunity that’s hard to ignore. The P2E game is just one part of the BTFD Coin ecosystem creating excitement in the community. But the real kicker here is the rewards system—holders can earn by playing the game and staking their BTFD coins for a mind-blowing 90% APY . While some meme coins rely solely on community enthusiasm, BTFD Coin is building a sustainable system that rewards its supporters in multiple ways, all while maintaining the fun and inclusive vibe that meme coins are known for. In addition to the P2E game and staking, BTFD Coin’s presale is already showing impressive numbers.

Amid this market uncertainty, crypto whales appear to be accumulating Cardano (ADA) tokens, as reported by a prominent crypto expert on X (formerly Twitter). Whales Buy 90 Million ADA Token In a post on X, an expert noted that whales have purchased a significant 90 million ADA tokens in the past 96 hours, which equates to the last four days. This substantial accumulation indicates an ideal buying opportunity and potential for an upside rally.

Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.968 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.85% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, due to the recent breakout of the bullish price action pattern, investors and traders have shown strong participation in the token, resulting in a 27.5% increase in trading volume. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Levels With the recent price decline, the ADA price has reached the breakout level, and it appears that the price has come to this level for a retest, aiming for further upside momentum. As long as the altcoin maintains itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame and the $0.955 level, ADA remains bullish. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ADA could soar by 17.5% to reach the next resistance level of $1.135 in the coming days. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neither in the overbought area nor oversold, indicating that the asset has enough room for significant upside momentum. This bullish price action pattern and recent whale activity indicate potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 00:22:48
