Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:04:00

The response came after a user claimed that Litecoin's emergence and Charlie Lee's actions represented an early example of a pump-and-dump scheme. The user compared the project negatively to Solana, claiming that Charlie Lee founded Litecoin, set aside a significant amount of supply for himself, and sold it at the height of the 2017 bull run. The comment accused the Litecoin founder of using the project for personal gain and argued that Solana deserves more respect for his contributions to the crypto space. In response, the Litecoin team issued a detailed refutation, defending the project’s transparency, decentralization, and longevity since its inception in 2011. The team noted that Charlie Lee publicly announced Litecoin ahead of its launch, allowing the community to determine the launch date. Unlike many modern projects, Litecoin had no pre-mined supply, no initial coin offering (ICO), and no venture capital funding. Charlie Lee, like other participants, mined and purchased Litecoin and did not maintain a “founders stash.” He later sold his holdings in 2017 to avoid a conflict of interest while continuing to develop and defend the project. Contrary to claims, the team noted that Lee sold his Litecoin at an average price of $205, below the peak of the 2017 bull market. Related News: Famous ETF Expert Made 10 Predictions for the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 - “XRP, Solana...” The response detailed Charlie Lee’s ongoing financial and technical support for Litecoin: He has invested millions in Litecoin through the Litecoin Foundation and partnerships. He has supported marketing campaigns including collaborations with the Miami Dolphins, UFC and others. It holds its annual Litecoin Summit, costing $250,000 and up per event. He actively contributed to Litecoin's core code and encouraged its adoption among businesses and regulators. The team rejected comparisons to Solana and other projects, stating that Litecoin remains unique in its decentralization, lack of founder-controlled reserves, and lack of venture capital influence. They noted that Litecoin has consistently ranked in the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap for over 13 years, despite market volatility and the collapse of thousands of other projects. In their closing remarks, the team questioned Solana’s main use cases and claimed that its ecosystem is frequently used to create tokens that are involved in scams and fraud. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s administration is promising to turn it into a cornerstone of US economic strategy. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the same company holding over half a million Bitcoins valued at $52.81 billion through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has its own battles to fight — with regulators breathing down its neck. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) isn’t cutting BlackRock any slack. And Trump’s big Bitcoin plans? Let’s just say they don’t make things any easier for Mr. Larry Fink. But hey, at least BlackRock’s a Bitcoin whale now. BlackRock vs. FDIC Here’s what is going down with the FDIC. BlackRock was supposed to meet a January 10 deadline to address concerns about its influence on US banks. However, It didn’t. Instead, it asked for more time—until March 31—to review a proposed agreement, claiming it needed at least two more months. The FDIC wasn’t buying it. The agency not only rejected the extension but also added more demands. They want more transparency about how BlackRock makes decisions and details about its bank-related holdings. If BlackRock doesn’t act fast, things could get worse, and fast too. Sources familiar with the matter say the FDIC might issue subpoenas or take other mandatory actions to force the firm’s compliance. This isn’t a minor dispute. BlackRock’s sheer size, combined with its massive stakes in banks, has some regulators worried it could have too much control over the financial system. Jonathan McKernan, a Republican FDIC board member, and Rohit Chopra, the Democratic head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have both called for tighter oversight of big asset managers. Their main argument is that BlackRock could sway how banks operate, making them less independent. BlackRock’s defense has so far been calling the FDIC’s demands disruptive, arguing that new rules could wreck index funds—one of its flagship offerings—and make it harder for banks to raise cash. The company also says the FDIC needs to coordinate its efforts with the Federal Reserve, which already oversees its operations through a passivity agreement. Trump’s Bitcoin play Trump, along with Bitcoin-friendly figures like Senator Cynthia Lummis, is pushing for a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Here’s the plan: Senator Lummis has introduced a bill proposing the US Treasury and Federal Reserve acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years. That’s 200,000 Bitcoins a year, adding up to about 5% of the total global supply. The goal? To reduce America’s reliance on traditional financial systems and keep up with rivals like China and Russia. Dennis Porter, the co-founder of the Satoshi Act Fund, spilled the details. The reserve would partly come from Bitcoins seized in criminal investigations, giving the government a head start. Trump’s team believes this reserve could help stabilize the dollar while tackling the US’s enormous $36 trillion national debt. BlackRock, despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, isn’t on the same page. The firm has been making headlines for other reasons, like its withdrawal from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). BlackRock pulled out of NZAMI on January 11, under pressure from Republican-led states that weren’t happy with its climate-focused investments. The company insists it will continue to consider climate risks in its investment strategies, but the decision shows how political tensions are forcing it to adapt.

On January 11, Mango Markets shared on its X account: “We are shutting down. It’s time for users to close their positions.” The decision follows governance proposals that unanimously supported adjustments to interest rates and collateral requirements, effectively terminating borrowing and lending services. These changes will take effect on January 13. SEC Settlement The shutdown comes after a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On September 27, 2024, the SEC filed charges against Mango DAO and the Blockworks Foundation for selling unregistered securities. According to the SEC, Mango raised over $70 million in August 2021 by selling MNGO governance tokens in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also accused Mango Labs of operating as an unregistered broker, breaching the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As part of the settlement, Mango DAO agreed to pay $700,000 in penalties, destroy its MNGO tokens, and request the delisting of these tokens from exchanges. “Since the inception of our crypto enforcement program, our view has been that the label ‘DAO’ does not change the reality of who is behind a project,” said Jorge Tenreiro, chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit. Legal and Financial Struggles Mango Markets’ difficulties date back to an October 2022 exploit by crypto trader Avraham “Avi” Eisenberg, who drained over $100 million from the platform. Although Eisenberg returned $67 million as part of a governance vote, he kept $40 million. US authorities arrested Eisenberg in December 2022, charging him with fraud and market manipulation. He faces up to 20 years in prison, with his sentencing delayed multiple times due to legal complexities. Mango Markets was launched in August 2021, offering fast and affordable trading and lending services using its MNGO governance token. At the time of writing, the platform holds $9 million in total value locked, a sharp decline from its $210 million peak in November 2021, according to DefiLlama.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 21:24:01

Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-350000-top-crypto-influencer-makes-bold-prediction/,"Jeremie Davinci, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency domain, has garnered attention with his audacious forecast that Bitcoin may attain an extraordinary value of $350,000. This forecast, lately disseminated on social media, is predicated on historical trends and the present dynamics of Bitcoin mining expenses. Related Reading: $7,000 Ethereum In Sight? Expert Breaks Down The Potential Path The current expense for miners to generate one Bitcoin is approximately $70,000. Davinci indicates that historically, under positive market conditions, Bitcoin has frequently surpassed its mining cost by a ratio of five. This association indicates that, if historical trends persist, a price of $350,000 is feasible. The Cost Factor Of Mining The basis of Davinci’s approach is the relationship between mining costs and market price of Bitcoin. The mining process requires electricity and advanced technology among other resources. These costs build the basis for Bitcoin’s value as they rise. Currently spending over $70,000 to extract one BTC, miners may open the path for significant price increases in the future, claims Davinci. It costs miners about $70k to produce 1 #Bitcoin now, less with better hardware or cheap energy. In past bull markets, Bitcoin’s price has hit over 5x the mining cost. Huge potential ahead! — Davinci Jeremie (@Davincij15) January 11, 2025 He underscores that this forecast lacks a defined timescale and instead embodies an optimistic perspective grounded in historical performance. He asserted, “Significant potential lies ahead!” in reference to Bitcoin’s future price trajectory. Bitcoin: Institutional Impact And Market Forces Davinci’s prognosis is set against a landscape of growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Prominent corporations have commenced the acquisition of substantial quantities of BTC, indicating assurance in its long-term growth prospects. Companies such as BlackRock and MicroStrategy have made substantial investments in Bitcoin, contributing to the optimistic feeling around the cryptocurrency. In addition, the recent halving event in April 2024 cut the block payment for miners to 3.125 BTC. This made it harder for new coins to enter the market. Around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined, leaving less than 2 million to be made. This could cause prices to rise as long as people want them. A Prudent Optimism Although Davinci’s projection is undeniably ambitious, it is crucial to regard such forecasts with prudence. The bitcoin market is famously unstable and can undergo significant fluctuations in value. Analysts have observed that although Bitcoin may realize considerable increases over time, it has also had huge corrections in previous cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead As we approach 2025 and beyond, numerous investors are closely observing how these dynamics will develop. The interplay between mining expenses, institutional acceptance, and market mood will be a major determining factor in ascertaining the feasibility of Davinci’s prediction. Bold predictions like Jeremie Davinci’s are being debated as the crypto market continues to evolve. His forecast of Bitcoin reaching $350,000 reflects both reliance on historical trends and a sense of optimism.

From being a fun and quirky joke coin, Dogecoin quickly rose to fame, attracting an army of passionate holders and garnering massive attention from celebrities and influencers alike. The ICO was priced so low that it was a goldmine for early investors, with some even making millions from what was once just a silly meme coin. With Dogecoin currently holding a place as one of the most widely recognized meme coins in the world, its price has seen explosive growth over the years, and its future seems to be filled with even more promise. But for those who regret not getting in at the right time, there’s still hope. Enter BTFD Coin—a new player in the meme coin world that’s making waves with its exciting presale numbers and its standout feature: a jaw-dropping 90% APY on staking ! The Missed Opportunity: Dogecoin’s ICO and Rise to Fame Let’s talk numbers. When Dogecoin first hit the market in 2013, its initial price was virtually pennies—$0.0002047 per coin. Early investors, especially those who believed in the coin’s fun-loving culture, watched their investments grow exponentially as Dogecoin became more mainstream. In fact, as of 2025, Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70 per coin. That’s a massive jump for a coin that started as a joke. With over $49 billion in market cap, Dogecoin’s growth has solidified its place in meme coin history. And while Dogecoin’s story is one for the books, many missed out on that golden opportunity. Investors who saw its potential too late are left with nothing but “what ifs” and “could’ve, should’ve, would’ve” thoughts. But don’t sweat it!

At the same time, Foresight Ventures’ X account was hacked, linked to $500,000 raised through 15 compromised accounts, showing rising security risks. Crypto hacks happen, but the market bounces back There has been so much hacking from the Mt. Gox hack in 2014 up to hacks on Litecoin and Foresight Ventures’ X accounts in 2025. Each hack is similar; it starts with chaos, breaking trust, and lowering the market prices. Time heals most wounds as prices tend to bounce back usually stronger than before. Litecoin’s official X account was hacked on January 11, 2025. An attacker released a fake token based on the Solana network, named using the ticker LTC, via the said account. Litecoin's X account was briefly compromised today and posts that were not authorized were published. These were live only for a matter of seconds before being deleted. We're still investigating the issue, but immediately found a delegated account that was compromised and removed… — Litecoin (@litecoin) January 11, 2025 A post including a Solana contract address and a scam link briefly propelled the fake token’s market cap to $27,000. The value of the token, however, cratered to $3,400 after a scam alert was published. The Litecoin team regained control, deleted the post, and removed the hacked delegated account. They assured users that investigations are currently being done on the issue. At the same time, hackers accessed Foresight Ventures’ X account. It was used for promoting fraudulent activity with cryptocurrencies tied to AI. Such a hack was alarming, as Foresight Ventures has close ties to blockchain and AI projects. Yet, the team acted fast: it issued warnings and solved the problem. At the end of December 2024, hackers broke into the Cardano Foundation’s X account. They falsely claimed a lawsuit with the SEC and sold a scam token called “ADAsol.” It has been reported that one hacker managed to raise $500,000 by exploiting more than 15 hacked X accounts for meme coin scams during late 2024 and early 2025. These hacks are often phishing emails masquerading as legitimate messages, tricking victims into sharing their credentials. Hacks have been a bane in the crypto industry for years. In 2014, the Mt. Gox hack resulted in over $450 million worth of Bitcoin being stolen, causing the collapse of what was then the largest exchange. The Bitfinex hack in 2016 led to the loss of 120,000 BTC, worth $72 million at the time. In 2018, $530 million in NEM tokens were stolen from Coincheck. Such occurrences demonstrate the impact hacks can have on the crypto market. In the case of 2020, hackers hijacked the Twitter accounts of influential people such as Elon Musk and Joe Biden, displaying them with fake Bitcoin giveaways. Although the financial loss was not too massive, it highlighted the need to protect influential accounts. In 2022, the hack of the Ronin Network targeting Axie Infinity stole $625 million and marked one of the biggest crypto robberies ever; it was said to question a centralized blockchain gaming ecosystem. The WazirX hack in 2024 joined the list of concerns regarding centralized exchanges. From hacks to altseason Most hacks lead to short-term market drops due to users panicking and withdrawing funds. These, however, happen at the worst time when the crypto market prepares for an altseason in which altcoins tend to do way better than Bitcoin. This might, therefore, be an opportunity for the market to get over such shocks and enjoy substantial growth. The attacks that Litecoin and Foresight Ventures experienced may be minor in comparison but show a possibility of going wrong in the crypto space. However, growth in the market may still be true, especially around the time of altseason and with bettering security in security. There is a bright long-term future for the crypto market. Whether hacks would be in the way of problems or growth will depend on whether these incidents can be studied and leveraged to improve security.

SUI ATH & ETC Poised for Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/get-6-on-every-purchase-with-blockdags-affiliate-program-sui-ath-etc-poised-for-growth/,"As we step into 2025, the cryptocurrency landscape is teeming with potential. Key highlights include the anticipated rise in Ethereum Classic (ETC) price to $49.07 and SUI nearing a peak at $5.35, coupled with robust investor interest. Amid these developments, BlockDAG (BDAG) , a notable layer-1 blockchain entity, rolls out its referral program, offering up to 10% in USDT rewards, significantly fueling the demand for its tokens. Here’s an analysis of these pivotal market elements to gauge the top crypto gem for 2025. Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Targeting $49 in 2025! Forecasting a significant upturn, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is predicted to escalate to a peak of $49.07 by 2025. Investors need a thorough technical analysis to navigate this potential. Currently, ETC is trading at $25.28, with market reactions mixed and a transaction volume of $326.06 million in the last 24 hours. Analysis of the weekly trends shows a bullish reversal, hinting at lucrative opportunities ahead. The coin might retest its highest resistance at $167, potentially triggering a bullish trend. Predictions suggest ETC’s price could oscillate between $22.38 and $49.07, averaging around $44.74. Will SUI Achieve a New ATH as TVL Soars? The SUI token recently marked a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.35, propelled by an upsurge across the market. Despite a significant rally of 10.39% and reaching new highs, SUI has since corrected to $4.59. Closing 2024 with a robust increase in Total Value Locked (TVL) from $1.75 billion to more than $2.6 billion in early 2025, SUI continues to draw attention. Initiatives like DeepBook V3 and Sui Bridge, along with institutional backing, have spurred this growth. The continued DeFi boom and SUI’s ATH underscore its strong market stance. BlockDAG’s Innovative Affiliate Program: Turn $30 into Significant Gains! BlockDAG’s latest initiative offers a compelling referral program that rewards users with up to 10% cashback in USDT for purchases made through shared referral links.

This program is designed for broad participation, with a minimal purchase requirement of $30, allowing widespread entry and benefit from the BlockDAG ecosystem. Its simplicity and attractive rewards make this program a key growth driver for BlockDAG, positioning it as a top contender for 2025’s best cryptocurrency.

BlockDAG’s affiliate program not only offers simple, significant earning opportunities but also plays a crucial role in the platform’s expansion and prominence in the cryptocurrency world. Anticipating the Top Crypto Gems for 2025 With a landscape ripe with opportunities, Ethereum Classic, SUI, and BlockDAG stand out in the 2025 crypto market. Ethereum Classic’s projection of reaching $49.07 is backed by positive market trends, while SUI’s recent ATH at $5.35 highlights its increasing influence in DeFi. BlockDAG capitalizes on these trends with its user-centric referral program, promising significant USDT rewards and a notable return for its early adopters.

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 22:01:00

These Bitcoin mining devices aim to simplify cryptocurrency mining for individuals while incorporating unique dual-purpose functionality. According to the official press release , the Avalon Mini 3 combines high-performance Bitcoin mining with home heating, boasting a hash rate of 37.5Th/s and a user-friendly app-controlled interface. Meanwhile, the Avalon Nano 3S is an upgraded version of the popular Nano 3 which features a hash rate of 6Th/s and is being marketed as a beginner-friendly entry point into Bitcoin mining . Key advantages of the products include a plug-and-play setup for ease of use and a focus on energy efficiency. The Avalon Mini 3 addresses environmental concerns by recycling computational energy into home heating, allowing users to offset energy costs while minimizing waste. Canaan CEO NG Zhang spoke about the company’s vision of combining practicality with sustainability and added, “The Avalon Mini 3 and Avalon 3S represent our vision of user-friendly, practical mining solutions for the modern individual. We’re reimagining how technology can create value while minimizing environmental waste. The Avalon Mini 3’s ability to generate cryptocurrency while heating your home is a perfect example of our vision for sustainable, multi-purpose technology.”​​​​​​​ Transforming cryptocurrency mining rigs into household devices is not a new concept. Back in 2017, Avi Aisenberg, who operated South Florida Distillers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, created a heating system that used ASIC miners to mine crypto while accelerating the rum-distillation process. In 2018, the French start-up Qarnot introduced the QC-1, a heater designed specifically for cryptocurrency mining.

As we move into 2025, AI agents are set to dominate the crypto landscape, promising smarter and faster decision-making. From analyzing vast datasets to executing trades with precision, these tools are turning heads in the trading world. Wall Street Pepe stands out in this AI wave, though it takes a unique stance. The 99Bitcoins put it best: “Wall Street Pepe is not artificial intelligence. Wall Street Pepe is simply intelligence.” Here’s a closer look at why $WEPE might just be your smartest move in the crypto market. What Are AI Agents in Crypto? AI agents in the crypto world are autonomous systems that use machine learning to analyze market trends and execute trades. These bots can process data in seconds, making decisions that would take humans hours or even days. Unlike traditional trading tools, AI agents learn and adapt. They use historical data to predict future price movements, detect patterns, and even respond to real-time market changes. This ability to “think” on the fly is what makes them a game-changer. Why AI Agents Are in the Spotlight The buzz around AI agents isn’t just hype – it’s backed by numbers. Recently, Binance listed several AI agent-powered altcoins – $AIXBT (aixbt by Virtuals), $CGPT (ChainGPT), and $COOKIE (Cookie DAO) – causing their prices to skyrocket. Investors are flocking to AI-driven projects because they offer a unique edge. They provide faster, data-backed decisions, reducing the emotional bias often associated with human trading.

Notably, Bitcoin has been unable to hold substantially above the $100,000 price level since it first broke through in early December, and multiple breakouts have been followed by rejections. The most recent rejection came last week when the price peaked at $102,000 on Monday, only to reverse sharply and fall to $92,000 by Thursday. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Challenge Gold: Expert Sees US Taking The Lead This continued tug-of-war has brought the bearish case for BTC into sharper focus, with technical analysis highlighting a 50/50 chance of a further drop or a bounce. $90,000: A Pivotal Support Zone Under Threat Recent Bitcoin price action has significantly put the $90,000 price point as the most notable support level for the bulls. Although the crypto has largely held above the $90,000 support level even during the recent corrections, the bearish outlook hinges on its ability to defend this level. According to technical analysis by crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin has made five different attempts to test a support trendline around $90,000, which further reveals the importance of the level. This repeated retest increases the chance of weakening the support strength and is gradually making Bitcoin more vulnerable to a sharp decline. With this in mind, the major task for Bitcoin bulls would be to hold above the $90,000 and break resistance levels above $100,000 in order to invalidate a bearish outlook. Should Bitcoin fall below $90,000, it could cascade to a further price drop to the $87,000 range or even lower. A fall below $87,000 could, in turn, cause a quick fall through a $12,000 gap to reach $75,000. Resistance Levels To Break: $103,000 To $108,500 As noted by EGRAG CRYPTO, Bitcoin could continue to pose a bearish threat until it closes above a few resistance levels. These resistance levels are situated at $103,000, $106,400, and $108,500, and consistent daily closes above these thresholds are required to confirm a bullish trend. The third resistance of $108,500 is the most notable, as a break above it would see Bitcoin trading at new all-time highs. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, current technical indicators suggest that the chances of a pump are low at the moment. For instance, Bitcoin has now lost the support of the 21 EMA on the daily candlestick timeframe, and sentiment is now in a neutral zone on the Fear and Greed Index. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Under Threat: $12,000 Void Opens Up Possibility Of Crash Toward $75,000 As it stands, the biggest factor that could see bullish momentum return to Bitcoin is the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20th and the anticipated crypto-positive policies that during the new administration. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the event could either trigger a short-term rally or exacerbate the ongoing decline. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,400.

Recent Uniswap’s updates about its forthcoming V4 launch are creating waves within its community. In parallel, SHIB news is making headlines as it gears up for its governance token, TREAT’s release. Despite some circulating rumors, Shytoshi Kusama, the anonymous lead, has confirmed no early launches occurred. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) , a burgeoning decentralized e-commerce platform, has successfully exceeded $590K in its presale. This achievement signals its potential to reshape the future of online shopping, highlighting the evolving nature of web3 commerce. Uniswap Update: Anticipating the 2025 Launch of V4 Uniswap’s forthcoming V4 update is drawing community focus, with its release anticipated this year.

The Uniswap update will introduce the “Hooks” system, allowing developers to insert custom codes around swap functions. Although the exact release date is still under wraps, the anticipation around V4 confirms Uniswap’s leadership in the decentralized exchange arena. SHIB’s Leadership Addresses Misinformation Ahead of TREAT Launch In the latest SHIB news, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is preparing for the significant rollout of its governance token, TREAT, officially scheduled for January 14. Recent false claims about a secret launch two years ago have been refuted by Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous leader of the ecosystem. Kusama has emphasized the importance of community vigilance against potential scams using the TREAT name. Despite these challenges, the imminent launch of TREAT stands as a key advancement for the Shiba Inu community, promising new governance capabilities and enhanced utility.

Recently, FTX unveiled new details about its $16 billion creditor repayment plan , offering some clarity to those affected by its collapse. The plan prioritizes smaller creditors, with the first payments soon scheduled. This update marks the beginning of financial relief for many, causing anticipation to build among creditors and the broader crypto community. However, the challenges, such as phishing scams and unresolved legal disputes, still loom large. Small Creditors to Get Early Relief FTX’s bankruptcy reorganization plan emphasizes fairness, starting with creditors whose claims are below $50,000. These smaller creditors will share an initial repayment pool of $1.2 billion. This information was disclosed by FTX creditor Sunil Kavuri in an X post earlier today. FTX repayments Initial Distribution Schedule Claims Jan 20th: FTX has given until 20th Jan to fulfil pre distribution requirements for initial distribution Repayments likely won’t start before then Feb 25: Likely (up to 4th Mar) — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 12, 2025 The record date for these claims was set as January 3, with repayments expected to commence in February. To streamline the process, the trading platform has asked creditors to complete essential pre-distribution requirements by January 20. These include submitting W-8BEN tax forms and passing Know Your Customer (KYC) verification. Importantly, creditors have a 60-day deadline to file their tax forms or risk forfeiting their repayments. FTX has stressed the importance of meeting these requirements to avoid delays. Phishing Scams and Legal Confusion Add to FTX Worries While the repayment plan brings hope, it has also created new risks. A wave of phishing scams and fraudulent claim portals has been targeting creditors. FTX has urged caution, reminding stakeholders to verify all communications and rely only on official channels for information. In addition, unresolved legal issues are complicating the process. Claims surrounding the acquisition of FTX EU by Backpack have been flagged as inaccurate. FTX clarified that FTX EU remains fully owned by FTX Europe AG. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court oversees FTX’s Chapter 11 case and has not approved any share transfers. These legal disputes highlight the ongoing complexities in FTX’s path to recovery. A Boost for the Crypto Market? The repayment plan could have a significant impact beyond FTX creditors. Market analysts are optimistic that many creditors may reinvest their funds in the crypto market once repayments are distributed. Kraken recently offered selected creditors seamless ways to reinvest in the market, a no-fee trading initiative. This influx of capital and a favorable stance from the pro-crypto incoming Trump administration could trigger a rally for Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. The crypto market, still reeling from the collapse of major exchanges like FTX, needs positive momentum. If the trading platform successfully executes its repayment plan, it could restore some confidence in the industry and set a precedent for managing future crises.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-12 23:22:00

Speaking to the Russian news outlet Prime , Sergey Bezdelov, the head of the Industrial Mining Association said that “in the fourth quarter of 2024,” the demand for industrial mining equipment and services in Russia “increased threefold compared to the same period in FY2023.” Bezdelov was speaking in the wake of comments from a top lawmaker who said Moscow was ready to “soften” its stance on crypto regulation. Crypto Mining Hardware a Hit in Russia? The Industrial Mining Association chief added that there was “also high interest” in Russian crypto mining projects “among foreign market participants.” The estimated percentage change in Bitcoin Mining difficulty over the past seven days. (Source: Dune/@mitchklee_) Bezdelov said that some of this “interest” in Russian crypto mining was now coming from “fellow BRICS member states.” In May last year, Bezdelov claimed that the Russian industrial crypto mining market “doubled in size” in 2023 . The expert hinted that recent legal changes had helped boost the popularity of mining in Russia. A law that came into force on November 1, 2024, allows both “legal entities” (private companies) and “individual entrepreneurs” (private citizens) to mine crypto “legally” if they do not consume more than 6,000 kWh of energy per month. “Individuals can mine cryptoassets without being included in a state-run register, but within the limits of the electricity consumption threshold. If they go beyond this threshold, citizens must register as an individual entrepreneur and apply for inclusion on the register.” Bezdelov With the help of a two-story clock in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, the Baltics are counting down the minutes until they leave Russia's energy grid on Feb. 8. https://t.co/eNgeDsdKGa — Bloomberg (@business) January 11, 2025 Crypto Taxes Incoming? At present, the register only requires companies and individuals to submit data on transactions and energy consumption. However, as the body that controls the register also operates Russia’s taxation system, it is highly likely that any miner using more than 6,000 kWh will soon have to pay tax on their earnings. However, Bezdelov noted that before last year’s legal change, crypto mining was in a “gray” legal zone. Until November, mining had no legal status. Now, however, Russian law recognizes it as a form of “entrepreneurship.” While Bezdelov and others have previously said that most (around 90%) of domestic miners focus their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC) , Cryptonews.com has seen evidence that suggests many Russian home-based miners prefer Ethereum (ETH) . Last year, Bezdelov said that Litecoin (LTC) is also popular among a smaller group of Russian miners. Litecoin prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Russian Media, Lawmakers Change Tune on Crypto The same media outlet wrote that mining is a “good source of additional income.” It added that Russian companies and individuals could use crypto as an “opportunity to diversify their assets.” It also suggested that firms could use the crypto they mine as a settlement tool “when conducting foreign economic activity within the framework” of the Central Bank’s sandbox. This type of positive talk about crypto was once almost unheard of in Russian mainstream media outlets.

And the Central Bank has led several attempts to issue a China-style crypto crackdown in Russia. However, President Vladimir Putin last year spearheaded a crypto pivot when he began to speak about crypto mining in glowing terms. And while many energy-poor areas have issued bans on crypto mining until 2031, Putin has urged other parts of the Russian Federation to mine crypto “if they have surplus energy.” Tax Boost The association has claimed that the Russian Treasury could expect to earn over $500 million per year from taxing crypto miners. Others claim that Russia’s desire to become an AI “powerhouse” has inspired Putin’s crypto pivot . Bezdelov advised Russian qualified investors to “allocate up to 5% of their portfolios to mining services and digital currencies.” China warmly welcomes the new addition to the BRICS family, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday, in response to Brazil, as the BRICS chair 2025, releasing a statement on Monday night announcing the official entry of Indonesia as a full member into BRICS.… pic.twitter.com/XqZycI9onG — Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 7, 2025 Softer Crypto Stance Possible, Lawmakers Says Meanwhile, TASS reported that the chief architect of Russia’s crypto legislation has “allowed for the possibility of softer regulation” for domestic companies using crypto to avoid US, UK, and EU-led sanctions . The state-run news agency quoted Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets, as explaining that crypto “market players” are complaining of “over-regulation” in the Central Bank’s sandbox. Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets. (Source: Secretariat of the World Russian People’s Council/YouTube/Screenshot) The Central Bank wants all Russian firms who use crypto as a payment tool to exchange coins using the sandbox, rather than dealing directly with overseas partners in crypto. “We need to quickly launch an experimental [sandbox]. We then need to see how the standards we have adopted in this market work. And then we can make further adjustments later. Quite possibly, we will move toward a softer regulatory [position].” Lawmaker Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the Russian State Duma’s Committee on the Financial Markets Aksakov also said that firms are not happy with the Central Bank’s protocols. Many, it seems, think these protocols are over-complicated. The lawmaker said: “Many companies are suggesting that we need to somehow simplify the turnover of cryptocurrencies so that the market can develop successfully. As [crypto settlements] are new and mobile, this is proving to be the case.” The post Crypto Mining Hardware Sales ‘Triple’ in Russia as Moscow Teases ‘Light Touch’ Regulation appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Crypto Mining|Russia,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-01-12 23:30:00

Travis Ford, 35, of Glenpool, pleaded guilty yesterday to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with his role as CEO, co-founder, and head trader of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC. The purported investment firm operated from January 2023 to August 2023, promoting itself through its website, social media, and other internet platforms.

Ford admitted that he knew such returns were unattainable but made promises to lure investors anyway. He misappropriated the funds to benefit himself and his co-conspirators, leaving investors with significant financial losses. The Justice Department announced the plea on Friday, Jan. 10, with Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Wible and U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Inspector in Charge Eric Shen highlighting the fraudulent scheme’s scope. Ford now faces up to five years in prison, with sentencing to be determined by a federal district court judge. The court will consider the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors before issuing a final sentence. A sentencing date has not yet been set. The news came just two days after a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Washington charged a former pastor with 26 counts of fraud, alleging he masterminded a cryptocurrency scheme.

On January 12, several users in Singapore reported being unable to access Polymarket. Alex Zuo, Vice President of Investment and Custody at Cobo Global, commented on X: “Polymarket is officially defined as a gambling website in Singapore. If you want to place a bet, you can only go to a state-owned gambling company. Otherwise, you will face fines and imprisonment.” Users attempting to visit Polymarket are greeted with a warning under Section 20 of the Gambling Control Act 2022. The act imposes penalties of up to SG$10,000, jail terms of up to six months, or both for gambling with unlicensed operators. The warning from the Gambling Regulatory Authority (GRA) reads: “You have attempted to access an illegal gambling site hosted by an unlicensed gambling service provider. Singapore Pools is the only licensed online gambling operator in Singapore.” Regulatory Landscape The GRA, established on August 1, 2022, oversees all forms of gambling in Singapore. It was created by restructuring the Casino Regulatory Authority to address the changing nature of gambling products and services. Polymarket operates on the Polygon blockchain, allowing users to bet on global events using USD Coin (USDC). From January 1, the Singapore Police Force assumed enforcement authority for illegal gambling. According to the GRA, Singapore Pools is the sole operator licensed to offer remote gambling services. Violators face fines of up to SG$500,000 and imprisonment of up to seven years, with repeat offenders subject to harsher penalties. Since 2015, the GRA has blocked more than 3,800 gambling websites and SG$37 million in transactions. Singapore’s Crypto Leadership Despite its strict gambling regulations, Singapore is a blockchain and cryptocurrency hub. A December study by ApeX Protocol highlighted Singapore’s 1,600 blockchain patents, 2,433 crypto-related jobs, and 81 cryptocurrency exchanges.

FET Trends Look Uncertain While Chroma Drives Web3 Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bays-presale-tops-590k-fet-trends-look-uncertain-while-chroma-drives-web3-growth/,"Various market movements are drawing attention in the blockchain field. FET trends are showing mixed signals, with the possibility of surpassing the $1.71 resistance level, yet inconsistent network activities temper these gains. In parallel, the Web3 sector is expanding, enhanced by tools like Chroma’s Crocket app which simplifies blockchain interaction through enjoyable, cost-free activities, showcasing seamless integration of technology and practical usability. Concurrently, Web3Bay ‘s presale is performing well, accumulating over $590,000. This indicates its potential to innovate the traditional e-commerce sector by integrating decentralized blockchain technology with accessible crypto pricing, creating an inviting environment for participants in its growing ecosystem. FET Trends Surge By 25%: What’s Next? FET trends are capturing attention, having surged by 25% before descending to $1.29. This rise was a temporary boost, and a deeper analysis reveals possible bearish patterns that might affect its stability. The Price DAA Divergence, showing a mismatch between increasing prices and diminishing network activities, suggests impending adjustments. Despite some concerns, the weakening of the downward momentum indicated by the Average Directional Index suggests FET might be stabilizing. Investors are keeping an eye on the crucial $1.71 resistance level, which, if broken, could propel FET toward $2.00. As these trends develop, the market remains vigilant of FET’s direction. Web3 Adoption: Chroma’s Crocket Redefines Access Web3 adoption is widening, led by platforms that ease access to blockchain technology. The Chroma Crocket app, for instance, enhances user engagement through reward-based activities like quizzes and games, eliminating transaction fees with its Chroma ID, thus broadening the blockchain’s reach to novices. The influence of Web3 is not confined to apps; it’s spreading across gaming, e-commerce, and finance sectors. Developers are dedicated to lowering technological hurdles, enabling effortless user involvement. Crocket’s successful strategy illustrates how Web3 can link real rewards with enhanced functionality. As Web3 becomes more accessible, it’s clear that user-friendly tools are crucial for its mainstream acceptance. Web3Bay Presale Catalyzes E-Commerce Transformation! Web3Bay is emerging as the premier platform for online transactions of digital assets, revolutionizing e-commerce through blockchain technology. With its native coin, the 3BAY token presale creating significant buzz, it has successfully raised over $590,000 and sold more than 180 million coins. This impressive performance highlights the rising interest in Web3Bay’s potential to transform how users buy, trade, and sell assets online. Beyond simply facilitating e-commerce, Web3Bay’s vision includes launching an NFT marketplace where users can both create and trade tokenized assets, thereby enhancing the platform’s value. Furthermore, strategic partnerships with DeFi platforms are set to introduce staking, lending, and borrowing opportunities, broadening the ways 3BAY holders can increase their assets. Additionally, Web3Bay plans to implement cross-chain compatibility to ensure smooth operation across various blockchain ecosystems. This adaptability is crucial as it positions Web3Bay to excel in both the crypto and e-commerce sectors. The affordability of the 3BAY token, priced at just $0.0039675, coupled with an ambitious growth plan, continues to attract traders. Many see Web3Bay not merely as a platform to sell digital assets but as a gateway to a vast ecosystem that integrates NFTs, DeFi, and Web3 technologies. As such, Web3Bay is setting itself up as a key player in advancing decentralized commerce, a project that merits close attention as its adoption progresses. Final Verdict! Cryptocurrency initiatives are progressing, promoting broader adoption and routine use. FET trends reflect a guarded optimism, with investors watching resistance thresholds for potential advances. Meanwhile, web3 adoption is gaining strength, supported by platforms like Chroma’s Crocket app which simplifies daily blockchain interactions. Web3Bay stands out with its commitment to providing a safe, inclusive, and decentralized marketplace for users to buy, trade, and sell digital assets. Its thriving presale, now over $590,000 with 180 million coins sold, underscores increasing trust in its vision.

BlockDAG Targets $1 with Exchange Listing Talks Heating Up — Dogecoin Whales Shift & AVAX Targets Climb,https://thecoinrise.com/next-big-crypto-blockdag-targets-1-with-exchange-listing-talks-heating-up-dogecoin-whales-shift-avax-targets-climb/,"The crypto market thrives on big gains, and three key contenders are aiming for impressive growth this year. But which one has the potential to be the best crypto investment for 2025? This week, Dogecoin increased by 22.83% after a recent 14% decline. This rise is largely due to Dogecoin whales moving over $1 billion in DOGE. Analysts have identified a crucial Avalanche (AVAX) target at $126, which could lead to significant gains if AVAX overcomes existing resistance levels. Concurrently, BlockDAG (BDAG) is under discussion with ten prominent exchanges for listings. The potential of BlockDAG securing major exchange spots has attracted more participants to the presale, already surpassing $179.5 million. As the presale advances towards its $600 million goal, the outlook for BDAG reaching $1 sooner than anticipated this year remains optimistic! Dogecoin Whales Propel DOGE’s Market Value This week, Dogecoin’s price ascended to $0.3921, marking a 22.83% increase. The spike is mainly attributed to Dogecoin whales, who shifted over $1 billion in DOGE, increasing liquidity and buyer interest. Elon Musk’s recent activities and tweets, known to influence Dogecoin’s market previously, are believed to have lifted market confidence. Furthermore, a rise in trading volume across major exchanges shows escalating interest from both individual and larger scale buyers. Yet, while Dogecoin whale activities have led to positive growth, the coin’s fluctuating nature remains a concern for some analysts. Avalanche (AVAX) Target: Crucial Points to Monitor Avalanche is currently trading at $43.48 and might be poised for growth, with a significant Avalanche (AVAX) target set at $126.03. If it breaks through the $126 mark, it might escalate to $243, a 468% jump from current figures. However, overcoming crucial resistance levels is essential for these gains. Failure to surpass $126 could impede the bullish trajectory, keeping the price from reaching higher AVAX targets. Therefore, analysts continue to watch these levels closely to gauge AVAX’s momentum and price goals. BlockDAG Poised for $1 as Exchange Listing Talks Progress! BlockDAG’s promising $179.5 million presale surge, consistent growth, and high ROI projections mark it as one of the top cryptos to buy in 2025. Currently in discussions to list BDAG on ten exchanges, these initiatives further boost excitement around BlockDAG’s trajectory, pushing its presale towards the $600 million mark and offering substantial value to BDAG holders. Globally, the project is gaining attention, notably through strategic partnerships, like its collaboration with Italian football titan Inter Milan, which has introduced a new wave of sports enthusiasts to the crypto realm. This alliance has significantly enhanced BlockDAG’s visibility and credibility in both the crypto and sports arenas, fostering a broad base of supporters and holders. With these strategic moves and a rapidly expanding community, BlockDAG is on track for significant achievements in 2025 and beyond. Given its strong presale results and ongoing exchange talks, analysts believe BDAG could reach $1 this year. With its price currently at $0.0248, this indicates considerable return potential for current buyers. Those who bought in early, during the first batch, have already seen returns increase by 2380%. Smart traders are quickly seizing this promising opportunity, as the 26th presale batch has sold out. With BDAG’s price rising batch by batch, now is an ideal time for enthusiasts to engage for substantial gains in the upcoming months. Best Cryptos to Buy for 2025– Final Verdict DOGE’s recent price surge, spurred by Dogecoin whales and Musk’s influence, suggests growing interest, though its volatility remains a point of caution. Meanwhile, if Avalanche can break the critical resistance at $126, its price might soar, but failure could stall its bullish run. Currently at $43.48 with a 15.22% drop this month, the realization of Avalanche’s (AVAX) targets is up for debate. However, BlockDAG, with the largest presale to date, emerges as a highly promising contender. Its notable partnerships and imminent listings enhance its potential, with analysts predicting a $1 valuation in the near months. At just $0.0248 currently, BlockDAG offers an enticing opportunity for significant future returns, positioning it as the best crypto to buy for 2025 .

Since the price patterns are forming up, Ethereum price seems appealing to analysts and investors. However, it is the emergent DTX Exchange that is holding the spotlight moment. It has witnessed explosive momentum with the significant development in the case of Ripple vs. SEC. Could DTX be the evolutionary platform that changes the face of the crypto trade? Keep on reading to dig deeper into the details. DTX Exchange - The New Force in Crypto Trade While Ethereum and XRP get all the buzz, DTX Exchange is secretly becoming the new big hype in the crypto scene. A hybrid trading platform that bridges the centralized and decentralized world, DTX offers a smooth trading experience appealing to a broader audience. Let’s take a review at what makes DTX stand out: The Hybrid Model Combining the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges, user-friendliness with security and autonomy, DTX Exchange allows traders to benefit from both ends. This innovation appeals to experienced traders looking to be more effective and newer ones wanting the safest crypto entry. DTX is in a league of its own since it doesn't stop at the mere provision of cryptocurrencies. With over 120,000 available financial instruments on the platform, tokenized stocks, ETFs, and commodities, to name a few, users have options unparalleled in variety and scope for portfolio diversification as never before. Fair Tokenomics The DTX tokenomics model is all about inclusivity. Unlike other platforms that heavily favor institutional players, DTX Exchange ensures a fair launch, giving both retail and institutional investors equal opportunities to participate. This balanced approach fosters a more equitable ecosystem, which resonates strongly with the crypto community. Proven Growth All said, the DTX presale has been nothing short of a blockbuster, garnering more than $11.2 million and presenting a 600% return to early participants. It further indicates that the value of the token has gone up from $0.02 to $0.14, which depicts the immense confidence investors have in the platform's vision. Upcoming Catalysts Industry leaders have been keeping close tabs on DTX's performance. With tier-one exchange listings expected within the next few months, analysts predict that the token is set to multiply 10x to 100x. These statements have raised anticipation and interest in DTX Exchange , especially for traders looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP vs SEC: A Revolutionary Case for Crypto Regulation The history of cryptocurrency shows the XRP vs SEC case as the most significant happening till now. This lawsuit has been a battleground between innovation and regulation for years: the SEC believes that XRP is not a security, while Ripple maintains that it is. This partial recent victory for XRP brought much-needed clarification to its legal status, thereby eliciting a powerful price rally with the consequent restoration of the market's trust in the token. Such an outcome reverberated across the entire cryptocurrency system. It actually bonded optimism among altcoins and pushed the notion further that digital assets can somehow find a route toward acceptance in America. The Ripple vs SEC case has created a ripple effect in investor sentiment. Reduced regulatory uncertainty typically translates to more aggressive market participation, which has encouraged traders and investors to explore promising altcoins and innovative projects. Ethereum Price Action: The Market's Compass Investors are keeping a close eye on the Ethereum price. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and crypto enthusiasts often refer to it as a ""compass"" for market movements. The fluctuation in Ethereum price reflects the general mood in the cryptocurrency industry, right now. ETH has traded at over $3600, as of 4th January 2025 and has demonstrated remarkable resilience to market volatility. Source: CoinMarketCap It has been noticed that Ethereum favors the long-term investor due to the upgrades it is expected to go through, along with dominating the DeFi and NFT markets. According to analysts, continuous improvement of scalability and institutional adoption will lead to the revisiting of all-time highs, possibly surpassing it. Why Is DTX Gaining Momentum? The rapid success of DTX Exchange is not merely a case of smart marketing; it has deep roots in tangible innovation and timing. A new phase in the crypto market is opening its doors, with investors no longer content with the traditional exchanges, which are limited in flexibility and security. DTX fills in these gaps with features that traders genuinely need. But it is also because the larger industry dynamics are in DTX's favour. The crypto market is now looking forward to the next bull cycle. So, with the hybrid model of DTX, diversified assets and an approach for all, the platform is sitting on the most ideal ground. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Investors Ethereum price and XRP continue to play pivotal roles in setting the stage, but the emergence of platforms like DTX Exchange signals the dawn of a new era. At its next cycle, the question in the market won't be about whether crypto is going to keep growing but, rather, who will lead. With innovative features and unstoppable momentum, DTX Exchange is most definitely one of them. With its promising tokenomics, proven success, and upcoming catalysts, DTX is already poised to lead the market. It’s set to be more accessible to crypto investors through its enlightened, flexible way of trading.

From its humble beginnings as a meme coin in 2020, Shiba Inu turned into one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the world. People who got in early saw massive returns, with Shiba Inu’s price soaring from fractions of a cent to the moon. Those who missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO watched their friends become rich from what was once just a dog-themed joke. But here’s the good news for anyone feeling left out: you don’t have to regret missing Shiba Inu’s ICO anymore. The market is brimming with fresh opportunities, and the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term is right here: BTFD Coin. While Shiba Inu may have taken the world by storm, BTFD Coin is fast gaining traction with a standout feature: its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , which offers real utility and rewards, making it the perfect new meme coin for those who want to get in on the action. The Shiba Inu ICO: A Missed Opportunity Many Regret to This Day Back in 2020, Shiba Inu was launched at a fraction of a cent, with an initial price that made it practically impossible to ignore. As early investors took a chance on this meme-inspired project, the coin’s value surged, making it one of the most recognizable meme coins in the space. By 2021, Shiba Inu’s price had risen to a crazy degree, creating millionaires out of those who took the plunge early. The meme coin industry was never the same, and Shiba Inu set the bar for what could happen when meme coins gain massive popularity. Unfortunately, for those who didn’t take the chance when Shiba Inu’s ICO was available, the dream of grabbing cheap coins at ground level quickly slipped away. The price soared, and those who entered after the initial hype missed the boat on those massive gains. But don’t worry, the good news is that BTFD Coin is the fresh opportunity you’ve been waiting for. BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a meme coin with a fully developed Play-to-Earn game that gives holders something tangible and valuable to look forward to, making it the best new meme coin to buy and hold for the short term right now. BTFD Coin’s P2E Gaming Universe: The Best New Meme Coin to Buy and Hold for the Short Term BTFD’s Play-to-Earn game allows players to earn BTFD tokens through in-game rewards, and those rewards can be converted into real-world value. This gives BTFD Coin an edge over other meme coins, adding a layer of fun and financial opportunity that’s hard to ignore. The P2E game is just one part of the BTFD Coin ecosystem creating excitement in the community. But the real kicker here is the rewards system—holders can earn by playing the game and staking their BTFD coins for a mind-blowing 90% APY . While some meme coins rely solely on community enthusiasm, BTFD Coin is building a sustainable system that rewards its supporters in multiple ways, all while maintaining the fun and inclusive vibe that meme coins are known for. In addition to the P2E game and staking, BTFD Coin’s presale is already showing impressive numbers. With over 64 billion coins sold and more than $5.1 million raised so far, this project is rapidly gaining momentum. And with BTFD Coin still in its presale stage, now is the perfect time to jump in before the price rises and the game gets even more competitive.

Amid this market uncertainty, crypto whales appear to be accumulating Cardano (ADA) tokens, as reported by a prominent crypto expert on X (formerly Twitter). Whales Buy 90 Million ADA Token In a post on X, an expert noted that whales have purchased a significant 90 million ADA tokens in the past 96 hours, which equates to the last four days. This substantial accumulation indicates an ideal buying opportunity and potential for an upside rally. Whales have bought over 90 million #Cardano $ADA in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/MkP8PFUmzE — Ali (@ali_charts) January 12, 2025 However, the ADA price appears to be struggling and facing a decline after yesterday’s impressive gain of over 7%. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.968 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.85% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, due to the recent breakout of the bullish price action pattern, investors and traders have shown strong participation in the token, resulting in a 27.5% increase in trading volume. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Levels With the recent price decline, the ADA price has reached the breakout level, and it appears that the price has come to this level for a retest, aiming for further upside momentum. As long as the altcoin maintains itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the four-hour time frame and the $0.955 level, ADA remains bullish. Source: Trading View ADA Price Prediction Based on the recent price action, there is a strong possibility that ADA could soar by 17.5% to reach the next resistance level of $1.135 in the coming days. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neither in the overbought area nor oversold, indicating that the asset has enough room for significant upside momentum. This bullish price action pattern and recent whale activity indicate potential upside momentum and an ideal buying opportunity.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-13 00:22:48

Elon Buys Solana (ELONBSOL), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Elon Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Buys Solana launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 85b1Mza2zF6SDGXZURjeu53wdapN6W1UjFC4PAqhKE8k – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 00:26:20

Aptos price forecasts for 2025 also show considerable growth potential, fueled by its growing ecosystem. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making waves in the crypto market, having amassed an impressive $179.5 million to date and securing a staggering 2380% ROI. Its dynamic ecosystem, including the highly acclaimed X1 mobile mining app and the engaging TG Tap miner game on Telegram, is attracting a broad crypto audience. Currently, BlockDAG is swiftly advancing towards its bold $600 million target and is often cited as the best crypto right now. Litecoin Price Prediction: Is $400 Achievable Soon? Litecoin (LTC) is on the rise, breaking past a multi-year low and sparking optimism for its mid-term trajectory. Analysts have set a $400 target, supporting a bullish Litecoin price prediction for the coming months Over the recent week, LTC has climbed by 11%, showing solid support and a bullish stance. Additionally, talks of a possible Litecoin ETF by 2025 could draw institutional players, potentially elevating its market price. With positive market sentiment and strong technical indicators, the discussion around Litecoin price prediction remains focused on its substantial upside potential in the near term. What’s in Store for Aptos Price in 2025? Aptos price predictions for 2025 indicate significant promise, with experts suggesting a peak of $16.64 by year-end. The cryptocurrency’s performance is bolstered by its established ecosystem and the increasing adoption of decentralized applications. Currently priced at $9.80, Aptos demonstrates resilience, having rebounded from earlier declines and showing signs of potential further appreciation. Technical analysis suggests continued growth, with milestones like $10 and higher acting as key resistance levels. As the market finds its footing, Aptos price trends for 2025 continue to captivate both traders and long-term seekers of lucrative assets. BlockDAG’s Surge Towards $600M: A Crypto Phenomenon Gains Steam BlockDAG’s presale is breaking records as the most substantial and quickest in the market, amassing over $179.5 million towards its $600 million goal. The value of the coin has escalated by 2380% since its debut, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0248 in the latest batch, 27. Already, over 17.8 billion BDAG coins have been purchased, demonstrating robust demand and market confidence. These achievements are instrumental in the continuous growth of the ecosystem and in cementing BlockDAG’s position in the crypto scene. The BlockDAG ecosystem is flourishing, propelled by in-demand features like the X1 miner app and the TG Tap miner game. The X1 miner app allows cloud mining from mobile devices and has attracted over 300,000 active users, who can mine up to 20 BDAG coins daily. Likewise, the TG Tap miner game on Telegram has drawn in 105,000 participants, offering them a chance to earn points that can be converted into BDAG coins.

Why Web3Bay Could Permanently Transform Decentralized E-Commerce The 3BAY token is pivotal in reshaping the e-commerce ecosystem , establishing Web3Bay as a significant competitor to disrupt traditional giants like Amazon.

This token is the gateway to an innovative e-commerce ecosystem where users enjoy exclusive product access, reduced transaction fees, and loyalty incentives.

The 3BAY token catalyzes these transactions and nurtures a community-driven value system. Unlike conventional marketplaces, 3BAY token holders experience true ownership, converting shopping into an investment. Consequently, the demand for 3BAY tokens is surging, with $590K raised and over 180 million tokens already sold at just $0.0039675 each, reflecting its growing momentum.

Its user-driven approach, supported by the critical role of the 3BAY token, is redefining the operations of Web3 e-commerce. The opportunity to engage in this paradigm shift is available now—before it becomes mainstream. Final Thoughts Recent developments in Web3—from TONCASH’s innovative cashback mechanism to the collaborative efforts of Hunters of Web3 and Wilder World—underscore the blockchain’s transformative influence across various sectors. However, it’s Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce ecosystem that stands out, offering a prime opportunity for traders seeking substantial long-term benefits. The 3BAY tokens are central to driving decentralized transactions and providing unmatched rewards, setting Web3Bay on a path to disrupt established platforms like Amazon and redefine the e-commerce landscape. With the presale reaching impressive milestones—garnering over $590K and indicating a potential 6430% ROI upon launch—the growing confidence in Web3Bay’s vision is evident.

RCO Finance is positioned as a next-generation crypto project, and is emerging as a strong contender for investors looking for massive returns, with projections indicating a potential 40,000% rise. XRP’s Path to $10: XRP Price Recovery and Market Dynamics The potential for the XRP price to hit $10 is rooted in its growing adoption and favorable legal developments. Following Ripple Labs’ partial victory against the SEC, investor confidence in XRP has increased, sparking a rally that many believe could continue into 2025. XRP’s unique role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments has made it a favorite among financial institutions.

Market Competition : Other blockchain networks are also targeting the cross-border payment sector, threatening XRP’s dominance. Why RCO Finance Is Outpacing the Competition While XRP targets incremental growth, RCO Finance (RCOF) is positioned for explosive gains thanks to its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi).

Analysts predict a meteoric rise to $2 by early 2025, translating to a 40,000% return for early investors. Why the Presale Matters The RCOF presale is more than just a token sale; it’s a gateway to long-term wealth creation. Here’s why: Low Entry Point : Early adopters can secure RCOF tokens at a fraction of their projected market value. High Growth Potential : With its robust ecosystem and growing demand, RCOF is set to outshine other altcoins. Community Support : The presale is attracting a global community of investors, amplifying its growth trajectory. XRP vs. RCO Finance: Comparing the Opportunities XRP’s Strengths Institutional Adoption : Backed by financial giants. Proven Use Case : Dominates cross-border payments. RCO Finance’s Advantages Innovative Features : Combines AI with DeFi for unparalleled utility. Massive ROI Potential : Offers a 40,000% return compared to XRP’s modest gains. What This Means for Crypto Investors The choice between XRP and RCO Finance depends on your investment goals. XRP offers stability and incremental growth, making it suitable for conservative investors. And that is one of the reasons XRP price keeps increasing. Meanwhile, RCOF provides an opportunity for exponential returns, appealing to those willing to embrace higher risk for higher rewards. Many investors are turning to RCO Finance for its: Technological Edge : Innovative features that set it apart from traditional altcoins.

Meme coins named after the nascent Department of Government Efficiency — an early-stage agency devoted to cost-cutting measures under the incoming Trump administration — plummeted Sunday. One DOGE token, which formed in 2024 as a satirical take on government spending and bureaucracy, experienced a sharp 18% drop in value over the past 24 hours. See one trajectory below. Source: CoinGecko Another version of the coin, sporting a logo of a dog wearing a MAGA-like hat, also landed in the red at last check on Sunday, dropping by 20%. Source: CoinGecko The real DOGE — the actual coterie of business leaders set to eliminate bureaucratic waste — has sparked both intrigue and skepticism. The agency, to be co-led by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, initially boasted that it could slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. This week, however, Musk revised his estimate, describing $1 trillion in cuts as “an epic outcome.” Speaking on X, which he owns, Musk explained his vision: “If we try for $2 trillion, we’ve got a good shot at getting one. That would free up the economy, reduce inflation, and be, well, epic.” Watch Stagwell's CEO Mark Penn interview Elon Musk at CES! https://t.co/BO3Z7bbHOZ — Live (@Live) January 9, 2025 The tokens inspired by the agency (whose name is an acronym for Dogecoin’s trading symbol) plummeted in value in the days following Musk’s comments. “It’s very, very hard for people to care about spending someone else’s money,” Musk said, adding that federal regulations often render large projects illegal—or at least prohibitively expensive. DOGE, as it turns out, isn’t technically part of the government and holds no actual power to cut spending or enforce policies. It intends to advise the White House on what to slash . Tech journalist Kara Swisher, who has interviewed Musk in the past, wasn’t surprised by the Tesla CEO’s sudden downplaying of what the DOGE can accomplish. “Typical Musk on more things than you think,” she said in a social media post. “Over bragging and then under delivering.” Swisher cited other Musk-led initiatives (i.e., the Hyperloop, robotaxis, autonomous vehicles) as examples. “The weird part is he is fully capable of delivering good stuff when he just shuts up,” she added.

With innovation driving the crypto space forward, it’s critical to pick projects that offer not just hype but tangible value and long-term potential. Among the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term, three projects stand out: Qubetics (TICS) with its groundbreaking presale and asset tokenization solutions, Bittensor TAO as a game-changer in decentralized AI, and Arbitrum, a leader in scaling Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table. Whether it’s Qubetics’ transformative approach to real-world asset tokenization, Bittensor TAO’s pioneering AI infrastructure, or Arbitrum’s unmatched blockchain scalability, these altcoins are worth your attention. Qubetics: Redefining Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is the name on everyone’s lips right now, and for good reason. The project is currently in the 16th stage of its presale, where it has already sold over 413 million $TICS tokens to more than 14,200 holders, raising an impressive $9.3 million. At a presale price of just $0.0455 per token, this is a golden opportunity for anyone looking for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. What sets Qubetics apart is its focus on real-world asset tokenization . This revolutionary concept is about converting physical assets—think real estate, art, or even precious metals—into digital tokens on the blockchain. Imagine owning a fraction of a luxury apartment in New York or a rare painting from Paris, all through $TICS tokens. It’s not just about democratizing investments; it’s about making them accessible, transparent, and secure. Consider this scenario: A small business in Toronto wants to expand but lacks traditional funding options. With Qubetics, they can tokenize their real estate holdings, offering investors a piece of their property in exchange for capital. Similarly, a professional in Dallas could diversify their portfolio by buying tokenized shares of a wind farm in Spain. Even individuals can leverage tokenized assets to gain exposure to global markets without the usual barriers of entry. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project; it’s a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. Analysts predict potential returns of up to 32,816% ROI following its mainnet launch, making it a prime contender for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. The future of investments is here, and it’s called Qubetics. Bittensor TAO: Pioneering Decentralized AI In the world of artificial intelligence, Bittensor TAO is blazing a trail like no other. By combining blockchain with AI, Bittensor has created a decentralized network where anyone can contribute to and benefit from cutting-edge machine learning models. It’s a concept that has resonated deeply with the crypto community, cementing Bittensor TAO as one of the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. The beauty of Bittensor lies in its openness. Unlike traditional AI models that are controlled by tech giants, Bittensor’s decentralized network allows anyone to participate. Developers can train and deploy AI models, while users can access these models without the gatekeeping of centralized entities. It’s a win-win situation that democratizes AI and fosters innovation. Take, for example, a startup in Silicon Valley working on a predictive analytics tool for healthcare. Instead of building their AI infrastructure from scratch, they can tap into Bittensor’s network, saving time and resources. Meanwhile, contributors to the network earn TAO tokens for their efforts, creating an ecosystem where everyone benefits. Bittensor’s potential doesn’t stop at technology; it’s also a powerful investment opportunity. With AI becoming increasingly integrated into industries ranging from healthcare to finance, Bittensor is poised to play a pivotal role. Its decentralized approach not only challenges the status quo but also opens new avenues for collaboration and innovation. The combination of AI and blockchain is a match made in heaven, and Bittensor TAO is leading the charge. For those seeking a project with long-term viability and a strong community, this is one of the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Arbitrum: Scaling Ethereum’s Blockchain Arbitrum has quickly established itself as a key player in the crypto world, offering solutions to one of Ethereum’s most pressing challenges: scalability. By enabling faster and cheaper transactions, Arbitrum has become a favorite among developers and users alike. Its role in the Ethereum ecosystem makes it a no-brainer for anyone searching for the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Arbitrum achieves its scalability through an innovative technology called optimistic rollups. This allows it to process transactions off-chain while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum. The result is a blockchain that’s both efficient and cost-effective, without compromising on reliability. For businesses, this means they can build decentralized applications (dApps) that are not only powerful but also user-friendly. Imagine a gaming company in Austin launching a blockchain-based multiplayer game. With Arbitrum, they can ensure smooth gameplay and seamless transactions, enhancing the user experience while keeping costs low. Developers, too, are flocking to Arbitrum for its ease of use and robust infrastructure. Arbitrum’s integration with Ethereum has also bolstered its reputation. As the demand for Ethereum-based solutions continues to grow, so does the importance of scaling solutions like Arbitrum. Its ecosystem is thriving, with projects ranging from DeFi protocols to NFT platforms choosing Arbitrum as their foundation. What truly sets Arbitrum apart is its focus on community and collaboration. It’s not just about technology; it’s about building an ecosystem where developers, businesses, and users can thrive. For those looking to invest in a project with solid fundamentals and long-term potential, Arbitrum is a standout among the top altcoins to buy and hold for long term. Conclusion: Your Crypto Portfolio’s Next Big Moves The crypto market is filled with possibilities, but Qubetics, Bittensor TAO, and Arbitrum rise above the noise. Qubetics is transforming real-world asset tokenization while breaking presale records. Bittensor TAO is democratizing AI with its decentralized network, and Arbitrum is scaling Ethereum to new heights with its innovative rollups. Opportunities like these don’t come around often.

It’s constantly buzzing with innovation, offering investors endless opportunities to grow their portfolios. If you’re on the hunt for the best altcoins to invest in this month, three projects stand out: Qubetics (TICS) with its groundbreaking presale and focus on interoperability, AAVE as a DeFi giant, and Immutable X, a leader in blockchain gaming. Each of these projects has carved out a unique space in the crypto ecosystem. Whether you’re looking for revolutionary technology, financial empowerment, or gaming innovation, these altcoins deliver. Qubetics: Bridging the Gap with Interoperability Qubetics has taken the crypto world by storm, and for good reason. Currently in the 17th stage of its presale, the project has already sold over 413 million $TICS tokens to more than 14,200 holders, raising an impressive $9.3 million. At just $0.0500 per token, this is your chance to get in on one of the best altcoins to invest in this month before the price jumps by 10% this weekend. The real magic of Qubetics lies in its focus on interoperability . In a fragmented crypto world, where blockchains often operate like isolated islands, Qubetics is building bridges. Its platform is designed to allow seamless communication and data transfer between different blockchains, creating a unified ecosystem that benefits everyone. Imagine a business owner in Bogotá using Qubetics to move assets across Ethereum and Solana networks without needing third-party solutions. Or think about a developer in Lima creating a decentralized app that taps into multiple blockchains for real-time data, all thanks to Qubetics’ interoperability. Even individual users, like a crypto enthusiast in Mexico City, can enjoy hassle-free transactions across chains, eliminating the usual complexity. Interoperability isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a game-changer. It streamlines processes, reduces costs, and opens new doors for innovation. With analysts forecasting potential returns of up to 32,816% ROI post-mainnet launch, Qubetics is more than just an altcoin; it’s a revolution in the making. If you’re serious about finding the best altcoins to invest in this month, Qubetics should top your list. AAVE: Empowering Financial Freedom AAVE has earned its place as a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Launched in 2020, AAVE has revolutionized the way people interact with money by providing a platform for borrowing and lending without the need for traditional financial institutions. Its trustless, permissionless ecosystem has made it a go-to choice for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. What makes AAVE one of the best altcoins to invest in this month is its ability to adapt to user needs. Whether you’re looking to earn interest on your crypto holdings or borrow against them, AAVE offers a seamless experience. Its protocol supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, giving users the flexibility to diversify their portfolios. Picture this: a digital entrepreneur in Buenos Aires needs quick access to funds but doesn’t want to sell their crypto holdings. With AAVE, they can use their assets as collateral to secure a loan, all without jumping through the hoops of traditional banks. Similarly, a crypto investor in Santiago can deposit idle assets into AAVE’s liquidity pools, earning passive income while contributing to the ecosystem. AAVE’s user-friendly interface and robust security measures have made it a favorite among DeFi users. Its governance model, powered by AAVE token holders, ensures that the community has a say in the protocol’s future.

Game developers can use Immutable X’s platform to create, distribute, and trade in-game assets with ease. Players, on the other hand, get true ownership of their digital items, a concept that’s transforming the gaming industry.

These items can be traded or sold across platforms, giving players real-world value for their in-game achievements. For developers, Immutable X offers the tools to build and scale games without worrying about technical limitations or high costs. Immutable X’s partnerships with major gaming studios and projects have cemented its reputation as a leader in blockchain gaming. Its commitment to sustainability, with a carbon-neutral approach, further enhances its appeal to environmentally conscious gamers and investors. In a world where digital ownership is becoming increasingly important, Immutable X stands out as a project that’s not just ahead of the curve but shaping the curve itself.

Doge’s Alt Rally (DOGEALTS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DOGEALTS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Doge’s Alt Rally can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Doge’s Alt Rally could become the next viral memecoin. Doge’s Alt Rally launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Doge’s Alt Rally on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Doge’s Alt Rally by entering its contract address – BzNdWPmGnwyYrsTDbDy4hafnRpRd2AZp4ATNbJNFXmqm – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DOGEALTS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-13 01:52:26

Hoskinson clarified that IOG earned its ADA , rather than receiving it as a gift. “No ADA was ‘given’ to IOG,” Hoskinson stated. “We earned it all. It’s not the people’s money. It’s profit for building Cardano. The original value of IOG’s ADA was around [$8 million] in 2015. We’ve been here for nine years building.” See below. No ada was ""given"" to IOG. We earned it all. It's not the people's money. It's profit for building Cardano. The original value of IOG's ada was around 8 million dollars in 2015. We've been here for 9 years building. The CF was given ada as a donation. They have a mandate to… — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) January 12, 2025 Hoskinson contrasted IOG’s ADA holdings with those of the Cardano Foundation (CF), which received ADA as a donation. The foundation, he said, has a mandate to allocate those funds to ecosystem development. His comments came amid speculation about whether IOG would contribute its ADA to support the integration of Circle’s USDC stablecoin, a notion Hoskinson seemingly dismissed. You might also like: NFT market defies crypto dip, Do Kwon trial date set, North Dakota eyes Bitcoin | Weekly Recap Hoskinson: ‘Dishonest people have no place at IOG’ On Saturday, Jan. 11, Hoskinson accused a former CF employee of attempting to “rewrite history” regarding the blockchain’s integration of stablecoins. The former employee had criticized the network’s lack of progress in this area. Hoskinson clapped back: the CF missed an opportunity to integrate USDC in 2021 for $3 million, a time when the foundation’s holdings were valued at nearly $2 billion. “They turned down the deal according to their own employee,” Hoskinson said. “Then you rewrite history to eschew any of their responsibility and make it into power dynamics? I’m seriously glad you don’t work for me anymore. Dishonest people have no place at IOG.” The controversy underscores broader challenges facing Cardano in its push for wider adoption. Major stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether are reportedly hesitant to support the network, citing concerns over a lack of successful decentralized applications and insufficient transaction volume. Hoskinson’s remarks highlight ongoing tensions within the Cardano ecosystem, as stakeholders grapple with decisions that could shape the blockchain’s future. At last check on Sunday, Cardano was trading at roughly $0.96. Source: CoinGecko Cardano, which launched its mainnet in September 2017, is gearing up for an integration with BitcoinOS , which will unlock over $1.4 trillion in liquidity. The developers are also working on Midnight, a scaling project for the ecosystem. Cardano may also benefit from President-elect Donald Trump, who is expected to adopt a lighter regulatory approach toward cryptocurrencies. Whether a spot ADA ETF, or exchange-traded fund, gets introduced remains to be seen. So far, crypto commentators are optimistic.
