In Binance's latest snapshot, user balances and exchange reserves of dozens of assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, BNB, SOL, XRP, USDC, were compared. Users' Bitcoin holdings on Binance reached 617,620 BTC. This represents a 4% increase compared to November 1st. 23,768 BTC were added to user balances in the past month. The reserve ratio for BTC was recorded at 102.11%, meaning Binance holds more than enough reserves to fully cover users' BTC holdings, according to the report.

Phase 6 has reached 95% allocation, creating urgency for buyers searching for what crypto to invest in as prices prepare to jump. The current valuation of $0.035, already up 250% from the Phase 1 level of $0.01, is becoming a focal point as investors shift toward the next big crypto poised for utility-driven growth. This rising traction is strengthening the view that MUTM is the best cryptocurrency to invest in as the year closes. Cardano Struggles As Market Signals Weaken Cardano has been showing renewed stress throughout November, and its recent behavior has turned many traders away while they assess what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in for short-term upside. ADA has been sliding in a clear downtrend after dropping more than 31% this month as large wallets ease off and money flow weakens. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator has been staying below zero, signaling that capital is exiting rather than entering, although price briefly attempted a rebound. Spent coins have increased sharply, which means more ADA is moving from storage to exchanges, creating pressure on supports that were already fragile. That shift in supply has intensified concerns because ADA must reclaim $0.438 to escape the downtrend. Losing that level would expose lower zones near $0.386 and potentially $0.354 if outflows continue. Traders monitoring what crypto to buy now have noted that ADA’s bounce attempts remain unstable, and its 1.9% weekly recovery has not changed the broader structure. Consequently, attention is rotating toward new crypto projects offering stronger momentum, which is increasing the appeal of alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for buyers seeking the best crypto to invest today. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Momentum Momentum has been accelerating around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as investors rush to secure tokens before the Phase 6 allocation closes out entirely. The stage has reached 95% completion, which means only a limited window is left to accumulate tokens at $0.035. $19,150,000 has been raised since the presale began and total holder count has climbed to 18,330, reinforcing the view that MUTM is emerging as a top crypto to buy during a period of renewed investor activity. Because Phase 7 will increase the price nearly 20% to $0.04, buyers evaluating the best cryptos to buy now are responding quickly. The upcoming launch valuation of $0.06 offers current participants an attractive 380% upside, which continues to draw interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also introduced a daily 24-hour leaderboard for depositors, and the top daily participant earns a $500 MUTM bonus after completing one transaction in the same period. The leaderboard refreshes at 00:00 UTC, and this gamified approach has amplified participation. In addition, buyers have been responding strongly to Mutuum’s $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 each. Early participants have been monitoring these incentives as they explore which crypto to buy today for long-term positioning. The team has further confirmed that an independent audit by Halborn Security is underway and that the lending and borrowing contracts are in the final review stage. Beyond the presale acceleration, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been preparing its V1 protocol for release. The platform will go live on the Sepolia testnet in 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens and a liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be supported initially for lending, borrowing and collateral, shaping a streamlined DeFi crypto environment that connects flexible markets with secure execution. Urgency Behind The Final Tokens Investors scanning the market for the best crypto to invest in are reacting swiftly because Phase 6 is selling out fast and the chance to acquire tokens at this level is almost gone. The price increase in Phase 7 will close this window, and many buyers do not want to miss the last heavily discounted tier. Interested participants should act quickly to avoid entering at the higher rate.

Shares in the GPU maker skyrocketed to as much as 470% on Thursday following its initial public offering (IPO) on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, valuing the company at around RMB 282 billion ($39.9 billion). However, as the success was being celebrated online, a social media post revived claims that Moore Threads’ co-founder Li Feng borrowed 1,500 Bitcoins from Mingxing “Star” Xu, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange OKX , and never repaid the loan. Crypto past with OKX founder resurfaces In an X post, AB Kuai.Dong referenced Feng’s involvement in a 2017 initial coin offering that raised 5,000 ETH alongside controversial angel investor Xue Manzi. Feng allegedly dismissed the Bitcoin loan, stating, “It was just that Xu Mingxing’s investment in me had failed.” Xu responded to the post with a conciliatory message, writing, “People cannot always remain in the shadow of negative history. Face the future and contribute more positive energy.” He added, “Let the legal system handle the debt issue,” and offered blessings to every entrepreneur. Feng reportedly partnered with Xue Manzi and Li Xiaolai in 2017 to launch Malego Coin, which was later renamed Alpaca Coin MGD. The project reportedly raised approximately 5,000 ETH, but it was around this period that China banned ICOs, allowing regulators to crack down on what they viewed as speculative excess and potential fraud in the cryptocurrency sector. The Bitcoin loan dispute appears separate from the ICO controversy. According to sources familiar with the matter, the original loan agreement was dated December 17, 2014, with an expiry of December 16, 2016. It was subsequently renewed on March 30, 2017, with guarantees provided by Hu Zhibin. Xu previously posted publicly seeking a resolution and pursued legal action in both China and the United States. However, ambiguities due to the classification and legal status of cryptocurrencies at that time meant he never got a meaningful resolution. Moore Threads touted as China’s semiconductor champion Moore Threads, founded in 2020 by James Zhang Jianzhong, a former head of Nvidia’s China vice president who spent 14 years at the American chip giant, has positioned itself as a homegrown alternative to foreign GPU suppliers. The company’s IPO raised RMB 8 billion, around $1.1 billion. It also received regulatory approval in just 88 days, which is significantly faster than the average 470-day timeline for Chinese listings. Major investors include ByteDance , Tencent, Sequoia China, and DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, among others.

The Bitcoin price has decisively broken below the critical $90,000 psychological level, sending ripples through investor portfolios. According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, BTC is currently trading at $89,977.83. This sudden shift prompts a crucial question for every trader and holder: is this a temporary dip or the start of a deeper correction? Let’s analyze the landscape. What Triggered the Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Market movements are rarely caused by a single event. Therefore, understanding the confluence of factors is key. A sharp Bitcoin price decline often follows periods of excessive optimism or “overheating.” In this case, several potential catalysts are at play. First, broader macroeconomic uncertainty, such as shifting interest rate expectations, can trigger risk-off sentiment, impacting all risk assets including crypto. Second, large-scale sell orders from institutional whales or profit-taking after a rally can create sudden downward pressure. Finally, technical analysis levels, like the $90,000 support, act as magnets for market activity; breaking below them can trigger automated selling. How Should Investors React to BTC Volatility? Watching the Bitcoin price swing can be unnerving. However, seasoned investors know volatility is part of the crypto DNA. The key is to have a strategy rather than react emotionally. Consider these points: Review Your Portfolio Allocation: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): For long-term believers, price dips can be opportunities to accumulate at a lower average cost. Set Clear Stop-Losses: Protect your capital by defining exit points before emotions take over. Look Beyond the Price: Assess fundamental developments like network adoption and regulatory clarity, not just daily charts. Is the $90,000 Level Still Important for Bitcoin? Absolutely. Major round numbers like $90,000 serve as powerful psychological benchmarks for the market. A sustained break below this level could see the Bitcoin price test lower support zones, potentially around $85,000 or $88,000, where previous buying interest emerged. Conversely, a swift recovery back above $90,000 would signal strong buyer conviction and could invalidate the bearish breakout. Monitoring how BTC interacts with this level in the coming days will be critical for determining short-term momentum. What’s the Long-Term Outlook for Bitcoin Price? While short-term fluctuations dominate headlines, the long-term narrative for Bitcoin often remains intact. Drivers like institutional adoption through ETFs, its role as a potential hedge against inflation, and the continued development of its underlying technology provide a foundational thesis. Today’s Bitcoin price action, though significant, is a single data point in a much larger chart. History shows that Bitcoin has weathered numerous corrections exceeding 20-30% on its path to new all-time highs. In summary, the drop below $90,000 is a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. It underscores the importance of disciplined investing, thorough research, and a focus on long-term fundamentals over short-term noise. Whether this is a buying opportunity or a warning sign depends entirely on your investment horizon and strategy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why did Bitcoin fall below $90,000? A: The drop is likely due to a combination of factors including macroeconomic pressures, large investor profit-taking, and the breaking of a key technical support level, which triggered automated selling. Q: Should I sell my Bitcoin now? A> This is a personal decision based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Panic selling during dips often leads to losses. Consider your long-term strategy, portfolio allocation, and whether your original investment thesis for Bitcoin still holds true. Q: Could the Bitcoin price go lower? A> Yes, it is possible. The next key support levels to watch are around $88,000 and $85,000. Market sentiment and broader financial conditions will determine if the decline continues. Q: Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A> For investors using a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy, a lower price can be an opportunity to buy at a better average cost. However, trying to “time the bottom” is extremely difficult and risky. Q: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A> Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader crypto market. A significant drop in BTC price typically leads to declines across major altcoins, as investor sentiment and capital flow are interconnected. Q: Where can I reliably track the Bitcoin price? A> Use reputable and established cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken for real-time prices. Aggregator sites like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko also provide reliable data across multiple platforms. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price movement helpful? Market insights are best when shared.

Now, imagine a top world leader sounding a stark alarm about it. That’s precisely what’s happening. French President Emmanuel Macron has issued a critical warning, stating that easing crypto regulations in the United States could set the stage for a global financial crisis. This isn’t just political posturing; it’s a direct challenge to the regulatory direction of the world’s largest economy. Why Is Macron Sounding the Alarm on Crypto Regulations? According to a report by U.Today, President Macron expressed deep concerns about the current trajectory in the U.S. He believes rules for cryptocurrencies and, importantly, stablecoins are becoming dangerously lax. His core argument is simple: allowing this sector to grow without robust guardrails invites systemic risk. Therefore, he has urged the European Union to firmly resist following the American lead, advocating for a more cautious and structured approach to crypto regulations . What’s at Stake with Lax Financial Rules? The heart of Macron’s warning revolves around financial stability. Cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are now deeply intertwined with the traditional financial system. Here’s what could go wrong if crypto regulations are too weak: Contagion Risk: A major failure in a large crypto firm or a stablecoin de-pegging could spill over into banks and investment funds. Investor Protection: Without clear rules, retail investors are more exposed to fraud, market manipulation, and catastrophic losses. Monetary Policy Challenges: Widely adopted, unregulated stablecoins could undermine a central bank’s ability to manage the economy. Macron’s fear is that the U.S., by taking a softer stance, is exporting this instability to the rest of the world. The EU vs. US: A Clash of Crypto Philosophies? This warning highlights a growing divergence in global crypto regulations . The European Union has proactively established the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, a comprehensive set of rules for the bloc. The U.S., however, has a more fragmented approach, with ongoing debates between different regulatory bodies. Macron’s statement is a clear endorsement of the EU’s model, framing it not as a barrier to innovation but as a necessary shield for the global financial system. He positions strict crypto regulations as a prerequisite for sustainable growth, not an obstacle. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? Macron’s intervention raises crucial questions for investors and the industry. Will the U.S. reconsider its regulatory pace? How will this transatlantic tension affect global crypto companies operating in both jurisdictions? More importantly, it forces a fundamental debate: is the primary goal of crypto regulations to foster rapid innovation at any cost, or to ensure long-term stability and protect the broader economy? The path chosen will define the next decade of digital finance. In conclusion, Emmanuel Macron has thrown a stark warning into the heart of the crypto debate. His message is unambiguous: treating cryptocurrency with a light regulatory touch is a perilous gamble with global stability. As the EU forges ahead with its structured framework, the world will be watching to see if the U.S. heeds this cautionary tale or doubles down on its current course. The stakes for the financial system have never been higher. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly did Macron say about U.S. crypto rules? French President Emmanuel Macron warned that cryptocurrency and stablecoin regulations in the United States are becoming too lax. He stated that allowing the sector to grow without strict rules could lead to global financial instability. Why does Macron think this is a problem for Europe? Due to the interconnected nature of the global financial system, a crisis originating in the loosely regulated U.S. crypto market could easily spread to European banks, investors, and economies. What is the EU doing differently with crypto regulation? The EU has implemented the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, a comprehensive framework that sets clear rules for crypto issuers and service providers across all member states, aiming for harmonized consumer protection and financial stability. Are stablecoins a particular concern in this warning? Yes. Stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value, are specifically mentioned. If a major stablecoin were to fail or lose its peg in an under-regulated environment, it could trigger rapid, widespread sell-offs and liquidity crises. What can an individual crypto investor learn from this? This highlights the importance of regulatory clarity for market safety. Investors should pay close attention to the regulatory environment of the projects they support, as stronger regulations can mean reduced risk of fraud and systemic collapse. Could this warning actually change U.S. policy? While it adds significant international pressure, U.S. policy is determined domestically. However, warnings from a key ally like France could influence the debate and encourage lawmakers to consider the global implications of their decisions.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has launched a significant Dapper Labs tax investigation , marking its second major crackdown on cryptocurrency users. This move signals a new era of enforcement for digital asset holders across the country. What is the Dapper Labs Tax Investigation All About? The CRA is specifically scrutinizing users of Dapper Labs, the Vancouver-based company behind the Flow blockchain and popular NFT projects like NBA Top Shot. According to reports from The Block, this is part of a broader effort where Canada has already recovered a staggering 100 million Canadian dollars from crypto-related tax probes over three years. The agency is now deepening its focus. This Dapper Labs tax investigation isn’t a random audit. It targets individuals who may have failed to report income or capital gains from their NFT transactions. The CRA obtains user data from exchanges and platforms, then cross-references it with tax filings. If discrepancies exist, you could face penalties, interest, or even legal action. Why Are NFT Transactions a Tax Target? Many users mistakenly believe NFT trading is a tax-free activity. However, the CRA treats cryptocurrencies and NFTs as commodities, not currency. This means every transaction is a taxable event. Here’s a simple breakdown of your potential tax obligations: Buying an NFT with CAD: Not a taxable event. Your cost basis is established. Selling an NFT for CAD: Taxable. You must report the capital gain (selling price minus cost basis). Trading one NFT for another: Taxable. This is considered a ‘barter transaction’ equal to selling the first asset. Earning NFTs or crypto: Taxable as income at fair market value when received. The complexity and volume of transactions on platforms like those built by Dapper Labs make them a prime focus for the CRA’s data-matching programs. How Can You Stay Compliant Amidst the Crackdown? Facing a Dapper Labs tax investigation can be daunting, but proactive steps can protect you. First, gather all your transaction history. Export your complete records from Dapper Labs wallets, NBA Top Shot, or any other Flow-based platform you use. Next, calculate your gains and losses accurately. You may need specialized crypto tax software or an accountant familiar with digital assets. Remember, the onus is on you to report correctly. If you discover past errors, consider using the CRA’s Voluntary Disclosures Program to correct them before they find you, which can reduce penalties. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto in Canada? This investigation is a clear warning shot. The CRA is investing heavily in technology and expertise to track crypto transactions. Their success in collecting 100 million CAD proves their methods are effective. For the average user, this means the ‘wild west’ days of unreported crypto gains are ending. However, this also brings legitimacy. Clear tax frameworks can encourage broader institutional adoption. The key is education. Understanding your obligations turns a potential liability into a manageable part of your financial portfolio.

Jupiter launched Jupiter Lend in August, and it has already grown to $1 billion in TVL. The Solana lending market is currently valued at around $5 billion, a number that is significantly dwarfed by Ethereum’s $50 billion and the trillions in TradFi collateral markets. Solana Foundation’s president does not mind the competition Lily Liu, president of the Solana Foundation , referenced the current valuation of Solana’s lending market in her post. That gap is what is fueling the competitive landscape in Solana’s lending sector. While it has led to rapid innovation, tensions have been rising between protocols vying for dominance. “Hey @kamino @jup_lend, Love you both,” she wrote . “…We can snipe at one another (one click lending position conversion; dunking on sloppy remarks; etc) or we can focus on capturing market share from all of crypto and then Tradfi beyond that.” As the Solana Foundation executive is concerned, competition has always been healthy for the space, but it is crucial not to lose sight of the main goal, which is capturing more market share from Ethereum and TradFi. Why are Kamino Finance and Jupiter Lend feuding? Jupiter Lend had had to contend with accusations that the protocol misled users about the platform’s risk isolation and rehypothecation practices, with critics (mostly founders from rival protocols like Kamino and Fluid) claiming that Jupiter Lend falsely advertised its vaults as completely isolated, an act that could potentially expose the broader DeFi space to contagion during market stress. While Kash Dhanda, Jupiter Lend’s co-founder, admitted that the initial “zero contagion” assertion was not 100% accurate, the executive insisted that rehypothecation occurs to generate yields on collateral, but the risk remains limited and contained at the asset level. As far as Kamino’s founder, Marius is concerned, Jupiter Lend’s vaults enable full inter-asset exposure that could undermine confidence in the entire Solana DeFi ecosystem. The executive has publicly criticiz ed Dhanda’s Jupiter Lend for “misleading users.” Fluid’s founder Samyak Jain pointed out that the platform’s vaults actually reuse user collateral for yield optimization, contradicting the notion of full isolation.

Sounds revolutionary, right? However, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo delivers a crucial reality check. The true challenge for asset tokenization isn’t just creating digital versions—it’s ensuring those tokens can actually trade. Without liquidity, even the most innovative tokenized assets remain stuck in digital limbo. What’s the Real Barrier for Asset Tokenization Growth? In a recent interview, Domingo highlighted a common misconception. Many believe that tokenizing an asset automatically makes it liquid. This is fundamentally incorrect. He uses clear examples to make his point. Tokenizing shares in a Manhattan building doesn’t magically create buyers. Digitizing a rare Pokémon card collection won’t build a trading market. The token is simply a new form of ownership. The underlying asset’s market demand determines its liquidity. Therefore, the current expansion in asset tokenization focuses on assets that already possess deep markets. Which Assets Are Leading the Tokenization Charge? The market is growing smartly by starting with what works. Domingo notes that platforms are prioritizing highly liquid traditional assets. This strategic approach builds credibility and infrastructure. Major examples include: Cash and Cash Equivalents: Stablecoins and tokenized money market funds. U.S. Treasurys: Government bonds with established, global demand. By tokenizing these assets first, the industry proves the technology’s reliability for settlement and ownership. It creates a foundation of trust. This foundation is essential before tackling more complex, illiquid assets. Can Technology Eventually Solve the Liquidity Puzzle? Domingo remains optimistic about the future. He suggests that technological advancements could gradually improve liquidity for a wider range of tokenized assets. However, this won’t happen overnight. Potential solutions on the horizon include: Advanced decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with better price discovery. Automated market makers (AMMs) designed for unique assets. Improved interoperability between different trading platforms. The key insight is that technology can enhance market efficiency, but it cannot create demand where none exists. The success of asset tokenization hinges on marrying innovative tech with fundamentally desirable assets. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors and Builders? Domingo’s analysis provides crucial guidance for anyone involved in the digital asset space. The focus must shift from mere digitization to market creation. For investors, this means looking beyond the tokenization headline. Scrutinize the underlying asset’s existing market depth. For developers and entrepreneurs, the mandate is clear: build tools and platforms that specifically enhance trading and price discovery for tokenized real-world assets. The journey of asset tokenization is just beginning. While transforming illiquid assets into digital tokens is a powerful concept, Carlos Domingo rightly points out that liquidity is the non-negotiable fuel for growth. The industry’s current path—tokenizing liquid assets first—is a pragmatic strategy to build a sustainable future. The ultimate promise of a fully tokenized world depends on solving this core challenge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘liquidity’ mean in asset tokenization? A: Liquidity refers to how easily and quickly a tokenized asset can be bought or sold in the market without significantly affecting its price. High liquidity means many buyers and sellers. Q: Does tokenizing an asset automatically increase its value? A: No. Tokenization changes the form of ownership, not the intrinsic value. The asset’s value is still determined by its underlying fundamentals and market demand. Q: Why are U.S. Treasurys a popular choice for tokenization? A> They are already highly liquid, trusted globally, and have a massive existing market. Tokenizing them adds efficiency (like 24/7 settlement) to an already successful asset. Q: Can a tokenized illiquid asset ever become liquid? A> It’s possible but difficult. Technology can improve market access, but liquidity ultimately requires a broad base of willing buyers and sellers, which depends on the asset’s perceived value. Q: What’s the main benefit of tokenizing an already liquid asset? A> It introduces blockchain efficiencies—such as faster settlement, reduced intermediaries, and programmable features—to traditional finance, potentially lowering costs and increasing accessibility.

If you’ve been in the crypto space for a few years, you might remember this name as a trailblazer. But what does this shutdown really mean for the ecosystem and, more importantly, for you? Let’s break down the announcement and explore the future beyond zkSync Lite . What is the zkSync Lite Shutdown All About? The official announcement came via the platform X, where zkSync stated it will phase out the zkSync Lite service in the coming year. Crucially, the team framed this not as a failure, but as a natural evolution. They explained that zkSync Lite has “already served its purpose” and that its retirement will not impact the operations of the main zkSync Era network. This is a key point for user confidence. Launched back in 2020, zkSync Lite (originally known as zkSync 1.0) holds a special place in history as Ethereum’s very first ZK rollup. It provided vital early scaling solutions, enabling features like: Fast and cheap token transfers Basic NFT minting and trading A proof-of-concept for secure, scalable Layer 2 technology Why is zkSync Lite Being Phased Out? Think of this like upgrading from an old, reliable flip phone to a modern smartphone. The flip phone served its purpose perfectly, but technology has moved on. The same is true for zkSync Lite . The newer zkSync Era network, which launched in 2023, is simply a more advanced, full-featured successor. Therefore, maintaining two parallel networks is inefficient. Here are the core reasons behind the decision: Technological Supersession: zkSync Era offers a fully-fledged, EVM-compatible smart contract platform, while Lite was primarily for payments. Resource Consolidation: The development team can focus all its energy on improving and securing the single, more powerful zkSync Era chain. User Migration: Encouraging all activity to move to the more capable network creates a stronger, unified ecosystem. What Should zkSync Lite Users Do Now? First, don’t panic. The shutdown is scheduled for next year, which gives everyone ample time to prepare. The most important action is to migrate any assets you still have on the zkSync Lite network over to zkSync Era or back to Ethereum Mainnet. The zkSync team will undoubtedly provide clear, step-by-step guides and tools for this process as the deadline approaches. For developers who built on Lite, this is a call to action to port your applications to zkSync Era. The newer platform’s EVM compatibility makes this transition far smoother than it would have been otherwise. This consolidation ultimately benefits everyone by pooling liquidity and users into one vibrant ecosystem. The Bigger Picture: What This Means for Ethereum Scaling The retirement of zkSync Lite is a sign of a healthy, maturing technology stack. It shows that the ZK rollup space is evolving rapidly, with early prototypes making way for production-ready solutions. zkSync Era, along with competitors like Starknet and Polygon zkEVM, are now battling it out in the arena of general-purpose ZK rollups. This move reinforces a critical lesson for the crypto industry: successful innovation often means knowing when to sunset older systems to focus on the future. The core promise of zkSync Lite —scaling Ethereum securely with zero-knowledge proofs—is not dying; it’s being fulfilled on a grander scale. Conclusion: A Graceful Exit for a Pioneer The planned zkSync Lite shutdown marks the end of an important chapter in Ethereum’s scaling journey. It was the proof that ZK technology could work in practice, paving the way for everything that has followed. While it’s always bittersweet to see a pioneer step aside, this transition is a net positive, signaling growth, confidence, and a focused path forward for the zkSync ecosystem. Users have time to adapt, and the entire community can now rally behind the more powerful zkSync Era network. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will zkSync Lite shut down? A: The official announcement states “next year,” but a specific date has not been provided yet. The team will announce the exact timeline well in advance. Q2: Will I lose my funds if they are on zkSync Lite? A: No. You will not lose funds. You will need to migrate your assets (tokens, NFTs) off the Lite network before the shutdown date using official migration tools. Q3: Does this affect the zkSync Era network or the ZK token? A: No. The shutdown is specifically for the older zkSync Lite network. The zkSync Era chain continues operating normally, and this decision is unrelated to the ZK token’s functionality. Q4: Why not keep both networks running? A: Maintaining a secure blockchain network requires significant resources. Sunsetting Lite allows the developers to concentrate all security and innovation efforts on the superior zkSync Era network. Q5: How do I migrate my assets from zkSync Lite? A> The zkSync team will release detailed instructions and user-friendly migration portals. Keep an eye on their official blog and social channels for updates. Q6: What happens to NFTs minted on zkSync Lite? A: You will need to migrate them to zkSync Era or Ethereum Mainnet to ensure they remain accessible and tradable after the shutdown.

According to a fresh analysis from K33 Research, the answer might be yes. The firm sees a high probability of a Bitcoin rebound materializing as early as December, suggesting the current downturn could be setting the stage for a significant recovery. This perspective offers a beacon of hope for investors navigating the recent market volatility. Why Does K33 Research Predict a Bitcoin Rebound? K33 Research’s optimistic outlook for a Bitcoin rebound is not based on mere speculation. Instead, it stems from a detailed examination of current market mechanics. The analysts point to specific on-chain and derivatives data that signal the selling pressure is exhausting itself. While the market has faced headwinds, the underlying structure appears resilient, paving the way for a potential upward shift. What’s Driving the Current Selling Pressure? To understand the potential for a rebound, we must first look at what caused the dip. K33 identifies two primary sources of recent selling pressure: Net ETF Outflows: U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have experienced periods of net outflows, creating consistent sell-side pressure in the market. Reduced CME Activity: Trading volume on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), a key venue for institutional Bitcoin futures, has declined. This indicates reduced institutional speculative activity in the short term. However, the crucial insight is that these factors are now seen as temporary rather than structural. The Bullish Case: Key Factors Supporting a BTC Recovery Despite the selling, several powerful factors are aligning to support a Bitcoin rebound . K33 highlights these critical bullish signals that mitigate the downward pressure. Is Low Leverage a Hidden Strength? One of the most encouraging metrics is the low leverage burden across the market. Unlike previous cycles where excessive borrowing amplified crashes, the current correction has occurred with relatively low leverage. This means there are fewer forced liquidations to trigger a cascading sell-off. The market has been de-risking, which creates a more stable foundation for the next leg up. Where is Bitcoin’s Strong Support Zone? Technical and on-chain analysis points to a formidable support zone between $70,000 and $80,000. This price range represents a massive concentration of investor cost basis, meaning many buyers entered the market here. This area acts as a psychological and economic floor, where buying interest historically intensifies, making a sustained drop below it less probable. Could Policy Changes Fuel a Structural Uptrend? Beyond technicals, K33 expects a “structural uptrend” to be driven by macro policy shifts. The evolving regulatory landscape in major economies like the U.S. is increasingly seen as moving toward clearer, more crypto-friendly frameworks. Positive regulatory clarity has always been a powerful catalyst for institutional capital inflows, which could supercharge the next Bitcoin rebound . What Does This Mean for Investors Before December? The analysis suggests a strategic perspective for market participants. The approach of December, often a seasonally positive month for asset prices, combined with the identified technical supports, creates a compelling setup. For investors, this period of consolidation may represent an accumulation opportunity ahead of the anticipated Bitcoin rebound . In summary, K33 Research provides a data-driven case for optimism. While short-term flows have caused friction, the core market structure remains healthy with strong support, low systemic risk from leverage, and a favorable policy horizon. December is pinpointed not as a guarantee, but as a high-probability window for this positive momentum to manifest, potentially marking a decisive turn from correction to recovery. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main reason K33 predicts a Bitcoin rebound in December? K33’s prediction is based on a combination of factors: the exhaustion of selling pressure from ETFs, a strong support zone ($70K-$80K), low market leverage reducing crash risk, and expectations of positive crypto policy changes that could drive a structural uptrend. What does “low leverage burden” mean for Bitcoin’s price? A low leverage burden means fewer traders have used borrowed money (leverage) to buy Bitcoin. This is positive because it reduces the risk of a cascade of forced sales (liquidations) if the price drops slightly, making the market more stable and less prone to sharp, exaggerated crashes. Why is the $70,000 to $80,000 range considered a strong support zone? This price range is where a significant amount of Bitcoin was previously bought. As the price approaches this zone, many of those buyers are likely to either hold firm or buy more to average their cost, creating concentrated buying interest that acts as a price floor. How could crypto-friendly policy changes impact Bitcoin? Clearer, supportive regulations reduce uncertainty for large institutions and traditional finance players. This can lead to increased institutional investment, new financial products, and greater mainstream adoption, all of which drive demand and can positively impact Bitcoin’s price. Should I invest based on this December rebound prediction? This analysis is a perspective, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your financial goals and risk tolerance. Predictions are probabilistic, and markets can remain volatile. What are the risks to this bullish outlook? Key risks include unexpected negative regulatory news, broader macroeconomic downturns affecting all risk assets, a prolonged period of ETF outflows, or a break below the identified key support zone that could trigger further selling.

The first Bitcoin Casascius was dormant for 13.2 years and moved 1,000.0028 BTC, while the second Casascius was dormant for 14 years and its output was 999.99998110 BTC. The overall value of the 2,000 BTC equates to around $180 million. On the same day, a total of 8 BTC was redeemed from other Bitcoin Casascius coins. It’s unclear who the owners of the high-value BTC Casascius are. The purpose of the redemption could be a sale or a simple transfer to preserve asset access due to physical damage. In 2025, the Bitcoin space saw a number of Casascius coins moving after a decade of dormancy. Cryptopolitan reported the redemption of 100 BTC from a Casascius back in July. In late October, another early Bitcoiner released 9.5 BTC from nine Casascius. What is a Bitcoin Casascius? A Bitcoin Casascius is a physical collectible item, usually made form silver or gold. The item was created by Mike Caldwell, a Utah based entrepreneur, back in 2011. According to the Casascius Bitcoin Analyzer website, the collectibles were sold as coins or bars. Coins carried as low as 0.1 BTC to 1,000 BTC, while bars had a minimum of 100 BTC up to 1,000 BTC per bar. Each Casascius worked as a Bitcoin cold storage device. Each physical coin and bar had a public Bitcoin address. Inside the coin or bar, there’s a redeemable private key, protected by a tamper-evident hologram. Once the hologram is removed, it leaves a honeycomb pattern as proof of access. Some Casascius are advanced and have an encrypted private key. Owners of such collectibles must decrypt the private keys using a passphrase to redeem the bitcoins. Caldwell sold 27,912 Casascius coins and bars, funded with digital bitcoins. The items contain a total of 98,483.9 BTC. In late 2013, Caldwell stopped selling physical coins and bars that contained digital bitcoins. At the time, US FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) said he was acting as an unregistered money transmitter. According to a post from X user Sani, a total of 17,835 BTC Casascius remain unopened. They carry 36,467 bitcoins worth $3.29 billion. Dormant BTC continue to move this year. Sani shared a post showing 16 transactions moving 14-year-old BTC. A total of 64 BTC worth $5.7 million moved from various wallet addresses. Unknown entities moved the coins in a span of two days. In the past hour, 7 BTC moved for the first time in over a decade across four transactions.

This substantial movement comes as the ENA token continues to establish itself in the competitive DeFi landscape, raising important questions about what such large-scale transactions mean for ordinary investors and the broader market. What Exactly Happened with the ENA Withdrawal? According to blockchain analytics platform Onchain Lens, an address beginning with 0x631e executed a withdrawal of 25 million ENA tokens from Bybit approximately 15 minutes before this report. The transaction, valued at $7.05 million, represents a significant movement of assets from a centralized exchange to what appears to be a private wallet. This isn’t the first time this particular address has made headlines – it now holds a staggering 779.89 million ENA tokens worth approximately $270 million. For those new to cryptocurrency tracking, such large withdrawals often signal several possible scenarios. The movement could indicate: Long-term holding strategy by the project team Preparation for future developments or partnerships Asset security measures moving funds from exchanges to secure storage Vesting schedule adjustments for team or investor tokens Why Should ENA Investors Pay Attention? Large transactions from project-affiliated addresses always warrant careful observation. When Ethena Labs or associated entities move substantial amounts of ENA tokens, it can provide valuable insights into the project’s internal strategy and confidence levels. The current holding of $270 million in ENA by this single address represents a significant portion of the token’s circulating supply, potentially influencing market dynamics. Market analysts typically watch for patterns in such transactions. A withdrawal from an exchange like Bybit often suggests the holder doesn’t plan to sell immediately, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal. However, it’s crucial to consider the broader context of the ENA ecosystem and current market conditions before drawing definitive conclusions. Understanding Ethena Labs’ Position in the Market Ethena Labs has emerged as an innovative player in the decentralized finance space, with ENA serving as its governance and utility token. The project’s unique approach to synthetic dollars and yield generation has attracted considerable attention from both retail and institutional investors. Large token movements like this $7.1 million withdrawal naturally spark discussions about: Token distribution and supply dynamics Team confidence in their own project Future development plans that might require token allocation Market sentiment indicators based on insider activity It’s worth noting that while the address is “suspected” to belong to Ethena Labs, blockchain analysis provides strong circumstantial evidence based on transaction patterns, interaction with known project addresses, and the sheer scale of holdings. Practical Implications for ENA Token Holders For current and prospective ENA investors, understanding these large transactions is more than just market gossip – it’s fundamental to making informed decisions. The removal of $7.1 million worth of ENA from Bybit’s exchange liquidity could potentially affect: Trading liquidity on the exchange Price volatility in the short term Market perception of token scarcity Future price support levels based on holding patterns However, experienced traders know that single transactions, no matter how large, should be considered alongside broader market trends, project developments, and overall cryptocurrency market conditions. The true significance often reveals itself over time through pattern recognition rather than isolated events. The Bigger Picture: What This Means for ENA’s Future Looking beyond the immediate transaction, this $7.1 million withdrawal tells a story about Ethena Labs’ operational maturity and strategic planning. Large-scale asset management demonstrates sophisticated treasury management practices, which is increasingly important as regulatory scrutiny intensifies across the cryptocurrency sector. Furthermore, the decision to hold $270 million in ENA tokens rather than converting to stablecoins or other assets suggests strong conviction in the project’s long-term value proposition. This alignment of interests between the project team and token holders can be a positive signal for ecosystem health and sustainable growth. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, transparency around large transactions becomes increasingly valuable for all participants. While complete anonymity was once the norm, projects like Ethena Labs that operate with greater transparency around major movements help build trust and credibility in the broader DeFi ecosystem. Conclusion: Navigating ENA’s Evolving Landscape The $7.1 million ENA withdrawal from Bybit represents more than just a large transaction – it’s a window into the strategic thinking and operational patterns of one of DeFi’s emerging leaders. While individual investors should never base decisions solely on single transactions, understanding these movements provides valuable context for assessing project health and market dynamics. The most successful cryptocurrency investors combine on-chain data analysis with fundamental research and market awareness. As Ethena Labs continues to develop its ecosystem and the ENA token matures, watching how project-affiliated addresses manage their substantial holdings will remain an important piece of the investment puzzle. Frequently Asked Questions What is Ethena Labs? Ethena Labs is a decentralized finance protocol that issues USDe, a synthetic dollar protocol built on Ethereum. The ENA token serves as the governance and utility token within their ecosystem. Why would Ethena Labs withdraw ENA from Bybit? Possible reasons include long-term holding strategy, preparation for future ecosystem developments, enhanced security measures, or adjustments to token vesting schedules. Large withdrawals from exchanges often indicate the holder doesn’t plan immediate selling. How does this affect ENA’s price? While large withdrawals can reduce immediate selling pressure and exchange liquidity, price impact depends on multiple factors including overall market conditions, trading volume, and broader investor sentiment toward the project. Is it confirmed this address belongs to Ethena Labs? The address is “suspected” to belong to Ethena Labs based on blockchain analysis patterns, transaction history, and the scale of holdings. While not officially confirmed, the evidence strongly suggests project affiliation. Should I buy or sell ENA based on this news? Investment decisions should never be based on single transactions. Consider this information as part of comprehensive research including project fundamentals, market conditions, and your individual investment strategy. How can I track similar transactions? Blockchain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens, Etherscan, and specialized DeFi tracking tools allow users to monitor large transactions and wallet activities across various networks.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a crucial barometer of investor sentiment, has remained frozen at a score of 20. This signals a state of ‘Extreme Fear’ that has persisted, creating a tense atmosphere for Bitcoin and altcoin holders alike. Understanding this index is not just about reading a number; it’s about decoding the market’s collective psychology and making smarter investment decisions. What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Right Now? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index from Alternative.me acts as the market’s emotional heartbeat. A score of 20, unchanged from the previous day, sits deep in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This metric ranges from 0 (maximum fear) to 100 (maximum greed). When the index lingers this low, it often indicates that investors are selling assets based on emotion rather than fundamentals, which can sometimes create contrarian buying opportunities for the disciplined trader. How Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? This sentiment gauge isn’t a simple guess. It’s a sophisticated composite of several market factors. The index provides a data-driven snapshot of crowd psychology by analyzing: Volatility (25%): High price swings, especially to the downside, increase fear. Market Volume (25%): Trading activity and momentum are key indicators. Social Media (15%): The tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Direct polling of market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Shifts in Bitcoin’s market share relative to altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Search interest for terms like ‘Bitcoin crash’ or ‘crypto bull run’. Why Should You Care About Extreme Fear in Crypto Markets? History shows that periods of extreme fear often precede significant market rebounds. However, they can also indicate deeper, systemic issues. A persistently low Crypto Fear & Greed Index score suggests widespread caution, which can lead to reduced liquidity and increased volatility. For long-term investors, this environment tests conviction. For traders, it presents both risk and potential opportunity. The key is to avoid panic and develop a strategy that aligns with your risk tolerance. Actionable Insights: Navigating a Fearful Market So, what can you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index screams extreme fear? First, avoid making impulsive decisions. Use this time for research and portfolio review. Consider dollar-cost averaging to build positions gradually. Furthermore, extreme fear can depress prices below their intrinsic value, allowing savvy investors to accumulate assets at a discount. Always remember, the crowd is often wrong at emotional extremes. The Bottom Line on Today’s Market Sentiment The stagnant Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 20 is a clear signal that uncertainty reigns. While fear is a natural part of market cycles, successful investing requires separating emotion from analysis. This index is a tool, not a crystal ball. Use it to gauge the market’s temperature, but base your decisions on solid research and a clear financial plan. The market will eventually transition from fear to greed; the question is whether you’ll be positioned correctly when it does. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 20 mean? A score of 20 falls into the ‘Extreme Fear’ category. It indicates that market participants are predominantly fearful, which is often associated with selling pressure and negative sentiment across social media and trading platforms. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a good predictor of price? It is a sentiment indicator, not a direct price predictor. However, historically, sustained periods of extreme fear have sometimes preceded market bottoms, while extreme greed has often coincided with market tops. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is typically updated once per day. The website Alternative.me provides the current reading, which is based on the previous 24 hours of market data. Should I buy when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows extreme fear? ‘Buying the fear’ is a common contrarian strategy, but it carries significant risk. It should only be considered as part of a diversified strategy and never with funds you cannot afford to lose. Always conduct your own research. Can the index be used for altcoins, or is it just for Bitcoin? While the index’s calculation heavily weights Bitcoin-specific data (like its dominance), it is widely used as a proxy for overall cryptocurrency market sentiment, which heavily influences altcoin prices. Where can I check the current Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The primary source is the website Alternative.me. Many major cryptocurrency news and data platforms also display the current index value on their market analysis pages.

If you trade CME Bitcoin futures, you saw a significant opening: a $395 gap. This isn’t just a random blip on the screen. For seasoned traders, a CME Bitcoin futures gap is a powerful signal that demands attention. It reveals the hidden tension between the 24/7 crypto world and traditional market hours, often setting the stage for the week’s price action. Let’s break down what this gap means and why it’s a critical piece of the trading puzzle. What Exactly Is a CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? Simply put, a CME Bitcoin futures gap is the empty space on a price chart between Friday’s closing price and Monday’s opening price. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where these regulated futures trade, closes for the weekend. However, the Bitcoin spot market never sleeps. This creates a disconnect. Friday Close: CME futures settled at $89,425. Weekend Activity: Bitcoin’s spot price moved freely on global exchanges. Monday Open: CME futures reopened, adjusting to the new weekend reality at $89,820. The $395 difference between these two points is the gap. It visually represents the price movement that occurred while the futures market was offline. Why Do These Gaps Matter for Bitcoin Traders? Gaps are more than just a chart curiosity; they often act like magnets for price. Many traders operate on the theory that these gaps have a high probability of being “filled.” This means the futures price may eventually retrace to trade in the price range it skipped over. Therefore, a gap can present both a risk and an opportunity. For instance, a gap up (like this week’s) suggests bullish sentiment built over the weekend. However, if that momentum fades, the price might pull back to “fill” the void left on the chart. Traders monitor these levels closely for potential entry or exit points, making the CME Bitcoin futures gap a key technical feature. What Causes a Large CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? The size of the gap is directly tied to weekend volatility in the Bitcoin spot market. A quiet weekend typically leads to a small or non-existent gap. A large gap, like this $395 one, tells a story of significant movement. Potential drivers include: Major News Events: Regulatory announcements or macroeconomic data released over the weekend. Spot Market Volatility: Large buy or sell orders on global crypto exchanges. Sentiment Shifts: Changing investor perception driven by social media or analyst reports. Essentially, the gap quantifies the market’s reaction to events that the CME futures price couldn’t incorporate in real-time. How Can Traders Use This Information? Understanding the CME Bitcoin futures gap provides a strategic edge. It’s not a guaranteed prediction, but it highlights a high-probability zone for price action. Savvy traders might: Watch for a Fill: Monitor price action to see if it moves back toward the $89,425 level. Assess Momentum: Determine if the weekend’s bullish or bearish sentiment is continuing or reversing. Manage Risk: Use the gap area as a reference point for setting stop-loss or take-profit orders. Remember, while gaps often fill, they don’t always do so immediately. The price could continue moving away from the gap before eventually returning. The Bottom Line on This Week’s $395 Signal This week’s CME Bitcoin futures gap is a clear footprint of weekend buying pressure. It shows that institutional and retail traders were actively accumulating Bitcoin while traditional markets were closed. The crucial question now is whether this optimism will sustain or if profit-taking will pull the price back to fill the void. By keeping an eye on this $395 zone, you align your analysis with a well-established market phenomenon, turning a simple chart pattern into a actionable insight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do all CME Bitcoin futures gaps get filled? A: While a high percentage do eventually fill, it is not a 100% certainty. Price can sometimes continue trending away from the gap for an extended period before any retracement occurs. Q: How long does it typically take for a gap to fill? A: There’s no set timeframe. A gap can fill within hours, days, or even weeks. It depends on overall market conditions and momentum. Q: Is the CME the only exchange with futures gaps? A> No, any futures market that closes while its underlying asset (like Bitcoin) continues trading 24/7 can experience gaps. However, the CME gap is particularly watched due to its high volume and institutional participation. Q: Can a gap provide a guaranteed trading signal? A> No, it should not be used in isolation. Always use gap analysis alongside other technical indicators, volume data, and fundamental news for a comprehensive trading strategy. Q: What does a “gap down” mean? A> A gap down occurs when Monday’s opening price is below Friday’s close. This indicates selling pressure and bearish sentiment over the weekend, and traders watch for potential fills to the upside.

We’ve had 4% GDP growth in a couple of quarters,” Bessent told’ Face the Nation’. “We’re going to finish the year, despite the Schumer shutdown, with 3% real GDP growth.” Holiday spending drives U.S. economic growth According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis , gross domestic product dropped by 0.6% year-over-year between jan and March 2025. The second quarter of the year saw a 3.8% increase . BEA is expected to publish initial economic results for the third quarter by December 23. Just a few days ago, an estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta put third-quarter annual GDP growth at 3.5%. Consumer spending remains a key driver of the economy, accounting for nearly 70% of the U.S. GDP. However, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index stood at 53.3 in December—up 4.5% from November but down 28% compared with last year. Inflation continues to impact households. The latest report, delayed by the government shutdown, showed consumer prices rising 3% year-over-year in September, including a 3.1% increase in the cost of food at home. President Donald Trump has dismissed concerns over Americans’ financial struggles . “The word ‘affordability’ is a con job by the Democrats,” he said during a cabinet meeting. “The word ‘affordability’ is a Democrat scam.” Lately, voters have expressed frustration with Trump’s handling of the economy. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, according to a recent poll. When asked about Trump’s comments on Sunday, Bessent said that the administration was dealing with inflation issues leftover from the Biden administration and pointed to media coverage as a source of Americans’ views of the economy. “The American people don’t know how good they have it,” he said. “Now, Democrats created scarcity, whether it was in energy or over-regulation, that we are now seeing this affordability problem, and I think next year we’re going to move on to prosperity.” Trade talks with China keep key agreements on track On related developments, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer says China has been adhering to the terms of the bilateral trade agreements, and Washington continues to closely monitor Beijing’s commitments to maintain a stable trade relationship. “With China, it’s always a matter of verifying, monitoring, and tracking commitments. These commitments are very specific,” Greer said Sunday on Fox News’ The Sunday Briefing . “All of the agreements we’ve reached with China recently are concrete, easy to monitor, and so far, we are seeing that they are in compliance.” Greer noted that China has fulfilled roughly “a third” of its soybean purchase obligations for the current growing season. Previous reports indicate that following a series of orders in late October—the first of this season—China’s purchases of U.S. soybeans appeared to slow. In late October, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to extend a tariff truce, roll back certain export controls, and reduce other trade barriers. However, several components of the deal—including soybean purchases, the sale of social media app TikTok, and expanded licenses for exporting critical rare earths from China—are still underway. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Greer held a video call with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng on Friday, according to China’s state-run news agency Xinhua, during which the officials had an “in-depth and constructive” discussion in which they vowed to keep stable ties and address “respective concerns” on trade and the economy. On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that China is not expected to accelerate its soybean purchases, though they are still anticipated to occur during this crop season.

Brevis, a leader in ZK verification, has officially launched the ProverNet mainnet beta . This isn’t just another technical release; it’s the debut of a decentralized marketplace designed to solve a fundamental bottleneck in how ZK proofs are generated and accessed. For developers and protocols, this launch marks a pivotal shift towards more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective verification. What Exactly is the ProverNet Mainnet Beta? Think of the ProverNet mainnet beta as a new digital bazaar, but instead of goods, it trades in cryptographic certainty. Brevis has built a decentralized network where anyone can request a ZK proof and a network of specialized provers can compete to generate it. The core innovation is its auction mechanism, called TODA (Truthful and Asymptotically Optimal Double Auction). This system efficiently matches proof requests with the best available prover, addressing a key pain point: no single prover setup is optimal for every type of proof. This beta launch on Base, with USDC payments, is the first real-world test of this ambitious model. Why is This Launch a Game-Changer for Developers? The existing landscape for ZK proofs often forces developers into a one-size-fits-all approach, which can be inefficient and expensive. The ProverNet mainnet beta introduces crucial benefits: Optimized Performance: The TODA mechanism dynamically finds the most suitable prover for each job, improving speed and reducing costs. Decentralized Reliability: By moving away from a single point of failure, the network becomes more robust and censorship-resistant. Simplified Access: Developers can tap into a ready marketplace instead of building complex proving infrastructure from scratch. Brevis is already migrating its own production workloads, starting with Ethereum block execution proofs from ETHProofs.org, proving its real-world utility from day one. What’s Next for ProverNet and the BREV Token? The ProverNet mainnet beta is just the beginning. A significant collaboration with AltLayer is underway to transition the entire marketplace to a dedicated, app-specific rollup. This move will supercharge its performance and scalability. Furthermore, the official mainnet launch will see the introduction of the BREV token. BREV will become the lifeblood of the ecosystem, serving as the native currency for all payments and for staking within the network, aligning incentives for all participants. Conclusion: A New Chapter for ZK Verification The launch of the ProverNet mainnet beta is a bold step toward a more modular and efficient future for blockchain. By creating a competitive, decentralized marketplace for truth, Brevis is not just launching a product; it’s laying the groundwork for a new standard in how trust is computationally verified across Web3. The success of this beta will be closely watched, as it has the potential to unlock a new wave of scalable and privacy-preserving applications. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is ProverNet? A: ProverNet is a decentralized marketplace launched by Brevis where users can request zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and a network of providers can generate them, using an efficient auction system for optimal pricing and performance. Q: What does ‘mainnet beta’ mean? A: It means the core marketplace is live and functional on the Base blockchain (mainnet), but it’s still in a testing and optimization phase before the full, official launch. Q: How are payments handled on ProverNet? A: During the beta, payments for proof generation are settled in USDC on the Base network. After the full launch, the native BREV token will be used. Q: What is the BREV token used for? A: Upon mainnet launch, the BREV token will be required for paying for proofs and for staking within the ProverNet ecosystem to participate in the network’s security and operations. Q: What is the collaboration with AltLayer about? A: Brevis is working with AltLayer to migrate ProverNet to its own dedicated rollup. This will make the marketplace faster, cheaper to use, and more scalable as an application-specific blockchain. Q: Who can use ProverNet? A: It is designed for blockchain developers, protocols, and applications that need to generate ZK proofs for verification, data availability, or privacy features without managing their own proving infrastructure.

A significant wave of liquidity is about to hit the market. This week, from December 8th to 14th, a series of crucial key token unlocks are scheduled, collectively worth over $75 million. Understanding these events is vital for managing your portfolio and anticipating potential market movements. Let’s break down the details and explore what these unlocks mean for you. What Are This Week’s Key Token Unlocks? According to data from Tokenomist, several major projects will release previously locked tokens into circulation. These key token unlocks can increase selling pressure or signal growing project activity. Therefore, monitoring them provides a critical edge. Here is the detailed schedule for the upcoming week: December 10, 11:00 a.m. UTC: 1.38 billion LINEA tokens ($10.75M), representing 6.76% of its circulating supply. December 11, 4:00 p.m. UTC: 11.31 million APT tokens ($19.23M), or 0.83% of its supply. December 13, 12:00 a.m. UTC: 20.81 million CHEEL tokens ($10.82M), representing 2.86% of its circulating supply. December 15, 12:00 a.m. UTC: A dual unlock featuring 127 million STRK tokens ($14.13M) and 1.32 million CONX tokens ($21.25M). Why Should You Care About These Unlocks? Token unlocks are not merely calendar events; they are fundamental economic shifts. When a large volume of tokens held by early investors, team members, or foundations becomes tradable, it directly impacts supply and demand. A sudden influx of new tokens can dilute the value if demand doesn’t keep pace. However, these events are also a normal part of a project’s lifecycle, funding development and rewarding early supporters. The key token unlocks this week, especially the substantial $21.25 million CONX release, warrant close observation for any unusual trading volume or price volatility. How Can Investors Navigate Token Unlock Weeks? Facing a week packed with key token unlocks requires a strategic approach. First, review your portfolio to see if you hold any of the affected assets. Second, analyze historical data: how did the token’s price behave after previous unlocks? Third, consider the unlock’s size relative to the average daily trading volume; a large unlock on a low-volume token can be more disruptive. Finally, avoid panic selling. Instead, use this information to make informed decisions about entry points, exit strategies, or setting stop-loss orders. Knowledge of these schedules is a powerful tool for risk management. What’s the Big Picture for CONX and Other Tokens? The spotlight this week falls heavily on CONX, with its $21.25 million unlock representing 1.61% of its circulating supply. While the percentage seems modest, the absolute dollar value is significant. Investors should watch for announcements from the CONX team regarding the unlock’s purpose. Are the tokens going to ecosystem development or early investors? The intent behind the unlock often influences market sentiment more than the event itself. Similarly, the LINEA unlock, at nearly 7% of circulation, is another major event to monitor closely. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Ahead In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, being proactive beats being reactive. The scheduled key token unlocks this week are a perfect example of fundamental data that can influence short-term price action. By understanding the schedule, the magnitudes involved, and the potential market psychology, you position yourself to navigate volatility more confidently. Remember, not all unlocks lead to price drops, but they all create a moment of market reassessment. Keep this guide handy as you watch the markets from December 8th to 14th. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token unlock? A: A token unlock is when previously locked or vesting cryptocurrency tokens are released and become available for trading on the open market. These are often allocated to team members, investors, or for ecosystem rewards. Q2: Do token unlocks always cause the price to drop? A: Not always. While increased supply can create selling pressure, the price impact depends on overall market sentiment, the unlock’s size relative to daily volume, and why the tokens are being released. Sometimes, unlocks are anticipated and have minimal effect. Q3: Where can I find a reliable token unlock schedule? A: Platforms like Token Unlocks, Tokenomist, and CoinMarketCap provide calendars and data on upcoming token release events for various cryptocurrencies. Q4: Is the $21.25M CONX unlock a reason to sell? A: It’s a reason to pay attention, not necessarily to panic sell. Assess the project’s fundamentals, recent news, and your own investment strategy. Consider if the unlock was already priced in by the market. Q5: What was the largest unlock by value this week? A: The CONX unlock at $21.25 million is the largest single unlock by dollar value mentioned for this period, followed by APT at $19.23 million. Q6: How often do these major unlock events happen? A: Most projects have multi-year unlock schedules with periodic releases (monthly, quarterly, annually). Weeks with multiple major unlocks across different projects, like this one, are common but require investor diligence. Found this guide to the week’s key token unlocks helpful?

This week delivers a packed economic calendar that could significantly influence market sentiment and asset prices. From the Federal Reserve’s pivotal interest rate decision to critical labor market data, these releases hold the power to shape trading strategies and portfolio decisions. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters to you. Why This Week’s Key Financial Events Matter for Your Portfolio Economic data releases and central bank announcements are fundamental drivers of market volatility. They provide insights into the health of the economy and future policy direction, which directly affects asset valuations. For crypto investors, these key financial events often correlate with broader risk appetite. A hawkish Fed, for instance, can strengthen the dollar and pressure risk assets like Bitcoin. Therefore, marking your calendar for these moments is not just for traditional traders—it’s essential for anyone with skin in the game. December 9th: The JOLTS Report Kickstarts the Week The week begins with the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) at 3:00 p.m. UTC. This report offers a deep dive into labor market dynamics beyond just unemployment numbers. What it measures: The number of job openings, hires, quits, and layoffs. Why it’s important: The Federal Reserve watches this data closely. A high number of job openings can signal wage pressure and persistent inflation, influencing their policy stance. Market Impact: A stronger-than-expected report could reinforce a “higher for longer” interest rate narrative, potentially dampening risk sentiment. The Main Event: Fed Rate Decision and Dot Plot (Dec. 10) Without a doubt, the most critical of this week’s key financial events is the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The sequence of releases is vital: 7:00 p.m. UTC: Interest rate decision, FOMC statement, and the updated “dot plot” of economic projections. 7:30 p.m. UTC: Press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Markets will dissect every word. The focus will be on whether the Fed signals an end to its hiking cycle and hints at potential rate cuts in 2024. The “dot plot” is a visual chart of each Fed official’s interest rate forecast, providing crucial clues about the committee’s future path. Powell’s press conference often moves markets more than the statement itself, as he clarifies the Fed’s thinking. Follow-Up Data: Jobless Claims and the Fed’s Balance Sheet The action continues on December 11th with two more significant releases. First, at 1:30 p.m. UTC, the weekly Initial Jobless Claims data arrives. This is a high-frequency indicator of labor market health. A sustained rise in claims could suggest cooling, which the Fed might view favorably in its fight against inflation. Later, at 9:30 p.m. UTC, the Federal Reserve releases data on reserve balances and its balance sheet. This is a key metric for understanding the implementation of monetary policy. For crypto markets, changes in liquidity conditions (reflected in the balance sheet) can impact the availability of capital flowing into digital assets. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Week How should you prepare for these key financial events ? First, expect heightened volatility around the release times. Consider adjusting leverage or setting wider stop-losses if you are an active trader. Second, listen for the narrative. Is the Fed emphasizing data dependence? Are they concerned about growth or still laser-focused on inflation? This narrative will set the tone for weeks to come. Finally, remember that markets often react to the deviation from expectations, not just the raw data. Watch the “whisper numbers” and analyst consensus forecasts. Conclusion: Your Roadmap for a Volatile Week This week’s economic calendar is a powerful reminder that macroeconomic forces and central bank policy remain fundamental to all financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. By understanding these key financial events —from the JOLTS report to the Fed’s dot plot—you equip yourself with the knowledge to interpret market moves and make more informed decisions. Stay alert, manage your risk, and use this information as your roadmap through what promises to be a pivotal period for global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why should crypto investors care about the Fed’s interest rate decision? A: Interest rates influence the strength of the US dollar and global risk appetite. Higher rates typically strengthen the dollar and can lead to outflows from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, as safer yields become more attractive. Q: What is the ‘dot plot’ and why is it important? A: The dot plot is a chart summarizing the interest rate projections of all Federal Reserve officials. It provides a visual forecast of where the committee thinks rates are headed, offering invaluable insight into future monetary policy. Q: How quickly do markets react to these data releases? A> Markets react within seconds to major data and Fed announcements. The most volatile period is usually in the first few minutes after a release, as algorithms and traders digest the information. Q: Can good economic news be bad for the stock and crypto markets? A> Yes, in the current environment. Strong economic data, like high job openings, can convince the Fed to maintain higher interest rates for longer to combat inflation, which can be a headwind for risk assets. Q: Where can I find the official times and releases for these events? A> The Federal Reserve and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics websites publish official calendars. Many financial news platforms and market data terminals also provide real-time economic calendars. Did you find this guide to the week’s key financial events helpful?

Interestingly, the government agency reported that no criminal charges have been filed against anyone since 2020. CRA has been initiating efforts to uncover a considerable amount of unpaid taxes . Following their findings, they discovered that approximately 40% of taxpayers using cryptocurrency platforms have neither filed their taxes nor complied with the regulations properly. Concerning this situation, sources noted that documents connected to a Vancouver crypto firm demonstrated that the current major challenge that the federal government faces is struggling to address tax evasion. It also disclosed that the government is struggling to handle cases of illegal financing linked to cryptocurrencies. Sources with knowledge of the matter attempted to explain that some of the reasons for this struggle are due to the limited enforcement resources available in a place famous for its anonymity. The CRA team raises concerns regarding crypto taxpayers In a September CRA application submitted to the Federal Court, Canada’s Minister of National Revenue raised concerns regarding taxpayers’ use of the underground economy, fueled by cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), to evade their tax responsibilities. Considering the intense nature of the situation, the CRA’s key crypto auditor pointed out in related documents that they believe the country has not yet adopted a reliable method for identifying taxpayers operating in the crypto industry and ensuring that these taxpayers strictly adhere to the income tax reporting requirements. Therefore, the team called for the urgent need to implement effective measures to curb the situation. In an attempt to play a role in this initiative, the CRA went to the Federal Court to seek permission to disclose the identities of thousands of customers from Dapper Labs Inc., a prominent firm in the NFT sector. This company also operates its own blockchain and provides its clients with crypto wallets, which are essential for storing digital assets. When it was informed of the investigation, sources close to the matter revealed that the firm did not refuse to cooperate with the process. However, documents highlighted that the CRA initially wanted information concerning Dapper’s leading 18,000 users. After talks with company officials and their lawyers, this figure was reduced to 2,500 users. Notably, this move marked the second time a court has requested a Canadian crypto company to submit details about its clients in an investigation focused on exposing potential tax evaders. This kind of requirement is known as an “unnamed persons requirement” and is usually conducted under the Income Tax Act . Meanwhile, in an affidavit from Predrag Mizdrak, a project leader in the agency’s digital compliance and audit support division, he noted that the cryptoasset ecosystem commonly engages in the underground economy. Mizdrak made these remarks after his affidavit pointed out that the agency’s efforts to ensure crypto platforms comply with the guidelines put forth so far illustrated a substantial lack of compliance in this area. He also mentioned that previous data showed that around 15% of Canadian taxpayers using cryptoasset platforms have either failed to file their taxes on time or have not filed them at all. Moreover, the agency reports that 30% of users who file tax returns on time are considered high risk for non-compliance. The increased cases of non-compliance in the crypto space ignite controversy Mizdrak’s affidavit highlighted that the preference for using cryptoassets increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This rise resulted in more compliance issues for the CRA due to the habit of individuals hiding their identities in the cryptocurrency world, the high volume of transactions carried out, and the streamlined process of creating accounts on various cryptocurrency platforms across different countries. This finding raised concerns about safety in the ecosystem. To ease tension, the agency issued an email statement noting that it has 35 auditors in its cryptoasset program, who have been assigned to handle more than 230 cases and collect considerable taxes through audits. This included $100 million earned in the last three years. They also mentioned that between 2020 and early 2025, five criminal investigations related to digital assets had been commenced, with four still active as of March. Still, no charges have been filed. The agency explained, “The CRA’s criminal investigations are complicated and often take years to finish.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This crucial metric provides investors with an objective snapshot of market dynamics, and right now, it’s painting a clear picture: we’re firmly in Bitcoin’s territory. What Exactly Is the Altcoin Season Index? Think of the Altcoin Season Index as the crypto market’s thermometer. CoinMarketCap calculates this score by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin itself. The process is straightforward but powerful. It tracks whether each altcoin has beaten Bitcoin’s returns over a quarter. The index score represents the percentage of these top 100 coins that have outperformed. A score of 75 or above officially signals an “ altcoin season .” Therefore, the current reading of 18 tells us that only a small fraction of major altcoins are keeping pace with the king of crypto. This isn’t just a number—it’s a strategic insight for every portfolio. Why Is a Score of 18 Significant for Crypto Investors? A low Altcoin Season Index score isn’t inherently bad news, but it defines the current playing field. When the index lingers below 25, the market is experiencing a pronounced “Bitcoin season.” Capital and investor sentiment are heavily concentrated in BTC, often driven by macroeconomic factors like ETF approvals or institutional interest. For altcoin holders, this period can test patience. However, understanding this cycle is key. Historically, prolonged Bitcoin dominance often precedes a rotation of capital into altcoins. The index acts as your early warning system for that potential shift. How Can You Use the Altcoin Season Index in Your Strategy? Smart investors don’t just watch the Altcoin Season Index ; they use it. This metric should inform your risk management and timing. Diversification Balance: A low index suggests weighting your portfolio more heavily toward Bitcoin. As the index rises, you can gradually increase your altcoin exposure. Accumulation Phase: For long-term believers in specific altcoins, a low index period can present a strategic accumulation opportunity, allowing you to buy before potential broader market rallies. Sentiment Gauge: The index objectively measures market hype versus reality. It helps answer the critical question: “Is the altcoin rally real, or is it just a few outliers?” Remember, the goal isn’t to predict the exact day the season changes, but to be prepared when the evidence starts to build. When Will the Altcoin Season Return? This is the million-dollar question. While no one has a crystal ball, the Altcoin Season Index gives us the framework to watch. The shift typically requires a catalyst. Often, it’s Bitcoin achieving a new stable high, which gives investors confidence to seek higher returns in smaller-cap projects. Other triggers include major protocol upgrades, regulatory clarity for specific altcoin sectors, or a surge in decentralized application usage. The key is monitoring for a sustained climb in the index above 50, not just a brief spike. Consistent improvement over weeks is a stronger signal than a one-day jump. Conclusion: Patience and Preparation Are Key CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index at 18 delivers a clear, data-driven message: patience is paramount. The crypto market moves in cycles, and we are currently in a phase that highlights Bitcoin’s strength. Instead of fearing this number, use it. Let it guide a disciplined strategy—whether that means securing Bitcoin profits, researching fundamental altcoin projects for your watchlist, or dollar-cost averaging into your high-conviction picks. The season will turn, and those who understand the metrics will be ready to act. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Where can I find the current Altcoin Season Index? A: You can find the live Altcoin Season Index on the CoinMarketCap website, typically within their research or market analysis sections. Q: Does a low index mean all altcoins are performing poorly? A: Not necessarily. It means less than 25% of the top 100 are outperforming Bitcoin. Some individual altcoins may still have strong rallies, but they are the exception, not the rule. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A: The index is typically updated daily, reflecting the rolling 90-day performance window. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins if the index is low? A> A low index is a signal, not a sell command. Your strategy should depend on your investment horizon and belief in a project’s fundamentals. It may be a reason to rebalance, not necessarily panic sell. Q: Has the index ever been wrong? A> The index is a historical metric, not a predictor. It accurately shows what HAS happened. It cannot guarantee future performance, but it is a reliable indicator of prevailing market trends. Q: What other indicators should I pair with this index? A> For a fuller picture, consider Bitcoin dominance charts, total altcoin market capitalization trends, and trading volume analysis across different sectors.

Leading cryptocurrencies such as Ripple’s XRP and Solana (SOL) remain close to their support levels, tempting traders who realize that moments of panic offer some of the best buying opportunities. Although the unconfirmed floor for SOL’s recent downturn and the ‘supply in losses’ metric for XRP may indicate uncertainty, they also indicate opportunities that only focused traders can seize. However, despite the prevailing downtrend, with many cryptos such as SOL testing their lows, there is something that is bucking this trend. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly going ahead, despite the prevailing negative sentiment in the crypto space, as this new altcoin keeps rising despite the prevailing downturn. Due to its runaway success in its presale stage, its DeFi use case, and its early contributors lining up for its V1 launch, MUTM is rapidly being seen as the best crypto to buy in such high-fear moments and a new crypto coin that continues outperforming even during market panic. XRP Targets Massive Breakout as Long-Term Patterns Emerge XRP is being seen with fresh bullish interest as experts indicate that a strong break-out may be in the offing, with long-range charts showing projections of lofty break-out to as high as $10-$20. Further boosts also come with more investments being channeled into the XRP ETF, as well as with increasing strength within the wider crypto market, thus fueling the hope for recovery. Models for technical analysis, most specifically the Fibonacci extending keys, indicate that this may end up realizing as much as a lofty gain of 1,200% above its present position if this strength keeps gaining pace. And as more traders begin seeking fresh investment with lofty upside alongside XRP, more are beginning to look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising new crypto coin, especially for those searching for the best crypto to buy in uncertain conditions. Solana Battles Key Support as On-Chain Metrics Go Bearish Solana (SOL) is currently trading below $130 as a result of this recent shock in the market, although this degradation was well underway before Bitcoin suffered its fall. Network activity has been down for weeks, the number of users is down to 3 million, DEX trading is slowing, and TVL is still in free fall, demonstrating that this is a net outflow of capital. SOL is struggling to support this range of $121-$128, although a move down into the $100 area still may happen because of its MACD/RSI conditions. However, Solana’s reputation for rapid bounce backs once user activity picks up may lead to a reversal. With increasing stress being applied to the leading alts, some buyers are studying Mutuum Finance, which is more strongly trending as the best crypto to buy for dip-focused buyers and also a new crypto coin that continues building momentum. Mutuum Finance Nears Significant Mark as Presale Breaks $19.15 Million Mutuum Finance is on the cusp of a critical phase of its presale as the demand picks up across all levels. Starting from as low as $0.01 in Phase 1, MUTM has progressed to its present valuation of $0.035 in Phase 6, working its way up to launch with the initial value of $0.06. At this point, Mutuum is offering a discount of almost 50% before launch, which in turn, gives a cumulative increase of almost 600% since the presale launch. At this stage, the sale of the token has managed to attract more than $19.15 million from more than 18,330 participants, situating Mutuum Finance amongst the most successful early-stage cryptocurrencies launched thus far in the year 2025. With stage 6 already beyond the allocation of more than 95%, the offer of this project will soon run out, as stage 7 will come with a 20% increase in the form of a higher priced unit that will sell for $0.04. Quick Sellout in Phase 6 Represents Gathering Market Interest Phase 6 intensifies its acceleration with a speed consistent with the increasingly optimistic views of Mutuum Finance’s fundamental strengths. Starting with its presale model, based on fixed allocation units with increasingly higher phase prices, this design’s purpose was always meant to facilitate as many early participants as would be possible, with quick sellouts of every stage. Starting with its launch entry position of merely $0.01 in Phase 1, through its present value of $0.035, MUTM already boasts a sharp increase of 250% before its eventual listing value of $0.06. Platform Resilience One of the most important components of the Mutuum Finance infrastructure is its sophisticated pricing system, designed to retain a high level of accuracy regardless of unpredictable market conditions. Mutuum Finance derives its valuation system through the use of oracles provided by Chainlink, which gives the network real-time value estimates of essential assets in terms of USD, ETH, MATIC, as well as AVAX. To facilitate this, Mutuum Finance incorporates fallback oracles, data feeds, as well as on-chain prices. Such an integrated approach helps facilitate fair borrowing, lending, and liquidation practices, providing users with a reliable and trustworthy space as the protocol gets ready for the next level of development. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $19.15 million from 18,330+ contributors, surged to $0.035 as Phase 6 nears sell-out, offers unmatchable strength, pace, along with legitimate DeFi functionality, thus considered the best crypto to buy during market fear and a new crypto coin positioned for massive upside. Buy MUTM before the rate jumps to $0.04 in Phase 7 soon.

The Bittensor network is poised for a pivotal moment. On December 14th, the Bittensor halving will officially take place, fundamentally altering the economics of its native TAO token. This event cuts the daily issuance of new TAO coins in half, a move that could have significant implications for investors and the broader AI crypto sector. Let’s break down what this means and why it matters. What Exactly Is the Bittensor Halving? Simply put, a halving is a pre-programmed event in a blockchain’s code that reduces the reward for mining or validating new blocks. For Bittensor, this translates to a direct cut in the creation of new TAO tokens. According to the report, the daily issuance will drop from 7,200 TAO to just 3,600 TAO. This mechanism is designed to control inflation and increase scarcity over time, mirroring the economic model of Bitcoin. Therefore, starting December 14th, the flow of new TAO into the market will be drastically reduced. This built-in scarcity is a core feature that many investors watch closely, as it directly impacts the token’s supply dynamics. Why Does This Bittensor Halving Matter for TAO’s Price? Basic economic principles suggest that if demand remains steady or grows while new supply shrinks, upward pressure on price can follow. The Bittensor halving is a classic supply shock event. However, the market’s reaction is never guaranteed and depends on several factors. Reduced Selling Pressure: Fewer new tokens issued daily means less potential sell pressure from miners and validators needing to cover operational costs. Perceived Scarcity: The event highlights TAO’s deflationary design, potentially attracting long-term investors seeking assets with controlled supply. Market Sentiment: Halvings are often viewed as bullish catalysts, which can drive positive sentiment and increased trading activity around the date. At the time of writing, TAO is trading at $277.81. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the upcoming supply change is a fundamental variable that every TAO holder must consider. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges This Bittensor halving presents a mix of potential and uncertainty. For the network, it’s a test of maturity and a step towards its long-term economic vision. A successful transition can reinforce confidence in Bittensor’s decentralized AI marketplace. However, challenges exist. The reduced block reward could impact miner/validator participation if the TAO price doesn’t adjust accordingly. Moreover, the broader crypto market conditions will play a massive role. A bullish macro environment could amplify the halving’s positive effects, while a bearish trend could dampen them. Actionable insight? Treat this as a key learning moment. Understand the mechanics, watch the on-chain data post-halving, and avoid making decisions based solely on hype. The real impact often unfolds in the weeks and months following the event. The Final Verdict on Bittensor’s Pivotal Moment The December 14th Bittensor halving is more than just a date on the calendar; it’s a fundamental shift in the token’s issuance policy. By slashing the daily supply of TAO, the network embraces a scarcer, more deflationary model. This event underscores Bittensor’s commitment to a sustainable economic structure as it continues to pioneer decentralized artificial intelligence. While short-term price movements are unpredictable, the halving solidifies TAO’s value proposition as a capped-supply asset within the high-growth AI crypto niche. For savvy investors, it represents a critical point to assess the network’s health and long-term trajectory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What time will the Bittensor halving occur on Dec. 14? The exact block height or UTC time is typically specified by the network. Follow Bittensor’s official channels for the precise moment. Will my existing TAO tokens be affected? No. Your held TAO tokens are safe. The halving only changes the rate at which new TAO is created and rewarded to network participants. How does this compare to Bitcoin’s halving? The concept is identical: reducing block rewards to control inflation. However, the timelines, tokenomics, and the underlying technology (AI vs. digital gold) are different. Could the halving cause network security issues? It’s a consideration. If validator rewards become too low, it could impact participation. The network relies on the TAO price and fee market to compensate and maintain security. Where can I track halving data and metrics? Use blockchain explorers for Bittensor and reliable crypto data aggregators that track issuance rates and network activity. Found this guide to the Bittensor halving helpful?

The platform has frozen a staggering 2.6 billion won, equivalent to $2 million, in digital assets directly linked to fraudulent activity. This action highlights a critical shift towards proactive protection in the cryptocurrency space. How did Upbit freeze these assets? Financial News broke the story on December 8th, revealing the scale of the operation. The exchange, operated by Dunamu, identified suspicious transactions and immediately moved to secure the funds. This is not a simple account lock. Upbit is now deploying its proprietary on-chain technology to trace the entire movement of these digital assets, even after they left the platform. What is the On-Chain Tracking Service (OTS)? This is where Upbit’s technical expertise shines. The On-chain automatic Tracking Service (OTS) is their secret weapon. Think of it as a high-tech detective for blockchain transactions. Here’s what makes it effective: Automated Surveillance: The system constantly monitors transaction flows for patterns associated with scams or money laundering. Proactive Action: It allows Upbit to freeze assets quickly, preventing criminals from cashing out. Deep Tracing: The service can follow the digital trail across multiple wallets and blockchains, increasing recovery chances. This technology represents a significant upgrade from reactive measures to a proactive security stance. Why is this action by Upbit so important? When a major exchange like Upbit freezes assets, it sends a clear message to the entire ecosystem. It demonstrates that illicit activity will face serious consequences. For users, this builds essential trust. It shows that platforms are investing heavily in security, not just trading features. Furthermore, it sets a legal and operational precedent for other exchanges worldwide to follow. What are the challenges in tracking crypto fraud? While the move to freeze assets is commendable, the path isn’t easy. The pseudonymous nature of blockchain can shield bad actors. Criminals often use mixers or chain-hopping techniques to obscure the money trail. International jurisdiction also complicates recovery efforts. However, tools like Upbit’s OTS are specifically designed to cut through these obstacles, making life harder for fraudsters. What can users learn from this incident? This event is more than just news; it’s a learning opportunity. It underscores the importance of using reputable, compliant exchanges that prioritize security. Users should always enable two-factor authentication and be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. The fact that Upbit could freeze these assets also highlights that crypto transactions are more traceable than commonly believed. In conclusion, Upbit’s decision to freeze $2 million in assets is a landmark moment. It showcases the growing maturity of the cryptocurrency industry, where security and regulatory compliance are becoming non-negotiable. This action protects victims, deters future fraud, and reinforces the legitimacy of digital asset exchanges. The relentless tracking effort proves that the industry is fighting back, making the ecosystem safer for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can Upbit legally freeze user assets? A: Yes. The terms of service users agree to typically grant exchanges the right to freeze accounts and assets if they suspect illegal activity, such as fraud or money laundering, to comply with financial regulations. Q2: What happens to the frozen assets now? A: The assets are locked and inaccessible. Upbit, likely in cooperation with South Korean authorities, will investigate. If the fraud is proven, the assets could be returned to victims or seized by the state. Q3: Does this mean all my crypto is safe on Upbit? A> While this action shows strong security measures, no platform is 100% immune. User safety also depends on personal security practices like using strong passwords and avoiding phishing scams. Q4: How does on-chain tracking actually work? A: It analyzes the public blockchain ledger. Every transaction leaves a permanent record. Sophisticated software can cluster wallet addresses and analyze flow patterns to link them to known fraudulent entities or suspicious behavior. Q5: Will this affect Upbit’s other users or trading? A> For legitimate users, there should be no negative impact. In fact, it may increase overall platform security and trust. Trading operations continue as normal. Q6: Should I be worried if I’m not involved? A> Not at all. This is a positive development. It targets criminals, not regular users. It makes the exchange and the broader crypto environment safer for your investments. Found this deep dive into how Upbit tackles fraud insightful? Help spread awareness about crypto security!

Their target? The burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, with a specific focus on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). This announcement sends a clear message to the global market: China’s crypto ban is not just active; it’s intensifying. What Exactly Did the Chinese Financial Groups Warn Against? On December 5th, a united front including the China Internet Finance Association made their position crystal clear. According to state media Xinhua, they explicitly warned the public against participating in or supporting any transactions involving RWA tokenization . However, their warning cast a much wider net. The groups declared all cryptocurrency-related business activities as illegal within China’s borders. This comprehensive prohibition includes: Stablecoin operations and transactions Cryptocurrency airdrops and promotions Digital asset mining activities Any platform facilitating RWA tokenization Why is RWA Tokenization a Major Concern for China? The specific mention of RWA tokenization is significant. This process involves converting rights to a physical asset—like real estate, art, or commodities—into a digital token on a blockchain. Globally, it’s seen as a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized technology. For Chinese regulators, however, it represents a potential threat to financial stability and monetary sovereignty. The associations emphasized a core legal principle: virtual assets do not possess the same status as the official Chinese Yuan. They cannot be used as a lawful means of circulation in the economy. This fundamental distinction is at the heart of China’s restrictive policy. Is This a New Policy or a Reinforced Stance? This warning is not an isolated event. It acts as a powerful reinforcement of existing policy. The statement directly follows earlier announcements from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) regarding a strict crackdown on illegal virtual asset activities, particularly those involving stablecoins. Therefore, the December 5th warning serves a dual purpose: Clarification: It removes any ambiguity about the legality of new crypto concepts like RWA tokenization . Deterrence: It aims to deter both domestic participants and foreign entities from testing the boundaries of China’s regulations. What Are the Global Implications of This Warning? China’s position creates a fascinating dichotomy in the global crypto landscape. While other major economies are working on regulatory frameworks for RWA tokenization and digital assets, China is drawing a firm line. This stance influences global markets in several ways. It limits a massive pool of potential users and capital from participating in certain crypto sectors. Conversely, it may accelerate innovation and adoption in regions with more favorable regulations. For international projects involved in RWA tokenization , the message is clear: the Chinese market remains strictly off-limits under current rules. Any attempt to circumvent these regulations risks severe penalties. Conclusion: A Unwavering Stance in a Shifting World The coordinated warning from seven financial associations underscores China’s consistent and uncompromising approach to cryptocurrency. By explicitly naming RWA tokenization alongside mining and stablecoins, authorities are closing potential loopholes before they widen. For investors and industry observers, this development reaffirms that navigating the crypto space requires careful attention to jurisdictional boundaries. China’s path remains distinctly separate, prioritizing state control over financial innovation in the digital asset realm. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is RWA tokenization? A1: RWA tokenization is the process of converting ownership rights of a physical, real-world asset (like property, gold, or invoices) into a digital token that can be traded on a blockchain. Q2: Why is China specifically warning against RWA tokenization? A2: Regulators see it as a high-risk activity that could undermine financial stability, facilitate capital flight, and challenge the monopoly of the official Chinese currency. Q3: Does this mean all crypto activity is illegal for Chinese citizens? A3: Yes. The warning reiterates that all cryptocurrency-related business activities are illegal. However, owning crypto assets as a personal holding in a foreign jurisdiction exists in a legal gray area, though accessing platforms to trade them is blocked. Q4: How does this warning affect global crypto markets? A4: It reinforces China as a closed market, which can impact liquidity and sentiment for projects focused on RWA tokenization and other sectors. It may also push innovation to other regions. Q5: Have there been any recent crackdowns? A5: Yes. The People’s Bank of China has recently announced intensified crackdowns on illegal activities involving virtual assets, indicating ongoing enforcement. Q6: Could China’s policy on crypto ever change? A6: While always a possibility, the consistent and escalating nature of these warnings suggests a change is unlikely in the near to medium term. The state’s priority remains control over its financial system. Found this analysis of China’s critical stance on RWA tokenization insightful? The regulatory landscape is constantly shifting.

Macron has in the past sought to project a robust European front in dealing with China, while being careful not to antagonize Beijing, whose growing assertiveness is testing trade, security, and diplomatic ties, analysts say. Noah Barkin, a China analyst with Rhodium Group, recently said Macron must make it clear to China’s leadership that Europe will respond to growing economic and security threats from Beijing, while preventing an escalation of tensions that could lead to a full-blown trade war and diplomatic breakdown. “This is not an easy message to deliver,” Barkin said. In an interview publishe d on Sunday by the French daily Les Echos, Macron said he urged China to increase cooperation on what he called “unsustainable” global trade imbalances, as well as on geopolitical issues and environmental concerns . “I tried to explain to the Chinese that their trade surplus is unsustainable because they are killing their own customers, particularly by no longer importing much from us,” Macron said in an interview published on Sunday by French daily Les Echos. “I told them that if they do not react, we Europeans would be forced, in the coming months, to take strong measures following the example of the United States, such as imposing tariffs on Chinese products,” he added. Economic risks mount as trade deficit threatens European industry The European Union’s goods trade deficit with China has increased almost 60% since 2019; France’s trade balance with the $19 trillion economy continues to widen. Macron had long advocated for a unified European stance on China and had been calling for measures to protect European producers from Chinese imports. Macron said the U.S. protectionism and China are both striking at the core of our industrial and innovation model. And that, he said, was the worst-case scenario: he added that they had become the adjustment market. Macron warned that it was a matter of life or death for European industry. If the trade imbalance persists, analysts caution, Eurozone GDP growth could be significantly affected. Countries with well-established industrial sectors, including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, face significant vulnerabilities because the influx of cheaper Chinese goods could undercut domestic manufacturers and reduce profits in crucial sectors. There’s more risk than just trade. Persistent deficits could weaken innovation capacity, as European firms face fewer resources to invest in research and development, possibly leading Europe to fall behind in high-tech sectors. Economists also suggest that the imbalance would exacerbate regional economic disparities in the EU, making a unified approach more challenging. Ongoing exposure to Chinese competition, according to some forecasts, could reduce Eurozone GDP growth by as much as 0.5 percent over the next decade. Macron urges China to invest and open markets Macron also said he was proposing a more conciliatory approach towards China, such as the dismantling of restrictions on European exports of semiconductor machinery and limitations on Chinese exports of rare earths. He encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Europe and to “create value and opportunities for Europe.” Macron highlighted that partnerships with Chinese firms could help modernize key industrial sectors, while also promoting sustainable development and technology transfer. Partnerships with Chinese firms, according to Macron, will facilitate the modernization of key industrial sectors and promote sustainable development and technology transfer. Macron also pitched the approach as a win-win situation: Europe is provided with capital and high-tech collaboration, while Chinese investors, through skilled labor and established markets, gain access.

According to live data from Binance’s USDT trading pair, BTC is currently trading at $91,012. This powerful move marks a significant moment for investors and signals renewed bullish momentum in the cryptocurrency market. But what’s fueling this impressive rally, and is the momentum sustainable? What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? The leap past $91,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to create this bullish environment. First, institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial firms increasing their exposure. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are pushing investors toward perceived stores of value like Bitcoin. Finally, positive sentiment around upcoming network developments is contributing to the optimism. Therefore, this price action reflects a combination of long-term confidence and short-term trading dynamics. Key Levels and Market Sentiment for BTC Breaking through the $91,000 level is psychologically important for traders. This area often acts as both resistance and support. Now that the Bitcoin price has moved above it, the market will watch to see if it can hold as a new support floor. Key aspects to monitor include: Trading Volume: Sustained high volume confirms the move’s strength. Market Depth: Large buy orders below $91,000 could prevent a sharp drop. Global Catalysts: News regarding regulation or macroeconomic policy can cause immediate volatility. The overall sentiment has shifted from cautious to optimistic, but seasoned investors know that crypto markets can change direction quickly. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you do when the Bitcoin price makes such a dramatic move? First, avoid making decisions based purely on emotion. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) can lead to buying at a peak. Instead, consider these strategies: Review Your Portfolio: Ensure your allocation to Bitcoin still aligns with your risk tolerance. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): If you believe in long-term growth, consistent small purchases can mitigate timing risk. Set Clear Targets: Define your profit-taking and stop-loss levels before emotions take over. Remember, a rising Bitcoin price creates opportunities, but it also increases risk. A disciplined approach is your best defense against volatility. The Road Ahead: Can Bitcoin Maintain This Momentum? The future trajectory of the Bitcoin price depends on several variables. On-chain data, such as the movement of coins from long-term holders to exchanges, will provide clues about selling pressure. Moreover, broader financial market stability plays a crucial role. If traditional markets experience a downturn, cryptocurrency often faces correlated selling. However, Bitcoin’s growing role as a digital asset class suggests its long-term trend may remain upward, despite short-term fluctuations. The key for investors is to separate the noise from the fundamental signal. In conclusion, Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $91,000 is a landmark event that underscores its resilience and growing market relevance. This surge is fueled by institutional interest, macroeconomic factors, and positive network developments. While the climb presents exciting opportunities, it demands a strategic and level-headed approach from investors. By focusing on fundamentals, managing risk, and avoiding emotional trading, you can navigate this volatile yet promising landscape. The journey for the Bitcoin price is far from over, and staying informed is your greatest asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was the exact Bitcoin price mentioned in the article? A: The article notes that Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $91,012 on the Binance USDT market at the time of reporting. Q: Why is breaking $91,000 significant for Bitcoin?

The company has announced its plan to acquire the Indonesian crypto trading firm Pedagang Aset Kripto. This Robinhood crypto acquisition signals a powerful expansion into one of Southeast Asia’s most vibrant digital asset markets. Let’s explore what this deal means for traders and the broader crypto landscape. Why is Robinhood Targeting Indonesia with This Crypto Acquisition? Robinhood’s decision isn’t random. Indonesia represents a massive and growing market for digital assets. With a young, tech-savvy population and increasing smartphone penetration, the country is ripe for fintech innovation. This Robinhood crypto acquisition provides an instant, established foothold. Instead of building from scratch, Robinhood gains local expertise, regulatory compliance, and an existing user base through Pedagang Aset Kripto. The deal, reported by CNBC, is expected to finalize in the first half of next year. For Robinhood, it’s a direct path to compete in a region where crypto adoption is accelerating. This move follows a trend of Western crypto firms seeking growth in emerging markets. What Does This Acquisition Mean for Indonesian Crypto Traders? For users in Indonesia, this merger could bring significant benefits. Robinhood is known for its user-friendly interface and commission-free trading model. The integration could mean: Enhanced Platform Features: Access to Robinhood’s intuitive mobile app and tools. Broader Asset Access: Potential for a wider selection of cryptocurrencies. Increased Market Legitimacy: A major international player entering the local scene often boosts confidence. However, challenges exist. Regulatory landscapes differ, and Robinhood must navigate Indonesia’s specific crypto rules. The success of this Robinhood crypto acquisition will depend on a smooth transition that respects local regulations and user expectations. How Does This Fit Into Robinhood’s Overall Crypto Strategy? This isn’t just an isolated deal; it’s a key piece of Robinhood’s global puzzle. After facing regulatory pressures in the U.S., expanding into new territories is a smart diversification strategy. Southeast Asia is a hotspot for crypto, and Indonesia is its largest economy. A successful Robinhood crypto acquisition here could serve as a blueprint for further expansion into markets like Vietnam or the Philippines. The move also strengthens Robinhood’s position against competitors. By capturing market share in high-growth regions, Robinhood builds a more resilient and globally relevant business. This strategic vision turns local challenges into international opportunities. What Are the Potential Challenges and Considerations? Every major acquisition carries risk. Key questions remain: Cultural and Operational Integration: Can Robinhood’s model adapt seamlessly to Indonesian user behavior? Regulatory Hurdles: Will local authorities approve the deal without stringent conditions? Market Competition: How will established local and regional exchanges respond? Furthermore, the crypto market itself is volatile. Robinhood’s foray depends on sustained interest in digital assets within Indonesia. The company must prove that this Robinhood crypto acquisition is a long-term commitment, not just a market-timing play. Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Global Crypto Adoption Robinhood’s planned acquisition of Pedagang Aset Kripto is a bold, strategic bet. It highlights the company’s ambition to be a global leader in retail crypto trading, not just a U.S. phenomenon. This Robinhood crypto acquisition could democratize access for millions of new users while testing the platform’s ability to scale its model internationally. If successful, it may inspire a wave of similar cross-border consolidations in the fintech space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Which Indonesian company is Robinhood acquiring? A1: Robinhood is set to acquire the Indonesian crypto trading platform known as Pedagang Aset Kripto. Q2: When will the Robinhood acquisition be completed? A2: The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of next year, according to reports. Q3: Why is Indonesia an important market for Robinhood? A3: Indonesia has a large, young, tech-oriented population with rapidly growing interest in cryptocurrencies, making it a key growth market for fintech companies. Q4: Will Indonesian users get the same Robinhood app as in the U.S.? A4: Details are pending, but the integration will likely involve adapting Robinhood’s platform to meet local regulations and market needs, potentially offering a similar user experience. Q5: What does this mean for existing Pedagang Aset Kripto users? A5: Existing users should expect a transition to the Robinhood platform, which may bring new features and a wider range of services, though official migration plans have not yet been detailed. Q6: Is this Robinhood’s first international expansion? A6: While Robinhood has offered crypto trading in the U.S. and launched in the UK, this acquisition marks a significant strategic push into the Southeast Asian market through a local entity.

The platform will temporarily suspend all deposit and withdrawal services for the dYdX (DYDX) token. This Bithumb DYDX suspension is scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. UTC on December 8. But what does this mean for you, and why is it happening? Let’s break it down. Why Is Bithumb Suspending DYDX Services? The primary reason for this temporary halt is a planned network upgrade for the dYdX protocol. Exchanges like Bithumb often proactively suspend services during such events to ensure the safety and security of user funds. This precaution prevents any potential transaction errors or losses that could occur if the network is in a transitional state. Therefore, this Bithumb DYDX suspension is a standard, protective measure, not a cause for alarm. What Should DYDX Holders on Bithumb Do Now? If you hold DYDX on Bithumb, don’t panic. The suspension affects moving tokens on and off the exchange, but your assets remain secure in your wallet. Here is your actionable checklist: Complete All Transfers Before Deadline: Ensure any planned deposits or withdrawals are finalized before 9:30 a.m. UTC on Dec 8. Trading is Unaffected: You can still buy, sell, and trade DYDX against other pairs on Bithumb’s internal order book. Monitor Official Channels: Follow Bithumb’s official announcements for the exact time when services will be restored. No Action Required for Holdings: If you are simply holding DYDX, you do not need to take any steps. How Do Network Upgrades Benefit the dYdX Ecosystem? While inconvenient, network upgrades are vital for progress. For the dYdX decentralized exchange, this upgrade likely aims to improve: Scalability: Handling more transactions per second. Security: Implementing enhanced protocol safeguards. Features: Introducing new trading tools or governance mechanisms. This temporary Bithumb DYDX suspension is a short-term step for long-term gains, ultimately making the token and its underlying platform more robust and efficient for all users. What’s the Bigger Picture for Crypto Exchanges? This event highlights the evolving infrastructure of cryptocurrency. Major exchanges like Bithumb must constantly adapt to the underlying blockchains they support. Proactive maintenance, like this suspension, demonstrates a commitment to operational excellence and user security. It’s a sign of a maturing industry where user protection is prioritized, even if it requires brief service interruptions. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for a Better Future In summary, the Bithumb DYDX suspension is a planned, temporary measure driven by essential network maintenance. It underscores the dynamic nature of crypto assets and the responsible practices of leading exchanges. For traders, it’s a reminder to stay informed about exchange announcements and understand that such upgrades, while pausing certain functions, are designed to enhance the overall ecosystem’s health and your trading experience in the long run. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade DYDX on Bithumb during the suspension? A: Yes. The suspension only applies to depositing and withdrawing DYDX from the exchange. Trading DYDX for other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb’s platform will continue as normal. Q2: How long will the DYDX deposit and withdrawal suspension last? A: Bithumb has not announced a specific end time. The suspension begins on Dec 8 at 9:30 a.m. UTC and will last until the dYdX network upgrade is complete and deemed stable by the exchange. Monitor Bithumb’s official notices for the resumption announcement. Q3: Are my DYDX tokens safe on Bithumb during this time? A: Absolutely. Your funds remain secure in your Bithumb wallet. The suspension is a preventative measure to protect assets during the technical transition on the network. Q4: What happens if I send DYDX to my Bithumb address during the suspension? A: You should avoid doing this. Transactions sent during the suspension period may be lost or require complex recovery processes. Always ensure a service is active before initiating a transfer. Q5: Will this suspension affect the price of DYDX? A: While temporary exchange suspensions can sometimes cause minor price volatility due to reduced liquidity flows, this is a planned, short-term event for a technical upgrade. Significant long-term price impact is unlikely, as the upgrade aims to improve the protocol’s fundamentals. Q6: Where can I get the most reliable updates on this situation? A: The most reliable source is always the official Bithumb website and its verified social media channels. Avoid relying on unofficial forums or unverified social media accounts for critical information. Found this guide on the Bithumb DYDX suspension helpful?

55486271,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=236827,1765159811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Farcaster Wallet Focus: The Bold Pivot Reshaping Decentralized Social Media,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/farcaster-wallet-strategy-pivot/,"BitcoinWorld Farcaster Wallet Focus: The Bold Pivot Reshaping Decentralized Social Media In a surprising move that’s sending ripples through the crypto community, Farcaster, the decentralized social media protocol, is making a dramatic pivot. Founder Dan Romero recently announced the platform is shifting its core focus away from social features to concentrate squarely on its Farcaster wallet technology. This strategic overhaul comes after years of pursuing a social-first approach that, according to Romero, simply didn’t deliver the desired impact. So, what does this mean for the future of decentralized networking, and why are wallets now the centerpiece? Why is Farcaster Abandoning Its Social Strategy? For four and a half years, Farcaster operated with a primary goal: to become a powerhouse in decentralized social media. However, in a candid post on his own Farcaster account, Dan Romero declared this strategy ineffective. The platform faced the immense challenge of competing with established Web2 giants while onboarding users to a novel, blockchain-based experience. The user growth trajectory for pure social interaction didn’t meet expectations. Consequently, Romero signaled a clear change in direction. The data revealed a more promising trend: a steady, reliable increase in users engaging with the platform’s wallet functionality. This insight became the catalyst for a complete strategic realignment. What Does a Wallet-Centric Farcaster Look Like? The new vision transforms the Farcaster wallet from a supporting feature into the main protagonist. The core mission now is to build a more accessible and user-friendly wallet. Every new user who creates a wallet and every existing user who retains one is counted as a win for the protocol’s growth. This fundamental shift means: Product Development: Future features and updates will be designed with the wallet experience as the top priority. User Onboarding: The journey will likely simplify around wallet creation and management first. Protocol Growth: Metrics for success will be tied directly to wallet adoption and activity. Romero emphasized that this is a protocol-level decision. Users or developers who preferred the old social-centric model are free to use alternative clients or even build their own, preserving the decentralized ethos. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities of This Pivot? This bold move is not without risk. Pivoting a core identity can confuse existing users and reset community momentum. The crypto wallet space is also fiercely competitive, filled with established players. However, the opportunities are significant. By focusing on a single, critical piece of infrastructure—the Farcaster wallet —the team can dedicate all its resources to solving real user pain points like security, simplicity, and cross-platform utility. A best-in-class wallet could become a stronger “trojan horse” for introducing users to the broader Farcaster ecosystem than a direct social media appeal ever was. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community Farcaster’s pivot offers key lessons. First, it highlights the importance of agility in the fast-paced Web3 world. Even well-considered strategies must evolve based on real user data. Second, it underscores that in decentralized ecosystems, foundational infrastructure like wallets often drives broader adoption more effectively than end-user applications in the early stages. For builders, the message is clear: sometimes, doubling down on a core utility that’s gaining traction is smarter than persisting with an original, but underperforming, vision. The Final Verdict on Farcaster’s New Direction Farcaster’s strategic shift from social media to a Farcaster wallet focus is a pragmatic, data-driven response to market realities. While it marks the end of one ambitious chapter, it inaugurates another focused on building robust, accessible infrastructure. The success of this pivot will depend on the team’s execution in creating a wallet that stands out in a crowded field. If successful, it could provide a more sustainable foundation for the entire Farcaster protocol to grow. Ultimately, this move reminds us that in the quest for decentralization, the most powerful tools are often the simplest ones that empower users directly. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean Farcaster is shutting down its social features? A: Not immediately. The pivot means development focus and resources are shifting to the wallet. Existing social features may remain, but new development will be wallet-centric. Q: What will happen to my Farcaster account and social data? A: Your account and data, tied to your wallet, should remain intact. The protocol is decentralized, so your social graph and posts are not controlled by a single company’s strategy shift. Q: Can I still use Farcaster just for social networking? A: Yes, but the experience may not see significant new social-focused updates. Romero noted that users or other developers can build clients focused on the social experience if there is demand. Q: Why are wallets considered a better focus than social media? A: The data showed stronger, steadier growth in wallet users. Wallets are also fundamental infrastructure for Web3, potentially offering a more scalable and utility-driven path to mass adoption. Q: How will the Farcaster wallet be different from others like MetaMask? A> Details are emerging, but the goal is to build a wallet focused on accessibility and deep integration with the Farcaster protocol and its future ecosystem. Q: Is this a sign that decentralized social media is failing? A> Not necessarily. It reflects one project’s strategic adjustment. The broader space continues to evolve, with different projects experimenting with various models for growth and utility. Found this deep dive into Farcaster’s pivotal strategy shift insightful?

This is the future IOTA, a pioneering distributed ledger project, is building. While most blockchains compete for financial dominance, IOTA has carved a unique path by focusing on a monumental challenge: digitalizing global trade . We spoke with IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener to uncover how this technology is moving beyond theory to reshape real-world logistics. Why is Digitalizing Global Trade So Critical Today? Global trade remains tangled in a web of paper trails, manual processes, and isolated data systems. This inefficiency creates delays, increases costs, and opens doors for fraud. The IOTA Foundation, established in 2017, identified this gap. Instead of creating another general-purpose blockchain, they engineered a specialized Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) designed for the machine-to-machine economy and complex supply chains. Their mission is clear: to provide the foundational layer for a truly connected and automated trade ecosystem. IOTA’s Technological Edge for Trade So, what makes IOTA different? Its core technology offers distinct advantages for logistics: Feeless Transactions: Unlike many blockchains, IOTA allows data and value transfer without transaction fees. This is crucial for the micro-transactions and high-volume data exchanges in supply chains. Scalability: Its unique “Tangle” architecture becomes faster and more secure as more participants join, avoiding the bottlenecks of traditional blockchains. Data Integrity: It creates an immutable, shared record of events—from manufacturing to delivery—that all authorized parties can trust. This technical foundation enables the practical digitalizing of global trade processes, turning physical movements into secure, verifiable digital threads. From Vision to Reality: The African Trade Initiative Theoretical benefits are one thing, but real-world adoption is the true test. IOTA is passing this test through landmark partnerships. A prime example is their work with the Kenyan government and the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). This collaboration aims to build a digital trade infrastructure that can: Simplify cross-border customs and documentation. Provide real-time tracking of goods. Enable secure and instant payments between businesses. This African initiative serves as a powerful blueprint. It demonstrates how digitalizing global trade with blockchain can foster economic growth, increase transparency, and empower small and medium-sized enterprises across continents. What Are the Biggest Hurdles to Overcome? Dominik Schiener acknowledges the journey has challenges. Success requires more than just superior technology. The main obstacles include: Regulatory Alignment: Creating frameworks that recognize digital, blockchain-based records and contracts. Industry Collaboration: Getting competing companies and governments to agree on common data standards and share a single source of truth. Legacy System Integration: Connecting new DLT systems with decades-old existing infrastructure in ports and warehouses. Overcoming these requires persistent dialogue and proving tangible return on investment through pilot projects. The Transformative Impact on Global Commerce The potential payoff for digitalizing global trade is staggering. We can expect a future with: Radical Efficiency: Automated processes slash administrative time and cost. Unbreakable Trust: Every stakeholder has access to the same verified data, reducing disputes. Financial Inclusion: Secure and low-cost payment systems open new markets for businesses worldwide. Sustainable Practices: Precise tracking enables better carbon footprint measurement and ethical sourcing verification. IOTA’s work is not just about upgrading software; it’s about building the rails for a more equitable and connected global economy. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Trade is Being Written IOTA’s focused strategy on digitalizing global trade positions it as a critical player in the next industrial revolution. By moving beyond cryptocurrency speculation and tackling concrete industrial problems, they provide a compelling case for blockchain’s real-world utility. The partnerships in Africa are just the beginning. As these digital trade corridors prove their value, the model can scale globally, making the vision of frictionless, transparent, and efficient commerce a tangible reality for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is IOTA’s main goal? IOTA’s primary goal is to provide the foundational distributed ledger technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) and to digitalize real-world processes, with a major focus on global trade and supply chain logistics. How is IOTA different from Bitcoin or Ethereum? Unlike Bitcoin (a digital currency) or Ethereum (a platform for smart contracts), IOTA uses a “Tangle” instead of a blockchain. It is designed to be feeless, highly scalable, and optimized for machine-to-machine communication and data transfer, making it suited for trade logistics. What does the partnership with AfCFTA involve? The partnership aims to develop and implement a digital trade infrastructure for Africa. This includes creating systems for secure digital documentation, customs clearance, and payments to facilitate easier cross-border trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement. Can IOTA’s technology prevent fraud in shipping? Yes, by providing an immutable, timestamped record of a product’s journey from origin to destination. This transparency makes it extremely difficult to alter shipping documents or misrepresent the contents and location of cargo. Is IOTA only focused on Africa? No. While the AfCFTA project is a flagship initiative, IOTA is involved in various projects across Europe and other regions, including digital identity, sustainable energy, and automotive data. Africa serves as a scalable model for global trade solutions. Do businesses need cryptocurrency to use IOTA for trade? Not necessarily. The core value for trade is in the secure, feeless data layer. While the IOTA token can be used for value transfer and network security, many trade applications can leverage the data integrity features without direct cryptocurrency use by enterprises.

In a dramatic 24-hour period, crypto perpetual futures liquidations soared past a staggering $316 million, forcing thousands of over-leveraged traders out of their positions. This event highlights the extreme volatility and inherent risks of trading with borrowed funds. Let’s break down what happened and what it means for the market. What Caused This Wave of Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations? A sharp, unexpected price drop across major cryptocurrencies triggered this cascade. When prices fall rapidly, traders who borrowed money to bet on prices rising—known as taking a long position—face margin calls. If they can’t add more funds to their account, their positions are automatically closed, or ‘liquidated,’ by the exchange. This selling pressure can then fuel further declines, creating a negative feedback loop. The scale of these crypto perpetual futures liquidations indicates that many traders were caught off-guard by the market’s move. A Closer Look at the $316M Liquidation Data The data reveals which assets were hit the hardest and who was most affected. The pain was not evenly distributed. Bitcoin (BTC): Saw $111 million in liquidations. Notably, 56.95% of these were long positions, meaning more bulls were wiped out than bears. Ethereum (ETH): Faced the largest single hit with $182 million liquidated. A dominant 67.15% of these were long positions. Solana (SOL): Recorded $23.42 million in liquidations, with a whopping 76.85% being long positions. This pattern clearly shows that the recent price action punished optimistic traders betting on a rally. The scale of these crypto perpetual futures liquidations serves as a stark reminder of market risk. Why Are Perpetual Futures So Risky? Perpetual futures contracts are popular because they allow for high leverage—sometimes 100x or more—without an expiry date. However, this leverage is a double-edged sword. Amplified Gains AND Losses: Small price movements can lead to massive profits or catastrophic losses. Liquidation Risk: The primary danger. A small move against your position can result in a total loss of your collateral. Funding Rates: These periodic payments between long and short traders add another layer of complexity and cost. Therefore, the recent crypto perpetual futures liquidations event was almost inevitable given the high leverage prevalent in the market combined with sudden volatility. How Can Traders Navigate This Volatility? Surviving and thriving in this environment requires discipline and risk management. Here are actionable insights: Use Lower Leverage: High leverage is the fastest path to liquidation. Using 5x or 10x instead of 50x dramatically increases your survival odds. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Define your maximum loss before entering a trade. This automates risk management and removes emotion. Monitor Funding Rates: Consistently negative funding rates can signal excessive bullishness, often a precursor to a long squeeze and subsequent crypto perpetual futures liquidations . Never Risk More Than You Can Afford: This timeless advice is the cornerstone of all sensible trading. The Aftermath and Market Sentiment Such a significant liquidation event often acts as a reset button. It flushes out weak, over-leveraged hands and can sometimes create a local price bottom. However, it also damages trader confidence in the short term. The market will now watch to see if this deleveraging leads to a period of consolidation or if it marks the beginning of a deeper corrective phase. Monitoring open interest and funding rates will be key to gauging the next move. In conclusion, the $316 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidations is a powerful lesson in market mechanics. It underscores the non-negotiable importance of risk management in a highly speculative arena. While derivatives offer great opportunity, they demand immense respect. The traders who protect their capital during these violent swings are the ones who live to trade another day. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are crypto perpetual futures? A: They are derivative contracts that allow you to speculate on an asset’s price without owning it. They have no expiry date and use a funding mechanism to track the spot price. Q: What does ‘long liquidation’ mean? A: It means a trader who borrowed funds to bet on a price increase was forced to sell their position at a loss because the price fell and they could not meet margin requirements. Q: Can liquidations cause the price to drop further? A> Yes. This is called a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘long squeeze.’ Forced selling from liquidations adds sell pressure, which can push prices down, triggering even more liquidations. Q: Where can I track liquidation data? A: Websites like Coinglass and Bybit provide real-time liquidation heatmaps and data across multiple exchanges. Q: Is trading perpetual futures advisable for beginners? A> Generally, no. The complexity and high risk of leverage make them unsuitable for most beginners. It’s crucial to understand spot trading and basic risk management first. Q: After a big liquidation event, is it a good time to buy? A> Not necessarily. While it can signal a short-term bottom, it doesn’t guarantee a reversal. Always base decisions on your own analysis and risk tolerance, not just past events.

This massive transaction involves Twenty One Capital, a major Bitcoin investment firm, and reveals just how significant institutional players have become in the crypto space. The sheer scale of this Bitcoin transfer underscores the growing maturity of cryptocurrency markets. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Mean? According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, an address linked to Twenty One Capital moved 43,122 BTC to a new address beginning with 3MEa4s. At current valuations, this represents approximately $3.94 billion changing hands in a single transaction. However, this isn’t a sale or liquidation – it appears to be an internal transfer between wallets controlled by the same entity. This type of Bitcoin transfer between internal addresses is common among large holders for security and operational reasons. Institutions often rotate funds between cold storage (offline wallets) and hot wallets (connected to the internet) for various purposes including: Enhanced security protocols Operational restructuring Preparing for future transactions Compliance with internal policies How Significant Are Twenty One Capital’s Bitcoin Holdings? Following this Bitcoin transfer, Twenty One Capital still holds 43,514 BTC, making it the third-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin worldwide. This positions the firm behind only MicroStrategy (MSTR) and MARA Holdings in terms of corporate Bitcoin ownership, excluding spot Bitcoin ETFs. The company’s substantial position represents more than just wealth accumulation. It signals deep institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. When firms make Bitcoin transfers of this magnitude, they’re not just moving digital assets – they’re making strategic statements about their investment thesis. Why Do Large Bitcoin Transfers Matter to Investors? Major Bitcoin transfers like this one serve as important market signals for several reasons. First, they demonstrate the liquidity and functionality of the Bitcoin network at scale. Second, they show that institutional players are actively managing their cryptocurrency positions rather than simply holding them passively. For retail investors, understanding these large Bitcoin transfers provides valuable context about market dynamics. When institutions move funds, it often precedes strategic decisions that could affect market sentiment and price action. However, it’s crucial to remember that not every large Bitcoin transfer indicates buying or selling pressure. What Challenges Come With Managing Billions in Bitcoin? Managing a $4 billion Bitcoin position presents unique challenges that most investors never encounter. Security becomes paramount when dealing with digital assets of this scale. Every Bitcoin transfer requires meticulous planning and multiple layers of verification. Institutional players like Twenty One Capital must balance several competing priorities: Security versus accessibility Transparency versus privacy Long-term holding versus strategic flexibility Regulatory compliance versus operational efficiency Actionable Insights From This Bitcoin Transfer What can everyday investors learn from this massive Bitcoin transfer? First, monitor large transactions but don’t overreact to them. Second, recognize that institutional activity in Bitcoin is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Third, understand that security practices evolve as holdings grow. Most importantly, this Bitcoin transfer reinforces that cryptocurrency markets have matured significantly. When firms can move billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin efficiently and securely, it demonstrates the infrastructure development that supports broader adoption. Conclusion: The New Era of Institutional Bitcoin The $3.9 billion Bitcoin transfer by Twenty One Capital marks another milestone in cryptocurrency’s journey toward mainstream acceptance. As institutions continue to accumulate and manage substantial Bitcoin positions, their actions will increasingly influence market dynamics and public perception. This particular Bitcoin transfer shows that the cryptocurrency ecosystem now supports transactions of unprecedented scale with reliability and security. For investors, it’s a reminder that Bitcoin has evolved from a speculative asset to a serious component of institutional portfolios. Frequently Asked Questions Why would Twenty One Capital transfer $3.9B in Bitcoin internally? Large institutions often transfer Bitcoin between internal wallets for security upgrades, operational restructuring, or preparing for future transactions. This doesn’t necessarily indicate buying or selling intentions. How does this Bitcoin transfer affect the market price? Internal transfers between addresses controlled by the same entity typically don’t directly impact market prices since no Bitcoin enters or leaves the circulating supply available on exchanges. What makes Twenty One Capital the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder? With 43,514 BTC remaining after this transfer, the firm trails only MicroStrategy and MARA Holdings in corporate Bitcoin ownership, excluding spot Bitcoin ETFs which represent pooled investor funds rather than corporate treasury holdings. How can investors track large Bitcoin transfers? Blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Chainalysis, and various blockchain explorers allow users to monitor large transactions by tracking wallet addresses and analyzing transaction patterns. What security measures protect such large Bitcoin transfers? Institutions use multi-signature wallets, hardware security modules, geographic distribution of keys, and rigorous verification processes to secure billion-dollar Bitcoin transfers. Does this Bitcoin transfer indicate institutional confidence? Yes, the fact that Twenty One Capital continues to hold over 43,000 BTC after this transfer demonstrates ongoing institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition.

The mood stayed cautious, but risk assets, from crypto to equities, held their ground as investors lined up behind the prospect of fresh policy easing. Bitcoin rose about 1.9%, keeping prices close to the $90,000 mark and extending a steady grind higher that has drawn support from rate-cut bets. For crypto traders, the Fed meeting now looks less like a routine calendar event and more like a possible trigger for the next leg of the cycle. Akshat Siddhant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said that if the Fed proceeds with a rate cut this week, a “Santa rally” becomes increasingly likely, pushing BTC toward the $100,000 mark. He pointed to around $87,500 as an important support area, a level that still leaves the broader structure for Bitcoin looking constructive even if there is short-term volatility. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $91,256, up 1.9% Ether : $3,114, up 2.1% XRP : $2.07, up 0.9% Total crypto market cap: $3.18 trillion, up 1.3% BIG WEEK INCOMING FOR CRYPTO MONDAY: – FOMC MEETING – POSSIBLE QE START TUESDAY: – INFLATION DATA RELEASE WEDNESDAY: – FOMC MEETING AND RATE CUTS FRIDAY: – DEF BALANCE SHEET – POWELL RESIGNS MEGA BULLISH WEEK FOR CRYPTO IS COMING! pic.twitter.com/F4XuZiWPcp — ᴛʀᴀᴄᴇʀ (@DeFiTracer) December 7, 2025 Crypto Finds Support While Asian Stocks Log Cautious Early Gains Across Asia’s equity markets, stocks nudged higher as trading got under way. Japan’s Nikkei slipped about 0.3% after a modest 0.5% gain last week, while South Korea’s Kospi eased 0.3% after jumping 4.4% last week on confirmation of lower US tariffs on its exports. MSCI’s broad index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped roughly 0.1% in relatively quiet dealings. Mainland Chinese shares were set to take their cues from November trade figures, with investors watching how exports hold up against tariff headwinds. The data will feed into positioning on Chinese assets into year-end and help shape how much regional support Asian equities can offer to global risk sentiment. Fed Tension Builds With Futures Flat And Analysts Watching Earnings Signals US futures provided little directional push at the start of the week. S&P 500 and Nasdaq contracts traded close to flat as investors balanced the coming Fed decision with a fresh round of corporate results. Earnings from Oracle and Broadcom will give another read on demand for AI-linked infrastructure and chips, while Costco’s numbers will offer a window into consumer spending. Pricing in interest-rate markets shows how firmly investors lean toward an easing. Futures imply roughly an 85% chance of a quarter-point cut in the current 3.75% to 4% federal funds target range, so a hold would amount to a shock. Yet the decision may not be straightforward inside the Federal Open Market Committee. Some policymakers have spoken openly against cutting too early, and the Fed has not seen three or more dissents at a single meeting since 2019, something that has occurred only nine times since 1990. Crypto Watches Dollar Path As Markets Weigh Fed Timing And Political Noise Market prices are more cautious, attaching about a 24% probability to a January move and not fully factoring in another easing until July. For Bitcoin and other digital assets, that path matters because it shapes the dollar, liquidity and the appeal of hard-cap assets. US politics also hangs over the debate. Some investors worry that President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on Fed independence could help push rates too low over time, setting the stage for a later inflation problem. That kind of backdrop often feeds into the narrative that Bitcoin can act as a hedge against long-term currency debasement, even if day-to-day trading still reacts to standard macro data and funding conditions. The Fed is not the only game in town. Central banks in Canada, Switzerland and Australia also meet this week and are widely expected to hold policy steady. The Swiss National Bank may see reasons to offset a strong franc, but with its policy rate already at 0%, officials remain wary of returning to negative territory.

When the White House releases a document outlining America’s strategic priorities, the crypto world pays close attention. The latest National Security Strategy under President Trump, however, has sparked intrigue for what it doesn’t say. While it champions AI and quantum computing, the term ‘ crypto ‘ is conspicuously absent. This omission speaks volumes, but a closer look reveals a more nuanced story about the future of digital assets in U.S. policy. What Does the National Security Strategy Crypto Omission Really Mean? The document’s silence on cryptocurrency and blockchain is a strategic choice, not an oversight. It identifies artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing as clear technological battlegrounds. This suggests the administration views these areas as immediate, direct threats and opportunities for national power. The absence of crypto from this list could imply it’s seen as a financial tool rather than a core security technology—or that its regulatory path is still too uncertain for a definitive stance. However, dismissing the strategy as irrelevant to crypto would be a mistake. Buried within its pages is a crucial plan: to expand U.S. financial dominance through “digital financial innovation.” This phrase is the key. It acts as an indirect, yet powerful, nod to the underlying infrastructure that cryptocurrencies rely on. The focus seems to be on the system, not the asset. Decoding the “Digital Financial Innovation” Clause Why use vague terms instead of naming blockchain directly? The language offers political and strategic flexibility. By focusing on innovation, the National Security Strategy keeps options open. It allows the U.S. to support the development of digital dollar projects or private sector blockchain adoption without explicitly endorsing the volatile crypto market. This approach has significant implications: Regulatory Breathing Room: It avoids boxing regulators into a corner, allowing them to shape policy without a top-down mandate. Private Sector Lead: It signals that innovation may be driven by companies, not government mandates. Global Positioning: It enables the U.S. to counter digital currency projects from rivals like China without being tied to a specific technology. The Strategic Gap: Where Crypto Fits in National Security This omission highlights a critical debate. Should cryptocurrency be treated primarily as a financial innovation, or is it a foundational technology with profound security implications? Proponents argue blockchain offers strategic advantages: Financial Sovereignty: Reducing reliance on global payment networks controlled by others. Cyber Resilience: Potentially more secure systems for critical data and transactions. Economic Statecraft: New tools for sanctions enforcement or humanitarian aid delivery. The current National Security Strategy seems to lean toward the financial view, but future iterations may need to address the technology’s dual-use nature more directly. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For investors and builders, this isn’t a signal to retreat. Instead, it’s a call for nuanced engagement. The strategy’s emphasis on digital finance creates a potential on-ramp for broader blockchain integration. The path forward involves focusing on utility—how the technology solves real problems for national interests—rather than just speculation. In conclusion, the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy delivers a silent but significant message on crypto . The explicit omission, paired with the promise of digital financial innovation, paints a picture of cautious, infrastructure-focused acceptance. The United States is laying the groundwork to harness the power of blockchain for financial dominance, while carefully sidestepping the political volatility of cryptocurrencies themselves. The true impact of this National Security Strategy crypto stance will be determined by how the private sector and future administrations interpret and act on this strategic ambiguity. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does the National Security Strategy banning crypto? A: No, it does not ban cryptocurrency. The document simply does not mention it explicitly, which is different from a prohibition. It instead uses the broader term “digital financial innovation.” Q: What technologies does the strategy prioritize over crypto? A: The document clearly identifies Artificial Intelligence (AI), biotechnology, and quantum computing as key priority areas for national security and investment. Q: Is the U.S. government against blockchain technology? A: Not necessarily. The inclusion of “digital financial innovation” is widely seen as an indirect reference to the underlying technology that powers crypto, suggesting an interest in its application for financial systems. Q: How might this affect cryptocurrency regulation? A: The omission suggests that definitive, high-level strategic guidance on crypto is not yet a priority for the administration, potentially leaving more discretion to individual regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC. Q: Could this stance change in the future? A> Absolutely. As digital assets become more integrated into the global financial system and their national security implications become clearer, future National Security Strategy documents will likely address them more directly.

The 33-page-long document focuses instead on AI, biotech, and quantum computing. Released Friday, the NSS is a key policy document framed by the White House. The policy papers lay out how the President views global threats and opportunities. The pro-crypto administration has so far taken significant steps for the industry, including establishing the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, signing the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation and dropping several enforcement actions against crypto firms. However, skipping any mention of Bitcoin in global economic policy discussions suggests that digital assets remain outside core security planning. “We want to ensure that U.S. technology and U.S. standards — particularly in AI, biotech, and quantum computing — drive the world forward,” the national security strategy statement read. Besides, Trump, who campaigned on becoming the “crypto president”, established a strategic national Bitcoin reserve . However, he later said that the stash will be funded with seized Bitcoin and not fresh BTC purchases. Trump’s Commitment Over Crypto as National Strategic Issue The President has previously made strong on-record commitments, framing digital assets as part of the US’ national strategic issue. For instance, at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville in 2024 , Trump stressed that the future of crypto and the future of Bitcoin “will be made in the USA, not driven overseas.” Further, in several policy rollouts, Trump positioned global competitors as potential beneficiaries if the US fails to adopt crypto-friendly policies. The strategy has only mentioned “digital finance” in non-crypto terms, pointing to international economic systems and payment rails, failing to address decentralized networks. National Security Strategy Shakes BTC Price, Token Slid Below $88K Over Weekend The impact of the White House’s latest document was reflected in the price of Bitcoin , plunging below $88,000 over the weekend. However, the world’s largest crypto has risen 1.96% in the past 24 hours to $91,429, per CoinMarketCap data. A close above $91,600 could target $93K, while failure risks a pullback to $89.5K support.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon delivers a fiery rebuttal to these explosive crypto de-banking allegations, sparking a major debate about power, politics, and finance in the digital age. What is the Crypto De-banking Controversy All About? Several prominent figures from the cryptocurrency world have publicly accused JPMorgan Chase of cutting off their banking services. They claim this crypto de-banking happened suddenly and without clear explanation. The most vocal accusers include Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media, and Jack Mallers, CEO of the Bitcoin payment app Strike. Their allegations suggest the bank’s actions were politically motivated, targeting businesses associated with certain ideologies. This practice, known as de-banking, involves a financial institution terminating a client’s account or refusing to open one. While banks have compliance obligations, the crypto industry argues the process is often opaque and unfair. The controversy taps into deeper concerns about the power large banks wield over emerging financial technologies. Jamie Dimon’s Forceful Denial: What Did He Say? In a recent Fox News interview, JPMorgan’s longtime CEO addressed the claims head-on. Jamie Dimon stated unequivocally that the bank does not restrict services based on a client’s political affiliations . He acknowledged that JPMorgan does close accounts—a practice he says he personally dislikes—but insisted the reasons are never political. Dimon framed the issue as a matter of risk and compliance, not ideology. He explained that banks must follow strict regulations designed to prevent illegal activities like money laundering and fraud. His key points were: Account closures affect clients across the political spectrum. The decisions are based on risk assessments, not personal or political views. He supports regulatory changes to make the de-banking process more transparent. Moreover, Dimon expressed support for the Trump administration’s efforts to reform the rules surrounding account closures. This adds a complex layer to the narrative, as it shows the CEO aligning with a political agenda often associated with his accusers. Why Does Crypto De-banking Matter for the Industry? Access to traditional banking services, known as fiat on-ramps , is the lifeblood of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Without bank accounts, companies cannot easily convert between government-issued currency and digital assets. This makes crypto de-banking a potentially existential threat. The allegations against a titan like JPMorgan signal a broader challenge. If other major banks follow suit, it could severely stifle innovation and growth in the crypto sector. This struggle highlights the tension between disruptive new technologies and the established, heavily-regulated world of traditional finance. The core question remains: are banks acting as responsible gatekeepers or as gatekeepers blocking competition? What’s the Real Story Behind the Scenes? While the public debate centers on politics, the reality of bank risk management is often more technical. Financial institutions face enormous fines for compliance failures. Cryptocurrency businesses, especially newer ones, can be flagged for several reasons: Unclear source of funds or customer identities. Exposure to volatile asset prices. Operations in jurisdictions with weak regulatory frameworks. Therefore, a bank’s decision to de-bank a crypto client might stem from a conservative risk model, not a political vendetta. However, the lack of clear communication from banks when closing accounts fuels suspicion and allows narratives of bias to flourish. This opacity is the central problem both sides seem to agree on. The Path Forward: Transparency and Dialogue This public clash is more than a war of words. It underscores a critical need for clearer rules and better communication between traditional finance and the crypto industry. Dimon’s support for regulatory change is a significant admission that the current system is flawed. For the cryptocurrency sector, the incident is a stark reminder of its dependency on the very system it seeks to innovate. Building more resilient, decentralized financial infrastructure may be the long-term answer. In the short term, finding common ground on compliance standards is essential for coexistence. The crypto de-banking drama reveals the growing pains of a financial revolution. As digital assets move closer to the mainstream, their relationship with incumbent banks will be defined by conflicts like this one. The resolution will shape the future of money for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does ‘de-banking’ mean? De-banking refers to when a bank terminates a customer’s account or refuses to provide banking services, effectively cutting them off from the traditional financial system. Why do banks de-bank cryptocurrency companies? Banks cite compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations. They view some crypto businesses as high-risk due to potential volatility, regulatory uncertainty, or concerns about illicit finance. Is de-banking only a problem for crypto? No. Other industries deemed high-risk, like firearms sales or adult entertainment, have also reported de-banking. However, the practice has become a focal point in crypto due to the industry’s rapid growth and regulatory clashes. What did Jamie Dimon say about supporting Trump’s rules? Dimon stated he supports the Trump administration’s efforts to change the rules around de-banking to make the process fairer and more transparent, even though he dislikes the practice itself. How can crypto companies protect against de-banking? Companies can invest heavily in robust, transparent compliance programs, seek banking partnerships with institutions familiar with crypto, and advocate for clearer regulatory guidelines. What is the long-term impact of de-banking on crypto? It could push innovation towards more decentralized financial (DeFi) solutions that don’t rely on traditional banks, or it could force a regulatory reckoning that establishes clearer rules for crypto banking access.

The price is now showing positive signs but might struggle to clear the $2.10 resistance. XRP price started a recovery wave above the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading above $2.060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.090 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could continue to move up if it settles above $2.160. XRP Price Faces Uphill Task XRP price remained supported above $2.00 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above $2.020 and $2.050 to enter a positive zone. There was a clear move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2130 swing high to the $1.990 low. However, the price is now facing resistance near $2.10. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.090 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.060 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.10 level and the trend line. The first major resistance is near the $2.1250 level. A close above $2.1250 could send the price to $2.160 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.2130 swing high to the $1.990 low. The next hurdle sits at $2.220. A clear move above the $2.220 resistance might send the price toward the $2.280 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance.

This move comes in after the crypto exchange halted its services in the country for more than two years. This reentry follows the company’s registration this year with the Financial Intelligence Unit, India (FIU), thereby ensuring compliance with the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Meanwhile, apart from reopening in India , John O’Loghlen, the director for Coinbase in the Asia-Pacific region, hinted at the firm’s plans to launch a fiat on-ramp next year during India Blockchain Week (IBW). He further explained that the exchange had adopted the idea of introducing a fiat on-ramp to enable users based in India to deposit their funds and purchase cryptocurrency effectively. Coinbase halts all its activities in India Regarding Coinbase’s earlier decision to halt its services in India, reports noted that the cryptocurrency exchange had introduced its services in the country back in 2022. After careful consideration, it had to swiftly suspend its efforts to support the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payment system. This decision came after UPI operator National Payments Corporation (NPCI) refused to recognize the exchange’s operations in India. Following this denial, Coinbase was left with no other choice but to stop all its activities in the country later in 2023. Afterwards, the crypto exchange instructed its users based in India to close their accounts. “We previously had millions of customers in India, and we decided to completely remove those customers from overseas entities where they were based and regulated. We wanted a fresh start here,” O’Loghlen explained. He further acknowledged that the decision they adopted was not easy for Coinbase, being a company concentrating on generating more income and gaining more active users . After it ceased all its operations in India, the company partnered with the Financial Intelligence Unit. a national government agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information on suspicious financial activities. Coinbase successfully registered with the agency this year. Initially, it granted its users access to the app in October. Now, the exchange has made it available to everyone. Coinbase’s reopening in India marks a growing trend among several internet firms that are developing new markets in India. Several analysts weighed in on this trend. They noted that these companies aim to reach the second-largest group of online users worldwide. In the meantime, sources have warned that while AI companies, such as OpenAI , and social media platforms are experiencing rapid growth in this market, cryptocurrency firms are encountering significant challenges due to the strict regulations being implemented and tax hikes on digital currencies. Coinbase raises concerns about India’s tax imposed on crypto earnings In India, crypto earnings are subject to a 30% tax, inclusive of any losses encountered. The country also imposes a 1% tax on every transaction. Analysts cautioned that such factors may deter individuals from engaging in frequent trading. As Coinbase fully reopens in the country, O’Loghlen stated that the crypto exchange is optimistic that the government will soon reduce these tax burdens, making it easier for individuals to own digital assets. Meanwhile, despite these obstacles, the firm stated that it has a bullish outlook for its expectations in India. Coinbase also mentioned that its investment branch invested more funds into CoinDCX, the top crypto trading app in the country. This crypto trading app is now valued at $2.45 billion following its funding round. To further demonstrate its commitment to solidifying its position as a leader in the crypto industry, the crypto exchange publicly highlighted its intention to grow its workforce, which comprises more than 500 workers in India, by hiring for various positions targeted at both local and international markets. “I think we want to be recognized as a trusted exchange that keeps your money safe,” O’Loghlen stated. “We can’t reach a wide audience if we don’t provide an easy-to-use interface and a reliable experience that lets you sign up within minutes, just like you would with Zepto, Flipkart, or any other popular app in India.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",News|Coinbase|India,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-08 04:19:53

The world’s leading digital asset exchange has secured a full suite of licenses in Abu Dhabi, marking a pivotal step in its commitment to compliance and institutional growth. This approval from the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) positions Binance at the forefront of the Middle East’s evolving crypto landscape. What Does the Binance Abu Dhabi License Actually Mean? This isn’t just a basic operational permit. Binance received authorization to function through three distinct, fully-regulated entities within the ADGM. Therefore, the exchange can now legally operate as an authorized investment exchange , an authorized clearing house , and a broker-dealer . This comprehensive framework is a first for any digital asset platform in the region and provides a robust, secure foundation for serving institutional and retail clients. Why is This Regulatory Approval a Game-Changer? The significance of the Binance Abu Dhabi license extends far beyond a single geographic expansion. It represents a powerful signal of legitimacy and stability. For users, it means enhanced protection under the ADGM’s respected regulatory framework. For the broader market, it underscores a clear trend: major financial hubs are creating structured pathways for crypto innovation. Key benefits of this development include: Enhanced User Trust: Operating under a full FSRA license demands high standards of security, transparency, and anti-money laundering protocols. Institutional Gateway: The triple-entity structure is specifically designed to attract and serve professional investors, funds, and financial institutions. Market Maturity: This move accelerates the maturation of the crypto sector in the Middle East, encouraging further responsible innovation and investment. How Does This Fit Into Binance’s Global Strategy? Securing the Binance Abu Dhabi license is a strategic masterstroke in the exchange’s ongoing “compliance-first” approach. Following increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide, Binance has actively sought to rebuild its standing by pursuing licenses in key jurisdictions. Abu Dhabi, with its progressive stance on digital assets, offers a prestigious and stable base. Consequently, this achievement not only solidifies its presence in a wealthy economic zone but also boosts its global credibility as a regulated entity. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead? While a triumphant moment, maintaining this full license comes with continuous responsibility. Binance must consistently adhere to the ADGM’s strict regulatory requirements, which involves significant operational overhead. However, the opportunities are immense. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region presents a vast, tech-savvy population with growing interest in digital assets. By establishing a trusted, fully-licensed hub in Abu Dhabi, Binance is perfectly positioned to capture this growth and potentially set a new standard for crypto exchanges globally. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto Regulation The granting of a full Binance Abu Dhabi license is more than a corporate announcement; it’s a watershed event for the industry. It demonstrates that major crypto players can and will operate within established regulatory perimeters when clear frameworks exist. This development promises greater security for investors and paves the way for deeper integration between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. The message is clear: the future of cryptocurrency is regulated, secure, and institutional. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly did Binance get licensed for in Abu Dhabi? A1: Binance obtained a full Financial Services Permission (FSP) from the ADGM’s FSRA. This allows it to operate three licensed entities: a virtual asset exchange, a virtual asset broker-dealer, and a virtual asset custodian. Q2: Is Binance now fully regulated in the UAE? A2: This license applies specifically within the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), a special financial free zone. It is a major step toward full UAE regulation, but different emirates may have their own requirements. Q3: How does this benefit an average Binance user? A3: Users in the ADGM jurisdiction gain the assurance of dealing with a locally licensed entity subject to strict consumer protection, security, and financial crime prevention rules. Q4: Does this mean Binance is moving its global headquarters to Abu Dhabi? A4: No, this license is for its regional operations. Binance has not announced moving its global headquarters, but it establishes a major regulated hub in the Middle East. Q5: Will this affect Binance’s services or fees globally? A5: Services for users in Abu Dhabi will be tailored to meet local regulations. For most global users, no immediate changes to services or fees are expected due to this specific license. Q6: What does this mean for other crypto exchanges? A6: It sets a high regulatory benchmark in the region. Other exchanges seeking to operate in the ADGM will likely need to pursue similar comprehensive licenses, raising the overall standard of the market.

The platform now enables direct native USDC deposits , a move that streamlines the entire user experience by connecting the popular stablecoin directly to its core infrastructure. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift in how assets move onto one of the leading perpetuals DEXs. What Does Enabling Direct Native USDC Deposits Actually Mean? Previously, to use USDC on Hyperliquid, you likely relied on a bridge from the Arbitrum network. This added extra steps, potential delays, and bridge-related fees to your transaction. Now, with direct native USDC deposits , that intermediary is gone. The stablecoin is directly connected to Hyperliquid’s own Hypercore and HyperEVM layers. Think of it like upgrading from a winding country road with toll booths to a direct, high-speed highway for your digital assets. The announcement confirms the platform’s existing Arbitrum bridge for USDC will be deprecated. All USDC on Hyperliquid will now be natively issued on its own system. This change delivers several immediate benefits: Faster Transactions: Without waiting for bridge confirmations, deposits are near-instant. Lower Costs: You avoid paying gas fees on Arbitrum and bridge fees. Enhanced Security: Reducing reliance on external bridges minimizes potential attack vectors. Simpler Process: A more straightforward deposit path improves the user journey, especially for newcomers. Why is This a Strategic Masterstroke for Hyperliquid? This move is about more than just technical convenience. By enabling direct native USDC deposits , Hyperliquid is aggressively competing on user experience. In the crowded DeFi landscape, the platform that makes onboarding capital the easiest often wins. This update directly tackles a common pain point—cumbersome bridging—head-on. Furthermore, it strengthens Hyperliquid’s sovereignty and efficiency. Controlling the full lifecycle of a major stablecoin on its chain reduces external dependencies. This allows for more predictable performance and opens doors for future innovations built directly around native USDC. For traders, the implication is clear: more of your capital goes to work trading, not getting to the exchange. What Should Users Do Next? Your Actionable Insights If you’re an existing Hyperliquid user, this transition is straightforward. The platform will guide the deprecation of the old Arbitrum bridge. For all new deposits, you should now use the new native method. Always double-check official channels for the correct contract addresses to avoid scams. For DeFi enthusiasts watching the space, this is a trend to note. The race for superior infrastructure is intensifying, with a clear focus on removing intermediaries. Hyperliquid’s push for direct native USDC deposits sets a new benchmark, putting pressure on other exchanges to simplify their own asset onboarding processes. In conclusion, Hyperliquid’s integration of direct native USDC deposits is a powerful, user-centric upgrade. It eliminates friction, cuts costs, and boosts security, making the platform significantly more attractive for both retail and institutional participants. This strategic focus on core infrastructure smoothness is a winning formula in the competitive world of decentralized trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Do I need to do anything if my USDC is already on Hyperliquid via the old bridge? A: No, your funds are safe. The deprecated bridge will not affect existing balances. You will simply use the new native method for all future deposits. Q: Are there any fees for using the new direct native USDC deposit method? A: You will only pay the network gas fee for the transaction on the chain you are sending from (like Ethereum). You avoid the additional bridge fee that previously existed. Q: What chains can I send USDC from directly to Hyperliquid now? A: The announcement highlights a direct connection to Hyperliquid’s own layers. You should consult Hyperliquid’s official documentation for the specific supported source chains and detailed deposit instructions. Q: Does this mean Arbitrum is no longer supported on Hyperliquid? A: No, this change is specific to the USDC asset. The deprecation only applies to the USDC bridge from Arbitrum. Hyperliquid likely still supports other assets and functions connected to Arbitrum. Q: Is this native USDC the same as the official Circle-issued USDC? A: Yes, it is the same stablecoin, fully backed and redeemable. The “native” term refers to it being issued directly on and for Hyperliquid’s system, eliminating the need for a wrapped or bridged version. Q: How does this improve security? A: It reduces “bridge risk.” Cross-chain bridges have been targets for major hacks. By enabling direct native issuance, Hyperliquid minimizes dependency on these external, complex smart contracts.

This comeback follows a challenging two-year hiatus, a period marked by complex regulatory hurdles. The news, first reported by Bitcoin World, signals a renewed commitment to one of the world’s most promising digital asset markets. For Indian crypto enthusiasts, this marks a pivotal moment of regained access to a major global exchange platform. What Does the Coinbase India Relaunch Mean for Users? Currently, the revived Coinbase India platform offers a specific set of services. Indian users can immediately engage in crypto-to-crypto trades. This means you can exchange one cryptocurrency, like Ethereum, for another, such as Solana, directly on the exchange. However, the initial phase does not support direct purchases using Indian Rupees (INR). This staged approach allows Coinbase to re-enter the market while navigating the local financial ecosystem. When Can You Buy Crypto with Fiat on Coinbase India? The exchange has outlined a clear roadmap for expansion. The most anticipated upgrade is the planned support for fiat currency transactions, slated to begin next year. This future functionality will enable users to deposit Indian Rupees directly to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, while the platform starts with crypto swaps, its evolution aims to provide a more comprehensive gateway for new and experienced investors in the region. Why Did Coinbase Leave and What Changed? The previous exit was primarily driven by stringent regulatory pressures and operational challenges with local payment processors. India’s evolving stance on digital assets created an uncertain environment. The decision to return suggests a calculated confidence in the current and future regulatory framework. Moreover, it highlights Coinbase’s strategic patience and its view of India’s long-term potential in the global crypto economy. What Are the Key Benefits for Indian Crypto Traders? The return of Coinbase India brings several advantages to the table: Access to a Global Platform: Users gain entry to a reputable, internationally recognized exchange with robust security measures. Diverse Asset Selection: Coinbase typically offers a wide array of cryptocurrencies beyond just the major ones. Enhanced Liquidity: Being part of a global network can improve market depth and trading efficiency. Future-Proofing: The promise of fiat on-ramps next year prepares the ground for easier entry into crypto markets. What Challenges Remain for Coinbase in India? Despite the optimistic relaunch, challenges persist. The regulatory landscape, while improving, remains a focal point. Success will depend on continuous positive engagement with Indian authorities. Furthermore, Coinbase India faces established local competitors who have operated continuously. Gaining market share will require demonstrating unique value, reliability, and seamless user experience, especially when fiat services go live. How Should Indian Investors Approach This Development? For investors, this is a development to watch closely. You can start by exploring the crypto-to-crypto trading features to familiarize yourself with the platform. Keep an eye on official announcements regarding the fiat integration timeline. As always, conduct thorough research, understand the risks of volatility, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The return of a major player like Coinbase is a positive signal for market maturity. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Crypto in India The resumption of services by Coinbase in India is more than just an exchange reopening. It represents a vote of confidence in the Indian market’s resilience and future. It provides Indian users with more choice and connects them deeper into the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. While starting with crypto-to-crypto trades, the planned fiat support paints a picture of a more accessible and integrated future. This move could potentially catalyze further innovation and adoption across the country’s digital finance sector. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I use Indian Rupees (INR) to buy crypto on Coinbase India right now? A: No, not immediately. Currently, only crypto-to-crypto trading is available. The exchange has announced plans to support INR deposits and fiat purchases starting next year. Q2: Why did Coinbase stop its services in India two years ago? A: The halt was primarily due to regulatory uncertainties and challenges with local payment systems, which made operating sustainably difficult at that time. Q3: Is my money safe on the Coinbase India platform? A> Coinbase is a globally regulated exchange known for its strong security measures, including cold storage for assets. However, as with any crypto platform, users should employ their own security best practices, like using strong passwords and two-factor authentication. Q4: How does Coinbase’s return affect other Indian crypto exchanges? A: It increases competition, which can benefit users through better services, lower fees, and more innovation. Established local exchanges will likely enhance their offerings to retain users. Q5: What cryptocurrencies can I trade on Coinbase India? A: While the exact initial list may vary, Coinbase typically supports a wide range of major and altcoins. You will need to check the platform directly for the most current and specific list of supported assets for Indian users. Q6: Are there any restrictions for Indian users on Coinbase? A: The main initial restriction is the lack of direct fiat (INR) support. All other standard terms, conditions, and applicable Indian regulations regarding cryptocurrency trading will apply.

THIS VIDEO EXPLAINS IT CLEARLY, AND THE HATERS WILL SURELY HATE THE FACT THAT THE #XRP LEDGER, RIPPLE, AND XRP ARE BUILT TO DOMINATE GLOBAL FINANCE. https://t.co/P8B0iXlZV1 pic.twitter.com/DX3PZ71sSu — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) December 6, 2025 Performance, compliance, and staged rollout The account described a three-stage progression. The first stage established infrastructure; the second concentrated on trust and integration; and the third aims to allow institutional demand to emerge organically as tokenization expands. Skipper’s source stressed that large-scale monetary innovations do not occur instantaneously but unfold in phases as economic systems transition. Performance metrics, compliance practices, and demonstrable reliability were cited as the measures institutions require before they will use a system as a settlement rail. Tokenization at scale and selection of settlement rails Skipper relayed the view that global tokenization is in its early stages and that, as value becomes digitized across markets, only a small number of blockchains will meet the performance, liquidity, and trust thresholds required to serve as a settlement infrastructure at scale. The speaker asserted that when tokenization matures, systems that have been tested and institutionally recognized will naturally be considered the primary options for moving significant value. This claim implies that measured preparatory work now positions certain ledgers to serve in that role when markets are ready.

According to the explanation, adoption will increase in step with the maturation of tokenization across financial markets; institutional demand will follow once institutions are satisfied with the compliance, reliability, and performance of these technologies. Skipper’s reporting presents this progression as deliberate, emphasizing that the final stage—widespread institutional use for settlement —will arrive as tokenization advances and economic participants choose the rails capable of handling very large-scale digital value transfers.

Recently, new XRP price prediction models have sparked warnings: thinner liquidity and increasing risk mean XRP price swings could get nasty in late 2025 or early 2026. That uncertainty is prompting some investors to seek alternatives and one emerging name many are watching is Remittix (RTX) . In a market hungry for utility and pragmatic value, RTX is gaining whispers as a “what if” crypto to watch. Let’s explore why XRP might be due for turbulence, what’s going on with Remittix and why the latter is beginning to look like a serious contender for people sick of slim‑margin memecoins and hype cycles. Comparing XRP and Remittix Feature / Metric Ripple (XRP) Remittix (RTX) Core Use Case Cross-border liquidity and banking settlement Global crypto-to-fiat payments and merchant integration Price Drivers Regulatory news, Bitcoin correlation, market sentiment Presale momentum, beta wallet adoption, exchange listings Volatility Risk High in Q4 2025–Q1 2026 due to liquidity thinness Moderate — early adoption and controlled supply reduce sudden swings Security Signals Dependent on Ripple Labs infrastructure CertiK-audited smart contracts; long-term token locks Token Supply Around 100B XRP Around 1.5B RTX Market Narrative Institutional usage, banking partnerships Utility-driven, presale traction, cross-chain payment functionality Investor Appeal Traders, speculative, some institutional Early investors seeking functional utility + growth potential Why XRP Might Be Wobbling: Liquidity, Sentiment and Structural Risk First, liquidity is thinning as different XRP price prediction models signal flash warning lights. Recent academic work applying liquidity‑aware forecasting, measuring metrics such as the volume‑to‑volatility ratio (VVR) and volume‑weighted price averages, shows that tokens with liquidity drains are far more susceptible to sharp price swings, even when overall market sentiment is stable. When that framework is applied to XRP, several things stand out: Trading volumes on many exchanges have tapered in recent months. Bid‑ask spreads are widening, meaning even modest sell pressure could push the price down sharply. With macro uncertainty in global markets, complacent holders or over‑leveraged traders could trigger cascading sell-offs. In short: models that account for liquidity, not just hype or social sentiment, suggest XRP’s next move could be more volatile than many expect. Market Sentiment is Fragile: Headlines and Catalysts Are Thin Unlike early‑cycle bull runs where positive news flows (e.g. big partnership announcements, ecosystem upgrades) keep sentiment strong, XRP today faces a lack of fresh catalysts. Speculative momentum alone can’t sustain a run, especially if whales or big holders start trimming positions. One recent cycle showed how quickly things can reverse when liquidity thins and sentiment wobbles. That same scenario, played out on a larger scale, could mean severe pressure for XRP holders. With a massive circulating and total supply, XRP’s structure makes aggressive price growth less realistic without massive external inflows. Combine that with liquidity concerns and volatile macro conditions and you get a scenario where gains may be modest, but the downside could be sharp. Enter Remittix: Why Some Investors Are Leaning Toward RTX as a Potential Alternative While the XRP crowd braces for volatility, a subset of investors is shifting capital to tokens with real‑world use and structural clarity. Remittix is one such name gaining traction, and not for hype, but because it checks a lot of boxes in 2025’s reset environment. Here’s what the data says: The project recently passed the $28.5M presale milestone, selling over 693 million tokens at around $0.1190 each, a sizable commitment from early‑stage investors. Its public wallet is live on the App Store (Ethereum & Solana), meaning the project has moved beyond whitepaper promises into tangible product deployment. The smart contracts underlying Remittix have been audited by CertiK (as publicly disclosed), which adds a layer of security and reduces one of the biggest risks for presale tokens. Tokenomics are transparent: total supply capped at 1.5B tokens, presale allocation clearly laid out. Upcoming exchange listings: BitMart and LBank have been announced as part of Remittix’s roadmap, contingent on milestone achievements. The core value proposition is practical and relevant: a PayFi platform intended to let crypto holders send funds to fiat bank accounts globally, a major demand vector especially in emerging markets where remittances and cross-border transfers are in high demand. In a world where many tokens depend solely on hype loops, Remittix tries to base its case on actual utility, and that matters when big swings become the norm. Put simply, Remittix is gaining attention because it offers real-world functionality alongside strong investor confidence, which some see as a stabilizing factor in a volatile market. What This Means Practically for You as an Investor If you hold XRP, it’s a good time to re-evaluate your position. Liquidity-based models show risk. Consider trimming exposure or hedging with more utility-driven tokens. A small speculative allocation to RTX may be worth a look, if you’re looking for upside with less exposure to hype-only volatility; but only if you’re comfortable with the high execution risk. Diversification approach: For investors who want to balance speculative upside with utility, a split between XRP exposure and new presale utility tokens, such as Remittix, may make sense.

Not necessarily, but volatility often makes investors re-evaluate options. Tokens with real-world utility and audit-backed security can attract capital during uncertain times. Is Remittix safer than XRP? “Safer” is relative. Remittix offers audited contracts, live beta wallets, and structured presale liquidity, which some investors prefer over XRP’s exposure to regulatory and liquidity risks. Can Remittix reach similar adoption levels as XRP? Potentially in niche markets like cross-border payments, especially as blockchain adoption grows in everyday financial transactions. How should new investors approach XRP now? Monitor liquidity and regulatory updates. Consider smaller positions if risk tolerance is low, or hedge with functional utility tokens like RTX.

The next major resistance is near the $140 level. The main resistance could be $142. A successful close above the $142 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $150. Any more gains might send the price toward the $155 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $140 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $132 zone. The first major support is near the $130 level. A break below the $130 level might send the price toward the $128 support zone.

It will host Binance’s on exchange business, including spot and derivatives markets. Nest Clearing and Custody Limited has been approved as a recognized clearing house with added custody and securities depository permissions, putting it in charge of clearing, settlement and safekeeping of digital assets. A third entity, BCI Limited, set to become Nest Trading Limited, holds a broker dealer licence that covers dealing and arranging in investments, asset management, custody arrangements and money services, including over the counter trading and conversion. Binance Leans On ADGM Regime To Reinforce Compliance And Global Reach Binance has described the package as a comprehensive regulatory framework for Binance.com and a global first for the platform. The company says the approvals give it a cleaner path into multiple markets beyond the UAE and help it present itself as a more predictable counterparty to institutions that have grown wary of loosely regulated venues after a series of blow ups. Richard Teng, Binance’s co-chief executive and a former senior executive at Abu Dhabi Global Market, said in a statement that working under the authority’s regime reflects a commitment to compliance, transparency and user protection. He argued that the licence brings regulatory clarity and legitimacy and allows Binance to support its global operations from Abu Dhabi while keeping a distributed operating model that taps talent around the world. Rising Crypto Investments Show Abu Dhabi Positioning Itself As Digital Finance Hub For Abu Dhabi, the deal fits neatly into a broader push to turn its oil wealth and sovereign funds into long term exposure to digital assets and financial technology. The emirate, which sits on roughly $2 trillion in sovereign wealth, has been steadily increasing its footprint in crypto. The Abu Dhabi Investment Council, an independently run arm of Mubadala Investment, more than tripled its holding in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust during the third quarter, taking the position to almost 8m shares as of Sept. 30, worth about $518m at the time. Binance also has direct financial ties to the city. In March, the exchange secured a $2b investment from AI-focused investor MGX, chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, one of the most influential figures in the emirate’s financial and security establishment. That backing and the new licences deepen the sense that Abu Dhabi sees Binance as a core piece of its digital finance strategy. The exchange has not yet named a global headquarters, but Teng has previously called the UAE an attractive option. With Abu Dhabi Global Market now authorised to host Binance.com’s regulated activities from January 5, 2026, the city will remain high on the list of possible long term bases, especially as more institutional clients demand clear regulatory anchors. Binance Looks To Rebuild Trust As New Licences Follow Turbulent Period The approvals come after a difficult period for Binance on the enforcement front. Founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down as chief executive in 2023 after pleading guilty to breaking US anti money laundering laws. The company agreed to pay more than $4.3b to settle a years long US investigation. Zhao was pardoned by President Donald Trump in October this year, removing a major legal cloud for the former CEO, but regulators and counterparties still expect Binance to prove that it can operate with tighter controls. Binance says it now has more than 300m registered users and over $125 trillion in cumulative trading volume. It argues that operating under Abu Dhabi’s rules will give both retail and institutional users stronger comfort on oversight and consumer protection as it pushes toward its long stated goal of serving 1b people. The leadership team is shifting as the regulatory architecture firms up. Last week, Teng named Binance co founder Yi He as the company’s new co-chief executive. He described her as a driving force since the exchange’s launch, and credited her with shaping its culture, vision and user focused approach. Her formal elevation signals that Binance wants to present a more structured leadership bench as it leans further into regulated markets.

The idea comes as Ethereum’s fees, while currently low, continue to swing sharply. Buterin argues that a futures market will not only smooth out these fluctuations but also provide clearer signals about long-term fee expectations. Buterin Proposes New Way to Stabilize Gas Fees Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin caused fresh discussions about the future of network fees after proposing the creation of a trustless on-chain futures market for gas. The idea was shared in a post on X ,and came in response to questions about whether Ethereum can guarantee low and predictable gas fees as adoption scales. Buterin argued that while ongoing roadmap improvements aim to reduce costs, users, developers, and institutions need greater certainty about what they will pay to transact in the months and years ahead. His proposed solution is similar to how traditional futures markets operate. In commodities like oil, futures contracts let buyers and sellers lock in prices at a later date, reducing uncertainty and helping manage risk. An Ethereum gas futures market would adopt the same principle. Users could secure a set base fee for a defined future time window, effectively locking in the price of blockspace before they need it. This could allow high-volume users like traders, app developers, and institutions to hedge against volatility and plan operational expenses more accurately. Buterin explained that such a market would do more than protect against spikes. It would also offer a reliable metric for the ecosystem to understand expectations around future gas costs. This transparency could support better long-term planning for everything from protocol development to application design. A well-functioning on-chain futures system would, in his view, serve as a core financial tool for Ethereum’s maturing economy. The proposal arrives at a moment when Ethereum gas fees have fallen a lot throughout 2025. Basic transactions currently average around 0.474 gwei, or roughly one cent, according to Etherscan. More complex operations, like token swaps, NFT sales, or bridging assets, cost between $0.05 and $0.27. Despite the overall downtrend, fee levels have stayed unstable. YTD ETH gas prices (Source: Ycharts ) Data from Ycharts shows that average transaction fees started the year at $1, dipped to $0.18 at their lowest, and spiked to $2.60 at times before settling close to $0.30. For Buterin, this volatility proves why a futures market could become essential infrastructure for Ethereum.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|ETH|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-08 05:30:00

Recent reports confirm that regulatory approval for these investment vehicles is now effectively off the table for 2024. The delay stems from legislative bottlenecks that have pushed digital asset institutionalization down the priority list. Why Has South Korea’s Spot Crypto ETF Approval Stalled? According to ET News, the primary obstacle involves delays in amending the Capital Markets Act. Four related amendment bills currently sit in legislative limbo. Meanwhile, policymakers have shifted their attention to reorganizing South Korea’s Financial Services Commission and Financial Supervisory Service. They’re also focused on government measures designed to stimulate the traditional stock market. This regulatory pivot means the institutionalization of digital assets has been deprioritized. The situation creates uncertainty for investors who anticipated South Korea following the United States in approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs. The delay highlights the complex balancing act regulators face between innovation and market stability. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The postponement carries several immediate implications: Limited Access : South Korean investors cannot access regulated spot crypto ETF products through traditional brokers Market Sentiment : The delay may dampen short-term bullish sentiment in the regional crypto market Regulatory Signal It indicates South Korea’s cautious approach to crypto institutionalization Competitive Disadvantage : The country falls behind other markets that have approved similar products However, this doesn’t mean the door is permanently closed. The pending legislation suggests groundwork exists for future approval. The question becomes when rather than if South Korea will join the spot crypto ETF landscape. How Do Legislative Priorities Affect Crypto Markets? South Korea’s situation demonstrates how political and economic factors influence crypto regulation. The government’s current focus on stimulating the stock market reflects broader economic concerns. Meanwhile, restructuring financial regulators consumes bureaucratic bandwidth that might otherwise address digital asset frameworks. This prioritization creates a challenging environment for spot crypto ETF advocates. They must now wait for both legislative movement and regulatory attention to return to digital assets. The timeline remains uncertain, but most analysts agree that 2024 approval appears unlikely given current progress. What Can Investors Expect Moving Forward? While disappointing for 2024, the spot crypto ETF delay doesn’t signal outright rejection. The four pending amendment bills indicate legislative recognition of digital assets’ importance. Once regulatory reorganization concludes and stock market measures take effect, attention may return to crypto institutionalization. International developments will also pressure South Korean regulators. As more countries approve spot crypto ETFs, the argument for maintaining restrictions weakens. Global institutional adoption creates both competitive and innovative pressures that South Korea cannot ignore indefinitely. For now, investors should monitor: Progress on Capital Markets Act amendments Completion of financial regulator restructuring Shifts in political priorities following economic developments International regulatory trends affecting peer pressure Conclusion: Patience Required for South Korea’s Spot Crypto ETF Future The dream of South Korean spot crypto ETF approval in 2024 has faded against legislative and regulatory realities. While the delay frustrates investors eager for regulated crypto exposure, it reflects the complex considerations facing policymakers. The foundation for future approval exists through pending legislation, but timing depends on shifting political priorities and economic conditions. South Korea’s cautious approach contrasts with more aggressive markets but may ultimately create a more stable framework. When approval eventually comes, investors will benefit from thorough regulatory consideration. Until then, the wait continues as the country balances innovation with financial system stability. Frequently Asked Questions Why is South Korea delaying spot crypto ETF approval? The delay stems from postponed amendments to the Capital Markets Act and shifting government priorities. Policymakers currently focus on financial regulator restructuring and traditional stock market stimulation. When might South Korea approve spot crypto ETFs? Most analysts believe 2024 approval is unlikely. The timeline depends on legislative progress and when regulatory attention returns to digital assets, potentially in 2025 or later. How does this affect South Korean crypto investors? Investors cannot access regulated spot crypto ETF products through traditional channels. They must continue using existing crypto exchanges or international platforms for exposure. Are other countries approving spot crypto ETFs? Yes, several countries including the United States have approved spot crypto ETFs. This creates competitive pressure on South Korea but hasn’t accelerated their timeline. What legislation needs to pass for approval? Four amendment bills to the Capital Markets Act must progress through South Korea’s legislative process to create the legal framework for spot crypto ETFs. Could this delay benefit investors long-term? Potentially. Thorough regulatory consideration may create a more stable framework when approval eventually comes, reducing risks associated with hastily implemented regulations. Found this analysis helpful?

This led to the conclusion that Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD across multiple chains is the primary reason behind the achievement, and this strategy should be advised to other companies. An example of the analysts who weighed in on this success is Wendy O. She admitted that Ripple’s strategy of placing its stablecoin on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum was a prudent decision. The analyst also urged other significant crypto initiatives to embrace this strategy, noting that the current industry is shifting its focus towards multi-chain adoption. Wendy O’s remarks followed Token Terminal’s statement, which highlighted that RLUSD’s market cap surged to over $1.2 billion, further anticipating that additional increases would follow later. Meanwhile, Crypto lawyer Bill Morgan concurred with the analyst’s opinion, warning that crypto-related initiatives that disregard multi-chain designs will encounter challenges in the future. Morgan urges crypto-related initiatives to follow Ripple’s lead Ripple’s recent partnership with Gemini played a crucial role in pushing RLUSD to achieve an all-time high market cap of more than $1.2 billion. To illustrate this claim, sources with knowledge of the matter mentioned that this collaboration enabled the use of RLUSD card settlements . This upgrade illustrated how the stablecoin’s multi-chain setup paves the way for new payment choices. Bearing this advantage in mind, Morgan cautioned that crypto platforms that ignore the need to extend beyond a single network could end up being outdated. His statement aligned with the growing belief that future tokenized assets and stablecoins are necessary to operate across multiple chains to remain competitive. This was after Morgan shared an X post dated December 7 under the username @Belisarius2020, acknowledging that Wendy O’s findings were a really acute observation. He then elaborated on this observation, highlighting that individuals who fail to recognize the significance of a multi-chain future will get stuck and will not succeed in their operations. Meanwhile, when Ripple decided to introduce RLUSD on Ethereum, the move streamlined access to big pools of liquidity and DeFi platforms for its users. To support this claim, reports revealed that RLUSD being on the XRP ledger means that it processes transactions quickly, and its cost is affordable. Additionally, analysts mentioned that these factors contributed to RLUSD’s unexpected growth. However, Ripple did not disclose any updates concerning its next move for its stablecoin, but RLUSD’s escalating market cap demonstrated increasing interest in the stablecoin. Another significant achievement for Ripple is that RLUSD has received approval for use in international markets, such as Abu Dhabi, demonstrating its growing recognition in regulated financial settings. Ripple’s CTO seeks to get directly involved in the XRPL infrastructure While RLUSD positions itself as one of the rapidly growing stablecoins, sources pointed out that Cross-chain applications are increasingly becoming more common in the ecosystem. These sources further note that RLUSD’s growth underscores the importance of operating across various systems to achieve broader adoption of stablecoins. This discovery was made after David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Ripple, began actively engaging with the XRP Ledger. His decision drew the interest of reporters who reached out to the company’s CTO for comment on the matter. Responding to this, Schwartz mentioned that the primary reason behind his establishment of the XRPL hub was to monitor the network’s operation closely. He also acknowledged that he has not been part of the XRPL infrastructure for a few years, but he is looking forward to being directly engaged again. Moreover, Schwartz addressed issues regarding new delays with validators. According to him, a firm megahub can substantially reduce these delays and enhance the network’s reliability. It is worth noting that the XRP Ledger’s new MPT standard, applicable for tokenizing real-world assets, is among the tools chosen to aid in the development of the network. This change is crucial in enhancing the protocol’s capabilities and backing continual improvement to the infrastructure. Concerning his goal to get involved with XRPL infrastructure, Schwartz explained the current challenges in this sector. He argued that certain situations impact some functions of XRPL, causing it to malfunction. Hence, the hub will help him develop solutions based on real data. Don’t just read crypto news.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-announces-new-approval-for-global-operations-here-are-the-details/,"Binance has significantly expanded its operations in the region by receiving full regulatory approval under Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), which operates as Abu Dhabi’s financial free zone. Binance Receives Full License Approval in Abu Dhabi: Exchange, Clearing, and Brokerage Activities Officially Authorized The Abu Dhabi Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) has granted licenses to three Binance-affiliated entities for exchange operation, clearing services, and brokerage activities. This new structure is seen as a model that mirrors the functioning of traditional financial markets, adapted to the crypto asset ecosystem. Binance's ADGM structure has been organized into three separate companies under the “Nest” brand, in line with local regulations. This allows the FSRA to oversee each function separately. Nest Exchange received a Recognized Investment Exchange license to offer spot and derivatives trading services. Nest Clearing and Custody was authorized as a Recognized Clearing Institution for clearing, custody, and central depository services. Nest Trading received a broker-dealer license covering over-the-counter (OTC) and over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. While structured under the Nest brand, all three entities will operate under Binance's control and form the licensed infrastructure for Binance.com's Abu Dhabi operations. This model provides a framework aligned with the increasingly demanding market structure standards for global exchanges. Binance co-CEO Richard Teng emphasized that this move “demonstrates their commitment to compliance, transparency, and user protection.” ADGM Chairman Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi stated that Binance's arrival in the region solidifies Abu Dhabi's position as a leading hub for innovation and the future of finance. *This is not investment advice.

A revealing look at the latest BTC perpetual futures data provides a clear signal. Across the world’s top three cryptocurrency exchanges, traders are leaning ever so slightly towards a bullish outlook. This subtle bias might be the key to understanding the market’s current pulse. What Do the BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios Tell Us? The 24-hour long/short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a snapshot of collective trader sentiment. Currently, the aggregate data shows a market almost perfectly balanced, but with a distinct tilt. The numbers indicate that more traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price going up than down. This is not a dramatic signal, but in the nuanced world of derivatives, even a small edge can be significant. Let’s break down the data from the three exchanges with the highest open interest: Binance: 50.72% long / 49.28% short OKX: 50.82% long / 49.18% short Bybit: 50.59% long / 49.41% short As you can see, the pattern is consistent. Each major platform shows a long ratio above the 50% neutral mark. Therefore, this isn’t an anomaly on a single exchange; it’s a broad, albeit mild, trend. Why is This Slight Long Bias Important? You might think a difference of less than 1% is trivial. However, in the high-stakes arena of BTC perpetual futures , these minor shifts are closely watched. They represent the collective positioning of some of the market’s most active and leveraged participants. A sustained long bias, even a slight one, can suggest underlying confidence. It indicates that despite recent volatility or uncertainty, the predominant bet is still on upward movement. This data is a crucial piece of the puzzle. It doesn’t operate in a vacuum but interacts with other indicators like funding rates and spot market volume. When perpetual futures show a long bias while funding rates remain neutral or negative, it can signal a healthier, less overheated bullish sentiment compared to times when extreme long positions coincide with high positive funding. How Can Traders Use This Insight? Understanding the sentiment in BTC perpetual futures markets is about gauging the crowd. This information is most powerful when used as a contrarian indicator or a confirmation tool. For instance, if the long bias becomes extreme (e.g., over 65%), it might signal that the market is overly optimistic and due for a correction. Conversely, the current slight bias suggests a cautiously optimistic environment without excessive greed. Here are actionable ways to apply this knowledge: Context is Key: Always compare futures sentiment with spot price action and news flow. Watch for Shifts: A rapid change in these ratios can precede significant price moves. Manage Risk: In a slightly long-biased market, be aware that sudden liquidations can occur if the price dips and triggers stop-losses. Conclusion: A Market Leaning on Hope The data paints a clear picture: the derivatives market for Bitcoin is currently leaning, however gently, towards hope. The consistent long bias across Binance, OKX, and Bybit for BTC perpetual futures reveals a foundational confidence among traders. This isn’t the roaring euphoria of a bull market peak, but the steady hum of belief in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. For the astute observer, these subtle signals are the whispers that often speak volumes before the market shouts. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTC perpetual futures? BTC perpetual futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s future price without an expiry date. They are settled periodically through a funding rate mechanism to keep the contract price aligned with the spot price. What does a “long bias” mean? A long bias means that a higher percentage of open positions in the market are betting that the price of Bitcoin will increase (long positions) compared to those betting it will decrease (short positions). Is a slight long bias bullish for Bitcoin’s price? It indicates bullish sentiment among futures traders, which can be supportive of prices. However, it is just one indicator and must be considered alongside other market factors like trading volume, macroeconomic news, and spot market activity. Which exchanges are considered the top for BTC futures? By open interest, the top exchanges are typically Binance, OKX, and Bybit. Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. How often do these long/short ratios change? These ratios can change by the minute, reflecting real-time shifts in trader sentiment. The 24-hour snapshot provides a smoothed-out view of the prevailing trend over a full trading day. Can retail traders access this data? Yes, many cryptocurrency data analytics websites and some exchanges themselves provide public access to aggregated long/short ratio data for major trading pairs.

This vision is now a reality in the Philippines as GoTyme, a leading digital bank, launches its groundbreaking crypto service. This move bridges traditional finance with the digital asset world, offering unprecedented convenience for Filipino users. The GoTyme crypto service represents a significant step toward mainstream cryptocurrency adoption in Southeast Asia. What is the GoTyme Crypto Service? GoTyme Bank has partnered with U.S. fintech firm Alpaca to introduce cryptocurrency trading directly within its mobile banking application. This integration means users no longer need separate crypto exchange accounts. Instead, they can manage both fiat currency and digital assets in one secure platform. The service currently supports 11 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major digital tokens. This development is particularly significant because it comes from a regulated digital bank. Therefore, it carries more institutional trust than standalone crypto exchanges. The GoTyme crypto service operates under existing banking security protocols, potentially addressing common concerns about cryptocurrency safety and legitimacy. How Does This Benefit Philippine Crypto Users? The launch addresses several pain points for Filipino cryptocurrency enthusiasts. First, it simplifies the onboarding process. Users can fund their crypto purchases directly from their GoTyme bank accounts without transferring funds to external platforms. Second, it enhances security through banking-grade protection measures. Key benefits include: Convenience: Single-app access to banking and crypto services Security: Bank-level security protocols for cryptocurrency holdings Accessibility: Lower barriers to entry for new crypto investors Trust: Backing by a regulated financial institution Why is This Partnership with Alpaca Important? GoTyme’s collaboration with Alpaca provides the technical infrastructure for the crypto service. Alpaca is a U.S.-based fintech company specializing in brokerage and trading APIs. Their expertise ensures the GoTyme crypto service meets international standards for digital asset trading. This partnership demonstrates how traditional financial institutions can leverage fintech expertise to enter the cryptocurrency space. Moreover, it shows a growing trend of banks integrating crypto services rather than competing against them. For Philippine users, this means access to sophisticated trading technology through a familiar banking interface. What Challenges Might This Service Face? Despite the excitement, potential challenges exist. Regulatory scrutiny may increase as the service grows. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has been cautiously supportive of cryptocurrency innovation but maintains strict anti-money laundering requirements. Additionally, market volatility remains a concern for new investors unfamiliar with cryptocurrency risks. However, GoTyme’s approach as a regulated bank may help mitigate these concerns. Their existing compliance frameworks can adapt to cryptocurrency regulations more smoothly than startups. The GoTyme crypto service could actually set new standards for responsible crypto adoption in the Philippine banking sector. What Does This Mean for Philippine Financial Inclusion? This development could accelerate financial inclusion in several ways. First, it introduces digital assets to populations previously excluded from investment opportunities. Second, it demonstrates how digital banking can evolve beyond traditional services. Finally, it positions the Philippines as an innovator in Southeast Asia’s financial technology landscape. The service’s success may encourage other Philippine banks to explore similar offerings. Consequently, we might see increased competition and innovation in the country’s digital finance sector. The GoTyme crypto service isn’t just a product launch—it’s a signal of changing attitudes toward digital assets in mainstream finance. In conclusion, GoTyme’s crypto service launch marks a pivotal moment for Philippine finance. By integrating cryptocurrency trading into digital banking, they’re creating a more accessible and secure entry point for Filipinos. This move could inspire similar innovations across Southeast Asia, potentially transforming how people interact with both traditional and digital assets. The future of Philippine finance looks increasingly digital, decentralized, and democratized. Frequently Asked Questions Which cryptocurrencies can I buy through GoTyme? The GoTyme crypto service currently supports 11 cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and other major digital assets. The complete list is available within the GoTyme banking application. Is the GoTyme crypto service available to all users? The service is available to existing GoTyme Bank customers who complete additional verification steps for cryptocurrency trading. New users must first open a GoTyme bank account before accessing the crypto features. How does GoTyme ensure the security of cryptocurrency holdings? GoTyme implements banking-grade security protocols including multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure custody solutions through their partnership with Alpaca. However, users should understand that cryptocurrencies carry inherent risks different from traditional bank deposits. Are there fees for using the crypto service? Yes, the service includes standard trading fees comparable to other cryptocurrency platforms. Specific fee structures are detailed within the GoTyme application and may vary based on transaction type and size. Can I transfer cryptocurrencies to external wallets? Currently, the service focuses on buying and holding cryptocurrencies within the GoTyme ecosystem. External transfers may be introduced in future updates as the service evolves. How does this affect Philippines cryptocurrency regulations? GoTyme operates under existing Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) regulations and has implemented additional compliance measures for cryptocurrency services. Their regulated approach may help shape future crypto banking standards in the Philippines. Found this insight into Philippine crypto banking valuable?

See What Institutions Are Doing,https://timestabloid.com/bearish-on-xrp-see-what-institutions-are-doing/,"A recent post from crypto enthusiast X Finance Bull highlighted what he described as a measurable shift in institutional behaviour across the digital asset market. He pointed to the continued accumulation of XRP during price dips, contrasting it with declining exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum. His remarks referenced data showing that newly launched XRP exchange-traded funds have been receiving consistent inflows since their debut. These inflows, according to current market figures, have been notably strong compared with their Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts, suggesting a rotation of capital toward assets seen as having regulatory clarity and defined utility within payment infrastructure. Bearish on $XRP ? Institutions are literally buying the dips you fear! Institutional capital is quietly rotating out of Bitcoin and Ethereum…and flowing straight into XRP Week after week, XRP ETFs are pulling $200M+ in fresh inflows. BTC and ETH? Bleeding. Institutions… pic.twitter.com/a4yalISr5h — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 6, 2025 ETF Demand and Capital Movement Current figures place cumulative XRP ETF inflows between $874 million and $906 million within the first few weeks of trading, with daily movements reinforcing the trend. On December 3 alone, XRP ETFs recorded more than $50 million in fresh inflows, pushing their total to over $874 million. Other short-term comparisons further illustrate this divergence. Over the recent 3-day period, XRP ETFs accumulated roughly $207 million in new capital, compared with approximately $52 million for Bitcoin ETFs and $51 million for Ethereum ETFs. On December 2, XRP ETFs recorded approximately $67 million in inflows, while Bitcoin ETFs received nearly $58 million, and Ethereum ETFs saw close to $10 million in outflows. X Finance Bull referred to this pace of accumulation as evidence of an inflection stage, noting that XRP is absorbing institutional capital more rapidly than the larger market typically anticipates. Community Questions on Acquisition Channels Under the post, an X user, BristolSociety3, raised a question about the methods used by ETF providers to acquire large amounts of XRP. He asked why they were sourcing supply primarily through over-the-counter desks rather than through open-market purchases, noting that OTC accumulation prevents buying activity from immediately influencing the asset’s price. The user suggested that investors might expect ETF issuers to contribute to upward price movement rather than avoid it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Clarification from X Finance Bull X Finance Bull responded by stating that ETF desks prioritize securing adequate inventory over short-term price action. His point was that their accumulation phase is operational rather than speculative, and is therefore conducted in ways that do not disrupt market prices. Once inventory is established, he said, any significant market move would occur in the open market as normal trading volume interacts with constrained supply. His view is that the recent inflow data provides a clearer indication of institutional intent than day-to-day price volatility. The added inflow figures and accumulation behaviour contribute to a more detailed understanding of how institutional positioning around XRP is developing. The numbers referenced in the market provide measurable context to X Finance Bull’s post, reinforcing his view that the patterns emerging in ETF activity signal a continued shift in investor allocation within the digital asset sector.

The platform will officially delist the KITE/USDT perpetual futures trading pair. This move directly impacts traders holding positions in this specific market. The scheduled delisting time is 8:00 a.m. UTC on Friday, December 8. If you are involved with KITE perpetual futures , understanding the implications and next steps is essential to protect your capital and navigate this change smoothly. What Does Delisting KITE Perpetual Futures Mean for Traders? When an exchange delists a trading pair like the KITE perpetual futures contract, it means that specific market will cease to exist on that platform. Therefore, after the cutoff time, you will no longer be able to open new positions or trade this instrument on OKX. This is a standard procedure exchanges use to manage their product offerings, often due to factors like low trading volume, liquidity concerns, or strategic shifts. The primary goal is to maintain a healthy and efficient marketplace for all users. Key Dates and Actions You Must Take Before December 8 To avoid any complications or automatic liquidation of your positions, proactive management is key. The deadline is firm, so mark your calendar for 8:00 a.m. UTC on December 8. Here is your actionable checklist: Close Open Positions : You must manually close any open long or short positions you hold in the KITE/USDT perpetual futures market before the deadline. Cancel Open Orders : Remember to cancel any pending limit, stop-loss, or take-profit orders linked to this pair. Withdraw Funds : After closing positions and settling any profits or losses, ensure your USDT is available in your funding account for other trades or withdrawals. Failure to close your positions by the specified time will result in the exchange automatically liquidating them at the prevailing market price. This automated process can lead to unexpected slippage and results. Why Would OKX Delist a Futures Pair? You might wonder, why does this happen? Exchanges regularly review their listed products. The decision to delist KITE perpetual futures likely stems from a combination of factors focused on market quality and user safety. Common reasons include: Sustained low trading volume and liquidity, which can lead to poor price execution. A strategic refocusing of the exchange’s derivatives offerings. Compliance with evolving regulatory standards. Ensuring overall platform stability and performance for all traders. This is a normal part of ecosystem maintenance and is not unique to OKX or the KITE perpetual futures market. What Are Your Alternatives After the Delisting? If KITE remains a core part of your trading strategy, don’t worry. You have several paths forward. First, research if KITE spot trading is still available on OKX or other major exchanges. Alternatively, you can explore if other platforms list KITE perpetual futures or similar derivative products. However, always conduct thorough due diligence on any new platform regarding security, fees, and liquidity before transferring funds or opening new positions. Final Summary: Navigating the KITE Futures Delisting In summary, OKX’s decision to delist the KITE/USDT perpetual futures pair is a clear operational update requiring immediate attention from affected traders. The countdown to December 8 has begun. By proactively closing positions, canceling orders, and re-evaluating your strategy, you can transition seamlessly. This event underscores the importance of staying informed about exchange announcements and maintaining flexible trading strategies in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exact time will OKX delist KITE perpetual futures? A1: The delisting for the KITE/USDT perpetual futures pair is scheduled for 8:00 a.m. UTC on Friday, December 8. Q2: What happens if I forget to close my KITE futures position? A2: If you have an open position at the delisting time, OKX will automatically liquidate it at the current market price. To avoid potential slippage, it is best to close it manually before the deadline. Q3: Can I still trade KITE on OKX after December 8? A3: The delisting specifically applies to the KITE/USDT perpetual futures contract. You should check the OKX spot market to see if KITE spot trading remains available. Q4: Will I lose my funds when the pair is delisted? A4: No, you will not lose your capital outright. Any equity from your closed or liquidated position will be settled in USDT and will remain in your trading or funding account. Q5: Why is OKX removing this trading pair? A5: While OKX has not specified the exact reason, common factors include low liquidity, low trading volume, or a strategic review of their product offerings to ensure market quality. Q6: Where can I trade KITE perpetual futures after this? A6: You will need to research other cryptocurrency exchanges that may offer KITE derivatives. Always verify the reputation and security of any new platform before use. Found this guide on the KITE perpetual futures delisting helpful?

The exchange currently offers crypto-to-crypto trading while working toward full-service restoration, which will allow Indian customers to deposit rupees and purchase digital assets directly on the platform. The San Francisco-based company first entered India in April 2022 but was forced to suspend operations within days after the National Payments Corporation refused to recognize its use of the Unified Payments Interface. By September 2023, Coinbase had withdrawn entirely from India , requiring existing customers to liquidate their holdings and transfer funds elsewhere. @coinbase suspended trading service in India “because of some informal pressure from the Reserve Bank of India”, said Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 11, 2022 Strategic Compliance Gamble Pays Off Coinbase’s willingness to completely exit the market represented a significant commercial risk, John O’Loghlen, the exchange’s Asia-Pacific regional director, told TechCrunch . Speaking at India Blockchain Week, O’Loghlen explained that forcing existing customers to close their accounts ran counter to typical business strategy but established a clean regulatory slate. The company subsequently engaged with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit throughout 2024, securing approval for registration and launching early access in October before expanding to general availability. Global crypto exchange Coinbase has registered with India’s FIU—paving the way to resume trading and launch retail services later this year. #India #Coinbase https://t.co/fEEOzAC4aT — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 11, 2025 The exchange now joins other global platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Bybit in receiving Financial Intelligence Unit authorization. These competitors faced similar regulatory obstacles after the government agency cracked down on offshore exchanges in January 2024 for violating anti-money laundering provisions, blocking their websites, and removing their applications from digital storefronts. Most secured compliance approvals and paid substantial penalties to resume operations. Coinbase has simultaneously deepened its financial commitment to the Indian market by investing additional capital in local exchange CoinDCX at a $2.45 billion valuation. The American firm employs over 500 people nationwide. It continues hiring for positions serving both domestic and international operations, while chief legal officer Paul Grewal recently joined the U.S.-India Business Council board to strengthen bilateral commercial relationships. Tax Structure Creates Operational Headwinds India’s cryptocurrency taxation framework remains among the world’s most punitive, imposing a 30% levy on profits without allowing traders to offset losses against gains. The government additionally deducts 1% from every transaction, discouraging frequent trading activity and pushing an estimated 90% of Indian crypto volume to offshore platforms. When combined with mandatory surcharges and additional fees, the effective tax burden reaches 42.7% for high-income traders. O’Loghlen acknowledged these fiscal barriers while expressing hope that authorities will eventually ease restrictions to make digital asset ownership less burdensome. The Reserve Bank of India has consistently opposed cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about macroeconomic stability, financial system risks, and vulnerabilities to money laundering. A recently disclosed government document revealed that Indian officials remain reluctant to implement comprehensive crypto legislation , fearing that formal recognition might encourage mainstream adoption and create systemic financial exposure. India stalls full crypto framework due to systemic risk fears. Officials plan to maintain partial oversight with strict taxation rules. #Crypto #India #RBI https://t.co/hH14ySucmR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 10, 2025 Despite these regulatory headwinds, India consistently ranks among the top countries in global crypto adoption indices, with citizens holding approximately $4.5 billion in digital assets. Tax authorities have recently intensified scrutiny, investigating over 400 high-net-worth individuals suspected of evading payment obligations through peer-to-peer transactions on platforms like Binance and demanding regional office reports by mid-October. Building Trust Through User Experience Coinbase aims to differentiate itself through security and accessibility, according to O’Loghlen, who emphasized the need for intuitive interfaces comparable to popular Indian consumer applications. “ We want to be known as that trusted exchange, ensure that your funds are safe with us, ” he stated. “ We’re not going to get out to the masses if you can’t have a really nice UI, a trusted experience that allows you to onboard in a matter of minutes. “ The company’s return coincides with India’s emergence as a major blockchain development hub, with its share of global Web3 developers growing substantially in recent years. However, the operational environment remains complex, as government officials continue promoting the Reserve Bank’s digital rupee while heavily taxing private cryptocurrencies that lack sovereign backing.

Cùng lúc đó, một loạt ETF altcoin mới liên quan đến LTC, HBAR, DOGE và LINK cũng đã chính thức gia nhập cuộc chơi, mỗi quỹ đều ghi nhận dòng vốn khiêm tốn nhưng ổn định kể từ khi ra mắt. Thực đơn “Altcoin Buffet” chính thức xuất hiện trên Wall Street Bảy ETF Solana riêng biệt đã tạo ra $618,62 triệu dòng vốn ròng kể từ khi niêm yết, và với $915,08 triệu tổng tài sản quản lý, các quỹ này hiện chiếm khoảng 1,15% vốn hóa Solana . Trong khi đó, XRP đã thu hút $874,28 triệu , theo dữ liệu từ sosovalue.com. Chỉ có bốn ETF XRP xuất hiện trên bảng điều khiển của nền tảng này — do Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Canary và Bitwise quản lý. ETF của Canary, với mã XRPC , dẫn đầu với $357 triệu dòng vốn kể từ ngày đầu tiên. Riêng ngày hôm qua, cả nhóm thu hút $50,27 triệu , trong đó Grayscale GXRP đóng góp lớn nhất. Tổng cộng, bốn ETF này đang nắm giữ $906,46 triệu giá trị XRP , tương đương 0,68% vốn hóa của XRP . Đối với các nhà đầu tư muốn tiếp cận LINK, HBAR, LTC và DOGE , những ETF mới ra mắt này cũng đã ghi nhận tổng cộng $133,46 triệu dòng vốn ròng. Riêng DOGE có hai ETF — Grayscale GDOG và Bitwise BWOW — thu hút $2,85 triệu . ETF Floodgates Open: Altcoin ngập tràn lựa chọn Grayscale GLNK đã thu hút khoảng $40,90 triệu , trong khi LTCC của Canary (theo dõi Litecoin) thu về $7,67 triệu . ETF HBAR của Canary (HBR) đã ghi nhận $82,04 triệu dòng vốn ròng. Khi nhà đầu tư có thể dễ dàng “nhảy giữa các quỹ”, thị trường nhiều khả năng sẽ biến động mạnh hơn khi dòng vốn luân chuyển liên tục. Và mặc dù XRP và SOL ETF đang bám đuổi sát sao nhau, cả hai vẫn còn rất xa so với BTC và ETH ETF — những quỹ đã được triển khai sớm hơn một năm và đang tiến gần mốc hai năm hoạt động. Khi ngày càng nhiều ETF altcoin được tung ra thị trường, dòng vốn sẽ tiếp tục phân tán. Thách thức lớn nhất sẽ là liệu sự hào hứng của nhà đầu tư có theo kịp tốc độ mở rộng của danh sách quỹ hay không. Hiện tại, các ETF mới đang cạnh tranh quyết liệt với nhau, nhưng hành trình để đạt tới tầm vóc của BTC và ETH ETF vẫn còn rất dài. Tuy nhiên, sự mở rộng này cho thấy thị trường đang chuyển sang giai đoạn mới — một giai đoạn của sự lựa chọn đa dạng, cạnh tranh mạnh mẽ và dòng vốn mới tràn vào .

Therefore, this milestone propels XRP into a league of its own. No other U.S. exchange offers a fully regulated suite of products under a single federal authority. Significantly, XRP is now approved as trading collateral, allowing it, and RLUSD, to be used as margin just like Treasuries or stablecoins. This isn’t merely a technical upgrade; it’s a landmark legitimacy breakthrough. XRP’s long regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. continues to fade away. This milestone transforms it from a high-volume crypto token into a fully regulated part of U.S. financial market infrastructure, unlocking legal access for banks, hedge funds, and institutional traders. Notably, the impact is monumental. CFTC-regulated spot trading boosts transparency and price discovery, while futures, perps, and options enable sophisticated risk management. Collateral approval elevates XRP from a speculative token to a functional financial instrument, laying the groundwork for deeper liquidity, stronger institutional confidence, and broader real-world adoption. Beyond mechanics, this is a powerful psychological signal. Regulatory clarity, a major hurdle for institutional crypto adoption, is now addressed, giving XRP a rare credibility edge in the U.S. market. Therefore, XRP just achieved its most significant regulatory milestone in years. Once operating on the fringes of traditional finance, it now stands fully within it. As Diana highlights, XRP has transitioned from a mere crypto token to U.S.-regulated market infrastructure, a shift that could reshape its long-term role in global finance. Conclusion XRP’s debut in a CFTC-regulated U.S. spot market marks a transformative milestone. Now approved as trading collateral and offering a full suite of regulated products, XRP gains unmatched legitimacy, transparency, and institutional access. Therefore, this signals increasing regulatory acceptance of digital assets and positions XRP as a bridge between traditional finance and the future of crypto, paving the way for broader adoption and sustained growth.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-08 07:32:43

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.02. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $3.04 and $3.29, with an average value of $3.16. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.3221 Market Cap $605.81M Trading Volume $79.69M Circulating Supply 1.89B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2544 (Oct 10, 2025) 24-hour High $0.3197 24-hour Low $0.2981 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 12.61% (Very High) 50-Day SMA $0.3825 14-Day RSI 40.23 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 12/30 (40%) 200-Day SMA $0.6841 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is attempting a rebound but remains under key daily resistance at $0.321–0.325. Short-term momentum is improving, but volume support remains weak. Holding above $0.315 is crucial for any upside continuation. Optimism 1-day price chart The daily chart for December 8 shows OP climbing toward $0.320–0.321, a level aligning with the mid-Bollinger band at $0.3209. OP’s price has spent several weeks trading below this band, so today’s push into it signals the first meaningful attempt at reclaiming momentum after a long corrective leg. However, the upper band at $0.360 remains a distant upside marker, indicating that volatility is compressed and the broader trend still leans bearish. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD remains negative but is curling upward, with the histogram moving toward zero, a subtle hint that downside momentum is fading. The RSI at 38.9 is also rising from oversold territory, suggesting sellers are losing strength rather than buyers taking full control. The structure remains fragile because a failure to hold above $0.310 could drag the price back toward $0.285–0.281, the lower Bollinger band, and the recent support cluster. A daily close firmly above $0.321 would be the first constructive sign that OP may attempt a broader recovery toward $0.340–0.350, but until that happens, this remains a cautious rebound inside a broader downtrend. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour chart, OP has broken above the Alligator teeth and lips (around $0.311–0.312), shifting short-term structure into a mild bullish phase. The latest candle near $0.322 shows buyers briefly taking control after several sessions of choppy sideways movement. This break signals a possible attempt to confirm near-term trend strength if OP can maintain closes above $0.315. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView OBV remains weak at –106.2M, revealing that volume has not yet meaningfully supported the upside move, so momentum is still fragile. However, CMF at +0.06 is climbing back above zero, indicating improving capital inflow, something the pair has lacked for several days. If buyers hold at $0.315 within this timeframe, OP could push to test $0.324–$ 0.330 next. A rejection here, especially if OBV fails to rise, would expose a quick drop back toward $0.305.

OP is showing early stabilization and mild bullish pressure, but buyers must defend $0.315 and reclaim $0.325 to confirm a true shift. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently the best crypto to buy. MUTM is primed and ready to capitalize on the extremely awaited V1 protocol launch, towards the end of Q4, which expresses the project’s attention towards the implementation of usability. With the extremely low price, which is merely $0.035 today, the project continues to see increased attention. Having attained more than $19.18 million in presale and having garnered more than 18,350 supporters, Mutuum Finance is currently the best crypto among new buyers. Boosting the Presale Process with More Investors Entering Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is among the most-watched blockchain initiatives on the eve of the new year, 2026. The ongoing presale is attracting a lot of attention, and so far, it has gained more than 18,350 members and has exceeded the $19.18 million mark. The cost of buying tokens in phase 6 is $0.035, before phase 7, which is set to raise prices by nearly 20% to $0.04. The project has gained so much traction because it focuses on financial applications and utilization, rather than creating hype. This is what has made MUTM so attractive to financial investors, who look at utility focus when searching for new investments and looking to buy the best crypto. Ready to Go Live on Sepolia Testnet Mutuum Finance is preparing to launch the V1 protocol on the Sepolia testnet, which will take place during Q4 2025. This is a long-awaited moment, marking an essential milestone regarding the technical part of the project. When it happens, the most basic components of the Mutuum ecosystem, such as the mtTokens, collateral and borrowing mechanism, reward mechanism, and interest mechanism, will finally see the light of day. At the very beginning, support will be provided only for ETH and USDT. Mutuum Finance, by connecting the presale process of the MUTM token and the development stage of the Mutuum protocol, provides not only a chance to buy into the token but also gives the community a chance to utilize a system that is already working. In effect, it is the prime factor why the MUTM token is currently the best crypto to buy. At this stage, an audit is currently being conducted on the lending and borrowing platform offered by Mutuum Finance by Halborn Security, which is considered to be among the most reputable blockchain companies. This is an assessment of the lending and borrowing platform to ensure it works and is secure, regardless of the circumstances. After Halborn has completed the assessment, the project will soon issue a formal announcement regarding the new timeline when the testnet launch is to take place. This is another sign showing Mutuum Finance upholds integrity, transparency, and future viability, which form part of the essential components identifying the pursuit and aspiration of trust and the best cryptocurrency to buy and to invest. MUTM is at the forefront among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. With well over 18,350 participants and more than $19.18 million, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is near the total sellout of Phase 6 at $0.035, which is the last chance to take part on the platform before the prices go up to $0.04. In light of the V1 Sepolia testnet on the near horizon, lending and borrowing support, and Halborn audit, Mutuum Finance is filling the community with fresh confidence in the project. As the presale is near the 100% completion stage of phase 6, Mutuum Finance certainly tops the best cryptos showing considerable interest and is the very best to buy into next year, 2026.

Key Takeaways: Vitalik Buterin proposes a trustless onchain gas futures market to let users lock in future Ethereum transaction fees. The system would function like traditional futures markets, helping traders and developers hedge against sudden fee spikes. Buterin says a futures market could bring predictable costs for heavy network users. In a post on X over the weekend, Buterin said repeated questions about whether Ethereum’s roadmap can guarantee low fees inspired him to outline how such a market could work. Buterin Says Onchain Gas Futures Could Let Users Lock In Ethereum Fees Buterin argued that an onchain gas futures system would give users the ability to lock in gas prices for future time windows, offering greater certainty as Ethereum scales. The concept mirrors traditional futures markets, such as those for commodities, where buyers and sellers agree on a fixed price for a future date to hedge risk or speculate on price movements. Applied to Ethereum, it would allow users to prepay for a specific amount of gas during a chosen time period, protecting them from unexpected fee spikes. “People would get a clear signal of expectations for future gas fees, and would even be able to hedge against future gas prices,” Buterin wrote. He suggested that a market-built signal for future base fees could help traders, developers, and heavy network users plan with far more confidence, especially those managing large volumes of transactions or operating decentralized applications. We need a good trustless onchain gas futures market. (Like, a prediction market on the BASEFEE) I've heard people ask: ""today fees are low, but what about in 2 years? You say they'll stay low because of increasing gaslimit from BAL + ePBS + later ZK-EVM, but do I believe you?""… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 6, 2025 Gas costs have eased this year, with basic Ethereum transfers averaging around 0.474 gwei, roughly one cent, according to Etherscan. However, more complex activity still comes at a higher cost, including token swaps ($0.16), NFT transactions ($0.27), and cross-chain bridging ($0.05). Despite the overall decline, fee volatility remains a challenge. YCharts data shows average Ethereum fees started 2025 near $1 before falling to $0.30, punctuated by swings as high as $2.60 and as low as $0.18. Buterin’s proposal aims to smooth these fluctuations by giving users a mechanism to anticipate and manage costs, particularly ahead of high-demand periods. Ethereum Exchange Balances Hit Record Lows As reported, Ether held on centralized exchanges has dropped to an all-time low , with balances falling to just 8.7% of total supply, the smallest share since Ethereum launched in 2015. The decline marks a 43% drop since July, a shift analysts say is tightening liquid supply and setting the stage for a potential market squeeze. The rapid drawdown is linked to structural changes in how ETH is being used. More tokens are flowing into staking, restaking protocols, layer-2 networks, DeFi collateral loops, digital-asset treasury holdings, and long-term self-custody, all destinations that rarely send ETH back to exchanges. Research outlet Milk Road said ETH is now in its “tightest supply environment ever,” noting that Bitcoin’s exchange balance remains significantly higher.

In 2028, the DOT price is expected to range from a maximum of $7.74 to a minimum of $6.78. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $23.28 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong Polkadot protocol architecture, which ensures network security—and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on the Acala Network, which enhances functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility, contributing to its substantial market capitalization. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $2.06 Market Cap $3.44B Trading Volume $114.9M Circulating Supply 1.64B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $2.15 24-hour Low $2.14 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 14.25% 50-Day SMA $ 2.75 14-Day RSI 36.80 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 20(Extreme Fear) Green Days 9/30 (30%) 200-Day SMA $ 3.79 Polkadot price analysis: DOT holds steady in a tight range as traders navigate low-volatility conditions Price stays between $2.06 support and $2.14-$2.15 resistance, indicating balanced pressure on both sides. Sharp 4-hour swings recover quickly, but repeated failures at resistance keep DOT stuck in consolidation. Stable volume and unbroken boundaries signal hesitation, with DOT holding steady but directionless. On December 8, 2025, Polkadot’s DOT token trades at around $2.12, down 0.86% decline over the past 24 hours, according to the provided market chart. The daily range reflected limited volatility, with DOT moving between a low of $2.06 and a high of $2.15, suggesting restrained momentum despite visible intraday swings. Polkadot daily price chart: DOT remains range-bound as resistance holds firm near $2.15 DOT continued to trade below key mid-2025 resistance levels, with sellers consistently defending the $2.15–$2.14 zone. Repeated rejections confirmed weak bullish momentum, while the $2.06 intraday low aligned with a broader support band that has held multiple times, keeping price movement confined to a narrow consolidation range. The structure reflected a market balanced between demand at the lower boundary and supply overhead, locking DOT into sideways action. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView The shift from green to red zones on the chart showed ongoing changes in trader positioning without forming a clear directional bias. Volume remained steady but insufficient to trigger a breakout, signaling that the market was still waiting for a catalyst. Price behavior stayed disciplined within defined boundaries, reinforcing the broader consolidation pattern. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT volatility confirms ongoing rangebound structure DOT displayed sharper swings on the 4-hour timeframe, with a pronounced dip followed by a quick recovery into the $2.12–$2.14 range. The rebound confirmed that buyers were active at lower levels. Yet repeated failures to push through resistance and a visible lower spike signaled seller exhaustion before momentum faded near the upper band, reinforcing DOT’s short-term rangebound behavior. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView A mild upward slope formed after the deepest intraday drop, but the structure still lacked evidence of a confirmed trend reversal. Price action stayed highly sensitive to small shifts, with brief green waves turning red as traders locked in quick profits, and DOT’s inability to hold above the chart’s midpoint highlighted ongoing caution, keeping the asset confined to tight fluctuations without a clear directional bias. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 2.73 SELL SMA 5 $ 2.60 SELL SMA 10 $ 2.45 SELL SMA 21 $ 2.46 SELL SMA 50 $ 2.75 SELL SMA 100 $ 3.35 SELL SMA 200 $ 3.79 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 2.50 SELL EMA 5 $ 2.73 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.10 SELL EMA 21 $ 3.45 SELL EMA 50 $ 3.70 SELL EMA 100 $ 3.86 SELL EMA 200 $ 4.21 SELL What can you expect next for Polkadot (DOT)? Polkadot’s DOT remains confined between $2.06 support and $2.15–$2.14 resistance, reflecting a market balanced between buyers at lower levels and sellers near resistance. Despite occasional sharp 4-hour swings, the price quickly recovers, showing that traders are active but hesitant to push the token decisively in either direction. Stable volume and repeated resistance rejections suggest the market is in a consolidation phase, waiting for a catalyst to trigger a breakout. Short-term, DOT is likely to continue trading sideways within this tight range unless a surge in buying or selling pressure emerges. A break above $2.15 could signal renewed bullish momentum, while a drop below $2.06 would likely open the door to further declines. Until then, the market shows hesitation and caution, with price action sensitive to small shifts and minor intraday swings dominating sentiment. Is Polkadot a good investment? Currently, DOT is range-bound between $2.06 support and $2.15 resistance, showing low volatility and a lack of clear directional momentum. This makes it more suitable for short-term traders who thrive in consolidation ranges, as price swings are limited and predictable within defined boundaries. For long-term investors, DOT’s potential depends on broader market catalysts. A break above $2.15 could signal renewed bullish momentum, possibly attracting new investors, while a drop below $2.06 may indicate further downside risk. Until a decisive breakout occurs, DOT’s sideways movement means that gains could be limited, and risk remains tied to market sentiment and macro conditions. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot’s mild 0.86% decline to around $2.12 reflects low volatility and range-bound trading rather than a major market shift. The token remains confined between $2.06 support and $2.15 resistance, with repeated rejections at the upper boundary keeping the price from advancing. Short-term sell-offs at resistance combined with cautious trader positioning have led to small dips that are quickly recovered, indicating hesitation rather than panic. In short, DOT is down due to minor profit-taking and stalled bullish momentum, not a fundamental market downturn. The sideways consolidation suggests the market is awaiting a catalyst to break the current range, with neither buyers nor sellers able to dominate decisively. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2029, with expectations for next week also showing positive trends. Will Polkadot reach $20? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $40 by 2031. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years. However, you are advised to do your research before investing in the volatile market, especially considering future performance. Polkadot price prediction December 2025 Here are the current Polkadot price movements in December 2025. The potential low is $2.07, while the current price might average around $2.11.

Polkadot historic price sentiment After spending most of the second half of 2020 trading around $4-$5, the price broke above the previous all-time high of $7 on December 29 and quickly reached the Polkadot price projection of $10. Polkadot price history | Coinmarketcap Polkadot experienced rapid growth, with its price climbing from around $3 in January to an all-time high of approximately $57.50 in May 2021. After the peak, the price declined sharply, falling to around $10 by July before partially recovering to over $40 in November 2021. In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, resulting in a trading range of $4.64 to $5.28 in February. In March 2025, Polkadot (DOT) traded at approximately $4.30. In April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) experienced a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility. In May, Polkadot (DOT) began trading at around $ 4.10 and exhibited moderate fluctuations. As of the latest update, the price has declined slightly and is currently hovering near $ 3.90, reflecting a mild bearish trend so far. Polkadot (DOT) declined from a high of around $4.20 to approximately $3.30 in June, with a consistent downtrend and brief rebounds near $3.60 in July. In August 2025, Polkadot traded around $4.10, maintaining a steady pace with limited volatility. The price slightly dipped during September 2025, hovering near $4.00 as market sentiment remained neutral. By October 2025, DOT showed mild recovery, trading near $4.30, suggesting cautious accumulation among traders amid broader market stabilization. As of November 2025, Polkadot price fluctuated between $2.55 and $2.67 before stabilizing around $2.60.

There's a $1 Billion Risk!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-investors-attention-these-two-levels-are-critical-theres-a-1-billion-risk/,"Bitcoin (BTC), which fell below $90,000 over the weekend, started the critical Fed week with a recovery. While Bitcoin is recovering slightly and climbing above the $91,000 level, major altcoins including Ethereum (ETH) are also showing gains. Ethereum is back above $3,100, while XRP and Solana (SOL) are up 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively, in the last 24 hours. While it is stated that whether the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins will continue depends on the FED decision and the statements of FED chairman Jerome Powell, the latest data came from the cryptocurrency tracking platform Coinglass. Bitcoin's price movements are poised to trigger significant liquidation events on mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX), according to the latest data from Coinglass. “At this point, if Bitcoin rises above $93,000, $721 million worth of BTC short positions on CEXs will be liquidated. Conversely, if the Bitcoin price falls below $90,000, $340 million worth of long positions will be liquidated.” According to current data, $450 million worth of leveraged transactions were liquid in the last 24 hours, while $293.2 million worth of long positions and $157.5 million worth of short positions were liquid. While 130,468 traders were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the ETH/USD transaction on Hyperliquid. *This is not investment advice.

His projection is tied to a thesis that bitcoin will evolve from “digital gold” into the core collateral layer of the global financial system. Jackson said his thinking grows out of the same “hundred bagger” framework he used when buying beaten-down equities like Carvana. He recalled entering Carvana after its share price collapsed from around $400 to roughly $3.50 in 2022, at a time when sentiment was almost universally hostile. “You would hear things like, that’s run by a bunch of criminals. This is what a bunch of idiots. Like you’d have to be an idiot to let your company go from $400 this year to $450 or $350 rather,” he told Rosen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Profitability Hits ‘Complete Reset’ — What’s Next For Price? For Jackson, that period illustrated how markets behave at extremes. “It’s human nature almost that when you’re in the moment of max pain or pessimism, you can only see what’s right in front of you,” he said. Yet the underlying product remained strong: “It wasn’t a broken platform. It wasn’t a broken service they would tell you they loved it. It was so easy. It was the best customer experience they had.” From there, he could “envision how they were going to be like a much more profitable business” once the company focused on profitability and addressed its debt. Jackson’s Long-Term Thesis For Bitcoin He applies the same long-horizon lens to bitcoin, arguing that the day-to-day ticker and polarized narratives obscure its structural potential. “We get so tied to turning on the TV and just seeing, like, what’s the price of Bitcoin today […] Some people are bearish and they say, oh, it’s a Ponzi scheme. And some people are bullish and they just, you know, throw these like kind of pie in the sky targets that you can’t really tie to reality,” Jackson said. “It’s kind of hard to latch on to like, what is the value of this thing?” Jackson begins with the common “digital gold” framing. He asks how large the gold market is, how many central banks and sovereigns hold it and why. “Could Bitcoin be as big as gold one day? That seems like a safe assumption,” he argued, adding that because it is “digital” and “programmable” rather than a “hunk of rock,” younger generations may prefer it as a store of value. But he stresses that this is only part of the story, as bitcoin has not become a medium for daily transactions “since the guy who bought pizza with Bitcoin back in like 2011.” The “penny dropped,” he said, when he began to think in terms of what he calls the “global collateral layer” that underpins borrowing by sovereigns and central banks. Historically, that base layer moved from gold to the Eurodollar system from the 1960s onward, and today is heavily intertwined with sovereign debt. “All the countries around the world issue debt and then they kind of borrow against that and they do their daily like government transactions,” he noted, but “there are problems with that.” Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Top Analyst Assigns 91.5% Probability In Jackson’s “Vision 2041,” bitcoin replaces the Eurodollar and, functionally, becomes the neutral asset that other balance sheets are built upon. He argues that bitcoin is “much superior” as collateral because it is digital and “apolitical,” sitting outside central banks and the influence of “whoever the latest treasury secretary here is in the US.” As with the Eurodollar, he does not see this as a direct attack on the dollar or Treasuries, but as a new underlying layer: “There’s some underlying thing that a lot of other countries and the financial systems borrow against to kind of do things.” Eric Jackson (@ericjackson) expects bitcoin to hit $50 million by 2041. He compares his thesis to how he knew Carvana, $CVNA, would be a 100-bagger stock pick. pic.twitter.com/CA9BWoR4zF — Phil Rosen (@philrosenn) December 7, 2025 Looking ahead 15 years, Jackson envisions sovereigns that currently issue and roll debt instead “rely on Bitcoin,” because “over time, like that’s much more logical.” Given the “enormous” scale of the sovereign debt world, he argues that if bitcoin becomes the dominant collateral substrate, its price per coin would need to reach orders of magnitude above current levels—hence his $50 million-by-2041 target. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $91,574.

Instead of offering broad speculation, the remarks in the accompanying interview from Digital Ascension Group CEO Jake Claver focus on regulatory clarity, institutional readiness, and the mechanics of market settlement. The claims are specific, tied to ongoing industry developments, and present a structured view of how XRP could be deployed in real-world environments. With @beyond_broke on how Ripple's $XRP can impact the financial system as one of the most compliant, inter-connected crypto tokens in the US: ""They can absolutely start using XRP today."" pic.twitter.com/wOrfv3vsS7 — ALLINCRYPTO (@RealAllinCrypto) December 6, 2025 Clarity and Current U.S. Conditions In the interview, Claver explained that XRP currently holds one of the clearest regulatory positions among digital assets in the United States outside of Bitcoin, at least until new legislation, such as the Clarity Act, is finalized. He stated that this level of definition gives the asset a functional advantage in scenarios where rapid settlement or liquidity support would be required. Claver noted that, in a situation involving systemic stress, financial entities could already utilize XRP to conduct real-time settlement for operations connected to the DTCC, which plays a central role in U.S. market infrastructure. Industry Engagement and Nasdaq’s Position Claver also referenced discussions from the recent Swell conference , where he attended a session featuring the president of Nasdaq, interviewed by Ripple President Monica Long. According to his account, Nasdaq indicated that its first major application of distributed ledger technology would be in back-end trade settlement with the DTCC. Claver connected this to ongoing developments around Project Ion, which has been exploring the modernization of clearance and settlement processes. His remarks underscored that large market operators are focusing on blockchain technology in practical, operational roles rather than speculative use cases. Liquidity, Volatility, and Institutional Dynamics Claver addressed the long-standing volatility associated with digital assets, noting that price swings often emerge from speculation, leveraged positions, and the impact of large holders. He compared this behavior with what has occurred in the current Bitcoin market cycle, where ETF-driven liquidity has contributed to more stable price action. According to him, once digital assets like XRP develop sustained liquidity at an institutional scale, they may begin to display more consistent pricing and reduced volatility. He suggested that continuous buy and sell flows could create stability similar to the environment supporting Bitcoin ETFs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Settlement Utility and Long-Term Market Effects In his view, sufficient liquidity would enable XRP to be used to settle market operations at scale, providing consistent transaction volume that supports long-term price stability. Claver expressed the personal opinion that once the asset surpasses a major price threshold and becomes actively used within market infrastructure, it may not return to its historical levels. He suggested that institutional settlement flows could create price floors over time, offering a structural backstop. Claver concluded that such conditions could encourage broader institutional participation, as real utility in global market settlement would serve as a foundation for adoption rather than speculation.

('Circle') (NYSE:CRCL), a global financial technology firm and the issuer of USDC through its regulated entities. The partnership aims to expand USDC access across Bybit's global ecosystem, strengthen liquidity of the world's largest regulated stablecoin[1], and reinforce Bybit's position as a regulatory-compliant platform committed to transparency and trust. As part of this partnership, Bybit will enhance USDC liquidity across spot and derivatives markets, enabling a more efficient trading environment for retail and institutional users. The two companies will also roll out a series of campaigns and initiatives to increase the utility of USDC across Bybit's products and services. The partnership will further extend to fiat on- and off-ramp solutions, combining Circle's infrastructure and networks of partners with Bybit's global reach to simplify deposits and withdrawals across key markets. Bybit users will then benefit from greater speed, transparency, and efficiency when converting between local currencies and digital assets. Bybit also plans to expand USDC integration across its ecosystem, including Bybit Earn for savings, Bybit Card for cashback rewards, and Bybit Pay for everyday transactions — while reinforcing its commitment to compliance and responsible innovation. In addition, Bybit was among the first wave of more than one hundred companies to join the public testnet of Circle's Arc network, a new layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for stablecoin-native finance. Arc's public testnet launched in October 2025, with broad-based engagement and collaboration from across the financial and economic system, deep infrastructure support, and global participation. Regulatory Compliance as a Cornerstone of Innovation Bybit recently secured a full Virtual Asset Platform Operator License from the UAE's Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), marking a major milestone in its expansion in the Middle East and positioning it as the first global exchange to secure this level of regulatory approval in the region.

(‘Circle’) (NYSE:CRCL), a global financial technology firm and the issuer of USDC through its regulated entities. The partnership aims to expand USDC access across Bybit’s global ecosystem, strengthen liquidity of the world’s largest regulated stablecoin[1], and reinforce Bybit’s position as a regulatory-compliant platform committed to transparency and trust. As part of this partnership, Bybit will enhance USDC liquidity across spot and derivatives markets, enabling a more efficient trading environment for retail and institutional users. The two companies will also roll out a series of campaigns and initiatives to increase the utility of USDC across Bybit’s products and services. The partnership will further extend to fiat on- and off-ramp solutions, combining Circle’s infrastructure and networks of partners with Bybit’s global reach to simplify deposits and withdrawals across key markets. Bybit users will then benefit from greater speed, transparency, and efficiency when converting between local currencies and digital assets. Bybit also plans to expand USDC integration across its ecosystem, including Bybit Earn for savings, Bybit Card for cashback rewards, and Bybit Pay for everyday transactions — while reinforcing its commitment to compliance and responsible innovation.

The platform has implemented crucial changes to the BORA token circulation plan following a direct request from the BORA development team. This isn’t just a routine notice; it’s a strategic shift that could reshape tokenomics and influence future value. For investors and enthusiasts, understanding this update is essential for navigating the next phase of BORA’s journey. What Exactly Changed in the BORA Token Circulation Plan? Upbit’s announcement centers on modifying the schedule and mechanics of how BORA tokens enter the circulating supply. While the exchange did not publish granular details, such updates typically involve adjustments to: Vesting Schedules: Altering the unlock timeline for tokens allocated to team members, advisors, or early investors. Emission Rates: Changing the pace at which new tokens are released through staking rewards, ecosystem grants, or other incentives. Supply Management: Implementing new mechanisms for token burns, buybacks, or treasury management to control inflation. The core takeaway is that the BORA team proactively sought this change, signaling a deliberate strategy to optimize long-term ecosystem health rather than a reaction to market pressure. Why Does a Token Circulation Plan Matter So Much? Think of a token’s circulation plan as its economic heartbeat. It directly controls the balance between available supply and market demand. A well-managed BORA token circulation plan builds investor confidence by demonstrating foresight and discipline. Conversely, a poorly communicated or overly inflationary plan can lead to sell pressure and erode value. This update suggests the BORA team is prioritizing sustainable growth, which is a positive signal for the project’s maturity. What Are the Potential Impacts for BORA Holders? For current and prospective BORA holders, this revision has several key implications. First, it may reduce the risk of sudden, large-volume token unlocks that can dilute price. Second, it could extend the project’s runway by ensuring resources are distributed strategically over time. However, the specific impact depends entirely on the details. Is the new plan more conservative or more aggressive? The market will need clarity. Therefore, the community should watch for official communications from the BORA team that explain the rationale and new tokenomics model in detail. How Does This Reflect Broader Trends in Crypto? This move aligns with a growing industry emphasis on responsible tokenomics . After the excesses of 2021-2022, projects are now judged heavily on their supply management. A transparent and investor-friendly BORA token circulation plan can be a major competitive advantage. It shows that the team is learning from past market cycles and is committed to building a durable ecosystem, not just short-term hype. This is especially crucial for projects like BORA, which is deeply integrated into the gaming and digital content space, where user adoption depends on stable token utility. What Should You Do Next as an Investor? Do not panic or make impulsive decisions based on a headline. Instead, adopt a measured approach. First, seek out the primary source documentation from both Upbit and the official BORA channels. Second, analyze how the changes align with the project’s 2024 roadmap and development goals. Third, consider how this affects your personal investment thesis for BORA. Does this update increase your confidence in the team’s long-term vision? Responsible investing in crypto requires digging beneath the announcement to understand the ‘why’ behind the change. In summary, Upbit’s update to the BORA token circulation plan is a proactive, strategic decision that underscores the project’s evolution. While the precise effects on token price will unfold over time, the action itself signals a mature approach to ecosystem management. For the crypto community, it serves as a reminder that foundational tokenomics are just as important as technological promises. The true test will be in the execution and communication of this new plan in the months ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token circulation plan? A: A token circulation plan is a schedule that outlines how and when a cryptocurrency’s total supply will be released into the market. It includes details on vesting for teams, investor unlocks, staking rewards, and other emission mechanisms. Q2: Why did the BORA team request this change from Upbit? A: While not explicitly stated, teams typically request such changes to optimize tokenomics for long-term health. This could mean slowing down inflation, extending project runway, or better aligning token releases with ecosystem milestones. Q3: Will this update directly increase the BORA token price? A: Not necessarily. A well-managed circulation plan can reduce sell-side pressure and build confidence, which are positive fundamentals. However, price is influenced by many factors, including overall market sentiment, adoption, and Bitcoin’s trajectory. Q4: Where can I find the official details of the new plan? A> You should monitor the official BORA project blog, whitepaper updates, and their official social media channels (like Twitter/X) for the most detailed and authoritative information. Upbit’s announcement is the first step, but the project itself will provide the full context. Q5: Does this affect BORA tokens held on other exchanges? A: Yes. Changes to the fundamental tokenomics and emission schedule of BORA affect all tokens, regardless of where they are held or traded. The circulation plan is a property of the blockchain asset itself. Q6: Is this a common practice in the cryptocurrency industry? A> Yes. As projects mature and market conditions change, it is becoming increasingly common for teams to revise their tokenomics. This reflects a more professional and responsive approach to project management compared to the early days of crypto. Ready to dive deeper into smart tokenomics and market-moving updates?

The chart, sourced from Bloomberg and Google Trends, has been widely shared across crypto social media today. A search for the keyword “debasement” on Google Trends actually shows that it spiked in 2012 and has spiked again recently as fears grow. Searching for the term “dollar debasement” shows the highest ever levels in recent weeks in the United States. Google Searches for Dollar “Debasement” soared this quarter to the highest level in history pic.twitter.com/qJJFqd5b5h — Barchart (@Barchart) December 6, 2025 DXY Down … M2 Supply Up Fears and curiosity have grown this year as the greenback has had a rough ride, losing more than 10% against certain currencies. The US Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the US dollar against a basket of other currencies, has declined since the beginning of this year. It remained range-bound from late 2022 to late 2024, rising to a two-year high of 110 in January 2025. However, it plunged by more than 12% to a three-year low of 96.3 in mid-September and remains only slightly higher than that level currently, according to Tradingview. This means that the dollar has steadily weakened against many other currencies worldwide this year. Additionally, the phrase “debasement trade” came to light this year as investors sought ways to distance themselves from the plunging currency. In October, entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said financial institutions are quickly waking up to the debasement trade, realizing that “no one is ever going to stop printing money.” This is clearly evident in the M2 money supply chart , which has reached an all-time high of $22.3 trillion. With the Federal Reserve ending QT (quantitative tightening) and beginning QE (quantitative easing), liquidity and money printing will increase, further debasing the dollar. Strong Macro Setup For Crypto “This chart is one of the biggest signals for crypto right now,” said analyst “Bull Theory” on Sunday. “If the Fed begins T-bill purchases on top of rate cuts, the liquidity impact will be massive,” they added. This will weaken the dollar and cause a liquidity expansion, which, historically, has been very bullish for crypto markets. “This is one of the strongest macro setups Bitcoin and altcoins have had since the 2020-21 cycle.” The post Dollar in Danger? ‘Debasement’ Searches Skyrocket to All-Time Highs appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Federal Reserve,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-12-08 09:11:20

According to live data from Bitcoin World, the premier digital asset has surged above $92,000, trading at $92,003.68 on the Binance USDT market. This Bitcoin price surge marks a pivotal moment, fueling discussions about the potential for a renewed bull market. What is driving this impressive momentum, and what could it signal for investors? Let’s break down the rally. What’s Behind the Latest Bitcoin Price Surge? The jump past $92,000 is not an isolated event. Several key factors are converging to create this bullish momentum. First, institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial firms increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, are pushing investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Finally, positive sentiment around upcoming network upgrades and regulatory clarity in major markets is providing a strong foundation for this Bitcoin price surge . Market analysts point to increased buying pressure from large wallets, often called ‘whales,’ as a primary technical driver. This activity often precedes sustained upward trends. Moreover, trading volume has spiked significantly, indicating strong conviction behind the move. How Significant is the $92,000 Level for BTC? Breaking through major psychological price points like $92,000 is crucial for market psychology. It acts as a confirmation of strength and can trigger a cascade of further buying from traders who were waiting on the sidelines. Historically, when Bitcoin conquers such round-number resistances, it often explores new price territories. However, it’s wise to consider both sides of the coin. Key levels to watch now include: Support: The previous resistance near $90,000 may now act as a support floor. Resistance: The next major targets could be around $95,000 and then the all-time high region. Volatility: Rapid moves can lead to equally sharp corrections, so risk management remains essential. What Does This Rally Mean for the Average Crypto Investor? For everyday investors, this Bitcoin price surge offers both opportunity and a reminder of core principles. The excitement is palpable, but it’s a perfect time to review your strategy. Are you looking to hold long-term, or are you trading short-term momentum? Your answer should guide your actions. Remember the golden rules: never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. This rally also highlights the importance of using secure, reputable exchanges like Binance for your transactions, as reported in the price data. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin Bull Run Bitcoin’s breakthrough above $92,000 is a compelling chapter in its ongoing story. This Bitcoin price surge underscores the asset’s growing maturity and its increasing integration into the global financial landscape. While the future is never certain, the current momentum is built on a mix of institutional demand, macroeconomic trends, and positive market structure. Whether this is the start of a sustained climb or a prelude to consolidation, staying informed and disciplined is your greatest asset. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exact price did Bitcoin reach? A1: According to Binance USDT market data, Bitcoin reached $92,003.68. Q2: Why is breaking $92,000 important? A2: It’s a major psychological and technical resistance level. Breaking it often leads to increased buying interest and can set the stage for testing higher prices. Q3: Should I buy Bitcoin now after this surge? A3: Investment decisions should be based on your financial goals and risk tolerance. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Q4: Could the price drop back down quickly? A4> Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. While the trend is currently up, corrections are a normal part of any market cycle. Always be prepared for price fluctuations. Q5: Where can I reliably track Bitcoin’s price? A5> Reputable platforms like Bitcoin World provide real-time market monitoring. Always use well-known exchanges and data aggregators for accurate information. Q6: Does this affect other cryptocurrencies? A6> Yes, Bitcoin often leads the market.

Although XRP continues to show healthy growth and future investment potential, there appears to be an even bigger opportunity that most nimble investors are paying attention to. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, which is now in the last stages of phase 6, offers investors an attractive investment opportunity that makes it the best crypto to invest in. XRP Institutional Support The fact that XRP-spot ETF products experienced such strong demand, culminating in nearly $1 billion of net investment, indicates the increasing participation of the market as well as the fundamental shift of supply and demand. These factors, coupled with the dovish Fed policy, create and enhance the medium-term technical perspective for XRP. Social sentiment indicators and market positioning support the upward momentum. For investors assembling an investment portfolio of the top crypto to buy, XRP provides the case study of growth and penetration facilitated by regulations. On the other hand, for investors seeking high growth investment options, the opportunity for Mutuum Finance Investment is running out. The Mutuum Finance Presale Finale The Mutuum Finance presale stands out as one of the most significant occurrences, having raised well over $19,180,000, bringing together 18,350 holders. Currently, the project lies in the most crucial Phase 6, where 98% of the tokens are already sold based on the present price of $0.035, which indicates a 250% hike over the initial offering and will expire shortly. Phase 7 brings an accompanying nearly 20% price hike to $0.04, and it thus marks the last opportunity for investors to acquire the tokens at the same cost. Investors who invest currently are poised to generate 400% returns based on the launch price of $0.06, thus making MUTM the best crypto investment for 2026. Strategic Selling Points And Model Innovation In addition to the presale urgency, Mutuum Finance is building an entire DeFi ecosystem that boasts numerous innovative elements. The novel buy-back and distribution system that Mutuum Finance uses for their token is specifically designed for the creation of healthy tokenomics. In addition, the fact that the protocol uses an overcollateralized stablecoin provides an important foundation for the entire lending and borrowing marketplace. The platform further improves user engagement through the use of the dynamic 24-hour leaderboard which gives the leading owner a $500 reward on a daily basis. In light of investors carefully selecting the crypto to invest in, it would be difficult to come up with a stronger case. Securing Position Before the Transition To Phase 7 In the quest for the best cryptocurrency to invest in, timing and basic potential can often come into play. As XRP pursues a strategy of gradual institutionalization, Mutuum Finance presents an intensified growth story, the window for which keeps narrowing. The last tokens for Phase 6 are now being allocated, which marks the last chance for investment before the subsequent price increase. This crucial-proof point makes MUTM far from an additional new crypto investment, and rather an investment into the future of structured DeFi. Waiting for the future may result in the miss of the basic crypto investment price that will enter the evolutionary state.

A recent analysis from crypto commentator Pumpius presents a detailed view of how Ripple’s pursuit of a national banking license could influence market dynamics, particularly for XRP. Rather than offering broad speculation, the commentary outlines a regulatory and operational framework that, if approved, would position Ripple in alignment with some of the most established financial institutions in the United States. Ripple’s Banking Ambition and Its Regulatory Weight Pumpius highlights that Ripple is seeking a full national trust bank charter through the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. This license is significant because it places an organization under the same regulatory authority that oversees major institutions such as JPMorgan, BNY Mellon, and Citi. By pursuing this path, Ripple aims to operate with the same custody capabilities and institutional clearance mechanisms used by these large banks. The commentary highlights that this application is not limited to expanding its existing fintech activity; it represents an effort to enter the core of U.S. banking infrastructure. THE $50 XRP TRIGGER Most don’t realize how close we are. If the OCC (U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) approves Ripple’s national banking license, XRP doesn’t crawl to $5 or $10. It detonates straight to $50+. Here’s why pic.twitter.com/qmux5c3DTH — Pumpius (@pumpius) August 24, 2025 Expanded Powers Under an OCC Charter According to Pumpius, approval of the charter would permit Ripple to execute functions that extend far beyond standard fintech operations. These include direct access to Federal Reserve systems, the authority to custody digital and tokenized assets , and the capacity to issue stablecoins and facilitate settlement of securities. The analysis emphasizes that a charter of this type would allow Ripple to operate without relying on intermediaries. In practical terms, this would enable financial institutions, investment firms, and other market participants to interact with Ripple as a primary channel into tokenized markets, rather than depending on multiple service providers. XRP’s Role in Settlement and Liquidity The commentary places strong emphasis on XRP’s position within this potential structure. Pumpius describes XRP as the settlement asset within the broader operational design, portraying it as the bridge that enables transactions across tokenized financial systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The discussion includes a quantitative point: global bank settlements amount to approximately six trillion dollars daily. Pumpius argues that even limited use of XRP within this volume could generate substantial demand relative to its fixed supply. This forms the basis of the claim that a price level of $50 would not be excessive but would adequately meet liquidity requirements. Regulatory Context and Long-Term Positioning Pumpius’s commentary suggests that the SEC lawsuit functioned as a delaying mechanism rather than an existential threat, ultimately concluding with the case closed and regulatory positioning improved. With this context in place, the analysis frames Ripple’s alignment with U.S. regulators as intentional preparation for deeper integration into the financial system. Pumpius ultimately characterizes the potential approval of the OCC charter as a transformational step, marking a shift from Ripple’s role in the digital-asset sector to a position within the operational framework of U.S. finance.

The Massachusetts educational entity famous for law studies lifted its Bitcoin position to more than $442 million through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust during the third quarter, according to filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission in November. The increase placed the digital asset fund above Harvard’s stakes in major public companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, growing from $117 million reported in the previous quarter, according to Cryptopolitan’s insight . Bitcoin and gold allocations: Which is more favorable? Bitwise Invest Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan posted on X early Monday morning that Harvard, alongside increasing its BTC position, also boosted its gold ETF allocation from $102m to $235m. “Think about that for a second: Harvard decided to put on a debasement trade, and it allocated bitcoin 2-to-1 over gold,” the CIO surmised. Gold prices rose above $4,210 per ounce on Monday after a weekly decline in reaction to a much-anticipated Federal Reserve’s final policy meeting of the year. The markets expect officials to cut interest rates, and as historical data on Trading Economics shows, a rate reduction almost always supported demand for gold. The metal has gained 2.38% in recent sessions and stands 58.39% higher than it did at this time last year, according to trading on a contract for difference that tracks the benchmark commodity. After pushing past $4,380 per ounce to reach an all-time high record in October, gold dropped in value due to concerns about the US budget and ballooning national debt. After a 43-day-long US government shutdown came to a close on November 12, the precious metal recouped some of its losses and is now trading above $4,200 per ounce, just 3% below its all-time peak. Even though gold is way above price levels recorded year-on-year, the largest coin by market cap is down 9.6% since December 8, 2024, when it changed hands at slightly above $101,000. That said, a lot of institutions and the crypto community are hopeful that a Christmas crypto market rally will ensue and take Bitcoin back above $100,000. Harvard’s Bitcoin exposure counted losses after the digital asset market’s downturn this quarter took it below $90,000, and its position in the iShares Bitcoin Trust shed about $40 million. Bitcoin had dropped more than 10% this quarter, but a brief recovery last Tuesday flipped its price uptrend to a 2% profit since October 1. Had the school exited the trade in early October, it would likely have broken even or recorded a modest gain before the downturn accelerated. According to Investtech’s analysis, Bitcoin has broken above the ceiling of a falling trend channel in the short term, with slower declines. However, a sideways pattern is forming, and a slightly negative technical position is expected over the short term. Ivy League and state institutions increase crypto exposure Harvard is not the only institution allocating funds to cryptocurrency investment products. Rhode Island’s Brown University disclosed roughly $14 million in crypto ETF holdings at the end of Q3 2025, and the State of Michigan Retirement System tripled its holdings of a Bitcoin ETF during the second quarter. Michigan’s pension fund now holds 300,000 shares, valued at approximately $9.8 million, with a $12.2 million allocation to Ethereum through the Grayscale Ethereum Trust. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board has one of the largest known state pension exposures to cryptocurrency funds. It holds more than 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, valued at over $350 million. The allocation is one of the most prominent public pension investments in Bitcoin-related financial products. Emory University, a private research institution in Georgia, disclosed a $15 million stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust in 2024, becoming one of the earliest US endowments to reveal exposure to a crypto ETF. The university held just under 500,000 shares of the trust at the end of the second quarter. However, by the end of September, Emory reported holding more than 1 million shares of the same trust, roughly $52 million at the time. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

55500902,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=237618,1765186811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Dollar Plummets Before Critical Fed Meeting as Euro Surges: What This Means for Your Portfolio,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dollar-falls-fed-meeting-euro-surge/,"BitcoinWorld Dollar Plummets Before Critical Fed Meeting as Euro Surges: What This Means for Your Portfolio The US dollar is showing surprising weakness as traders brace for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision, while the euro capitalizes on shifting market sentiment. This currency market movement creates both risks and opportunities for cryptocurrency investors who understand the interconnected nature of global financial markets. The dollar’s drift lower reflects growing uncertainty about the Fed’s next move, with implications that extend far beyond traditional forex markets into digital assets. Why Is the Dollar Drifting Lower Before the Fed Meeting? Market participants are positioning cautiously ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy announcement, creating downward pressure on the dollar. Several factors contribute to this movement: Reduced expectations for aggressive rate hikes Concerns about economic growth slowing Technical selling pressure at key resistance levels Position adjustments by institutional investors The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, has retreated from recent highs as traders reduce bullish bets. This cautious approach reflects uncertainty about whether the Fed will maintain its hawkish stance or signal a potential pause in tightening. Euro Demand Surges Amid Dollar Weakness As the dollar weakens, the euro has emerged as a primary beneficiary. European Central Bank officials have maintained a relatively hawkish tone compared to market expectations for the Fed, creating favorable conditions for euro appreciation. The currency pair EUR/USD has broken through key technical levels, attracting additional buying interest from both speculative traders and long-term investors. Currency Pair Current Level Weekly Change Key Resistance EUR/USD 1.0850 +1.2% 1.0950 USD/JPY 147.80 -0.8% 149.00 GBP/USD 1.2650 +0.9% 1.2750 Federal Reserve Meeting: What to Expect for Currency Markets The upcoming Fed meeting represents a critical juncture for currency markets. Analysts are closely watching for signals about future monetary policy direction. Key elements to monitor include: Interest rate decision and accompanying statement Updated economic projections and dot plot Chair Powell’s press conference tone Forward guidance on inflation fighting The Fed’s communication will likely determine whether the dollar’s recent weakness becomes a sustained trend or merely a temporary correction. Market pricing currently suggests reduced expectations for additional rate hikes, but any hawkish surprises could quickly reverse recent currency movements. How Monetary Policy Decisions Impact Global Currency Markets Central bank policies create powerful ripple effects across global currency markets. When the Federal Reserve adjusts its policy stance, the impact extends far beyond US borders: Interest rate differentials drive capital flows between currencies Policy divergence creates trading opportunities Risk sentiment influences carry trade dynamics Liquidity conditions affect currency volatility The current environment features competing monetary policies, with the European Central Bank maintaining a more hawkish stance than many anticipated, while the Fed faces increasing pressure to consider economic growth alongside inflation concerns. Trading Opportunities in Volatile Currency Markets The pre-Fed meeting volatility creates specific trading opportunities for informed market participants. Consider these approaches: Position for potential dollar rebound if Fed remains hawkish Monitor euro technical levels for breakout confirmation Watch for correlation shifts between traditional and digital assets Consider volatility-based strategies around the announcement Successful navigation of this environment requires understanding both fundamental drivers and technical patterns. The period immediately following the Fed announcement typically features elevated volatility and potential for rapid price movements. FAQs: Understanding Currency Market Dynamics What causes the dollar to move before Fed meetings? The dollar often experiences volatility before Fed meetings as traders adjust positions based on expected policy changes. Uncertainty about interest rate decisions, economic projections, and forward guidance creates trading opportunities and risk management challenges. How does euro demand relate to dollar weakness? Euro demand often increases when the dollar weakens due to their inverse relationship in the EUR/USD pair. The euro represents the second most traded currency globally and frequently serves as an alternative to the US dollar in international transactions and reserve holdings. What should cryptocurrency investors watch during Fed meetings? Cryptocurrency investors should monitor dollar strength, risk sentiment, and liquidity conditions. The Federal Reserve’s decisions influence global capital flows that can affect digital asset valuations. Historically, dollar weakness has sometimes correlated with cryptocurrency strength, though this relationship can vary. Who are the key decision-makers at the Federal Reserve? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes monetary policy decisions. Key figures include Chair Jerome Powell , Vice Chair Philip Jefferson , and other voting members. Their collective decisions shape global financial conditions. Which companies are most affected by currency fluctuations? Multinational corporations with significant international operations are particularly sensitive to currency movements. Companies like Apple , Microsoft , and Amazon regularly discuss currency impacts in their financial reports. Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs actively trade and manage currency exposure. Conclusion: Navigating the Currency Crossroads The dollar’s pre-Fed meeting weakness and concurrent euro strength highlight the dynamic nature of global currency markets. As central bank policies evolve and economic conditions shift, currency relationships will continue to offer both challenges and opportunities. The upcoming Fed decision represents more than just an interest rate announcement—it’s a signal about the future direction of global liquidity, risk appetite, and capital flows that will influence all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies.

In November alone, China posted a $112 billion surplus, the third-highest ever for a single month, while exports surged by 5.9% year-on-year, bouncing back from the previous month’s dip, while imports edged up 1.9%. Shipments to the US fell 29% in November, the steepest drop since August. But the hit from the US didn’t drag the overall numbers down because sales to the EU and Africa climbed sharply, helping the country hold up its export momentum. That allowed China’s factory output to stay high at a time when global protectionism and trade friction are growing. The data puts more pressure on overseas markets already struggling with surging inflows of Chinese goods. The economic context at home is shaky. Retail sales are crawling through their worst slowdown streak since 2021. Investment just posted a record contraction. Still, the massive trade gap is now supporting GDP growth as the year closes. Despite slower momentum in the final quarter, Beijing is still on track to hit its official 5% growth target for 2025. Machinery exports lead rebound as consumer goods slow less The recovery in exports was powered by electronics and machinery, which surged nearly 10% in November, up from a barely noticeable rise the month before. Consumer goods exports were still in decline, but the fall narrowed. Shipments to the US have been dropping by double digits for eight straight months, highlighting how much demand has shifted elsewhere. Despite tensions, China continues to flood markets with manufactured goods, especially in places where import restrictions are less aggressive. This growing surplus now risks new trade actions from China’s commercial partners, especially in Europe and Africa where volumes have grown fast. Chip IPOs trigger massive buying frenzy among Chinese investors While trade dominates globally, China’s retail investors are turning domestic stock listings into a frenzy, especially in the chip sector. Two companies, MetaX Integrated Circuits Shanghai Co. and Beijing Onmicro Electronics Co. , each saw extreme oversubscription levels in their retail tranches last Friday. MetaX’s IPO was 2,986 times oversubscribed, while Onmicro pulled in 2,899 times the available shares. That came just as Moore Threads Technology Co. surged 425% on debut, feeding speculation it could become a Chinese competitor to Nvidia in artificial intelligence chips. Prior to trading, Moore Threads had already drawn retail bids that were 2,750 times overbooked. Analysts cited tight IPO approvals from regulators as a reason investor demand has been redirected into fewer, more hyped names. The mainland IPO pipeline has slowed because authorities are worried new listings could drain liquidity. MetaX set its IPO price at 104.66 yuan per share and pulled in 3 trillion yuan in bids, or roughly $424 billion. Onmicro’s price of 83.06 yuan attracted 1.4 trillion yuan in offers. The IPO process allows investors to bid without putting up money up front, so millions flood the applications, hoping to win a few shares with zero downside. Bloomberg used the online winning rates disclosed by both companies to calculate the oversubscription ratios. MetaX, founded in 2020, is aiming to raise $585.8 million in its Shanghai listing. It builds graphics processing units, targeting the same part of the market as Moore Threads. At its offer price, MetaX trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 56.4, far below the 127.4 peer average from 2024. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

How Will It Affect the Price? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-ai-focused-projects-first-halving-is-coming-how-will-it-affect-the-price-here-are-the-details/,"Bittensor, the AI-driven decentralized network, is preparing to complete its first four-year cycle with its first halving event on December 14. Bittensor's First Halving Approaches: TAO Supply Halving Could Start a New Era for Price With this critical update, the daily supply of the network's native token, TAO, will be reduced from 7,200 to 3,600, thus halving token production. Bittensor operates as an open network at the intersection of AI and crypto. Users can contribute to various AI tasks to improve AI systems and receive rewards in TAO tokens based on the benefits of their contributions. The network currently has 129 active subnets. These subnets provide a wide range of AI-based services, including computing power, data storage, AI agents, and deepfake detection. The halving's reduction in TAO supply is expected to create greater scarcity in the token's market dynamics, potentially positively impacting its price. Grayscale research analyst Will Ogden Moore, recalling Bitcoin's past halving experiences, stated, “We've seen in Bitcoin how decreasing supply strengthens the network's value over time.” According to Moore, Bittensor’s first halving will also be a significant milestone in the network’s maturation process, marking the beginning of the path towards a maximum supply of 21 million TAO. Grayscale also highlights a significant increase in institutional interest in the Bittensor ecosystem. The dynamic TAO (dTAO) mechanism introduced in February has enabled strong expansion of the Bittensor ecosystem's total market capitalization by making subnets directly investable. Funds like Yuma Asset Management and Stillcore Capital have launched new products investing in the most successful subnets. Three public companies have also established TAO treasuries, with TAO Synergies reportedly holding approximately $12 million in TAO. Moore suggests that the early success of subnetwork-based applications, rising institutional capital, and the upcoming halving could all be positive catalysts for TAO's price. TAO is currently trading at $282.31, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours but down over 28% on the month. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: The AI-Focused Project's First Halving Is Coming!

Despite growing expectations for Bank of Japan rate hikes, one of America’s largest financial institutions predicts the yen weakness will persist, creating unprecedented opportunities and risks for currency traders and cryptocurrency investors alike. This analysis cuts through the noise to reveal what’s really driving yen depreciation and how it connects to broader market trends. Why Bank of America Sees Persistent Yen Weakness Bank of America’s currency strategists have analyzed multiple factors contributing to their bearish yen outlook. The bank’s research indicates that structural issues within Japan’s economy outweigh potential benefits from monetary policy normalization. Their analysis suggests that even if the Bank of Japan raises interest rates, the move will likely be too little, too late to reverse the fundamental yen weakness that has developed over years. The bank points to three critical factors: Japan’s massive government debt burden limiting aggressive rate hikes Persistent trade deficits reducing yen demand Demographic challenges creating long-term economic headwinds The USD/JPY Outlook: More Pain Ahead for Yen Bulls Bank of America’s technical and fundamental analysis of the USD/JPY pair paints a concerning picture for those betting on yen strength. The bank’s models suggest the currency pair could test new multi-decade highs, with potential targets that would shock many market participants. This USD/JPY outlook is particularly significant given the pair’s role as a key indicator of global risk sentiment and carry trade dynamics. Factor Impact on USD/JPY Timeframe Interest Rate Divergence Bullish for USD/JPY Medium-term Japanese Economic Recovery Limited positive impact Long-term US Economic Strength Significant bullish pressure Immediate Global Risk Sentiment Mixed impact Variable Bank of Japan Policy: Too Little, Too Late? The Bank of Japan faces a nearly impossible dilemma. After years of ultra-loose monetary policy, any normalization risks destabilizing Japan’s debt-laden economy. Bank of America analysts believe the Bank of Japan will proceed with extreme caution, meaning rate hikes will be gradual and limited. This cautious approach from the Bank of Japan essentially guarantees that interest rate differentials with the US will remain wide, continuing to pressure the yen. Key considerations for the Bank of Japan include: Government debt exceeding 250% of GDP Fragile economic recovery post-pandemic Inflation only recently reaching target levels Political pressure to maintain accommodative conditions Interest Rate Divergence: The Unstoppable Force The interest rate divergence between Japan and the United States represents perhaps the most powerful driver of yen weakness. While the Federal Reserve maintains restrictive policy to combat inflation, the Bank of Japan remains the last major central bank with negative interest rates. Even when this changes, the gap will remain substantial, creating what Bank of America describes as a “structural advantage” for the US dollar against the yen. What This Means for Forex and Crypto Traders The implications of persistent yen weakness extend far beyond traditional forex markets. For cryptocurrency traders, understanding these dynamics is crucial for several reasons. First, yen weakness often correlates with increased risk appetite, which can benefit cryptocurrencies. Second, Japanese investors may seek alternative assets if their currency continues to depreciate. Third, the carry trade dynamics involving yen can influence global liquidity conditions affecting all risk assets. Actionable insights from Bank of America’s analysis: Consider USD/JPY longs as a core position Monitor Bank of Japan communications for policy shifts Watch for Japanese capital flows into alternative assets Use yen weakness as a barometer for global risk sentiment FAQs: Understanding the Yen Weakness Thesis What specific factors does Bank of America cite for continued yen weakness? Bank of America points to structural economic issues, interest rate differentials, and Japan’s demographic challenges as primary drivers. How does this analysis affect cryptocurrency markets? Yen weakness can influence global liquidity, risk appetite, and capital flows—all factors that significantly impact cryptocurrency valuations. What should traders watch for regarding Bank of Japan policy changes? Monitor statements from Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda and any changes to yield curve control parameters. How reliable is Bank of America’s forex analysis? As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, Bank of America maintains extensive research capabilities, though all forecasts involve uncertainty. What historical patterns support this yen weakness outlook? Japan has experienced prolonged yen weakness periods before, particularly during times of significant interest rate divergence with the US. The Bottom Line: A New Era for Yen Trading Bank of America’s warning about persistent yen weakness represents more than just another forex forecast—it signals a potential paradigm shift in how markets view Japan’s currency. The combination of structural economic challenges, cautious central bank policy, and overwhelming interest rate differentials creates what may become one of the most predictable trends in currency markets. For traders and investors, understanding and positioning for this reality could define success in the coming years. The shocking truth is that yen weakness may have become Japan’s new normal, creating both dangers and opportunities that demand attention from anyone participating in global financial markets.

The original Layer 2 solution , which launched in December 2020 as a groundbreaking proof-of-concept, will undergo an orderly sunset after serving its purpose of validating critical ideas for production ZK systems. No immediate action is required from users, as ZKsync Lite continues to operate normally, with funds remaining secure and withdrawals to Ethereum’s Layer 1 functioning throughout the deprecation process. The ZKsync Association will share detailed migration guidance, specific dates, and a comprehensive deprecation plan in the coming year. In 2026, we plan to deprecate ZKsync Lite (aka ZKsync 1.0), the original ZK-rollup we launched on Ethereum. This is a planned, orderly sunset for a system that has served its purpose and does not affect any other ZKsync systems. — ZKsync (@zksync) December 7, 2025 From Pioneer to Legacy System ZKsync Lite emerged as the first zero-knowledge rollup on Ethereum, pioneering technology that would later evolve into ZKsync Era and the Elastic Network. The protocol addressed Ethereum’s fundamental challenges of high transaction fees and slow transaction processing by executing transactions off-chain and submitting cryptographic proofs of validity back to Layer 1. The project gained significant momentum in November 2025 when Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin publicly endorsed ZKsync following its Atlas upgrade, describing the work as “ underrated and valuable. “ ZKsync has been doing a lot of underrated and valuable work in the ethereum ecosystem. Excited to see this come from them! https://t.co/coZKCfsb8h — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) November 1, 2025 His backing catalyzed institutional adoption, triggering a 50% surge in ZK token prices while positioning ZKsync as central to Ethereum’s “ Lean Ethereum ” scaling strategy. ZKsync evolved from its initial Lite version to ZKsync Era in March 2023, becoming the first publicly available zkEVM. The June 2024 ZKsync 3.0 upgrade transformed the ecosystem from a single Layer 2 into the Elastic Network, an interconnected system of autonomous ZK chains sharing liquidity and security through cryptographic proofs rather than traditional bridges. Institutional Traction Validates ZK Technology While ZKsync Lite phases out, the broader ZKsync ecosystem has attracted major institutional interest. Deutsche Bank is developing an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain using ZKsync technology as part of Project Dama 2, which involves 24 financial institutions testing the blockchain for asset tokenization under Singapore’s regulatory sandbox. UBS also conducted a proof-of-concept for its Key4 Gold product using ZKsync Validium, testing the platform’s ability to support tokenized gold investments with privacy and scalability. Tradable has also tokenized $2.1 billion in institutional-grade private credit on ZKsync, accounting for nearly 90% of the network’s market share for real-world asset protocols. Source: RWA[dot]xyz The Ethereum Foundation launched “Ethereum for Institutions” in October 2024, providing enterprises with structured pathways to blockchain adoption using zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and trusted execution environments. Projects like Chainlink, RAILGUN, and Aztec Network pioneer privacy-preserving smart contracts that secure counterparty information while maintaining transparency. Security Incidents Test Platform Resilience The deprecation announcement follows two significant security breaches in 2025 involving ZKsync’s protocols. In April, an attacker exploited admin access to the airdrop distribution contract, minting 111 million unclaimed ZK tokens worth approximately $5 million during the protocol’s token distribution to ecosystem participants. The hacker agreed to return 90% of the stolen assets in exchange for a 10% bounty , transferring nearly $5.7 million back to the ZKsync Security Council within the designated 72-hour safe harbor window. The recovered amount exceeded the original stolen value due to token price increases, with ZK gaining 16.6% and ETH rising 8.8% following the incident. The @TheZKNation has recovered $5 million worth of stolen tokens following a security breach on April 15. #ZKsync #Hack https://t.co/sb7iC0RqoR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 Just one month later, hackers compromised the official X accounts of ZKsync and Matter Labs , spreading false regulatory warnings claiming SEC investigations and Treasury Department sanctions. The attackers also published phishing links promoting a fake ZK token airdrop designed to drain users’ wallets, causing the token price to drop approximately 5% despite a prior 38.5% weekly rally. The breach occurred through compromised delegated accounts with limited posting privileges, which have since been disconnected. These back-to-back incidents contributed to broader industry concerns, as crypto hacks resulted in $1.6 billion in losses during the first quarter of 2025 alone. The quarter was among the worst for crypto security breaches in history.

With momentum climbing and development updates approaching, many traders watching early-stage opportunities say this may be one of the most important turning points in Mutuum Finance’s progress so far. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending protocol designed to support real activity across two connected lending markets. When users supply assets such as ETH or USDT, they receive mtTokens. These mtTokens increase in value as borrowers repay interest. For example, if someone supplies $450 in USDC, the mtTokens they receive slowly rise in value as lending demand continues. This creates a natural APY tied directly to protocol usage. Borrowers interact with a flexible interest-rate system that adjusts with liquidity levels. When liquidity is high, borrowing stays cheap. When the pool becomes tighter, borrowing costs rise. The platform uses loan-to-value rules to keep positions safe. If collateral drops too far and becomes unstable, the system can trigger liquidations. During this process, liquidators buy part of the collateral at a discount while repaying some of the borrower’s debt. This protects the system and helps maintain stability during volatile market periods. These mechanics allow Mutuum Finance to operate as a functional DeFi crypto ecosystem rather than a speculative token without utility. Expanding Community Metrics Mutuum Finance began its token sale in early 2025 at $0.01. Today the token sits at $0.035, marking a clear 250% rise during its development phase. The project has raised $19.2 million, with more than 18,400 holders joining across multiple regions. Over 810 million tokens have already been purchased since early 2025. The total supply for MUTM is 4 billion tokens. Out of this supply, 1.82 billion tokens, or 45.5%, were allocated for early participants. This gives a large portion of the supply to the community instead of concentrating it in a few wallets. Phase 6 is now sitting at 97% allocation, one of the highest completion points in the current cycle. The official launch price is set at $0.06, which many buyers note is significantly higher than today’s $0.035 listing. The rapid drop in remaining supply suggests rising demand, especially as the testnet approaches. To support participation, Mutuum Finance operates a 24-hour leaderboard. The top contributor each day receives $500 in MUTM, increasing activity and giving users an added incentive to buy or engage. Combined with card payment support, which makes onboarding simple for new contributors, the project has maintained steady daily engagement. These factors have created strong visibility, pushing the token into several lists of top crypto entries for traders searching for early-stage long-term opportunities. V1 Testnet and Analyst Expectations One of the most important updates came directly from the team on its official X account. The V1 testnet is scheduled to launch in Q4 2025. The first version will include core lending features such as the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the liquidator bot, and the debt-tracking module. ETH and USDT will serve as the initial assets for borrowing and lending. The project has undergone extensive security checks. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit, receiving a 90/100 Token Scan score, which indicates a strong level of security. Halborn Security is also reviewing the protocol’s smart contracts to ensure reliability ahead of the public testnet. A $50,000 bug bounty is active to allow external developers to report vulnerabilities. Some analysts reviewing early development models say the structure of Mutuum Finance could support strong growth once the testnet is live. Their outlook is based on the lending mechanics, mtToken yield, stablecoin integration, and protocol-driven buying pressure. While projections vary, many note that tokens with real utility and consistent development timelines tend to perform better once they reach early release stages. Stablecoin Development Mutuum Finance is preparing a USD-pegged stablecoin that will be minted and burned as needed. Borrower interest will support the stablecoin’s value. Stablecoins are often one of the most important parts of a lending ecosystem because they offer predictable valuation, strong liquidity, and easier access for users who want to borrow against assets without holding volatile tokens. The project also plans to expand across several layer-2 networks. L2 deployment lowers transaction costs and increases transaction speed. This is essential for lending protocols because they rely on frequent interactions such as collateral checks, interest updates, borrowing adjustments, and liquidation processes. Expanding onto layer-2 systems allows Mutuum Finance to scale more efficiently and reach more users. To maintain accurate asset valuation, Mutuum Finance will use Chainlink price feeds as its primary data source. Backup oracles, aggregated sources, and on-chain DEX information will serve as secondary inputs. This layered approach helps avoid liquidation errors and ensures the protocol remains stable even during volatile market conditions. Some market commentators believe these features position Mutuum Finance as one of the next crypto projects likely to gain broader adoption, especially if stablecoin activity and L2 expansion follow the expected timeline. Phase 6 Near Completion and the Impact of Whale Activity Mutuum Finance is now experiencing one of its most active allocation stages. With Phase 6 at 97%, there is very little supply left at the $0.035 price point. Historically, late-stage allocations tend to accelerate as buyers try to secure one of the final entries before the next increase. Recent on-chain activity shows that several large contributors have entered the project. A notable $100,000 whale allocation pushed the treasury higher and significantly reduced the remaining supply. Whale entries usually influence smaller buyers to move faster, especially when allocation levels are already close to completion. The combination of V1 progress, strong community numbers, audited contracts, mtToken yield, stablecoin plans, and shrinking allocation has pushed Mutuum Finance into a critical point in its early phase. Many traders watching best crypto to buy now discussions say Phase 6 may close sooner than expected.

The report analyzes derivatives data and trading behavior following the sharp selloff on December 1, which was triggered by hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan. Despite renewed optimism after Vanguard opened crypto exchange traded fund ( ETF ) trading, traders remain cautious as major cryptocurrencies continue to trade below their record highs. “Cryptocurrencies have been buffeted by multiple crosswinds, from shifting expectations surrounding major central bank policies, to mounting concerns over the viability of DATs,” said Han Tan, Chief Market Analyst, Bybit Learn. “Major crypto prices are likely to remain beholden to macro forces over the immediate term, especially with the pivotal Fed rate decision looming, even as the crypto world attempts to shake off the ghosts of the Oct 10 liquidation event,” he added. Sentiment slowly reversing, not yet bullish In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin ( BTC ) rebounded to a two-week high above $93,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) regained the $3,000 mark after the early December drop. Options market data shows that traders have significantly scaled back their bearish positions. The report notes that put-call skew premiums have declined from 10–13 percentage points at the start of the month to just 2–4 percentage points, suggesting that downside fear has eased and crash protection is being priced with less urgency. BTC options volumes showing a rebound in call activity and easing bearish positioning . Source: Block Scholes/Bybit While open interest in perpetual futures has seen a modest uptick during the recovery, overall activity remains subdued compared to pre-October levels. This points to lower participation in leveraged trading and an absence of liquidation cascades that typically occur in over-leveraged markets. Block Scholes’ proprietary Risk Appetite Index also indicates that sentiment is improving, though investors remain cautious. The index measures euphoria when readings rise above 1 and panic when they fall below -1, and momentum within it continues to show a close relationship with spot market returns.

The Ethereum-based token, which powers the Brave browser’s privacy-focused advertising ecosystem serving over 100 million users, helped position social tokens as the second-best performing category over the past month, behind only privacy coins.

Ethereum and Bitcoin have witnessed 2.8% and 3.5% price upticks, respectively, over the past 24 hours, both building momentum after a muted start to December. The coins traded firmer during Monday’s early Asian trading hours, supported by expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points in its final meeting of the year. Ripple’s XRP traded near $2.09 after a 2.8% day-to-day rise, continuing a tentative climb that came after weeks of heavy selling pressure from the broader crypto market. Other tokens like BNB added about 1.8%, while Solana climbed 3.7% to extend last week’s modest rebound and walk closer to its intraweek high of $145. Cardano’s price struggles seem to have come to an end after it reversed a 1.4% downtick that briefly took it to $0.40 to climb back up to $0.43 on the day. Despite the positive moves, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score, a metric used to gauge momentum changes in market cycles, fell to zero for the first time since early 2022. The analytics platform associates this reading with bearish market phases, suggesting investors are still in “fear” albeit the slight price recoveries. Liquidity gaps could slow down the crypto market’s upward momentum According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the market lacks fresh liquidity inflows that could prevent several coins from slipping into a deeper slowdown. In early December, Young Ju shared a chart on X that showed Bitcoin would be stuck in a broad consolidation zone between $55,000 and $70,000 next year, with volatility likely to persist around major macro events like Fed rate cuts. Most Bitcoin on-chain indicators are bearish. Without macro liquidity, we enter a bear cycle. pic.twitter.com/6uy298q5Wo — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 3, 2025 “It is simple. If you think macro gets better next year, you buy. Otherwise, you sell. I’m not a macro expert, so find macro bros. New ETF inflows are the key. At this stage, it is more about being reactive than predictive. Set your scenarios and trade accordingly,” the CEO reckoned. K33 Research had a slightly more optimistic medium-term view, expecting 401(k) rule changes by early 2026 to open the door for retirement accounts to allocate to Bitcoin. Although the group admitted it would take months to materialize, the legislative pro-Bitcoin influence could be enough to chase away the bears. The recent rebound in Bitcoin is similar to patterns seen during prior cycle pullbacks in 2013, 2017, and 2021, according to analyst Alex Kuptsikevich. He said the market has already absorbed a substantial two-month drawdown leading into the December policy window, and that the king crypto’s current price chart trajectory is consistent with recovery periods seen at the end of the mentioned years. CryptoQuant analysts Coindream see the current environment as a “healthy futures market” that only needs a trigger for the next bull run. Open interest in Bitcoin futures has dropped to its lowest level of the year, which could mean either investor capitulation or apathy, both of which precede opportunities for buyers seeking discounted entry points.

Is this finally the beginning of a rally that takes Bitcoin back to the high, or could this just be another fakeout? $BTC price breaks through downtrend and resistance Source: TradingView While it is still very early to call, $BTC has just opened a new 4-hour candle above the descending trendline. Not only has it done this, but the price has also broken beyond the $91,400 horizontal resistance level. As long as the price holds above these two important resistance milestones, a move up to the next horizontal resistance at $94,000 is the next logical step. Why this time is different Source: TradingView The daily chart illustrates how the $BTC price has tried to break through the descending trendline on a couple of previous occasions, and that it had failed to do so. Why should this time be any different? To start with, the price has come down 36%, which tarries with past big bull market drawdowns. Secondly, the price has come down to a major ascending trendline which has to be seen as ‘the’ bull market trendline for this cycle. Thirdly, not one market top indicator signalled when Bitcoin was at the $126,000 all-time high. It would seem that there is life in this bull market yet. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI reveals that the indicator line is working its way back up again, having reached the bottom when the price action also reached its nadir of $80,000. This could well be the next wave back to the top. Price and indicators are turning around Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC shows that this is a perfect place for a breakout. Historically, the $BTC price will usually break out of a wedge pattern around two thirds of the way along it, and almost always before it reaches the end. The Stochastic RSI indicator lines have bottomed, and are angled upwards nicely - not far now from the 20.00 level which is the signal for a big influx of upside price momentum. At the bottom of the chart, the MACD is revealing the beginnings of a potential slow turn around of the indicator line, while the pink bars are continuing to decrease in size. A move back above the zero level for the indicator lines, and a change back to green bars in the histogram would signal that the first new shoots of change are turning into real growth.

The USD/KZT pair, representing the US dollar against Kazakhstan’s tenge, has become a focal point for investors seeking opportunities beyond traditional markets. Bank of America’s recent analysis provides a compelling perspective on why this Central Asian currency deserves your attention. Why is Bank of America Bullish on the Kazakhstan Tenge? Bank of America, one of the world’s leading financial institutions, has reiterated its positive forex outlook for Kazakhstan’s currency. This endorsement carries significant weight in international markets and signals confidence in the country’s economic trajectory. The bank’s analysis points to several fundamental factors supporting the tenge’s strength against the US dollar. Three key pillars underpin Bank of America’s optimistic assessment: Commodity Strength: Kazakhstan’s position as a major energy and mineral exporter provides natural support for its currency Monetary Policy Discipline: The National Bank of Kazakhstan has maintained relatively tight monetary controls Economic Diversification: Gradual movement away from pure commodity dependence toward more balanced growth Understanding the USD/KZT Currency Dynamics The USD/KZT exchange rate represents more than just numbers on a trading screen. It reflects the economic relationship between the world’s largest economy and one of Central Asia’s most promising emerging markets. For traders and investors, this pair offers unique characteristics that differ from more commonly traded currency pairs. Recent performance of the Kazakhstan tenge against major currencies: Currency Pair Year-to-Date Performance Key Drivers USD/KZT -3.2% Commodity prices, monetary policy EUR/KZT -2.8% EU energy demand, regional trade RUB/KZT +1.5% Regional economic integration Kazakhstan’s Economic Fundamentals: A Deep Dive Bank of America’s positive assessment rests on solid economic foundations. Kazakhstan has demonstrated remarkable resilience in recent years, navigating global economic challenges while maintaining currency stability. The country’s strategic position between Europe and Asia, combined with abundant natural resources, creates a unique economic profile. The National Bank of Kazakhstan has implemented several measures that contribute to currency stability: Managed floating exchange rate regime with periodic interventions Substantial foreign currency reserves exceeding $35 billion Inflation targeting framework with clear communication Gradual capital account liberalization Forex Outlook: What This Means for Traders and Investors For those engaged in currency markets, Bank of America’s analysis provides actionable insights. The positive forex outlook suggests several potential strategies for market participants. However, like all emerging market currencies, the Kazakhstan tenge carries specific risks that require careful consideration. Key considerations for trading USD/KZT: Liquidity: Lower trading volumes compared to major pairs Volatility: Higher sensitivity to commodity price movements Geopolitical Factors: Regional stability and international relations Regulatory Environment: Local market access and capital controls Comparative Currency Analysis: Kazakhstan Tenge vs. Regional Peers Understanding the Kazakhstan tenge requires context within its regional environment. Compared to other Central Asian and former Soviet currencies, the tenge has demonstrated relative strength and stability. This performance reflects both domestic policy effectiveness and external economic conditions. Bank of America’s analysis places particular emphasis on the tenge’s performance relative to: Russian ruble (RUB) Uzbekistani som (UZS) Turkmenistani manat (TMT) Azerbaijani manat (AZN) Challenges and Risks in the Current Environment While the currency analysis from Bank of America highlights positive factors, investors must remain aware of potential challenges. Emerging market currencies face unique vulnerabilities that can quickly alter market dynamics. Several factors could potentially impact the USD/KZT outlook in coming months. Primary risk factors include: Global commodity price fluctuations, particularly in oil and gas Changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy affecting USD strength Regional geopolitical developments Domestic economic reforms and their implementation pace Global risk sentiment toward emerging markets Actionable Insights for Market Participants Based on Bank of America’s currency analysis , several approaches emerge for different types of market participants. Long-term investors, short-term traders, and corporate treasurers each have distinct considerations when evaluating the USD/KZT opportunity. For investors considering exposure to the Kazakhstan tenge: Assess your risk tolerance for emerging market currency exposure Consider diversified approaches rather than direct currency speculation Monitor key economic indicators from Kazakhstan’s statistical agency Stay informed about National Bank of Kazakhstan policy decisions Evaluate correlation with other assets in your portfolio Frequently Asked Questions What specific factors does Bank of America cite for its positive outlook? Bank of America points to Kazakhstan’s strong commodity exports, disciplined monetary policy, and gradual economic diversification as primary factors supporting the tenge. How does the National Bank of Kazakhstan influence the USD/KZT rate? The National Bank of Kazakhstan operates a managed float system, intervening when necessary to prevent excessive volatility while allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate. What are the main risks to this positive outlook? Key risks include significant declines in commodity prices, changes in global risk sentiment toward emerging markets, and unexpected domestic economic developments. How can international investors gain exposure to the Kazakhstan tenge? Investors can access the tenge through forex brokers offering the USD/KZT pair, Kazakhstan government bonds, or equities of Kazakh companies with domestic revenue exposure. What role does Bank of America play in emerging market currency analysis? As one of the world’s largest financial institutions, Bank of America provides influential research and analysis that helps shape global investor sentiment toward emerging market currencies. Conclusion: A Currency Worth Watching Bank of America’s reiterated confidence in the Kazakhstan tenge offers a compelling narrative in the complex world of currency markets. The USD/KZT pair represents more than just an exchange rate—it reflects Kazakhstan’s economic progress, policy discipline, and integration into global markets. While emerging market currencies always carry inherent risks, the fundamental case for the tenge’s strength appears well-supported by current economic conditions. For investors and traders seeking diversification beyond traditional currency pairs, the Kazakhstan tenge presents an intriguing opportunity worthy of careful consideration and ongoing monitoring.

Prepared in collaboration with knowledge partners CoinSwitch, DevFolio, Pi42, Jetking, Growth Protocol, and TriLegal, the report sheds light on startups, investment, adoption, developer ecosystem, and policy and regulations. Some of the key highlights include: Indian Web3 startups secured $653 million in funding in the first ten months of 2025, up 16% from $564 million for the full year 2024. India is home to 1250+ Web3 startups across finance, infrastructure and entertainment. They have collectively raised $3.5 billion to date, underscoring the depth of builders across multiple sub sectors. India strengthened its role as a Web3 hub in 2025 ranking #1 in blockchain adoption for the third straight year and the 2nd-largest developer market. Builders are pushing the frontiers in AI, DePIN, L1/L2s, RWAs and stablecoins. In 2025, centralized exchanges saw a sharp acceleration in activity. Spot volumes in blue-chip crypto tokens rose 114%, alongside a 27% increase in new traders. Young investors (18–35) now make up ~75% of active users and half of total trading volumes. Metros still dominate with 64% of invested value with Delhi alone contributing nearly one-fifth while rising access is steadily pulling tier-2 cities deeper into the market. In 2025, women traders grew nearly twice as fast as men across Tier-1, Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, signaling a broader, more inclusive investor base. Global Web3 investors continue to show strong conviction in India’s potential supported by ecosystem funds even though domestic funds remain cautious. Tak Lee, CEO of Hashed Emergent, said, “India’s market has already demonstrated extraordinary readiness for the next phase of Web3. What we must now focus on, together, is creating the right environment for this innovation to scale responsibly. Builders are moving fast, global investors are doubling down, and India’s digital public infrastructure has created a foundation few countries possess. By working collaboratively across industry and policy, we can design frameworks that protect consumers while enabling India to engineer the open, AI-enabled financial systems that will shape the next era of global commerce. When talent, capital, and regulation move with shared intent, India has the momentum and capability to define the future.” Other Key Highlights COINS Act : Hashed Emergent revealed a model law called the COINS Act (Crypto-Systems Oversight, Innovation, and Strategy Act 2025) that aims to deliver legal certainty, consumer protection and innovation acceleration, transforming India into a global hub for rights-grounded, decentralized finance rather than an afterthought in foreign jurisdictions. Cardano Hackathon Asia 2025 : The IBW Edition of the Cardano Hackathon Asia 2025 gave startup teams an opportunity to turn their ideas into impactful, ready-to-launch projects. About 400 developers joined in-person. The hackathon not only offered a total prize pool of $65K but also brought expert builders from across the Cardano ecosystem to guide startup teams from start to finish. IBW Demo Day : Sponsored by Aptos, Avalanche, Polygon, 0G, Coinswitch and NS.com, the IBW Demo Day took place on Day 2 of the conference, with 10 startups showcasing their innovation to investors, entrepreneurs, and the media for an investment of $530K by Hashed Emergent. Pandora Exchange, a one-stop trading hub for all DeFi needs, emerged the winner. Separately, 0G Labs provided a $6k grant to Kodeus and a $4k grant to Grovio.ai during the Demo Day. The IBW2025 Conference organizers are thankful to all the attendees who traveled to Bengaluru to participate in the most significant Web3 event in India. They also express their sincere gratitude to the 100+ speakers who took part in giving keynotes or panels at the conference. The IBW organizers would like to thank the sponsors who made it all possible.

South Korea has a long history of sparking sudden shifts, and recent activity suggests that another surge may be forming. Traders across the world are now watching the Korean order books with renewed interest as fresh demand builds in an otherwise uncertain market environment. Korean Volume Sparks Global Attention The conversation intensified after market commentator X Finance Bull highlighted a sharp rise in XRP trading activity in South Korea. Upbit, the country’s largest exchange, has recorded a dramatic spike in 24-hour XRP volume. Current data shows more than $143 million in trades, placing the platform ahead of major global exchanges. This level of concentrated activity suggests strong retail participation rather than institutional positioning. JUST IN South Koreans are panic buying $XRP in this choppy market and it’s not subtle! Upbit just clocked $143M in 24H volume, leading global exchanges If you’ve been in crypto long enough, you know what Korean volume means Retail hears noise. Asia sniffs opportunity https://t.co/yX7etTuZTk pic.twitter.com/96OJKjCKHq — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 7, 2025 Why Korean Traders Matter South Korean retail traders have a unique impact on volatile markets. They react quickly to perceived opportunities, often accelerating trends that begin during moments of global uncertainty. Their engagement is supported by high mobile usage, strong local interest in crypto , and a culture that embraces fast market decisions. These conditions can amplify price movements before other regions respond. The latest surge reflects a clear sense of urgency within Korean markets. Traders are buying aggressively during a choppy global environment. This behavior aligns with past episodes where Korean demand preceded short-term rallies in major assets. When one regional exchange dominates global volume, liquidity shifts become more visible across other platforms. Price Impact and Market Structure Large inflows on a single exchange do not guarantee a sustained rally. Thin books on international platforms can create brief price gaps and fast reversals. However, persistent demand on Upbit increases the chance of a broader market reaction. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If accumulation continues, liquidity may spill into other leading exchanges. That shift could strengthen XRP’s short-term outlook. Potential Risks to Consider Retail-driven surges come with notable risks. Sudden swings can occur if selling pressure returns on non-Korean exchanges. Traders should watch for shifts in Korean wallet inflows, changes in Upbit dominance, and any early signs of arbitrage pressure. A rapid decline in regional activity could end the momentum as quickly as it began. What Comes Next for XRP The current trend shows that Korean traders are becoming a major force in this market cycle. Their aggressive positioning during a volatile period is strengthening the global narrative around XRP’s resilience. Still, the sustainability of this demand depends on broader market conditions and cross-exchange liquidity. If other regions begin to mirror Korea’s enthusiasm, XRP could enter a stronger phase. South Korea has shaped many market moments in the past, and its traders are doing so again. The sharp rise in Upbit volume demonstrates how quickly regional sentiment can influence global perception. As the market remains unstable, all eyes are now on Korea to see whether this wave evolves into a larger trend.

Imagine owning virtual real estate that could appreciate like prime physical property. That’s the promise of Decentraland, the pioneering metaverse platform powered by its native cryptocurrency, MANA. As the digital world expands, investors are asking the crucial question: what does the future hold for Decentraland price prediction? Could MANA realistically reach the psychological milestone of $1, and what factors will determine its trajectory through 2025, 2026, and beyond to 2030? This comprehensive analysis dives deep into technical indicators, market trends, and the evolving metaverse landscape to provide actionable insights for your investment strategy. What is Decentraland and Why Does MANA Matter? Decentraland is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a complete virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can buy, sell, and develop virtual land parcels (represented as NFTs), create interactive experiences, and socialize in a decentralized digital environment. MANA serves as the lifeblood of this economy. It’s used to purchase virtual land (LAND tokens), pay for goods and services within the platform, and participate in governance decisions through the Decentraland DAO. Understanding this fundamental utility is key to any Decentraland price prediction. The token’s value is intrinsically tied to platform adoption, user engagement, and the overall growth of the metaverse sector. Analyzing the Current MANA Price Landscape Before looking forward, we must understand the present. MANA’s price history reflects the volatile nature of both the broader cryptocurrency market and the emerging metaverse narrative. It experienced explosive growth during the 2021 metaverse hype cycle, followed by a significant correction during the subsequent crypto winter. Current price action is influenced by several concurrent factors: Broader Crypto Market Sentiment: As a major altcoin, MANA often moves in correlation with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Platform-Specific Developments: Updates to the Decentraland platform, new partnerships, and user metrics directly impact investor perception. Metaverse Competition: The rise of other platforms like The Sandbox creates both competitive pressure and validation for the overall sector. Macroeconomic Conditions: Interest rates and regulatory news affect risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Decentraland Price Prediction 2025: The Next Major Test The year 2025 is seen by many analysts as a potential inflection point. Our Decentraland price prediction for this period hinges on several catalysts. If the next Bitcoin halving cycle (expected in 2024) triggers a new bull market for crypto, MANA could ride the wave of renewed investor interest in altcoins and metaverse projects. Key developments within Decentraland itself, such as significant improvements in user interface, major brand integrations, or breakthrough VR/AR compatibility, could drive substantial adoption. A realistic price range for MANA in 2025 might be between $0.45 and $0.80, with the upper bound achievable if both macro and micro conditions align favorably. MANA Price Forecast for 2026: Building Sustainable Value By 2026, the focus for a credible MANA price forecast shifts from hype to utility. The market will likely reward platforms that demonstrate real, sustained economic activity and user retention. Questions for Decentraland will include: Is daily active user count growing? Are virtual businesses thriving? Is the platform’s DAO effectively managing its treasury and roadmap? Success in these areas could see MANA establish a stronger support base. Predictions for this year are more conservative, often ranging from $0.60 to $1.00. Reaching the $1 mark in 2026 would require not just a bullish crypto market, but clear evidence that Decentraland is a leading, profitable metaverse destination. The Long-Term Vision: Decentraland 2030 Price Potential Looking all the way to a Decentraland 2030 price prediction involves significant speculation but is grounded in long-term technological trends. By the end of the decade, technologies like widespread augmented reality glasses, faster blockchain infrastructure, and deeper AI integration could make immersive virtual worlds a commonplace part of daily life. If Decentraland captures even a small fraction of the projected multi-trillion-dollar metaverse economy, the value of its native token could reflect that success. Long-term models suggest a potential price range of $1.50 to $3.00+ by 2030, assuming the platform evolves, scales, and maintains its first-mover advantage in a fiercely competitive space. Will MANA Price Hit $1? The Path to the Dollar Milestone The question of whether the MANA price will hit $1 is a central one for investors. Achieving this target is not a matter of if, but when and how. The path likely requires a combination of the following: Factor Description Impact on $1 Target Metaverse Mass Adoption Millions of regular, non-crypto users engaging with virtual worlds. High Decentraland Platform Growth Increased transactions, land utility, and unique experiences. Critical Favorable Crypto Regulation Clear, supportive regulatory frameworks for digital assets. Medium-High Strategic Partnerships Major brands establishing permanent, engaging presences. Medium Tokenomics & Scarcity Burn mechanisms or reduced token supply increasing scarcity. Medium A sustained break above $1 would signal that the market values Decentraland not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational piece of Web3 infrastructure with a proven economic model. Risks and Challenges to Consider No investment is without risk, and this is especially true for metaverse cryptocurrencies. Any Decentraland price prediction must account for significant headwinds. Technological disruption from newer, more advanced platforms could erode Decentraland’s market share. Prolonged crypto bear markets can drain liquidity and interest from all altcoins, regardless of their fundamentals. Furthermore, if the broader vision of an open, decentralized metaverse fails to materialize in favor of closed, corporate-controlled worlds (like those proposed by Meta), the value proposition of MANA could be challenged. Investors should only allocate capital they are prepared to lose and consider MANA as a high-risk, high-potential-reward component of a diversified portfolio. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this analysis, here are key takeaways for navigating the future of MANA: Focus on Adoption Metrics: Watch Decentraland’s user activity and developer engagement more closely than short-term price swings. Dollar-Cost Average (DCA): Given the volatility, consider accumulating MANA in smaller, regular purchases rather than timing the market. Understand the Product: The best way to gauge Decentraland’s potential is to experience it. Create an avatar and explore the world yourself. Stay Informed on Catalysts: Keep track of major platform updates, partnership announcements, and DAO governance proposals. Conclusion: A Calculated Bet on the Open Metaverse The journey of Decentraland and its MANA token is a microcosm of the broader experiment in building a user-owned internet. While short-term price predictions are fraught with uncertainty, the long-term thesis for a decentralized metaverse remains compelling. Reaching $1 is a realistic target within the 2026-2030 timeframe, but it is contingent upon real-world growth, not just market speculation. For believers in a future where digital sovereignty and virtual experiences hold significant value, Decentraland represents a foundational bet. Its success will be measured not just in dollar terms, but in its ability to create a vibrant, persistent, and user-governed digital society.

The popular memecoin’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, following the conclusion of its presale. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has started the week on a bullish note, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other major altcoins trading in positive territory. Husky Inu (HINU) Rises To $0.00023477 Husky Inu (HINU) has started the week with its latest price increase of the pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00023387 to $0.00023477. The project’s pre-launch phase began on April 1, following the conclusion of its highly successful presale. Husky Inu adopted a dynamic, highly flexible pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, helping empower its growing community and existing HINU token holders without compromising its fundraising efforts. The team behind the project has stated that the primary goal behind the pre-launch phase is to ensure capital raise, undertake marketing initiatives, fund platform improvements, and facilitate broader ecosystem expansion. Launch Date And Fundraising Husky Inu’s official launch date is just over three months away. However, the possibility of an earlier launch is open. The Husky Inu team will conduct a series of strategic meetings to assess market conditions and determine the optimal time to launch the project. The first two reviews were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025. The third review is scheduled for January 1, 2026. On the fundraising front, the project has raised $905,549, struggling to attract funding, largely due to uncertain market conditions. Husky Inu faced a similar fundraising crunch a couple of months earlier, taking longer than anticipated to cross the $900,000 mark, and potentially impacting its long-term fundraising target. However, the team remains optimistic about investor sentiment and fundraising picking up as broader market conditions improve. While the official launch date is set for March 27, 2026, the team is open to shifting launch dates to adapt to market conditions. The team has held two review meetings to assess market conditions, with a third scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Rebounds Crypto investors have plenty to cheer as the new week gets underway, with the market in bullish territory. Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $91,000 and is trading around $91,795, up almost 3% after a sluggish weekend, which saw it pinned below $90,000. Ethereum (ETH) has followed a similar trajectory and is up nearly 3%, trading around $3,150 after struggling to stay above $3,000 over the weekend. Ripple (XRP) is up 2.71% and Solana (SOL) is up nearly 3%, trading around $135. Dogecoin (DOGE), the largest memecoin by market capitalization, is up almost 2%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 2.28% at $0.428. Chainlink (LINK) is up almost 1% and Litecoin (LTC) is up 1.10%, trading around $83.14. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered substantial increases over the past 24 hours. As a result, the crypto market cap is up almost 2%, while the 24-hour trading volume is at $116 billion, up over 50%.

Solana Breakpoint Conference starts on December 11, 2025 Solana Breakpoint 2025, the network’s premier annual summit, commences on December 11. The event extends through December 13 at the Etihad Arena on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and has attracted thousands of participants. Organized by the Solana Foundation, this edition marks the largest iteration to date.

Solana opened a bridge to RWAs, neobanks, prediction markets, and the NYSE. With 3 days to go until Breakpoint, this next week will truly be one of the biggest in our history,” team Solana boasted via X. The past months have been massive for Solana. For instance, DFlow added tokenized Kalshi prediction markets, Revolut integrated SOL for its 65 million users, and the Franklin Templeton Solana ETF debuted on the NYSE. Solana also welcomed an RWA milestone with the launch of a consortium spearheaded by Figure to bring $1 billion in on-chain loans per month to the blockchain network. Vanguard also unlocked Solana ETFs for its 50 million clients. Breakpoint is poised to further highlight the growth and potential impact across SOL markets. Solana (SOL) price outlook The SOL token traded around $139 as of December 8, 2025, up 4% in the past 24 hours. With altcoins also eyeing a bounce, Solana’s uptick from lows of $128 means the key barrier around $150 may be coming into view. Buyers have faltered above $143 on multiple occasions this past month, suffering as Bitcoin swung between $93,000 and $85,000. But analysts project a bullish December trajectory. Catalysts include macroeconomic tailwinds and exchange-traded fund inflows. Solana’s appeal as likely to dominate the upcoming conference could be another factor. On the technical front, the near-term picture includes a supportive RSI and MACD on the daily chart. Solana price chart by TradingView Among the top segments on the agenda at the conference are decentralized finance (DeFi), artificial intelligence, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), network scalability, and real-world asset tokenization. Continued integrations within the Solana ecosystem amid institutional interest add to this bullish outlook for the Solana price. Bullish targets include $200 and the all-time high of $294 reached in January 2025.

Let’s break down what this means for the broader ecosystem. What’s Driving the Massive Inflow into Digital Asset Funds? The consistent, multi-million dollar inflows highlight a crucial trend: institutional investors are not just dipping a toe back in, they are making substantial commitments. This activity in digital asset funds often serves as a leading indicator for market sentiment, reflecting professional money moving based on macroeconomic factors and long-term valuation theses. The two-week streak suggests this is more than a fleeting reaction. A Closer Look at the Weekly Fund Flow Breakdown CoinShares’ data reveals where the smart money is flowing. The distribution shows a diversified appetite across several major cryptocurrencies, not just a singular bet. Bitcoin (BTC): The flagship cryptocurrency led the pack, attracting $352 million into its investment products. This underscores its enduring role as the core holding for institutional digital asset funds . XRP: In a standout performance, XRP products saw inflows of $245 million. This significant figure likely reflects optimism surrounding the asset’s legal clarity and potential for cross-border payment solutions. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum products recorded a solid $39.1 million in net inflows, indicating steady interest as the network continues its development roadmap. Solana (SOL): With $3 million in inflows, Solana maintains its presence as a contender for institutional capital focused on high-throughput blockchain applications. Why Should Everyday Crypto Investors Care? While these figures represent institutional vehicles like ETFs and trusts, they have a tangible impact on the entire market. Large inflows into digital asset funds increase buying pressure on the underlying assets, potentially contributing to price support and reduced volatility. Moreover, this activity validates the asset class, encouraging further development, regulatory clarity, and mainstream adoption. It’s a tide that lifts all boats. What Challenges and Considerations Remain? However, it’s essential to maintain perspective. The crypto market is famously cyclical, and inflows can reverse quickly based on global economic conditions or regulatory news. Furthermore, the concentration of flows into a few large assets highlights the ongoing challenge of achieving broad-based institutional adoption across the thousands of existing cryptocurrencies. Sustainability is the key question. Actionable Insights from the Data For investors, this report offers more than just numbers. First, it emphasizes the importance of monitoring institutional flow data as a sentiment gauge. Second, the diversification seen in the inflows reinforces the strategy of building a balanced portfolio across established leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside assets with specific catalysts like XRP. Finally, the two-week trend suggests watching for continuity; a third week of inflows would strongly confirm a new bullish phase for institutional digital asset funds . In conclusion, the back-to-back $716 million weekly inflows represent a stunning vote of confidence from the institutional world. This movement into digital asset funds for Bitcoin, XRP, Ethereum, and Solana products is a robust signal that professional capital is strategically re-entering the crypto space. While caution is always warranted, this trend marks a potentially significant inflection point, suggesting a foundation is being built for the next phase of mature market growth. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are “digital asset funds” exactly? A1: Digital asset funds are investment products like Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), trusts, or closed-end funds that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly buying and storing the coins themselves. Q2: Why is a second week of inflows so important? A2: A single week could be a temporary anomaly. Two consecutive weeks of strong inflows suggest a more sustained shift in institutional sentiment and a potential trend, rather than a one-off event. Q3: Does money flowing into these funds directly increase crypto prices? A3: Indirectly, yes. The fund providers must purchase the underlying cryptocurrency to back their shares. This creates consistent buy-side pressure in the market, which can support or increase prices. Q4: Should I invest based solely on this inflow data? A4: No. This data is one useful indicator among many. Always conduct your own research, consider your risk tolerance, and understand that past performance does not guarantee future results. Q5: Where can I find this CoinShares report? A5: CoinShares publishes its “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly” report on its official website for public access.

The network carries double the volume of Ethereum and is the home of some of the busiest protocols. Solana DEX activity remains elevated, surpassing other L1 and L2 chains in weekly volumes for 16 weeks in a row. Solana’s DEXs also report the biggest daily and weekly volumes, with only occasional anomalies where Ethereum or BNB Chain come close. Trading on DEX across the board remains elevated, despite the slowdown of meme trading. On Solana, memes make up a shrinking share of overall token volumes. The other factor for Solana DEX activity is HumidiFi , a dark pool DEX that emerged in the past six months. HumidiFi reported volumes are catching up with those of other top on-chain exchanges across all chains. HumidiFi recently launched a token presale, aiming to boost adoption with a native WET token. DEX activity remains robust across the board, based on legacy tokens, stablecoin pairs, and wrapped tokens. DEX trading is part of the liquidity flow from DeFi. Solana activity also got a boost from the recent expansion of lending, with competition from Jupiter and Kamino. Additional trading spikes come from high-profile launches like Monad’s MON token. Solana remains the leader in cross-chain activity Solana trading volumes on DEX have grown not only statistically. The ecosystem is more complex, including a new balance of platforms and cross-chain activity. Despite the slowdown in meme creation, PumpSwap emerged as a leader for legacy tokens. The platform carries activity for PUMP tokens , USDC pairs, as well as hot trending legacy memes. Solana DEX competition shifted in the past quarter, as PumpSwap took up the bulk of trading. PancakeSwap’s cross-chain version also remained highly active on Solana. | Source: Dune Analytics Other sources of volumes come from cross-chain activity. Solana remains the leader for transaction count, although BNB Chain was the leader for cross-chain volumes. Both networks benefit from the spike in activity on PancakeSwap , which is currently the most active protocol, passing even Uniswap. DEX volumes remain significant despite the slower altcoin season. Trading remains active, with occasional whale activity and short-term rallies for selected tokens. DEXs are carrying some of the internal turnover of crypto whales and traders, tapping liquidity from lending and stablecoins. Solana invites net inflows in the past three months The Solana ecosystem is relatively balanced based on its current cross-chain trading. Solana saw $182M in net inflows for the past three months, according to Artemis data. Additionally, Solana gained internal liquidity from renewed USDC minting. For the year to date, Solana has drawn in $634M in liquidity from other networks. Most of the bridged value comes from Ethereum, with a small part from Polygon. Solana is also used as an alternative chain for Polymarket predictions, causing some users to switch from Polygon. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

According to on-chain data, Amber Group and Metalpha have collectively withdrawn a staggering $28.2 million worth of Ethereum from Binance. This action is more than a simple transfer; it’s a powerful signal that could foreshadow a major shift in market dynamics. Let’s dive into what this means for Ethereum and your portfolio. What Does This Major ETH Accumulation Signal? On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain spotted the transactions, providing a transparent window into institutional behavior. First, crypto market maker Amber Group moved 6,000 ETH , valued at approximately $18.8 million, out of Binance. Shortly before that, Hong Kong-based digital asset manager Metalpha withdrew 3,000 ETH , worth around $9.4 million. When institutions of this caliber move assets off exchanges in large volumes, it typically indicates a long-term holding strategy, often referred to as ‘accumulation.’ This pattern of ETH accumulation reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges. Therefore, it can be interpreted as a bullish indicator for Ethereum’s price. Historically, sustained withdrawal of assets from exchanges by large holders has preceded periods of price appreciation. Why Are Institutions Betting on Ethereum Now? The timing of this ETH accumulation is crucial. Institutions don’t make multi-million dollar moves without reason. Several factors could be driving this confidence: Upcoming Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous development, including further improvements to scalability and efficiency post-Merge, enhances its long-term value proposition. Regulatory Clarity: Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is often viewed as a more established asset, potentially facing fewer regulatory headwinds. Macroeconomic Hedge: In uncertain economic times, major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are increasingly seen as digital stores of value by institutional portfolios. This strategic positioning suggests that these firms see more upside potential than downside risk at current levels. How Can Retail Investors Interpret This Move? While following ‘smart money’ is not a guaranteed strategy, understanding their motives provides valuable context. This institutional ETH accumulation is a strong data point for retail investors to consider. However, it should be one piece of a larger puzzle that includes your own financial goals and risk tolerance. For actionable insight, monitor exchange reserve data. A consistent decline in ETH held on major exchanges like Binance often correlates with a reduction in readily available supply, which can support higher prices. This recent activity is a prime example of that metric in action. What Are the Potential Challenges and Risks? It’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. Institutional moves are not infallible. Potential challenges include: Market Volatility: Crypto markets remain highly volatile. Accumulation does not guarantee immediate price increases. Liquidity Shifts: The ETH could be moved to another platform for lending, staking, or as collateral, not purely for long-term holding. Broader Market Trends: One or two data points do not override overarching macroeconomic trends that affect all risk assets. Always conduct your own research and never invest based solely on the observed actions of others. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal in a Complex Market The combined $28.2 million ETH accumulation by Amber Group and Metalpha is a compelling narrative for Ethereum. It underscores a growing institutional conviction in the asset’s future. This move, visible through on-chain transparency, provides a glimpse into the strategic thinking of major market participants. For the astute observer, it reinforces the importance of monitoring blockchain data to understand the undercurrents shaping the crypto landscape. While not a crystal ball, this activity adds a significant layer of bullish sentiment to Ethereum’s market story. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘ETH accumulation’ mean? A: ETH accumulation refers to the process of consistently buying and withdrawing Ethereum from exchanges with the intent to hold it for the long term, reducing its available supply for trading. Q: Why is withdrawing ETH from Binance considered bullish? A: Withdrawing coins from an exchange moves them into private wallets, typically for holding. This reduces the immediate ‘sell-side’ liquidity on the exchange, which can decrease selling pressure and potentially support price increases. Q: Who are Amber Group and Metalpha? A> Amber Group is a leading global crypto market maker and digital asset platform. Metalpha is a Hong Kong-based wealth management firm specializing in digital assets. Both are considered sophisticated institutional players. Q: Should I buy ETH because these institutions did? A> Not necessarily. Institutional moves are a useful data point, but they should not be your sole reason for investing. Always align your investments with your personal financial goals, risk appetite, and own research. Q: How can I track similar on-chain data? A> Platforms like Lookonchain, Nansen, and Glassnode provide analytics that track wallet movements of large holders, often labeled as ‘smart money’ or ‘whales.’ Q: Could this ETH be moved for staking instead of holding? A> Yes, that’s a possibility. The ETH could be moved to a staking service or protocol to earn rewards, which is still a long-term bullish action as it locks up supply.

Many of the altcoins have performed even better. An evident example is Zcash (ZEC), whose valuation spiked by approximately 17% on a 24-hour scale. BTC Heads North The primary cryptocurrency experienced substantial volatility in the last few days. It was at the forefront of gains towards the end of the business week, temporarily surpassing $94,000. However, the weekend was not kind to the bulls, and BTC slipped below $88,000 on December 7. The start of the current week, though, offered another comeback. Currently, BTC trades at around $92,00, representing a 3% increase on a daily scale. BTC Price, Source: TradingView The enhanced turbulence comes just days before the last FOMC meeting for the year, during which the Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise, lower, or keep interest rates in the United States unchanged. The probability of a 0.25% drop seems the most plausible scenario, and we will see how the official announcement impacts the crypto sector. Lower interest rates are typically seen as good news for the bulls since they reduce the appeal of traditional financial products and can redirect capital toward digital assets. Nonetheless, the entire crypto market could still fall victim to a classical “sell the news” effect. Following BTC’s latest price pump, its market capitalization has jumped to roughly $1.83 trillion, while its dominance over the alts stands at around 57.37%. ZEC Leads the Altcoin Rally Many of the well-known altcoins have charted much more impressive gains than BTC over the last 24 hours. ZEC is the best-performing top 100 cryptocurrency within that period, with its price soaring by 17% to $390. Canton (CC) follows next with a daily increase of 13%, whereas Bittensor (TAO), Ethena (ENA), Pepe (PEPE), and Cardano (ADA) have headed north by 6-7%.

As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are constantly searching for the next big opportunity. Among the many digital assets vying for attention, Bitcoin SV (BSV) stands out with its unique proposition and controversial history. The burning question on every trader’s mind: can Bitcoin SV price reach the elusive $100 mark in the coming years? Let’s dive deep into our comprehensive Bitcoin SV price prediction analysis for 2025 through 2030. Understanding Bitcoin SV and Its Market Position Bitcoin SV, which stands for Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, emerged from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in 2018. The project aims to restore what its creators believe was Satoshi Nakamoto’s original vision for Bitcoin—a peer-to-peer electronic cash system with massive scaling capabilities. Unlike its predecessor, BSV focuses on stability and scalability, with a protocol that remains largely unchanged. The current BSV price reflects its position in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. While not among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, Bitcoin SV maintains a dedicated community and continues to develop its infrastructure. The BSV cryptocurrency operates on a blockchain that supports larger block sizes, theoretically enabling more transactions at lower costs. Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025: The Critical Year Our Bitcoin SV price prediction for 2025 considers several key factors that could influence BSV’s trajectory. Market analysts generally fall into three camps regarding Bitcoin SV 2025 prospects: Bullish Scenario: If Bitcoin SV gains significant enterprise adoption and regulatory clarity improves, BSV could reach between $80-$120 Moderate Scenario: With steady growth and incremental adoption, a price range of $50-$80 seems plausible Bearish Scenario: If market conditions deteriorate or competition intensifies, BSV might struggle to break above $40 Factor Impact on BSV Price Probability Enterprise Adoption High Positive Medium Regulatory Developments Moderate to High High Bitcoin Market Correlation High Very High Technical Developments Moderate High BSV Cryptocurrency Technical Analysis and Market Factors When examining BSV price movements, several technical and fundamental factors come into play. The Bitcoin SV forecast must account for both internal developments and external market forces. Key technical indicators suggest that BSV has established important support and resistance levels that will shape its future price action. Market sentiment toward BSV cryptocurrency remains divided. Supporters point to its scalable architecture and enterprise-focused approach, while critics highlight its controversial leadership and legal challenges. The ongoing development of the BSV ecosystem, including new applications and partnerships, will significantly influence our Bitcoin SV price prediction accuracy. Bitcoin SV Forecast 2026-2030: Long-Term Prospects Looking beyond 2025, our Bitcoin SV forecast for 2026-2030 becomes increasingly speculative but reveals interesting possibilities. Several scenarios could unfold for BSV cryptocurrency over this extended timeframe: 2026: Continued infrastructure development could push BSV toward $150-$200 if adoption accelerates 2027-2028: Potential mainstream recognition and integration might drive prices to $250-$400 2029-2030: Maturation of the blockchain industry could position BSV between $400-$600 in an optimistic scenario However, these Bitcoin SV price prediction numbers assume favorable market conditions, technological progress, and growing adoption. The actual BSV price will depend on numerous variables, including competitor developments, regulatory frameworks, and macroeconomic factors. Will BSV Price Hit $100? The Critical Analysis The $100 threshold represents a psychological and technical milestone for Bitcoin SV. Based on our analysis, several factors suggest that BSV could indeed reach this level: Historical price patterns show BSV has previously approached this level during bull markets Increasing enterprise adoption of blockchain technology could benefit BSV’s value proposition Network upgrades and ecosystem development may enhance BSV’s competitive position Broader cryptocurrency market growth typically lifts most established projects However, challenges remain. The BSV cryptocurrency faces intense competition from other blockchain platforms, regulatory uncertainty, and market volatility. Our Bitcoin SV forecast suggests that reaching $100 is plausible within the 2025-2026 timeframe, but not guaranteed. Risks and Opportunities in Bitcoin SV Investment Every Bitcoin SV price prediction must acknowledge both the potential rewards and significant risks. The BSV cryptocurrency presents unique opportunities due to its focus on scalability and enterprise applications. However, investors should consider: Legal and Regulatory Risks: Ongoing legal issues involving key figures could impact development Market Competition: Numerous blockchain platforms compete for similar use cases Adoption Challenges: Enterprise adoption may progress slower than anticipated Technical Risks: Network security and stability concerns in a rapidly evolving space Despite these challenges, the Bitcoin SV 2025 outlook and beyond offers potential for substantial returns if the project achieves its technological and adoption goals. Expert Opinions and Alternative Viewpoints Financial analysts and cryptocurrency experts offer diverse perspectives on Bitcoin SV price prediction. Some emphasize BSV’s technical merits and potential for enterprise adoption, while others remain skeptical due to market dynamics and competitive pressures. Most agree that BSV cryptocurrency performance will correlate strongly with broader market trends while also responding to project-specific developments. When evaluating any Bitcoin SV forecast, consider multiple sources and methodologies. Technical analysis, fundamental evaluation, and market sentiment all contribute to a comprehensive understanding of BSV price potential. Actionable Insights for BSV Investors Based on our Bitcoin SV price prediction analysis, consider these strategic approaches: Diversification: Never allocate more than a small percentage of your portfolio to any single cryptocurrency Research: Continuously monitor BSV developments, partnerships, and technological progress Risk Management: Establish clear entry and exit strategies based on your risk tolerance Long-term Perspective: Consider BSV as part of a multi-year investment horizon rather than short-term speculation Frequently Asked Questions What is Bitcoin SV?

In this case, the asset’s valuation rose from $112.40 billion to $126.74 billion at press time, marking one of its strongest single-day capital surges in recent weeks and signaling growing trader confidence. XRP 24-hour market cap chart. Source: CMC The rapid jump in market cap coincides with a bullish technical structure, suggesting a sustained rebound in the coming sessions. In this line, insights shared by cryptocurrency trading analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on December 8 indicate that XRP is currently trading inside a large symmetrical triangle pattern, with price action compressing toward the apex. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Ali Martinez Notably, the pattern shows a descending upper trendline and a rising lower trendline, reflecting reduced volatility as XRP nears a breakout zone. At the same time, recent candles continue to move between these converging levels while forming higher lows, indicating strengthening buyer momentum and setting the stage for a potential decisive move. Based on the structure, Martinez noted that XRP is positioned for an upside breakout, with technical projections pointing to a potential 16% rally if the price pierces the triangle’s upper boundary. XRP whales on a dumping spree Interestingly, despite XRP showing strength, whales are not confident in the asset’s long-term structure. On-chain data indicates that whales have offloaded roughly 510 million tokens over the past week. The outflows affected wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP. This sustained distribution suggests major holders are reducing exposure, a trend that often amplifies market weakness.

However, if selling slows or large holders begin accumulating again, the asset could stabilize and attempt a recovery from current levels.

The potential policy reversal will lift restrictions that barred banks from engaging with crypto assets, including Bitcoin and stablecoins, on behalf of clients. The BCRA’s ban, which prohibited financial institutions from facilitating any client digital asset transactions aside from stablecoins, was supposedly due to a policy influenced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). At the time, the central bank cited the need to prevent money laundering, keep its financial stability, and halt unregulated transactions. Argentina is arguably a very welcoming environment for cryptos. However, after the country secured a $44 billion bailout from the IMF in 2017, policymakers yielded to the United Nations financier’s request to shun Bitcoin from banks. Argentina could revise the IMF restructuring plan to avoid Bitcoin In 2022, the IMF approved a debt restructuring deal that included a commitment to “discourage the use of cryptocurrencies with a view to preventing money laundering, informality and disintermediation,” according to correspondence sent to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva. The regulatory approach limited formal access to digital assets, leaving millions of Argentines reliant on informal channels for crypto trading. Despite the ban, some private banks like Banco Galicia, Argentina’s largest private bank, added crypto trading services. If the rule change is successful, allowing regulated banks to facilitate crypto transactions could give citizens a safer, more structured way to invest, and the central bank will have greater oversight of market activity. Argentines believe digital assets Bitcoin and stablecoins are the answer to high inflation rates and strict foreign currency controls. Argentina’s inflation rate came down slightly in October, falling to 31.3% from the previous month’s 31.8% level. During the central bank decision to restrict dollar resales for 90 days prior to the October 26 elections, local trading platform Ripio reported a 40% weekly surge in stablecoin-to-peso transactions. “Stablecoins are undoubtedly a vehicle to get cheaper dollars,” said Julián Colombo, country manager at Bitso. He also mentioned regulatory gaps that have allowed the informal “rulo” trading system to thrive, where stablecoins are exchanged for pesos at favorable rates. Nicole Connor, leader of Argentina’s Women in Crypto organization, said many citizens now avoid peso-based savings altogether. “Inflation and political uncertainty make us more conservative, so I don’t have any savings or investments in pesos. I keep my savings in crypto and stablecoins and try to generate returns with them,” she added. Crypto to ease economic weight on Argentine banks According to Bloomberg, private banks in Argentina reported losses during the third quarter against the backdrop of the highest loan delinquencies seen in the last 15 years. “A very tight monetary policy characterized by unsustainably high real interest rates and historic reserve requirements ahead of the elections had a severe impact on economic activity and particularly the entire banking sector,” said Julio Patricio Supervielle, CEO of Banco Supervielle SA. Persistent inflation has eroded purchasing power for average Argentines, including public employees, informal workers, and pensioners, whose incomes are well below early 2023 levels. If the BCRA decides to greenlight crypto trading for traditional banks, there could be more liquidity in US dollars for the country to bargain with, not to mention more ways for President Javier Milei to fight inflation. “The dollar occupies a very strong place in Argentine society and in everyday life because it has given us a refuge from the national currency,” one stockbroker told Bloomberg. The October midterm election results highly favored President Javier Milei’s coalition and provided a strong market signal. Yet, the government still has to secure more dollars to rebuild foreign currency reserves and keep the peso within a trading band through a gradual depreciation of about 1% per month until the 2027 presidential elections. London-based ProMeritum, a credit and fixed-income fund, posted a 1.76% gain in October after purchasing Argentine assets following a September sell-off. “We did not have any Argentina exposure before the September elections in the province of Buenos Aires, so avoided the negative impact,” said managing partner Pavel Mamai.

In spite of ADA currently trading 85% lower from the record high, charts confirm that the creation of a double-bottom formation close to $0.387 could signal the start of a break-out phase above $0.60. As liquidity levels are expected to increase during 2026, smart and experienced investors are finding their focus shifting to new crypto coins targets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has reached the sixth phase of the ongoing presale, having already claimed 98% of the total tokens available. Foundations of Cardano The sustainability of the Cardano network, as commented on by Hoskinson, can be attributed to the inherent core strength, as the short-term market volatility and prices are dominated by macroeconomic speculations and are not necessarily dependent on the core competency of the network. In the light of the Fed’s ending quantitative tightening and infused liquidity, the risk-on assets, such as ADA, are likely to witness an increase in demand. The double-bottoming formation visible on the price chart for ADA, coupled with the reversal of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) from the over-sold levels, could signal the start of the upward reversal. The resistance levels could extend up to $0.60, followed by cycle peaks of $1.80, which signal significant potential for growth. However, despite the stability depicted by the ADA, investors are often on the lookout for the most advanced and rapidly growing crypto assets, such as MUTM. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Final Stage Mutuum Finance appears as one of the new and top cryptos, as it enters the final stages of Phase 6, which stands at 98% complete. In Phase 6, the cost of the tokens stands at $0.035, showing an increase of 250% from the original cost, which was $0.01, but for the short term. Once the phase completes, the 7th phase kicks off, showing an increase of 20%, and the cost becomes $0.04. Currently, the total amount raised for the project stands at $19,180,000, and there are 18,350 members, exhibiting marked confidence. At the proposed launch price of $0.06, an individual purchasing during the sale phase stands to gain 400% after the launch, thus making MUTM one of the most prospective for 2026. Apart from the above characteristics, there are several important aspects. Security and Development Progress Security and ensuring the integrity and reliability of the MUTM protocol are obviously core priorities, and an independent audit that was initiated by Halborn Security, which specifically focused on the lending and borrowing contracts that Mutuum makes, and which the Mutuum team expects to complete shortly, goes some way towards ensuring that the code base and, therefore, the protocol are reliable. In light of the increasing pace of the presale, such factors position MUTM as an attractive option for investors. In the kind of market where the availability of well-established currencies like Cardano makes it less volatile, Mutuum Finance stands out as an investment opportunity that provides high growth as the presale reaches its climax. The fact that the project provides various assurances, such as audit and testnet development, and offers incentives by means of daily rewards, keeps it as one of the most attractive options to be considered for investment portfolios.

Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have seen their prices rise over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up by 2.4% since this time yesterday, currently trading at $91,532. Bitcoin (BTC) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Ethereum (ETH) is up by 3.3%, now changing hands at $3,133. This is the highest increase among the ten. The second-highest rise is Solana (SOL)’s 2.8% to $135. The smallest increase in the category is 0.4% by Tron (TRX) , currently trading at $0.2869. When it comes to the top 100 coins, 90 have appreciated over the past day. At the top we find Zcash (ZEC) , with a 9.2% increase to the price of $370. It’s followed by Canton (CC)’s 8%, now changing hands at $0.06749. On the other hand, Monero (XMR) and MemeCore (M) fell the most among the ten that have gone red over the past day. The former is down 2.8% to $375, while the latter fell 2% to $1.23. These are also the only two coins with decreases above 1%. Meanwhile, several notable developments occurred globally. Philippines’ GoTyme Bank has launched crypto trading for its 6.5 million customers through a partnership with US fintech firm Alpaca .

He argues that the Rule of Alternation suggests that if Wave II is fairly simple in its A-B-C formation, then Wave IV is likely to be complex. “To me what we’ve seen since the Wave III high thus far is only the A wave of the Wave IV A-B-C correction, and will take months to complete.” “I continue to look for the market to trade in a $71,000 to $105,000 range for the next 4-6 months, and intend to accumulate BTC in the $72,000 to $84,000 range as the opportunity presents itself,” Glover says. “If we have a 2 day close above $108,000 I’ll make the call that the correction is over and ensure that I have my full long position in place at that time,” he concludes. Source: Ledn Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing on Monday morning, BTC stood at $91,532. After a brief dip to the intraday low of $87,887, the price jumped to the day’s high (so far) of $91,786. Moreover, BTC is up 6.3% over the past 7 days, trading in the $84,553–$93,855 range. It’s down 10.3% in a month and 27.3% from its all-time high of $126,080. Clearing and holding the $94,600 level could confirm bullish continuation. In this case, BTC could move towards $100,000. Conversely, the price could drop to the $76,000 level. Ethereum is currently changing hands at $3,133. Like BTC, ETH saw a brief dip earlier in the day, dropping to the intraday low of $2,941 before jumping to the intraday high of $3,145. It also appreciated just below 11% in a week, trading between the low of $2,736 and the high of $3,222. Meanwhile, ETH is down 9% in a month and 36.7% from its ATH of $4,946. If the bulls continue running, we could see ETH move above $3,230, followed by the $3,300 and $3,380 levels. But a fall below $2,800 may lead to the $2,550 level. Ethereum (ETH) 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment dropped further over the weekend within the fear territory but then increased slightly on Monday. The crypto fear and greed index moved between 20 and 21 in the previous two days, before increasing to 24 today . This index has largely moved between 10 and 25 over the past month, indicating market participants’ caution and reflecting the market’s own moves within a tight range. ETFs See Mixed Performance On Friday, 5 December, after two days of outflows, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a $54.79 million in positive flows. The total net inflow is now at $54.79 billion. Of the twelve BTC ETFs, five recorded inflows, and one saw outflows. BlackRock accounts for the entirety of the negative flows, letting go of $32.49 million. On the other hand, Ark&21Shares added $42.79 million, followed by Fidelity’s $27.29 million. The US ETH ETFs posted negative flows on Friday for a second day in a raw, with $75.21 million in outflows. The total net inflow pulled back to $12.88 billion. BlackRock is responsible for this entire amount. Of the nine funds, none recorded inflows. Notably, more than 100 publicly traded companies transformed into crypto-holding vehicles in the first half of 2025, borrowing billions to buy digital tokens, copying Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy. However, they have seen median stock prices fall 43% year-to-date despite broader market gains, resulting from the way they fund crypto purchases.

The crypto market recorded an increase over the past 24 hours, as did the US stock market during the last session last week. By the closing time on Friday, 5 December, the S&P 500 was up by 0.19%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.22%. This followed a US inflation report that boosted expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Is this rally sustainable? We are likely to see prices rise at least moderately higher in the coming days and, potentially, weeks. Nonetheless, expect the typical short-tem decreases.

The move was short, and the price has since rebounded, but it marked the first clear breach of this range since November. The brief drop is viewed as a sign of weakening sentiment and added uncertainty around near-term direction.

Namely, Finbold’s AI prediction agent employed three leading large language models (LLMs) to project a LUNC price by December 31, with the average forecast coming in at $0.00004660. Compared with the current price of $0.00004819 on December 8, the figure implies a 3.66% downside. LUNC price prediction. Source: Finbold’s AI prediction agent However, not all LLMs were uniform in their prediction. On the bullish end, ChatGPT envisions Terra Classic rising another 8.12% to $0.00005230, while Claude Sonnet 4 sees it going up 7.91% to $0.00005200. These two scenarios would allow the asset to nearly double in value in the span of about a month, as it was changing hands at about $0.00002570 on December 1. On the other hand, Gemini 2.5 Flash anticipates a 26.61% crash and a resulting LUNC price target of $0.00003550. Should this prediction play out, Terra Classic would lose about 6% of its current monthly gains, considering it was trading at $0.00003777 on November 8. Machine learning algorithm predicts LUNC price As can be seen, the average LUNC December 31 price of $0.00004660 is the result of some rather disparate takes, meaning the number might be skewed due to one LLM’s exceptionally bearish analysis. After all, the predictions come amid heightened volatility for the cryptocurrency, which is down nearly 12% on the daily chart after the overheated rally mentioned above. Such conditions tend to influence short-term model outputs due to abrupt shifts in market momentum.

The two main drivers of this cycle are institutional capital entering the market through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury buyers. Ethereum is a technology platform, supporting multiple strong narratives, stablecoins, real-world assets (RWAs), and decentralized finance, all of which are poised for substantial growth in the coming years. Bitcoin enjoys a straightforward “digital gold” story, but Ethereum has to defend its position against both long-standing competitors and a steady stream of new Layer-1 networks. Institutional inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries have driven this cycle’s early strength, while long-term holders have steadily sold into the rally due to improved liquidity and lingering caution from past cycles. For Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), selling pressure may exceed current institutional buying capacity, potentially reinforcing the traditional four-year cycle and creating a market environment that actually benefits emerging long-term accumulators such as sovereign funds and central banks. Ethereum’s market share has stagnated as new stablecoin-focused chains and alternative platforms increasingly compete for new use cases like Perp DEX and prediction markets. Despite its strong ecosystem and decentralization, declining fee revenue and a shift back to inflationary territory are challenging the value-accrual thesis of ETH as an asset. BTC: Long-term Holder Selling Continuing Every Bitcoin cycle has a different market structure. The two main drivers of this cycle are institutional capital entering the market through spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury buyers. Both provided a steady bid for BTC, at least during the first half of the year. However, as we noted in the article “ Who’s Selling Bitcoin? Will They Stop? ” , ETF investors are more reactive to market sentiment. They reduce exposure rapidly during downturns and will only stop selling once prices stabilize and macro conditions remain favorable. With BTC holding near $90,000 and expectations for a December Fed rate cut climbing back above 80%, selling pressure from ETF holders has eased. Over the past two weeks, flows have been fairly muted, a noticeable change after four straight weeks of heavy redemptions. On the flip side, long-term holders have acted as a major selling force in this cycle. Although they were significant sellers in all previous cycles, they typically did not begin selling until the market entered its parabolic phase. In this cycle, however, long-term holders' behavior has been very different: they steadily sell into the market ever since the bull run began in late 2024. Their mentality is understandable. First, the entry of institutional capital has provided much deeper liquidity for Bitcoin, allowing long-term holders to offload their positions with minimal slippage. Second, in the previous bull run of 2021, many expected a “supercycle,” which unfortunately ultimately ended in the deepest crypto winter following the collapses of Terra/Luna and FTX. This time, investors are more cautious; many are simply anxious and want to front-run others by selling before the cycle top. We believe this mentality has contributed significantly to the steady selling trend observed in the chart below. Bitcoin 1Y+ HODL chart Without a doubt, Bitcoin has gained significant recognition from institutional capital in this cycle. Public companies, government entities (e.g., Luxembourg , Texas ), or even central banks (e.g., Czech central bank ) have begun accumulating Bitcoin as a reserve asset. However, aside from dedicated Bitcoin treasury companies like Strategy ( MSTR ), none of these public entities can currently purchase Bitcoin at scale due to the constraints of their institutional and regulatory nature. As a result, selling pressure from long-term holders may outsize the available bid in the market, potentially reinforcing the traditional four-year cycle, where the bull run ends in Q4 following the halving year, and which is now. In fact, this type of market environment may be exactly what these new entrants prefer. Public entities such as sovereign funds and central banks are not buying Bitcoin for trading purposes; they accumulate it for its role as a neutral reserve asset. A bear market is actually favorable for them, as it allows steady accumulation at more attractive prices. ETH: Market Share Stagnated Bitcoin benefits from a single, powerful narrative: digital gold. Investors who want to hold a neutral, digital reserve asset have one obvious choice. By contrast, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is a technology platform, supporting multiple strong narratives, stablecoins, real-world assets (RWAs), and decentralized finance, all of which are poised for substantial growth in the coming years. These use cases require a robust smart-contract platform. But this raises an important question: Why would developers and institutions choose Ethereum instead of alternative platforms? For Stablecoins, issuers are developing their own chain Ethereum has long dominated the supply of the two largest stablecoins, USDT and USDC. However, this has begun to change in recent months. Both issuers, Tether ( USDT-USD ) and Circle ( USDC-USD ), are now developing their own blockchains specifically designed to support their respective stablecoins. In our article "" The Rise of Stablecoin-Focused Blockchains "", we explore these emerging stablecoin-focused chains and their potential impact on the current leading settlement chains for stablecoins: Ethereum and Tron ( TRON-USD ). The rise of these dedicated stablecoin L1s raises big questions for existing networks that currently handle the bulk of stablecoin traffic – notably Ethereum (home of USDC and many other stablecoins in DeFi) and Tron (the chain that, thanks to low fees, carries a huge portion of USDT transactions today) In the immediate future, Ethereum and Tron are unlikely to lose their dominance overnight. They have large established user bases, integrations with exchanges and wallets, and liquidity deep in DeFi and CeFi. Newcomer chains like Arc or Stable will need time to ramp up. Looking further out, these new L1s could significantly alter the market share in stablecoin settlement. If Arc, Stable, Tempo, and Plasma achieve their goals, a growing chunk of stablecoin transactions (especially high-volume and enterprise transactions) may relocate off Ethereum and Tron onto these specialized chains. For DeFi and Dapps, Ethereum failed to capture more market share Total asset value, a common metric for measuring DeFi activity, has long been concentrated on Ethereum, which currently accounts for more than 67% of total TVL. This figure is often cited as evidence that Ethereum remains the most important chain for DeFi. However, it should be noted Ethereum share of total TVL has been at around 60% level since 2021. Ethereum has failed to capture more market share for the past 4 years. And all top emerging decentralized applications in this cycle, such as perp DEX - Hyperliquid or prediction market - Polymarket, are all not developed on Ethereum. Declining Fee Revenue Ethereum has been actively implementing network upgrades to enable lower fees, particularly for its Layer 2 (L2) networks, in response to the competitive landscape set by high-speed, low-cost Layer 1 blockchains like Solana ( SOL-USD ). In the most recent upgrade, Fusaka aims to further expand blob capacity and lower transaction costs, potentially boosting Layer 2 activity. However, while a lower fee means better usability, at the same time, it means lower network revenue and higher ETH inflation rate. Ethereum's fee mechanism (EIP-1559) burns a portion of transaction fees. When network activity and fees are high, the burn rate can exceed the issuance rate (rewards paid to stakers), making ETH deflationary. With the ever lower fees, ETH has already begun as an inflationary asset. Ethereum Fee Revenue has been declining since 2025 Source: Ethereum Revenue | Token Terminal And ETH has shifted back into inflationary territory since April 2024. Source: Dune Bitcoin enjoys a straightforward “digital gold” story, but Ethereum has to defend its position against both long-standing competitors and a steady stream of new Layer-1 networks. Ethereum’s strengths - its large developer base, strong decentralization, and deep application ecosystem - remain meaningful, but they’re not enough to rest on. The network needs to keep improving and reinforce how value ultimately flows back to ETH as an asset.

CoinShares reports total assets under management rose 7.9% from their November lows to $180B, though this figure remains below the all-time high of $264B. Daily flow data indicated minor outflows toward the end of the week, which analysts believe reflected macroeconomic uncertainty and market reactions to U.S. inflation-related data. Despite those short-term jitters, the week’s net performance highlights renewed confidence in digital asset exposure through exchange-traded products. A notable trend was the geographic spread of inflows, suggesting renewed interest globally rather than activity concentrated in a single region. The United States led with $483M in inflows, followed by Germany at $96.9M and Canada at $80.7M, demonstrating that institutional re-engagement with crypto markets is widening across regulated investment platforms. Bitcoin Leads Inflows While Short Products Reverse Bitcoin remained the primary focus for investors, recording $352M in inflows last week, contributing to year-to-date (YTD) inflows of $27.1B. This remains below the record $41.6B seen in 2024; however, continued inflows suggest persistent appetite for exposure despite reduced volatility and slower price momentum compared to previous cycles. In contrast, short-Bitcoin investment products saw outflows of $18.7M — the largest since March 2025. Analysts note that the previous occurrence coincided with price lows and later recovery, hinting that current negative sentiment may have exhausted itself, with investors positioning for a more favourable outlook. The reversal in short-Bitcoin demand could be interpreted as a tactical shift, where investors are less confident in prolonged downside risk and increasingly reassessing the potential for stabilization or upside in digital asset markets. XRP Sees Strong Momentum as Institutional Interest Accelerates XRP continued to draw attention , with $245M flowing into ETPs last week, bringing YTD inflows to $3.1B — a dramatic increase compared to $608M in 2024. The surge reflects heightened institutional engagement following greater clarity around its legal and regulatory landscape, which has broadened access and improved sentiment. The continued rise in XRP ETP demand marks one of the strongest comparative growth stories in the digital asset space this year, suggesting that investors may now be reassessing exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum as the market diversifies. Chainlink Records Largest Inflows on Record Chainlink registered $52.8M in weekly inflows, representing over 54% of its total assets under management — the largest on record for the token. The surge highlights growing institutional and developer interest in the tokenized asset and oracle infrastructure ecosystem that Chainlink underpins. As tokenization of real-world assets expands and demand for reliable data connectivity increases across blockchains, Chainlink’s growth may indicate a long-term thematic trend rather than short-term speculation. Digital asset ETPs saw US$716m in weekly inflows, lifting total AuM to US$180bn, though still well below the US$264bn all-time high.

This deposit, worth approximately $78.3 million, is more than just a large transaction. It represents a powerful vote of confidence from one of the world’s largest asset managers in the future of Ethereum and institutional cryptocurrency adoption. What Does This BlackRock Ethereum ETF Transaction Mean? According to data from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, this significant transfer occurred recently. The destination, Coinbase Prime, is crucial to understand. It is not the standard Coinbase retail platform. Instead, Coinbase Prime is a specialized prime brokerage service designed for large-scale institutional investors. It offers advanced trading tools, deep liquidity, and robust custody solutions. Therefore, this deposit likely signals preparatory activity, such as providing liquidity for the upcoming launch or management of the BlackRock Ethereum ETF (ticker: ETHA). Why Is Institutional Adoption a Game-Changer? The involvement of a titan like BlackRock fundamentally alters the landscape. Their entry validates Ethereum as a legitimate asset class for the most conservative portfolios. Here’s what this institutional wave brings: Unprecedented Liquidity: Large-scale inflows can stabilize markets and reduce volatility. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: Major firms engage only after thorough legal review, paving the way for clearer rules. Mainstream Credibility: It attracts other traditional finance players who have been waiting on the sidelines. This move by the BlackRock Ethereum ETF is a cornerstone in building a bridge between Wall Street and the crypto ecosystem. What Are the Immediate Implications for Ethereum? This deposit is a bullish signal for Ethereum’s market dynamics. Moving such a large sum to a prime brokerage often precedes trading activity. It indicates that BlackRock is gearing up for the operational phase of its ETF. For everyday investors, this underscores a key trend: institutional capital is not just planning to enter but is actively moving assets into position. The approval and launch of spot Ethereum ETFs, led by giants like BlackRock, are expected to funnel billions into ETH, potentially impacting its long-term valuation and network utility. Could There Be Challenges Ahead? While the outlook is positive, it’s wise to consider potential hurdles. The crypto market remains sensitive to macroeconomic factors and regulatory announcements. Furthermore, the concentration of large ETH holdings by institutions could introduce new market dynamics. However, the sheer scale and reputation of BlackRock suggest a long-term, strategic approach rather than short-term speculation. Their commitment likely includes navigating these challenges with significant resources. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto The $78.3 million deposit from the BlackRock Ethereum ETF to Coinbase Prime is a landmark event. It transcends a simple transfer of funds. This action is a clear declaration that institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies is accelerating rapidly and moving from theory to practice. For Ethereum, it marks the beginning of a new era of growth, stability, and integration with the global financial system. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the BlackRock Ethereum ETF (ETHA)? The BlackRock Ethereum ETF is a proposed spot exchange-traded fund that would allow investors to buy shares tracking the price of Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. It is awaiting final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Why did BlackRock send ETH to Coinbase Prime? Coinbase Prime is a platform for institutional clients. The deposit is widely seen as a move to secure custody and prepare liquidity for the ETF’s launch and subsequent trading activities, ensuring smooth operations for large investors. Is this good news for the price of Ethereum? Historically, the announcement and launch of major institutional investment products have been positive for the underlying asset’s price. This move signals strong demand and could attract more investment into Ethereum. How does this affect the average crypto investor? It increases legitimacy and stability in the market. For average investors, it means more regulated, accessible ways to gain exposure to Ethereum and potentially reduced extreme volatility as institutional capital enters. What is the difference between Coinbase and Coinbase Prime? Coinbase is the retail-facing exchange for individual investors. Coinbase Prime is a separate, white-glove service offering advanced trading, reporting, and security features tailored for hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Are other companies launching Ethereum ETFs? Yes, several other major financial firms, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest, have also filed for spot Ethereum ETFs, indicating a broad industry push for these products.

His new design aims to replace unpredictable costs with a system that lets users plan and budget more effectively, signaling one of the most significant shifts in Ethereum’s economic framework in years. Ethereum Gas Fees As Predictable, Prepaid Resources Buterin’s proposal centers on a new on-chain gas futures market. Today, gas fees rise and fall based on network congestion and users have no way to know in advance what they will pay, which complicates planning for developers, businesses, and high-volume platforms. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Performing As Expected; Analyst Reveals What Comes Next The new model reshapes that dynamic by allowing users to purchase a defined amount of gas at a fixed price for future use. Rather than hoping the network will be affordable at the moment they need to transact, they can lock in their costs in advance. This moves Ethereum from a system dominated by short-term fee volatility to one anchored in stable, forward-looking pricing Under the proposed design, these futures contracts would be traded directly on-chain. Their prices would naturally reflect expectations of future demand. When demand is expected to increase, futures prices rise; when expected to fall, they drop. This creates a transparent, market-driven view of upcoming network activity, giving developers and organizations a more reliable basis for planning their operations. The structure also builds on the foundation set by EIP-1559, which introduced the base fee mechanism. Buterin’s futures market doesn’t replace that system—it extends it. It transforms gas from reactive cost into a resource that can be managed in advance, similar to how businesses lock in costs for electricity, bandwidth, or other essential inputs. Operational Benefits For Developers, Businesses, And The Network The most immediate benefit is cost certainty. High-volume users—exchanges, rollups, wallets, and automation services—often operate on tight margins, and sudden gas fee spikes disrupt operations and planning. By locking in future gas costs, this uncertainty is removed, supporting consistent service delivery. Developers also gain a stable environment, enabling them to schedule upgrades, plan deployments, and manage workloads without worrying about fee surges. This predictability strengthens project roadmaps and enhances user experience. Related Reading: Are Dogecoin Whales Leaving The Meme Coin? Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows For enterprises integrating Ethereum into payments, verification, or data-processing workflows, predictable fees are essential. Buterin’s model addresses this barrier, positioning Ethereum as a more reliable foundation for long-term, large-scale adoption. At the network level, the futures market introduces clearer economic signals. Rising futures prices indicate increasing demand for blockspace, guiding scaling decisions and resource allocation. Falling prices signal lower demand, enabling more efficient development and infrastructure planning. The proposal does not lower gas fees but makes them manageable, converting an unstable cost into a predictable one. This enhances Ethereum’s appeal for serious applications, institutional activity, and reliable operational planning. By introducing a gas futures mechanism, the ecosystem can better manage costs and prepare for growth, marking a decisive step toward a more professional-grade Ethereum.

This comes over a year after Elon Musk revealed that Tesla would accept DOGE as a payment option at some point. Dogecoin Payments May Be Imminent As Tesla Updates Backend Code In an X post , DogeMemeGirl revealed that Tesla is upgrading its Dogecoin integration as the new backend code shows a “massive” shift from the old setup. She explained that the old code was basic and dormant, restricted to Tesla’s merchandise only. Meanwhile, the code provides a significant upgrade and hints at DOGE payments for Tesla cars. The community member revealed that the new code is woven deep into vehicle checkout for the Tesla Model 3 and the Cybertruck. It also includes hidden “order with Dogecoin” buttons that indicate the Dogecoin payments integration . Lastly, DogeMemeGirl stated that the new code features real-time price conversion and dynamic error handling. She also hinted that Dogecoin is likely to be the only crypto that will be accepted by Elon Musk’s Tesla in the meantime. This came as DogeMemeGirl stated that the Bitcoin references have been scrubbed in the new code, while DOGE remains. The community member noted that it is still disabled, but that the infrastructure to buy a Tesla with DOGE is actively being built. Tesla’s potential integration of Dogecoin payments could provide a huge boost for the foremost meme coin, expanding its utility and likely leading to more adoption for DOGE. Notably, Musk stated last year that his car company would begin accepting DOGE payments for car purchases at some point. Tesla already accepts the meme coin for some of its merchandise. DOGE Integration In X Payments? This development of the Tesla Dogecoin payments integration comes amid speculations that Elon Musk’s X could also integrate the meme coin into ‘X Payments.’ Musk stated last month that X payments is coming soon, with the possibility that it will still launch this year, as earlier announced by the then-CEO Linda Yaccarino. DOGE community members, including famous crypto pundit Kevin Capital, have speculated that Musk will integrate DOGE in X payments, which would boost the meme coin’s adoption. Kevin indicated that a potential integration could also significantly impact the DOGE price. In the meantime, the meme coin just received another major boost as Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires, reportedly passed a law allowing its citizens to pay taxes in DOGE. Dogecoin’s official X platform drew attention to this development just as the meme coin celebrated its 12th anniversary, having launched in 2013. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.14, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|Coinmarketcap|Cybertruck|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin payments|dogecoin price|DogeMemeGirl|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elon Musk|Kevin Capital|Linda Yaccarino|meme coin|Tesla,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-08 12:00:27

Many observers still view Ripple as a simple payments company. That assumption overlooks a broader transformation now taking shape across institutional infrastructure. X Finance Bull captures this shift, noting that Ripple is assembling a complete financial stack. Their observation highlights a growing reality. Ripple is building rails that handle real liquidity, real settlement, and real institutional flows. A Broader Institutional Architecture Ripple is no longer focused on single-purpose products. The company now builds layered infrastructure serving banks, fintechs, and market operators. XRP sits at the center of this framework . The token enables fast settlement across corridors without pre-funded accounts. This model reduces friction and improves capital efficiency for enterprise users. Most people still think Ripple is “just payments.” What they’ve missed is a complete financial stack quietly forming beneath their feet. Ripple isn’t building hype. It’s building financial rails and $XRP is the engine under all of it. Payments Custody Stablecoin … pic.twitter.com/HwqdNP4qtw — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) December 7, 2025 Payments as the Entry Point Ripple began with cross-border payments, but the vision has expanded. The payment layer now serves as a gateway to deeper financial services. On-Demand Liquidity provides instant settlement using XRP. The system operates even when market liquidity is thin. Ripple has strengthened this layer with compliance tools built for regulated institutions. Custody and Controlled Asset Flows Institutional adoption requires secure asset storage. Ripple has entered this space through regulated custody services. These services support tokenized assets, stablecoins, and enterprise accounts. Smart Escrows on the XRP Ledger add automation . They enable conditional settlement without external smart contracts. This gives banks new ways to manage controlled asset flows. RLUSD and the Stablecoin Layer Ripple launched RLUSD as a fully regulated dollar stablecoin. The asset offers predictable value and strong compliance oversight. RLUSD provides a trusted settlement unit for banks and treasuries. It also integrates directly with XRP-based liquidity channels. This connection strengthens liquidity efficiency across the entire stack. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Prime Brokerage and Market Access Ripple is also expanding into prime brokerage functions . These services include liquidity access, clearing, and institutional credit channels. Institutions can now execute, settle, and custody assets within the same ecosystem. This unified design reduces operational risk and accelerates transaction finality. Institutions Drive Utility, Not Hype XRP’s value proposition becomes stronger as more institutions depend on these rails. Demand grows from utility, not speculation. Settlement flows create recurring usage patterns. Banks and treasuries need speed, predictability, and compliance. Ripple’s infrastructure offers exactly that. As adoption increases, XRP becomes a core settlement engine rather than a speculative asset. A Financial System Under Reconstruction Ripple is not chasing trends or temporary liquidity cycles. It is building the digital foundation for future financial operations. The company aims to rearchitect how money moves across borders, markets, and accounts. This shift signals a new phase in blockchain finance. The winners will be the systems with real usage and real institutional trust. Ripple’s approach is clear. Build the rails. Strengthen the flows. Let utility drive demand. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

He Gave Four Reasons!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/a-former-bitcoin-supporter-sold-his-btc-and-invested-all-his-money-in-this-altcoin-he-gave-four-reasons/,"A pseudonymous investor, one of the earliest Bitcoin (BTC) supporters, made the bold decision to sell all his BTC holdings. Accordingly, an investor and market commentator with the nickname Crypto X AiMan announced that he sold Bitcoins he bought for around $3,000. The investor, who invested all the BTC he sold in XRP, explained four reasons why he made this bold decision. “I just sold all my Bitcoin and invested 100% in XRP.” Listing the reasons for this decision, the investor with the nickname AiMan first cited XRP being the only cryptocurrency with legal clarity in the US. Stating that Ripple and XRP won the SEC case, the investor stated that the court decision proved that XRP is not a security. The second reason is that Ripple holds approximately 40 billion XRP and has partnered with over 300 banks, central banks, and payment giants as they prepare for the ISO 20022 global reset in 2026. Thirdly, the investor pointed out a critical difference between Bitcoin and XRP, saying that Bitcoin, which many people see as digital gold, continues to be slow and expensive to move. At this point, the investor described XRP as a digital dollar because it facilitates cross-border payments, arguing that XRP is fast and cheap, and that people actually use it for its intended purpose. “BTC = digital gold (limited, slow, expensive) XRP = digital dollar for cross-border payments (fast, cheap, actually used)” Fourth, he highlighted XRP's potential. The investor acknowledged that Bitcoin, with a current market capitalization of approximately $2 trillion, has a much higher value than XRP. However, he emphasized that the cross-border payments market, which XRP is attempting to dominate, has a volume of $250 trillion, and that it has the potential to surpass BTC. Stating that there were reactions against this decision, the investor said that people laughed at him when he bought Bitcoin at $3,000, but he made huge profits. “…..What if I'm wrong? XRP will probably go to zero and I'll lose everything. If I'm right? I'll be laughing in my Lamborghini while you wait 7 seconds for Bitcoin confirmation. People laughed at me for buying $3,000 worth of Bitcoin. They're laughing at me now. But they won't be laughing for long. Negative side: maybe zero Positive side: a fortune that will change your life” *This is not investment advice.

The platform announced that Binance Alpha adds STABLE to its specialized on-chain trading environment. This development signals a focused expansion of opportunities within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. For traders looking to discover promising projects before they hit mainstream exchanges, this addition is a game-changer. What Does It Mean When Binance Alpha Adds STABLE? Binance Alpha serves as a curated gateway within the Binance Wallet, specifically designed for on-chain trading of early-stage digital assets. The decision that Binance Alpha adds STABLE means this particular token is now accessible for trading in this exclusive environment.

Despite drifting higher from its recent lows, BTC remains trapped in a tight $84,000–$91,000 range while the S&P 500 sits near record highs, underscoring deepening relative weakness and a widening decoupling from traditional risk assets. On-chain data shows more than seven million BTC sitting at an unrealised loss, mirroring conditions last seen during the choppy consolidation of early 2022 and emphasizing the market’s struggle to reclaim its True Market Mean , the dividing line between mid-cycle fatigue and full bear-market deterioration. Yet capital inflows remain modestly positive , offering at least a thin buffer against any further downside. At the same time, spot-side demand has meaningfully eroded: US Bitcoin ETFs have logged persistent outflows, taker buying has deteriorated significantly, and Cumulative Volume Delta across major exchanges has turned decisively negative, signalling traders are selling into strength rather than accumulating. The latest economic data signals a US economy still advancing but much more slowly, with slowing consumer spending, persistent inflation, and signs of strain emerging. Real consumer spending was flat in September, with incomes barely keeping up with prices, highlighting financial strain for lower- and middle-income households and signalling a softer fourth quarter. Inflation remained stubborn at 2.8 percent year-over-year, complicating expectations for a widely anticipated December rate cut, especially as Fed officials remain divided over whether the economy has cooled enough to justify easing. Meanwhile, labour and business indicators reveal a similarly uneven landscape. Private-sector hiring unexpectedly fell in November , led by small-business job losses, even as jobless claims dropped to their lowest level since 2022, showing employers are hesitant to cut staff. The services sector continued to expand, with stronger demand and rising backlogs, though hiring within the sector contracted and prices remained elevated. Together, the data suggest an economy that is cooling unevenly—supported by resilient services and stable employment—but increasingly vulnerable as persistent inflation erodes household strength and weighs on growth heading into the Fed’s next policy decision. In the news, Vanguard, long known for rejecting cryptocurrencies as too speculative, has reversed its stance by allowing clients to trade third-party crypto ETFs and mutual funds, including those tied to Bitcoin and Ethereum. While it still does not plan to offer its own crypto products, and says explicitly that it will not endorse any investment allocation to meme coins, the decision reflects growing confidence in the maturity of crypto markets as well as strong investor demand. Governments too are updating their view of the crypto industry, with the UK passing the Property (Digital Assets etc.) Act 2025 , which recognises cryptocurrencies as a distinct form of personal property. This reform offers clearer rights in cases of theft, insolvency, and inheritance, and is viewed as a crucial step toward making the UK a more attractive environment for digital-asset businesses. In the United States, regulators are also moving forward: the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has authorised the first-ever listing of spot cryptocurrency products on federally regulated exchanges, aiming to provide a safer, regulated alternative to offshore markets. Collectively, these developments reflect a global trend toward integrating digital assets into established financial and legal systems, expanding access, protection, and legitimacy for crypto markets.

To this end, on-chain data indicates that multiple high-performing Ethereum wallets, known to track smart institutional-level capital, have entered significant long positions, pointing to renewed confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency. Data shows that select whale wallets have collectively accumulated more than 136,000 ETH, with exposure exceeding half a billion dollars. One large wallet now holds over $169 million worth of ETH in long positions, while another has added around $194 million, with a third wallet entering with more than $62 million, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on December 8. Ethereum whale transaction. Source: Lookonchain This renewed appetite aligns with a broader market recovery, with Ethereum supported by recent scalability upgrades aimed at lowering fees and boosting Layer-2 throughput. The asset has held above the key $3,000 level, underscoring resilience during recent market weakness. Notably, whale accumulation signals expectations of medium-term price gains and confidence that the recent downturn has largely passed. Historically, when these positions hold, liquidity tends to follow, driven by retail and leveraged traders reacting to whale flows. At the same time, easing macro pressure has further supported this trend, as lower rate expectations and improving liquidity sentiment bolster risk assets. ETH has remained in a stable trading range, with forecasts pointing to potential upside if momentum persists. Risks of ETH price collapse However, separate flows indicate potential supply risks ahead. In this case, BlackRock on December 8 deposited a combined 24,791 ETH, worth approximately $78.3 million, to Coinbase Prime, suggesting the assets are now positioned on an exchange where a sell execution is possible.

The price is attempting to push through a clean trendline that has capped every rally since early October. Momentum is improving, but buyers still need a decisive break above the $3,500 area to shift the structure. Until then, every move higher remains vulnerable to rejection. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, ETH continues to respect the descending trendline while still trading well below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, located around the $3,600 mark. This keeps the broader bias bearish, even though the price is slowly recovering from the capitulation low around 2.7k. The critical region remains $3,400-$3,500, where a key Fair Value Gap and bearish order block sit. If ETH can break and close above that level, it could signal a move toward the $4,000 zone. Support levels remain cleaner. The $2,900 short-term level held multiple times, and below that, $2,500 and $2,200 areas are the strong demand zones. As long as ETH stays above $2,900, buyers have a base to work with, but they still need a new higher high to confirm trend reversal. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart shows ETH pushing into the descending trendline again after defending the $2,900 zone. This range is clearly acting as short-term support, but buyers haven’t shown enough strength to reclaim the $3,200 recent high. The RSI is also mid-range, showing no exhaustion, but also no strong momentum. A rejection here sends ETH back toward $2,900 for another test. A clean breakout above $3,200, followed by a retest, would be the first real sign of bullish continuation. Without that, ETH simply remains stuck under trendline compression, and the risk of another liquidity grab to the downside stays open. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis Open Interest Open Interest has been declining since September, while the price has also pulled back from the highs, indicating clear risk-off behavior. The most important part is that OI has not expanded during this recent bounce. That usually signals a lack of aggressive long positioning. Traders are cautious, not chasing the move, and still unwinding positions from the earlier rally. This kind of sentiment can actually fuel a stronger breakout later, because rallies that begin on low leverage tend to be healthier. But for now, it shows that the market doesn’t fully trust the upside. A quick spike in OI during a trendline breakout would confirm real participation returning. Until then, ETH remains in a neutral-to-cautious sentiment phase.

Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, detected a seismic event: the Tether Treasury minted a staggering 1,000 million USDT . That’s one billion dollars in the world’s largest stablecoin, freshly created. But what does this massive USDT minted event truly signal for the market, and more importantly, for your portfolio? Let’s dive beneath the surface. What Does It Mean When USDT Is Minted? First, let’s demystify the process. When we say USDT is minted , it means Tether Limited has created new tokens on the blockchain. Think of it like a digital printing press, but with a crucial backing promise. For every new USDT token, Tether claims to hold an equivalent reserve in assets, typically a mix of cash, cash equivalents, and other holdings. This recent USDT minted transaction is not coins moving between wallets; it’s an increase in the total supply, authorized from Tether’s treasury address. Why Would Tether Mint 1,000 Million USDT? Such a colossal mint doesn’t happen without reason. It’s a direct response to market forces. Primarily, Tether mints new tokens to meet soaring demand on cryptocurrency exchanges. Therefore, this USDT minted event suggests: Anticipated Buying Pressure: Exchanges request more USDT when traders are preparing to buy other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Liquidity Injection: It adds vast liquidity to the crypto ecosystem, smoothing large trades and potentially reducing volatility. Market Confidence Signal: Large institutions or investors may be positioning for major moves, requiring massive stablecoin reserves. Historically, significant USDT minted events have often preceded notable rallies, as the new liquidity finds its way into the market. The Ripple Effect: How a Billion USDT Impacts Crypto This isn’t just a number on a screen. The injection of 1,000 million USDT minted sends waves across the entire digital asset ocean. For you, the investor, it means several things. Firstly, increased liquidity can lead to more stable prices for altcoins during large transactions. Moreover, it often acts as a precursor to increased trading volume. However, it’s essential to watch where this capital flows. Does it sit on exchanges, or does it actively purchase assets? Tracking this can offer clues about market sentiment. Should You Be Concerned About Stablecoin Supply? With great supply comes great scrutiny. The perpetual growth of Tether’s market cap leads to valid questions. Is the demand organic? Are the reserves fully verified? While Tether publishes quarterly attestations, critics argue for more transparent, real-time audits. As a savvy participant, understanding that stablecoins are the lifeblood of crypto trading is key. This USDT minted operation underscores their central role but also highlights the importance of regulatory evolution and transparency for long-term ecosystem health. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Trader So, what can you do with this information? Don’t just watch—analyze. Use this USDT minted event as one piece of a larger puzzle. Monitor exchange order books for increased bid stacks on major pairs. Check if the stablecoin is being distributed to other exchanges, which signals broader demand. Remember, correlation isn’t causation. Use it alongside other fundamental and technical indicators to inform your strategy, not dictate it. In conclusion, the minting of 1,000 million USDT is a powerful market mechanic in action. It reflects anticipated demand, injects critical liquidity, and serves as a key barometer for institutional and retail sentiment. While not a guaranteed bull signal, it is a significant event that underscores the growing infrastructure and capital flows within cryptocurrency. By understanding why USDT is minted , you move from being a spectator to an informed participant in the digital economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does minting new USDT cause inflation in crypto? A: Not directly like fiat printing. New USDT is minted to meet demand on exchanges and is supposed to be backed 1:1 by reserves. It increases liquidity but doesn’t devalue other cryptocurrencies by itself. Q2: Where can I track these USDT minting events? A: You can follow blockchain tracking services like Whale Alert on social media platforms like Twitter (X) or use blockchain explorers to monitor Tether’s treasury address directly. Q3: Is all minted USDT immediately in circulation? A: Not always. Newly minted USDT often goes to Tether’s treasury and is then authorized for distribution to exchanges as needed. There can be a delay between minting and active market circulation. Q4: Could this large mint be bad for the market? A: If the minting is not based on genuine demand or if reserve backing is insufficient, it could pose systemic risks. However, in normal market function, it is a standard response to liquidity needs. Q5: How does this affect Bitcoin’s price? A: Historically, large USDT mints have correlated with increased Bitcoin buying pressure, as traders use USDT as the primary pair to purchase BTC. It can be a precursor to positive price movement, though not a guarantee. Q6: What’s the difference between minting and printing money? A: “Printing money” typically refers to central banks creating fiat currency, which can lead to inflation. “Minting” USDT is a blockchain operation to create a digital token that is supposed to be fully backed by existing assets.

The employees reportedly used insider information to post on social media for potential gains. Binance suspended a group of employees after an internal audit. The group of employees of Binance Futures reportedly used their access to insider information for potential personal gains. “ On December 7, 2025, Binance’s internal audit department received a relevant report alleging that Binance employees were suspected of using insider information to post on official social media accounts for improper gains. In response, the platform immediately initiated a comprehensive investigation,” announced the exchange team. This is the second employee incident since March 2025, when Binance discovered an incident with insider trading, as Cryptopolitan reported . This time, another whistleblower noticed the short time between the on-chain launch of a new token and the social media posting by the Binance Futures X handle. The recent incident was also linked to community reports. Binance Futures relies on its official whistleblower platform, calling for community support to discover discrepancies and potential insider trading. Binance Futures paid a previously agreed $100K whistleblower fee. Binance insider used early information on token launch The Binance Futures insider incident was related to a token that was just launched at 05:29 UTC on December 7. Less than a minute later, the Binance employee used the text and images related to the token to post through the Binance Futures account. Any mention from Binance’s handles has the potential to cause a token rally, even for brand-new assets. These actions were therefore seen as an abuse of the employee’s position for personal gain. At this point, Binance has not confirmed that the token was launched by the employee. The social media posting had no connections to previous Binance Futures plan of creating or listing a token. Insider may have launched new token deliberately Despite the suspension, Binance has limited options to affect the launched crypto asset. The token, Year of Yellow Fruit, continued to trade and gained decentralized liquidity, reaching a $5M market capitalization. The token launched by a Binance employee, Year of Yellow Fruit, went viral and had an even bigger rally after the news. On-chain data shows the token developer made minimal gains. | Source: DEX Screener The leading whale extracted $55.6K from the market after the token pumped twice. The newly launched asset had an even larger pump after being connected to a Binance insider. The token only has $278K in liquidity so far, while rallying from $0.000023 to $0.0006. The token was bought by around 2,300 holders. There are currently few signs of insider sniping or connected wallets. As with other early-stage memes, Year of Yellow Fruit may trade as an extremely volatile asset. The token’s launch may still gain enough meme potential to support volumes and liquidity for a while. The token was also immediately intercepted by AI-powered launch bots , bringing more liquidity even without the social media posting. The token was intercepted as early as December 7 and was hyped up precisely because of the insider trading incident. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This latest acquisition, worth nearly $1 billion, sends a powerful message to the market and solidifies the company’s position as the world’s leading corporate holder of digital assets. Let’s unpack the details and explore what this means for the future of institutional cryptocurrency adoption. What Does This Latest MicroStrategy Bitcoin Purchase Entail? Last week, MicroStrategy announced it spent $962.7 million to buy 10,624 Bitcoin. The company paid an average price of $90,615 per coin. This strategic move increases their total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 660,624 BTC. Importantly, their average purchase price across all acquisitions now stands at $74,696. This demonstrates a disciplined, long-term accumulation strategy, often buying during both market highs and lows. This purchase is significant for several reasons. First, it shows continued confidence from MicroStrategy’s leadership, particularly Chairman Michael Saylor. Second, it represents a substantial capital deployment at a price point above the current average cost basis, indicating a belief in future appreciation. Finally, it highlights the company’s unique corporate strategy of using Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Why Is MicroStrategy Betting So Heavily on Bitcoin? MicroStrategy’s strategy is not a short-term trade; it’s a fundamental shift in corporate treasury management. The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies or bonds. Their rationale centers on Bitcoin’s predictable, scarce supply and its potential to act as a hedge against inflation. Inflation Hedge: With central banks printing currency, Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it digitally scarce. Corporate Strategy: They are pivoting from a traditional business intelligence model to a technology and Bitcoin development company. Long-Term Conviction: The repeated purchases, regardless of price volatility, show a multi-year horizon. Therefore, each MicroStrategy Bitcoin purchase is a building block in this overarching vision. The company is effectively converting its cash and debt-raising capabilities into what it calls “digital gold.” This approach has attracted both praise and criticism, but it remains a landmark case study in corporate crypto adoption. What Are the Challenges and Market Reactions? While bold, this strategy is not without risks. The primary challenge is Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. The value of MicroStrategy’s holdings can swing dramatically, impacting its balance sheet and stock price (MSTR). Furthermore, the company has taken on debt to fund some purchases, adding financial leverage to an already volatile asset. Market reactions have been mixed. Bitcoin advocates hail MicroStrategy as a pioneer. However, some traditional investors express concern over the concentration risk. The company’s stock has become a high-beta proxy for Bitcoin itself, meaning it often amplifies Bitcoin’s price movements. This latest MicroStrategy Bitcoin purchase likely aims to signal stability and long-term planning to its shareholders and the broader market. Actionable Insights for Investors and Observers What can we learn from MicroStrategy’s relentless accumulation? For institutional investors, it provides a blueprint for treasury diversification. For retail investors, it underscores the importance of conviction and a long-term mindset in the crypto space. Monitoring MicroStrategy’s actions offers valuable signals about sophisticated market sentiment towards Bitcoin. In conclusion, MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition of 10,624 Bitcoin is more than just a large trade; it’s a statement of principle. It reinforces the company’s commitment to its Bitcoin-centric strategy and continues to push the boundaries of corporate finance. As the largest corporate holder, their actions will be closely watched as a bellwether for institutional adoption. The monumental scale of this MicroStrategy Bitcoin purchase cements their role as a defining player in the convergence of traditional business and the digital asset economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own now? A1: Following this latest purchase, MicroStrategy now holds 660,624 Bitcoin. Q2: What was the average price MicroStrategy paid in this latest buy? A2: The company paid an average price of $90,615 per Bitcoin for the 10,624 coins acquired last week. Q3: Why does MicroStrategy keep buying Bitcoin? A3: The company’s leadership views Bitcoin as a superior long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation, making it their primary treasury reserve asset. Q4: Does this purchase affect the price of Bitcoin? A4: Large, public purchases like this can influence market sentiment and contribute to buying pressure, though many other factors also drive Bitcoin’s price. Q5: What are the risks of MicroStrategy’s strategy? A5: The main risks are Bitcoin’s price volatility impacting their balance sheet and the financial leverage from using debt to fund some purchases. Q6: Can other companies follow this strategy? A6: Yes, and some have, but it requires a high-risk tolerance and a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term thesis.

Robinhood, the popular trading platform, has officially launched its ETH and SOL staking service for users in New York. This move signals a significant expansion of accessible crypto-earning tools for everyday investors. According to a report by Decrypt, this is just the beginning, with nationwide expansion on the horizon pending regulatory green lights. But what does this new service actually offer, and why is it such a big deal? Let’s break it down. What Does Robinhood’s New Staking Service Offer? For the uninitiated, staking is a way to earn rewards on your cryptocurrency holdings, similar to earning interest in a savings account. By participating in the network’s operations, you help secure the blockchain. Now, Robinhood ETH SOL staking brings this capability directly to its user-friendly app. New York residents can stake their Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) directly, simplifying a process that was often technical and daunting for newcomers. This integration is a powerful step toward mainstream adoption, making advanced crypto functions as easy as a few taps on your phone. Why is the New York Launch So Important? New York is known for its stringent financial regulations, particularly the BitLicense. Gaining approval here is no small feat and is often seen as a major regulatory hurdle. Therefore, Robinhood’s successful launch of ETH and SOL staking in this market is a strong vote of confidence. It suggests the company has navigated complex compliance waters. This successful entry sets a precedent and paves the way for the planned rollout across the United States. For investors elsewhere, this is a promising sign that the service will soon be at their fingertips. What Other Upgrades is Robinhood Rolling Out? The staking news is part of a broader suite of enhancements Robinhood is introducing. The platform isn’t just adding features; it’s refining the entire trading experience. Key updates include: A Revamped Fee Structure: Specifically tailored for U.S. high-frequency traders, making active trading more cost-effective. An Improved Crypto Trading API: This provides developers and advanced traders with better tools and more reliable integration for automated strategies. Simplified Tax Reporting: A major pain point for crypto users is addressed with tools designed to make calculating and reporting taxes clearer and less stressful. These improvements show Robinhood’s commitment to serving both casual investors and serious traders, creating a more robust financial ecosystem. What Are the Challenges and Considerations? While the launch is exciting, it’s crucial to approach Robinhood ETH SOL staking with a clear understanding. Staking typically involves “locking” your crypto for a period, which means it may not be instantly available for trading. Users must consider the trade-off between potential rewards and liquidity. Furthermore, staking rewards are not guaranteed and can fluctuate based on network conditions. As always, conducting your own research and understanding the specific terms Robinhood offers is essential before committing your assets. What’s the Future of Crypto Staking on Robinhood? The announcement clearly states that nationwide availability is the goal, contingent on regulatory approvals. This phased approach is prudent. If the New York launch proves successful and stable, we can likely expect a gradual expansion to other states. This could potentially include support for staking other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies in the future, further solidifying Robinhood’s position as a one-stop shop for retail crypto finance. Conclusion: A Simplified Path to Crypto Rewards Robinhood’s launch of ETH and SOL staking in New York is a transformative development. It demystifies a key wealth-building aspect of the crypto world and places it into the hands of millions of everyday users. By combining this with a better API, clearer fees, and simpler taxes, Robinhood is building a compelling, all-in-one platform. The New York launch is the first domino to fall; its success will likely trigger a wave of accessibility across the country, bringing crypto staking into the financial mainstream. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who is eligible for Robinhood’s ETH and SOL staking right now? A: Currently, only customers with a Robinhood Crypto account who are residents of New York state can access the staking service for these assets. Q: When will Robinhood staking be available in my state? A: Robinhood has announced plans to expand the service nationwide but has not provided a specific timeline. The expansion is pending regulatory approval in each state. Q: Are staking rewards on Robinhood guaranteed? A: No, staking rewards are not guaranteed. They are variable and depend on the network’s performance and participation rates. Robinhood will display the current estimated reward rate. Q: Can I unstake my crypto at any time? A: Staking often involves an unbonding or lock-up period. You will need to check Robinhood’s specific staking terms to understand how long it takes to withdraw your staked ETH or SOL and make it tradable again. Q: Does staking affect my crypto taxes? A: Yes, in the United States, staking rewards are generally considered taxable income at the fair market value when you receive them. Robinhood’s new simplified tax reporting tools are designed to help with this. Q: What other cryptocurrencies might Robinhood add for staking? A: While not confirmed, it is logical to expect Robinhood may expand staking support to other major proof-of-stake networks like Cardano (ADA) or Polkadot (DOT) in the future, depending on demand and regulatory clarity.

Binance has just made a strategic move that could unlock new opportunities for savvy traders. The exchange giant announced that Binance Alpha adds WET to its specialized on-chain trading platform. This development represents more than just another listing—it’s a gateway to discovering promising projects in their infancy. What Does It Mean When Binance Alpha Adds WET? When Binance Alpha adds WET , it signals confidence in this emerging token’s potential. Binance Alpha operates as a distinct platform within the Binance Wallet ecosystem, specifically designed for on-chain trading of early-stage digital assets. Unlike main exchange listings that typically feature established cryptocurrencies, Alpha focuses on discovering gems before they gain mainstream attention. The platform serves as a curated discovery zone where users can access tokens that haven’t yet reached Binance’s primary trading venues. This approach allows traders to participate in projects during their formative stages, potentially capturing value before wider market recognition. Why Should Traders Care About This Addition? The announcement that Binance Alpha adds WET matters for several practical reasons. First, it provides legitimate exposure for the WET token through a trusted platform. Second, it offers traders early access that wasn’t previously available through conventional Binance channels. Third, it demonstrates Binance’s ongoing commitment to expanding its ecosystem beyond mainstream cryptocurrencies. Consider these key benefits for traders: Early discovery : Access tokens before they potentially list on larger exchanges Reduced barriers : Trade directly through the Binance Wallet interface Curated selection : Benefit from Binance’s vetting process for early-stage projects On-chain transparency : All transactions occur directly on the blockchain How Does Binance Alpha Work for Early-Stage Coins? Binance Alpha functions as a specialized marketplace within the broader Binance ecosystem. The platform’s primary mission is identifying and listing promising early-stage coins that show potential for growth. When Binance Alpha adds WET , it follows an evaluation process that considers factors like project fundamentals, team credibility, technological innovation, and community engagement. The platform operates on-chain, meaning all trades execute directly through blockchain transactions rather than traditional order books. This approach offers several advantages, including greater transparency, reduced counterparty risk, and alignment with decentralized finance principles. However, traders should remember that early-stage investments inherently carry higher volatility and risk compared to established cryptocurrencies. What Challenges Come With Early-Stage Trading? While the news that Binance Alpha adds WET presents exciting opportunities, it’s crucial to understand the associated challenges. Early-stage tokens typically experience higher price volatility, lower liquidity, and greater information asymmetry compared to established cryptocurrencies. These factors can lead to rapid price swings in both directions. Traders should approach such opportunities with careful consideration: Conduct independent research beyond platform listings Allocate only risk capital you can afford to lose Understand the specific tokenomics of each project Monitor trading volumes and liquidity conditions Remember that while Binance’s curation provides a layer of vetting, it doesn’t eliminate investment risk. The platform’s focus on early-stage coins means projects are still developing and face uncertain futures. Actionable Insights for Navigating Binance Alpha Now that Binance Alpha adds WET to its platform, traders need practical strategies to navigate this opportunity effectively. First, familiarize yourself with the Binance Wallet interface if you haven’t used it previously. The wallet serves as your gateway to the Alpha platform and requires proper setup and security measures. Second, develop a research framework for evaluating early-stage projects. Look beyond surface-level information and examine: Project whitepapers and roadmaps Team backgrounds and previous experience Token utility within the ecosystem Community engagement and development activity Third, implement risk management strategies appropriate for high-volatility assets. Consider position sizing, entry and exit plans, and portfolio diversification. The excitement surrounding new listings can sometimes cloud judgment, so maintaining disciplined trading practices becomes especially important. The Bigger Picture: Binance’s Evolving Ecosystem The decision that Binance Alpha adds WET reflects broader trends in cryptocurrency exchange development. Major platforms increasingly recognize the value of serving diverse trader needs across different investment stages. By offering specialized venues like Alpha alongside traditional spot and futures markets, Binance creates a more comprehensive ecosystem. This approach benefits multiple stakeholders. Projects gain exposure through reputable channels, traders access diversified opportunities, and the exchange strengthens its position as a full-service cryptocurrency destination. As the market matures, we can expect further specialization within trading platforms, with dedicated spaces for different asset classes, risk profiles, and investment horizons. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward The announcement that Binance Alpha adds WET represents a strategic development for both the exchange and cryptocurrency traders. It expands access to early-stage investment opportunities while maintaining the security and reliability associated with the Binance ecosystem. For traders, it offers a curated pathway to discover emerging tokens before they potentially achieve broader recognition. However, this opportunity comes with important caveats. Early-stage trading requires careful research, risk management, and realistic expectations. The potential for significant returns exists alongside substantial volatility and uncertainty. As always in cryptocurrency markets, education and caution should accompany enthusiasm for new opportunities. The evolution of platforms like Binance Alpha demonstrates how cryptocurrency exchanges are adapting to serve increasingly sophisticated trader needs. By providing specialized venues for different investment approaches, they’re helping shape a more mature and diversified digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions What is Binance Alpha? Binance Alpha is an on-chain trading platform within the Binance Wallet that focuses on listing early-stage coins. It allows users to trade emerging tokens before they potentially list on Binance’s main exchange. How can I access Binance Alpha? You can access Binance Alpha through the Binance Wallet. First, download and set up the Binance Wallet, then navigate to the Alpha platform section within the wallet interface. Is trading on Binance Alpha riskier than regular Binance trading? Yes, trading early-stage coins typically involves higher risk due to greater volatility, lower liquidity, and less established track records compared to tokens on the main exchange. What does it mean when Binance Alpha lists a new token like WET? When Binance Alpha lists a token, it means the platform’s curators have identified it as a promising early-stage project worthy of exposure to their user base, though this doesn’t guarantee future success. Can I transfer tokens from Binance Alpha to my regular Binance account? Yes, since Binance Alpha operates on-chain, you can transfer tokens to any compatible wallet address, including your regular Binance account, subject to network fees and compatibility.

Top Stock Picks From Seeking Alpha's New Analysts The Academic Investor | Galaxy Digital: The Data Center Company Hiding In A Bitcoin Stock Biography: “I focus on thematic investing at the intersection of artificial intelligence infrastructure, digital assets, and geopolitical trends. My academic training in computer science gives me an edge in evaluating complex technology companies, particularly those building the infrastructure layer for AI and blockchain ecosystems. On Seeking Alpha, I write primarily about overlooked opportunities in AI infrastructure and crypto-native financial services firms. I'm particularly interested in companies undergoing strategic pivots, sum-of-the-parts valuation opportunities, and situations where the market fails to recognize business model transformations. "" Strong Buy | “While investors trade Galaxy Digital ( GLXY ) ( GLXY:CA ) like it's leveraged Bitcoin, Galaxy is quietly executing one of the most compelling infrastructure buildouts in the AI data center space. The company's Helios campus in West Texas, with the contracted $1 billion in annual revenue, represents a fundamental business transformation that the market has completely mispriced. This isn't a pivot story or speculative repositioning. Galaxy has secured $1.4 billion in non-recourse financing, gained regulatory approval for an 800MW data center, and locked in a 15-year lease with CoreWeave. Construction is well underway, with the first data hall set to power on in December and full delivery in H1 2026. For investors willing to look past the Bitcoin price noise and analyze the underlying businesses, Galaxy Digital represents one of the most compelling asymmetric opportunities in the market today. You're essentially buying an early-stage Digital Realty-style infrastructure business with a Goldman Sachs-quality digital asset management firm thrown in for free."" - Richard Doxtator | MoonLake: Ignore The Panic, Catch The Upside Biography: “A former broker, MBA, and CFA Charterholder, I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in financial research, investment advisory, and banking analytics. My research leverages macroeconomic trends, data science, and in-depth qualitative analysis to uncover actionable insights, distinctive risk/reward profiles, and market inefficiencies. I appreciate independent thought, encourage open debate, and frequently offer contrarian perspectives on stocks with contentious or misunderstood narratives. My mission is to create value for discerning investors by bridging analytical rigor and strategic foresight, focusing on the intersections of market psychology, valuation, and overlooked catalysts. ” Strong Buy | “ MoonLake Immunotherapeutics ( MLTX ) saw its shares collapse almost 90% after the September 29, 2025, release of Phase 3 VELA-1 and VELA-2 trial data. Investors reacted to VELA-2’s narrowly missed primary endpoint (p=0.053), driven by an unusually high placebo response, overlooking sonelokimab's (SLK) consistent 35%+ HiSCR75 rates and strong combined statistical significance. As a result, MLTX now trades at only 20% of its pre-readout value despite robust data and indications. In addition to the VELA-1 and 2 trials for HS, the company has ongoing trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of SLK in adolescents ages 12-17 with HS, palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The current valuation represents a market overreaction to statistical noise rather than any real setback to SLK’s clinical or regulatory prospects, positioning MoonLake as a compelling accumulation opportunity: upside is expected as additional data clears and uncertainty around the regulatory pathway dissipates.” - Holger Kujath | Kyverna Therapeutics: Immune Reset Is Clinically Validated, Market Ignores Potential Biography: “Holger is a Berlin-based technology founder and long-term investor, combining 20+ years of operational experience building companies with over 15 years in public markets. His research focuses on the secular AI infrastructure build-out and its ripple effects across the technology stack. Additionally, he hunts for asymmetric opportunities in small-cap biotech where innovative science meets compelling setups. His investment process is bottom-up and fundamentals-driven, emphasizing unit economics, gross-margin pools, capex cycles, silicon roadmaps, and ecosystem moats. ” Strong Buy | “ Kyverna Therapeutics ( KYTX ) just released data that could fundamentally de-risk its entire 'immune reset' platform. On October 29, interim Phase 2 data for its CAR-T therapy, KYV-101, showed revolutionary efficacy in severe myasthenia gravis (MG). The therapy didn't just meet endpoints; it doubled the efficacy of the current standard of care. In my view, the market has failed to price in this de-risking. At a current price of ~$7, Kyverna appears decoupled from this clinical success, offering a highly asymmetric risk-reward profile. I am initiating coverage with a Strong Buy and a $55 price target, based on a risk-adjusted valuation that, in light of this data, may still be conservative.

Indeed, their Bitcoin deployment strategy does not contribute meaningfully to their financials, as we will see later, and their recent moves towards AI / HPC, although promising, are still at the proof-of-concept stage. Then, regarding Bitcoin mining, the profitability of their operations is highly dependent on Bitcoin price fluctuations, which is a real risk for the company.

The institutional giant acquired a staggering 138,452 Ethereum (ETH), worth approximately $435 million. This single transaction underscores a powerful and ongoing trend of major capital flowing into digital assets. But what does it mean when a single entity makes such a colossal bet on Ethereum? Let’s unpack the details and explore the seismic implications of this purchase. Why Did Bitmine Purchase $435M in ETH Last Week? Bitmine’s latest acquisition is not an isolated event. It represents a strategic, long-term accumulation strategy. As of December 7th, the company’s total holdings now stand at a jaw-dropping 3,864,951 ETH, valued at over $12 billion. This consistent buying signals deep conviction in Ethereum’s future value proposition beyond short-term price fluctuations. The decision likely stems from several key factors: Confidence in the Ethereum Network: The successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (The Merge) has made Ethereum more scalable and environmentally sustainable, enhancing its appeal to large institutions. Hedging Against Inflation: Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is increasingly viewed as a digital store of value and a hedge against traditional market volatility and currency devaluation. Anticipation of Future Growth: Upcoming network upgrades aimed at improving scalability and reducing fees could significantly increase utility and demand. Therefore, when Bitmine purchased this massive amount of ETH, it wasn’t just buying a cryptocurrency; it was investing in a foundational blockchain platform it believes is critical to the future of finance and the internet. The Ripple Effect: How Major Buys Shape the Market When an institution like Bitmine purchased hundreds of millions in ETH, the impact extends far beyond its own balance sheet. Such actions create a powerful ripple effect throughout the entire crypto ecosystem. First, it reduces the available supply of ETH on the open market, which can create upward pressure on price if demand remains constant or increases. Second, it serves as a powerful signal to other institutional investors, validating Ethereum as a legitimate and serious asset class. This move can boost overall market sentiment and confidence. Retail and institutional investors alike watch these large transactions closely, often interpreting them as a vote of confidence from sophisticated players with significant resources and research capabilities. Consequently, the news that Bitmine purchased such a large stake can catalyze further investment and solidify Ethereum’s position as the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. What Are the Risks of Such Concentrated Holdings? While the headline is bullish, it’s crucial to consider the challenges. A central tenet of cryptocurrency is decentralization. When a single entity like Bitmine holds over 3.8 million ETH, it raises questions about network influence and centralization risk. Could such a large holder potentially impact network governance or decisions? Furthermore, the crypto market remains highly volatile. A strategic shift or a large sell-off from a major holder could introduce significant market instability. However, many analysts argue that institutional accumulation is a necessary phase for mainstream adoption. It brings liquidity, stability, and professional-grade custody solutions to the market. The key will be watching how these large holders participate in the ecosystem—whether as passive investors or active, engaged stakeholders in Ethereum’s decentralized future. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can the average investor learn from Bitmine’s mega-purchase? First, it highlights the importance of having a long-term perspective. Institutions are not day-trading; they are building strategic positions for the future. Second, it reinforces the need for fundamental research. Understanding why Bitmine purchased ETH—the technology, the roadmap, the use cases—is more important than just following the transaction itself. Diversify Wisely: Don’t put all your capital into a single asset, but consider core holdings in foundational protocols like Ethereum. Focus on Fundamentals: Look beyond the price chart to the technology, developer activity, and real-world adoption. Practice Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Ethereum The news that Bitmine purchased $435 million in ETH is a defining moment that underscores Ethereum’s maturation from a speculative tech experiment to a bedrock institutional asset. This colossal accumulation is a thunderous vote of confidence in the network’s long-term trajectory. While it introduces new dynamics around market concentration, the overwhelming signal is one of legitimacy and growth. For the crypto market, it’s a clear indicator that the era of institutional adoption is not coming—it’s already here, and it’s building its reserves in Ethereum. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How much ETH does Bitmine own now after this purchase? A1: Following last week’s purchase of 138,452 ETH, Bitmine’s total holdings have reached 3,864,951 Ethereum, worth approximately $12.04 billion as of December 7th. Q2: Why would a company like Bitmine buy so much Ethereum? A2: Bitmine likely views Ethereum as a long-term strategic asset. Reasons include confidence in its technology (especially post-Merge), its potential as a store of value, and its central role in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems. Q3: Does this large purchase make Ethereum more centralized? A3: It does increase concentration risk, as a single entity holds a significant amount of the total supply. This is a topic of debate, balancing the benefits of institutional adoption against the core principle of decentralization. Q4: Should I buy Ethereum because Bitmine did? A4: Never invest based solely on someone else’s actions. Bitmine’s purchase is a significant data point, but you should always conduct your own research, understand the risks, and ensure any investment aligns with your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Q5: Where does Bitmine store all this Ethereum? A5: While specific details are private, institutions of this size typically use a combination of ultra-secure, institutional-grade custody solutions, which often include multi-signature wallets, cold storage (offline), and insured custodial services. Q6: What does this mean for the future price of ETH? A6: Large purchases reduce circulating supply and can create bullish sentiment, potentially supporting price appreciation. However, cryptocurrency prices are influenced by countless factors, including broader market trends, regulation, and technological developments, so no single event guarantees a specific price outcome.

This frustrating scenario is all too common in online dating, where matches often stall before they even begin. Hinge’s new AI feature aims to solve this exact problem by providing users with intelligent conversation starters that move beyond boring small talk. As dating apps evolve, artificial intelligence is becoming an unexpected wingman for millions seeking genuine connections. How Hinge’s AI feature tackles dating app frustrations The core problem Hinge identified is simple but pervasive: too many matches never progress to actual conversations. Users frequently encounter profiles they like, but initiating dialogue can feel daunting. Many resort to generic openers like “Hey” or “How are you?” that rarely lead to meaningful exchanges. Hinge’s research revealed that 72% of daters are more likely to consider someone when a like includes a personalized message, and those who add comments are twice as likely to arrange dates. Convo Starters: Your AI-powered dating assistant Hinge’s Convo Starters feature represents a significant innovation in online dating technology. When users express interest in a profile, the AI analyzes that profile’s photos and prompts to generate three tailored conversation suggestions. The system looks for specific elements – hobbies shown in photos, unique prompt responses, travel destinations, or interests mentioned – then creates relevant opening lines that feel personal rather than generic. Profile Element AI-Generated Suggestion Photo playing chess “I see you’re into chess! What’s your favorite opening move?” Travel photo in Japan “Your Japan photos are amazing! What was your favorite experience there?” Prompt about favorite book “I noticed you mentioned [book title]. What did you think about the ending?” Photo with a dog “Your dog is adorable! What’s their name and personality like?” The technology behind Hinge’s online dating innovation Convo Starters builds on Hinge’s previous AI development, particularly their Prompt Feedback feature that helps users improve their profile content. The technology uses natural language processing and image recognition to understand profile elements and generate contextually relevant suggestions. This represents part of Match Group’s substantial investment in AI, with the parent company dedicating $20-30 million toward artificial intelligence initiatives across their dating platforms. Key benefits of AI-powered conversation starters: Reduces anxiety about sending the first message Saves time by providing ready-to-use suggestions Increases response rates through personalized openers Encourages deeper conversations from the beginning Builds user confidence in initiating contact User reactions and generational divides in dating apps While Hinge’s AI feature addresses a genuine need, it also highlights generational differences in comfort with artificial intelligence. A Bloomberg Intelligence survey found that Gen Z users feel more uneasy about using AI for dating-related tasks than older generations. Concerns typically center around authenticity – whether AI-assisted conversations feel genuine, and whether profiles enhanced by AI accurately represent real people. Match Group’s broader AI strategy for dating platforms Hinge’s parent company, Match Group, is making significant investments in artificial intelligence across their portfolio of dating apps. The $20-30 million commitment signals a strategic shift toward AI-enhanced dating experiences. This investment likely extends beyond conversation starters to include profile optimization, match suggestions, and safety features. As competition intensifies in the dating app market, AI differentiation becomes increasingly valuable. Practical implications for online dating success The introduction of Convo Starters changes how users approach initial interactions on dating apps. Rather than struggling to craft the perfect opening line, users can select from AI-generated suggestions that are specifically tailored to each profile. This doesn’t eliminate the need for genuine engagement – users still choose which suggestion to use and continue the conversation naturally – but it removes the initial barrier that often prevents connections from forming. Future developments in AI and dating apps Hinge’s Convo Starters feature represents just the beginning of AI integration in online dating. Future developments might include: Real-time conversation suggestions during chats AI-mediated icebreakers for mutual matches Profile compatibility analysis beyond basic algorithms Safety features that identify potentially problematic interactions Personalized date idea generation based on shared interests FAQs about Hinge’s AI feature and online dating How does Hinge’s Convo Starters AI feature work? The AI analyzes photos and prompts on user profiles to generate three personalized conversation starters when someone expresses interest. Is Match Group investing in other AI dating features? Yes, Match Group has committed $20-30 million to AI initiatives across their dating platforms, including profile optimization and safety features. Do users have to use the AI suggestions? No, the suggestions are optional. Users can choose to use them, modify them, or ignore them completely and write their own messages. How are younger users reacting to AI in dating apps? According to Bloomberg Intelligence surveys, Gen Z users express more discomfort with AI-assisted dating features than older generations. Can AI really improve online dating experiences? Early data suggests yes – Hinge reports that messages including personalized comments lead to twice as many dates, indicating that better conversation starters can significantly impact success rates. Conclusion: The evolving landscape of digital connection Hinge’s Convo Starters feature represents a meaningful step toward solving one of online dating’s most persistent problems: the awkward silence after matching. By leveraging artificial intelligence to provide personalized conversation starters, Hinge addresses user anxiety while encouraging more meaningful initial interactions. As dating apps continue to evolve, the integration of AI will likely become more sophisticated, potentially transforming how people connect in digital spaces. The success of such features will depend on balancing technological assistance with authentic human connection – ensuring that AI enhances rather than replaces genuine interaction.

Here’s the Latest Total Asset Under Management,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-inflows-hit-15-day-streak-heres-the-latest-total-asset-under-management/,"Institutional interest in XRP continues to grow as steady inflows reveal a shift in market sentiment. Investors are paying closer attention to XRP’s supply dynamics as ETF demand strengthens . The trend signals a new phase for XRP’s market structure. The momentum gained public attention after a report shared by XRPcryptowolf highlighted a notable inflow streak. The update confirmed that U.S. spot XRP ETFs recorded 15 straight days of net inflows. This sustained trend reflects strong confidence among institutional buyers during a period of market uncertainty. Updated AUM and Live Market Position As of report time, the combined assets under management across all U.S. spot XRP ETFs stand at $972 million. The funds collectively hold about 477.9 million XRP tokens in custody at the latest verified count. XRP ETF inflows hit 15 day streak. US $XRP ETFs have now logged 15 straight days of net inflows, pushing total assets over $1 billion pic.twitter.com/oczs1by2hQ — XRPcryptowolf (@XRPcryptowolf) December 6, 2025 These figures remain just below the $1 billion milestone referenced by several commentators. They also show clear growth from earlier reports that placed AUM near $900 million. The rise underscores expanding institutional involvement and consistent capital entry. Why the Streak Matters Each inflow adds pressure to the circulating supply because the ETFs hold real XRP. Locked tokens cannot enter normal trading channels unless redeemed. This mechanism slowly tightens exchange liquidity and reshapes market depth. A sustained lock-up strengthens the long-term outlook by reducing available supply. Investors often treat this supply effect as a bullish structural signal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Implications and Investor Focus Analysts observe that the inflow streak has emerged during wider market hesitation. XRP’s resilience stands out as other assets show mixed performance. The continued demand from ETF issuers demonstrates structured buying that does not rely on market hype. This pattern may support future price stability when overall conditions improve. What Comes Next The key metric to watch remains AUM growth. A move above $1 billion could attract more institutional allocators. Traders also monitor daily net flows to confirm whether the 15-day streak evolves into a longer record. Any acceleration in inflows may tighten supply further and influence price action. Supported by steady accumulation and rising institutional interest , t he current trend strengthens XRP’s long-term market narrative as more tokens move into regulated custody. XRPcryptowolf’s early highlight brought added focus to this shift, and the latest data confirms the trend remains strong.

The trigger was president Donald Trump’s “ Liberation Day ” tariffs, dropped on April 2, which shook up currency markets worldwide and kicked off the largest shift in foreign-exchange activity seen in years. The BIS said in its quarterly review that the US dollar collapsed sharply in response, losing its safe-haven shine and causing $1.5 trillion in OTC trades per day that month alone.”The FX market appeared to act as a shock absorber during the turbulence in April 2025,” BIS researchers Wenqian Huang, Ingomar Krohn, and Vladyslav Sushko wrote. The connection between the greenback and risky assets broke down entirely. Investors had to move fast. Many raced to hedge their USD positions as volatility spiked hard. Trump tariffs trigger worst dollar performance in 50 years Trump’s tariffs set off a full-on scramble. The dollar tanked the day the measures were announced. And it didn’t bounce back. A JPMorgan index of currency volatility shot up to its highest point in two years that same month. Traders with low hedge ratios suddenly found themselves badly exposed, especially after two years of rising global rates had already made hedging more expensive. “The need to adjust hedges of US dollar positions was especially acute since many investors entered the month with relatively low hedge ratios,” BIS said. Higher interest rates from 2022 to 2023 had pushed up hedging costs across the board. As the dollar kept slipping , many scrambled to protect against more downside. Some moved their money elsewhere altogether. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped more than 7% in the first half of 2025, marking the worst H1 for the dollar in five decades. It bounced slightly in the second half, but the damage was done. This crash spiked demand for forwards and options. Trading volumes for those products soared. But there was no panic over dollar funding. The BIS said FX swaps rose only modestly since 2022, showing no signs of stress on the funding side. BIS survey confirms global scale of trading boom The 2025 data came from the BIS’s triennial survey , the deepest dive into global FX trading available. Over 1,100 financial firms from across the world sent in their data. The BIS had already published a preliminary version in September, but the final update confirms how fast and how far the market moved after April’s shocks. Stock markets across Asia showed mixed reactions, as Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.12%, while China’s CSI 300 rose 0.81%, closing at 4,621.75, helped by a jump in exports. Japan’s Nikkei 225 ticked up 0.18% to finish at 50,581.94, and the Topix index added 0.65%, ending the day at 3,384.31. Over in South Korea, the Kospi surged 1.34% to 4,154.85, and the smaller Kosdaq gained 0.33%, closing at 927.79. Australia’s ASX/S&P 200 dipped 0.12% to 8,624.4, as investors looked ahead to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s policy meeting. In the US, markets closed stronger last Friday. The S&P 500 climbed 0.19% to 6,870.40, clocking its fourth green day and closing just 0.7% off its all-time high. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.31% to 23,578.13, and the Dow Jones added 104.05 points to end at 47,954.99.

While Schiff remains one of crypto’s most vocal skeptics , he is preparing to launch a tokenized gold payment system designed to modernize how physical gold can circulate as money. Before stepping onstage, Schiff sat down with Cryptonews to break down why he still believes Bitcoin is destined to fail and why tokenized gold, not digital scarcity, represents the future of sound money. Great meeting & chatting with @PeterSchiff today at @binance blockchain week! #Binance Looking forward to the conversation with Peter & @cz_binance tomorrow! pic.twitter.com/DuVcFyMu9S — Rachel Wolfson (@Rachelwolf00) December 3, 2025 Cryptonews: Why Are You Bearish on Bitcoin? Peter Schiff: I don’t believe Bitcoin is going to work. Yes, there have been times when I thought the price was going to go up, but that is separate from my ultimate understanding of what Bitcoin is and where the price is generally going. Bitcoin’s price is a function of the people who wish to gamble on it. You can have a period of time where people want to buy Bitcoin, and the people who own the asset don’t want to sell it, and then the price goes up. We’ve obviously had tremendous BTC price appreciation over the years . But it’s really interesting that Bitcoin peaked at the same time as gold. If Bitcoin is being portrayed as some digital equivalent of gold , the best way to price Bitcoin would be in terms of gold. But in terms of gold, Bitcoin is still considerably below where gold was four years ago. If I was really into Bitcoin, this would cause me to question the whole narrative. Why is Bitcoin lower than gold was four years ago, despite all the hype around Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, Bitcoin treasury companies, and electing a pro-Bitcoin U.S. president? So, why is Bitcoin still lower than gold was four years ago? And if Bitcoin can’t catch up now, why will it go up in the future? CN : Is there another reason why you think Bitcoin isn’t going to work? PS : Bitcoin can’t work as money because it doesn’t have any intrinsic value. And it won’t work as a store of value because you can’t store what you don’t have, right? An asset must possess value to be a store of value. Bitcoin has a price, but you can’t store the price. Also, the price of BTC is subject to market forces only. This means you never know what the price of Bitcoin is going to be worth in the future. It’s all dependent on the people who wish to buy Bitcoin versus the people not willing to sell it. If you bought Bitcoin years ago you could sell it at a much higher price, but that still doesn’t make it a store of value. CN : How would you define “store of value?” PS : Gold is a store of value. For instance, there’s gold in my watch. At $4,000 for an ounce of gold, there’s about $20,000 worth of actual gold in this watch. Somebody could melt this watch down and then use the gold—that is why gold is a store of value. Also, the value that gold has in one year could remain over hundreds and thousands of years. People would still be able to use the gold to do all the things that you could do with it today. Do you really think the value that gold has as a metal is going to disappear? There’s a shelf life on gold. Gold is worth just as much when it’s 10 years old as when it is brand new. It doesn’t matter when I take the gold out of the mine. The gold that I mined today has the same value as gold that was mined a hundred years ago – the value is stored. Bitcoin doesn’t have any value today because there is no real use for it. There’s no demand for it. There’s no industrial use for Bitcoin. People don’t need Bitcoin to make products. In fact, many people use gold as a hedge against inflation. They own gold, and they hedge it in case it drops. No one’s doing that with Bitcoin. There’s no actual end user of Bitcoin. CN : How would you then describe Bitcoin? PS : I describe Bitcoin as being the cigarettes of money. Cigarettes can be considered as money because people smoke and that’s why they are able to circulate. The GIs used cigarettes as money after World War II, and cigarettes function as money in prisons. If someone accepts cigarettes as a medium of exchange—even if they don’t smoke because they know that they can give them to someone else—that is what gives those cigarettes value. But, if there are no smokers, then the cigarettes become worthless—and so that is what I think about Bitcoin.

Some important metrics suggest the price may keep sliding in the near future, but one popular X user shared the recipe for stopping the free fall. The Potential Catalysts PI began trading at the beginning of 2025, and shortly after, its valuation exploded to $3. Currently, though, the asset trades at a mere $0.22, representing a 93% crash from the peak levels. According to X user pinetworkmembers, PI is starting to look like “one of those charts everyone was hyped about after the move already happened.” The analyst argued that the token’s momentum is drying up, buyers are retrating, while the crowd “is getting quieter by the day.” The anonymous market observer claimed that PI’s comeback depends on two catalysts: defending a solid support zone and finally attracting genuine interest from investors (“not just recycled hopium”). “PI looks less like an opportunity and more like a slow bleed waiting for a catalyst that never shows up. Trend is down, confidence is shaky, and patience is running out. Proceed accordingly,” the X user concluded. Meanwhile, the looming token unlocks spell further problems for the bulls. Data shows that over 183 million coins will be released in the next 30 days, which only increases the selling pressure. The record day is expected to be December 20, when almost 8 million PI will be freed up. The average daily unlocks for the following month are estimated to be approximately 6.1 million. PI Token Unlocks, Source: CoinGecko Pi Network’s Recent Updates Contrary to PI’s price retreat, the team behind Pi Network frequently announces ecosystem upgrades. Most recently, it integrated additional AI tools, making it easier and faster for Pioneers to complete their KYC procedures. According to some X users, the developers may introduce further updates on that front in the near future. Pi News, for instance, claimed that PI KYC validator rewards will be distributed by the end of Q1 2026. The Core Team also shook hands with CiDi Games (a gaming platform that builds Pi-related games that users can play).

It also revealed that authorities have uncovered more than ₹4,190 crore ($465 million) in crypto-linked crimes in recent years. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stated that the country cannot effectively police an industry that is “inherently borderless.” This comes in when the global crypto market is in the midst of a recovery run after witnessing heavy selling pressure. Bitcoin managed to regain around 7% in the last 7 days, yet it is still down by more than 10% over the past 30 days. India identifies $99M in unreported crypto income In a Lok Sabha session , Sitharaman mentioned that any regulatory framework for crypto assets can be effective only with international collaboration. This comes in line with the government’s long-standing stance on crypto assets. India sees crypto assets with a different trajectory. It does not treat cryptocurrencies as legal tender but allows their purchase, sale, and holding as Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) under a strict tax regime. Gains are taxed at a flat 30% plus cess, while a 1% TDS applies on most transactions. These rules have eventually pushed trading activity offshore. During the session, Sitharaman also disclosed that tax officials had identified ₹888.82 crore (approximately $99 million) in unreported cryptocurrency income during search and seizure operations. The Enforcement Directorate has attached or seized ₹4,189.89 crore (approximately $466 million) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). However, the authorities have also arrested 29 individuals and filed 22 prosecution complaints.

Coinbase reopens in India Officials have hinted that the regulatory vacuum is now becoming a financial-stability concern. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been warning that crypto cannot be “effectively regulated” without global guardrails. The renewed scrutiny comes as India’s crypto market shows signs of revival despite heavy taxation. The global crypto market cap surged by 2.5% over the last 24 hours. Bitcoin price managed to trade above $92,000 but saw a dip back to $91,500 zone. Meanwhile, the Fear and Greed index is still flashing “Fear” among the investors. Adding to the momentum, Coinbase reopened registrations in India this week. The crypto exchange was forced to wind down its operations in 2023 after UPI roadblocks. However, it is now allowing crypto-to-crypto trades and plans to restore fiat on-ramps in 2026. It is waiting to secure approval from the Financial Intelligence Unit. Don’t just read crypto news.

55509132,642200,1765208330,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55509132.jpeg,Криптозима близко. Биткоин ожидает глубокая просадка?,https://bitcoinist.com/kriptozima-blizko-bitkoin-ozhidaet-glubokaya-prosadka/,"Рынок снова нервничает: высокая волатильность, агрессивные продажи плечевых позиций и нарастающие разговоры о «криптозиме» усиливают страх перед глубокой коррекцией Bitcoin. Для многих это повод заморозить капитал в стейблкоинах, но для части инвесторов такие периоды — время искать инфраструктурные истории. Биткоин уже больше десяти лет остается базовым активом рынка, но его ограничения никуда не делись. Медленные транзакции, высокая комиссия в периоды нагрузки и практически полное отсутствие гибких смарт‑контрактов делают сеть неудобной для DeFi и массовых приложений. Отсюда и всплеск интереса к слоям решений поверх Bitcoin. На этом фоне усиливается внимание к инфраструктурным альткоинам, которые пытаются превратить Bitcoin из «цифрового золота» в полноценную базу для финансовых приложений. Инвесторы все чаще смотрят не только на цену, но и на архитектуру: модульные блокчейны, виртуальные машины, мосты ликвидности. В подобных обзорах уже стабильно фигурируют лучшие альткоины следующего цикла. Именно в такой контекст вписывается Bitcoin Hyper и токен $HYPER — инфраструктурный проект, который заявляет о себе как о первом Bitcoin Layer 2 с интеграцией Solana Virtual Machine. В условиях возможной глубокой просадки Bitcoin это ставит перед инвестором простой вопрос: оставить капитал пассивным или использовать спад, чтобы зайти в инфраструктуру, которая может масштабировать сам Bitcoin. КУПИТЬ BITCOIN HYPER Почему биткоину нужен второй уровень Главная проблема Bitcoin хорошо знакома каждому, кто хоть раз проводил транзакцию в период пикового спроса. Подтверждение может занимать десятки минут, а комиссии доходят до заметных сумм даже для простого перевода. Для мира DeFi, игр и высокочастотных платежей это критическое ограничение. Поэтому за последние годы сформировалась целая линейка решений второго уровня. Одни делают ставку на платежные каналы, другие — на «роллап»-архитектуру, третьи экспериментируют с отдельными виртуальными машинами и боковыми цепочками. Это отражает растущую конкуренцию за роль ключевой инфраструктуры поверх Bitcoin. Параллельно развивается сегмент высокопроизводительных цепочек вроде Solana, которые предлагают тысячи транзакций в секунду, но не имеют прямой «родной» привязки к безопасности Bitcoin. В результате рынок ищет гибрид: инфраструктуру, которая даст производительность уровня Solana, но при этом будет опираться на проверенную временем сеть Bitcoin. Bitcoin Hyper как раз пытается занять эту нишу, предлагая Layer 2 с поддержкой SVM. Bitcoin Hyper: ставка на SVM и скорость выше Solana Bitcoin Hyper строит модульную архитектуру: базовый слой Bitcoin отвечает за финальные расчеты, а отдельный слой с Solana Virtual Machine берет на себя исполнение транзакций и смарт‑контрактов в режиме реального времени. Это сочетание позволяет получить сверхнизкую задержку обработки операций и при этом опираться на безопасность основной сети. Команда заявляет, что производительность L2‑уровня превосходит показатели самой Solana, а комиссии удерживаются на уровне долей цента даже при высокой нагрузке. Для пользователя это открывает возможность проводить расчеты в обернутом Bitcoin, запускать DeFi‑протоколы, платформы NFT и игровые приложения на знакомом стеке Rust, но с привязкой к капиталу в Bitcoin, а не только к экосистеме Ethereum. Отдельный элемент конструкции — децентрализованный канонический мост для перевода Bitcoin на второй уровень, а также совместимость с токенами формата SPL, адаптированными под эту L2‑среду. На этапе раннего размещения проект уже привлек $29 млн при цене около $0.013395 за токен $HYPER, что демонстрирует заметный интерес к идее ускоренного Bitcoin на базе SVM. При этом данные ончейн‑мониторингов показывают, что два крупных кошелька суммарно приобрели около $396 000, что обычно воспринимается как сигнал внимания «умных денег». Модель вознаграждения держателей $HYPER строится вокруг стейкинга с повышенным APY и участием в управлении сетью. После запуска токена ранние инвесторы могут практически сразу переводить токены в стейкинг, а для участников предварительной продажи предусмотрен семидневный период вестинга. В перспективе ключевую роль будут играть не только финансовые стимулы, но и права голоса в развитии протокола. Задача Bitcoin Hyper проста и амбициозна одновременно: устранить для Bitcoin три главных ограничения — медленные транзакции, высокие комиссии и отсутствие развитых смарт‑контрактов. Если проекту удастся закрепиться в роли производительного Layer 2 с SVM и удобным инструментарием для разработчиков, $HYPER может стать одной из немногих инфраструктурных ставок, которые выиграют от следующего витка интереса к Bitcoin, а не просто будут следовать за его ценой.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-08 15:38:50

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a powerful signal of demand and liquidity entering the ecosystem. But what does such a colossal mint actually mean for you, the market, and the future of decentralized finance? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this whale-sized event. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC minted , we’re talking about the creation of new USDC stablecoin tokens. Circle, the company behind USDC, creates these tokens in response to demand. Essentially, someone deposits $250 million worth of U.S. dollars into Circle’s reserves, and in return, the treasury mints an equivalent 250 million USDC tokens on the blockchain. This process ensures every USDC in circulation is fully backed by real-world assets, maintaining its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Why Would Anyone Mint 250 Million USDC? Such a massive mint doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It points to significant institutional or whale activity. Here are the most likely reasons behind this move: Preparing for Major Investments: A large entity may be positioning itself to make a substantial purchase in the crypto market, such as buying Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other altcoins. Fueling DeFi Operations: The capital could be destined for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to earn yield through lending, liquidity provision, or staking. Enhancing Exchange Liquidity: Exchanges often need large stablecoin reserves to facilitate smooth trading, especially during periods of high volatility or anticipated market movement. Institutional Treasury Management: A corporation or fund might be moving part of its treasury on-chain for efficiency, transparency, or to access blockchain-based financial services. Therefore, a mint of this scale is often a precursor to action, indicating that a major player is about to make a significant move with that capital. The Ripple Effect: How a Major USDC Mint Impacts the Market When 250 million USDC is minted , the effects ripple across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. This injection of fresh, highly liquid capital acts like a adrenaline shot for the market. Primarily, it increases the overall liquidity available for trading and lending. This can help stabilize prices during dips by providing ready buying power. Furthermore, if this capital flows into DeFi, it can lower borrowing rates and increase yields for everyday users, making the ecosystem more attractive and efficient for everyone. Is This a Bullish Signal for Crypto? While not a guaranteed predictor, large stablecoin mints are generally viewed as a cautiously optimistic sign. They represent real-dollar demand entering the crypto sphere. Historically, accumulations of stablecoin liquidity on exchanges have sometimes preceded upward price movements, as this “dry powder” is used to purchase assets. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation is not causation. This mint signals preparedness and potential, but the ultimate market direction depends on broader sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and where this capital is actually deployed. Actionable Insights for the Astute Crypto Observer So, what should you do with this information? Don’t just watch the alert scroll by. Use it as a data point for your own strategy. Monitor exchange stablecoin balances to see if this USDC starts moving onto trading platforms. Keep an eye on lending rates in major DeFi protocols like Aave or Compound for a sudden influx of supply. This event underscores the importance of on-chain analytics; understanding whale movements can provide context that price charts alone cannot. In summary, the report of 250 million USDC minted is far more than a trivia fact. It is a powerful testament to the growing institutional footprint in crypto and a live demonstration of how traditional capital flows onto the blockchain. This mint enhances market liquidity, fuels DeFi innovation, and serves as a key indicator for savvy market participants watching for the next major shift. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Who can mint USDC? A: Only the authorized issuer, Circle, can mint new USDC tokens. They do so when verified partners deposit an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars into their regulated reserve accounts. Q: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? A: No. Unlike printing fiat currency, each new USDC token is minted 1-for-1 against a U.S. dollar held in reserve. It represents a conversion of existing dollars into a digital form, not the creation of new money. Q: Where can I track these mints and burns? A: You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDC or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which report large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between minting and buying USDC? A: “Minting” refers to the creation of new tokens by the issuer. “Buying” USDC is what you or I do on an exchange—acquiring existing tokens that are already in circulation from another seller. Q: Can minted USDC affect the token’s price peg? A> Properly executed mints and burns (the destruction of tokens) are the core mechanisms that help maintain USDC’s 1:1 dollar peg by matching supply precisely with reserve holdings. Q: Should I invest because of a large mint? A> A large mint is a data point, not an investment signal. Always conduct your own thorough research, consider your risk tolerance, and never invest based on a single piece of information. Found this breakdown of the major USDC mint helpful?

In a surprising turn of events, the cost of using the Ethereum network has quietly retreated to levels not seen for over half a decade. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, the 90-day simple moving average of Ethereum daily fees has dipped below 300 ETH, marking the most affordable period since July 2017. This dramatic shift raises critical questions for investors, developers, and everyday users. Is this a sign of a network in decline, or a hidden opportunity? Let’s unpack the data and explore the real story behind this significant milestone. What Do Record-Low Ethereum Daily Fees Actually Mean? First, it’s crucial to understand what these fees represent. Ethereum daily fees are the total amount of ETH paid by users to process transactions and execute smart contracts on the network. When this metric falls, it directly indicates lower demand for block space. Think of it like highway tolls; fewer cars on the road mean less congestion and lower toll prices for everyone. Therefore, the current low fee environment suggests a period of reduced network activity and competition among users. Why Have Ethereum Fees Dropped So Drastically? Several interconnected factors are contributing to this multi-year low in Ethereum daily fees . The primary driver is the successful implementation of the London upgrade (EIP-1559) and, more importantly, The Merge. The transition to Proof-of-Stake fundamentally changed Ethereum’s economics. However, the current low is less about technology and more about market behavior. Reduced DeFi and NFT Activity: The frenetic trading and minting that characterized the 2021 bull market have significantly cooled, lowering transaction demand. Layer 2 Adoption: Scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon are successfully diverting traffic away from the main Ethereum chain, where fees are much lower. General Crypto Market Sentiment: A broader bear market or period of consolidation naturally leads to less speculative on-chain activity. Consequently, this creates a double-edged sword: fantastic affordability for users, but also lower revenue for the network from fee burning. The User Benefits and Network Challenges of Low Fees For the average person, low Ethereum daily fees are an undeniable win. Interacting with decentralized applications, swapping tokens, or moving assets becomes far more accessible. This affordability can foster genuine utility and experimentation without the barrier of high gas costs. However, from a network health perspective, persistently low fees present a challenge. Lower fees mean less ETH is burned through the base fee mechanism introduced by EIP-1559. This burning is a key part of Ethereum’s deflationary pressure. If fee revenue remains low for an extended period, the net issuance of ETH could turn less deflationary or even inflationary, potentially impacting its long-term scarcity narrative. Therefore, the market watches this metric closely for clues about underlying economic security. What Does the Future Hold for Ethereum Transaction Costs? Predicting the future of Ethereum daily fees is complex. A sudden resurgence in a major trend like DeFi, NFTs, or a new innovation could quickly push demand and fees higher. However, the long-term trajectory is being actively shaped by Ethereum’s roadmap. The ongoing development of proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) aims to drastically reduce data costs for Layer 2s, which could further suppress mainnet fee pressure by making L2s even cheaper and more attractive. The ideal future state for Ethereum may not be perpetually low mainnet fees, but rather a healthy ecosystem where the mainnet serves as a secure settlement layer with predictable costs, while the vast majority of user activity occurs on ultra-low-cost Layer 2 networks. The current low fee period might be a preview of that future efficiency. Conclusion: A Moment of Calm, Not Necessarily Crisis The plunge in Ethereum daily fees to a 6-year low is a significant data point, but it should not be viewed in isolation as a negative signal. It reflects a maturation of the ecosystem, successful scaling through Layer 2s, and a current lull in speculative frenzy. For users, it’s a gift of affordability. For the network, it’s a temporary phase in its economic cycle. The true test will be how fees behave when the next wave of adoption hits, and whether the scaling infrastructure can handle it while keeping costs reasonable. This quiet period offers a strategic window for builders and users alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Are low Ethereum fees good or bad for the price of ETH? A> It’s nuanced. Low fees are great for user adoption but can reduce the amount of ETH burned, potentially affecting its deflationary supply. Long-term price depends more on overall utility and adoption than fee levels alone. Q: Will Ethereum fees stay this low forever? A> Almost certainly not. Fees are driven by demand for block space. A surge in network activity from a new popular dApp or market trend would quickly increase fees again. Q: Should I perform all my transactions now while fees are low? A> It can be a good time for non-urgent transactions like moving funds to cold storage or setting up smart contracts. For regular activity, consider using a Layer 2 network for consistently low costs. Q: How do Layer 2 solutions affect Ethereum mainnet fees? A> Layer 2s (like Arbitrum, Optimism) process transactions off-chain and post compressed data to Ethereum. This reduces congestion and demand on the mainnet, contributing directly to lower Ethereum daily fees . Q: What was the cause of extremely high Ethereum fees in the past? A> Periods of intense demand from phenomena like the 2020-2021 DeFi summer, NFT mints, and ICOs created massive competition for block space, driving fees to hundreds of dollars per transaction.

The Fear and Greed Index sits near 24, a level that keeps sentiment inside the fear range but still marks progress from last week’s deeper lows. Bitcoin is now trading around $90,000 with a gain of about 1% over 24 hours, and that move has eased some of the pressure that defined recent sessions . Bitcoin Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Most large caps remain quiet, although several mid-caps are advancing. Canton, Ethena, and Ondo stand out with steady climbs that align with a backdrop where traders engage selectively while still avoiding widespread risk-taking. These moves do not indicate a broad altcoin season, but they reveal where participation resumes when the market shifts from extreme stress to controlled caution. Canton Shows Renewed Interest In Its Network Activity Canton (CC) is trading around $0.074 , up by roughly 19% in 24 hours. Liquidity has improved across major venues, and order flow is more balanced than earlier this week. Privacy should be the foundation. Not an update to the system. — Canton Network (@CantonNetwork) December 6, 2025 On-chain activity around its coordination and settlement functions continues to draw attention from users who track enterprise-oriented experiments, and this interest appears to support today’s rise. The price structure suggests a transition from quiet trading toward a more stable upward pattern. Ethena Lifts As Its Synthetic Dollar System Steadies Ethena (ENA) is trading near $0.28 , up by about 11% in 24 hours. Recent data show a more consistent balance between funding costs and open interest, which indicates that its synthetic dollar framework is operating without the uneven spikes seen in previous weeks. Spot flows lean toward accumulation and remain spread across several active venues. The token continues to act as a reference point for yield-related designs during periods when the market prefers moderate exposure. Ondo Climbs On Ongoing Interest In Tokenized Yield ONDO is trading near $0.48 with an increase of about 8% over 24 hours. Trading activity suggests continued interest in tokenized treasury products, supported by steady demand for yield that connects crypto infrastructure with traditional markets. ONDO Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Liquidity on major pairs remains firm, and turnover now exceeds levels recorded in recent sessions. This behaviour keeps Ondo inside rotation lists whenever market tension eases. Altcoin Season Still Limited, but No Longer Suffocated Altcoin season remains distant , yet the rise from extreme fear levels has lowered stress across the market. Bitcoin’s ability to remain above $90,000 reduces forced selling and gives the market enough space for selective rotation. The strength in Canton, Ethena, and Ondo shows that capital is returning slowly to tokens with steady activity and clear user bases, even though most participants still prefer caution. For now, the environment remains defensive, but the combination of a higher Fear and Greed reading and several advancing names indicates a market that has moved from severe pressure to a quieter, more balanced phase.

This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a whale-sized signal that demands a closer look. What does such a massive injection of the world’s second-largest stablecoin mean for the market, and why should every investor pay attention? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this major USDC minted event. What Does It Mean When 250 Million USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC is minted , we mean new tokens are created and brought into circulation. Circle, the company behind USDC, creates these tokens in response to demand, typically when a user deposits an equivalent amount of US dollars. Therefore, a mint of this scale directly signals substantial institutional or whale-level demand for dollar-pegged digital assets. This recent 250 million USDC minted event points to one clear conclusion: significant capital is preparing to enter the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Why Is This Massive USDC Mint So Significant? This isn’t just a number on a screen. The act of having 250 million USDC minted has real-world ripple effects across the entire digital asset space. Think of USDC as high-powered fuel for the crypto economy. This new liquidity can flow into various areas, influencing prices and opportunities. Here are the key implications: Market Liquidity Injection: A fresh USDC minted supply provides immediate liquidity for trading pairs on centralized and decentralized exchanges, potentially reducing slippage for large trades. Institutional Signal: Moves of this magnitude are rarely made by retail investors. This points to institutional players, funds, or large trading desks positioning capital. DeFi and Yield Farming Fuel: This capital often seeks yield. A large portion of the newly minted USDC could flow into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, earning interest for its holders and providing lending liquidity. Potential Price Impact: While USDC itself is stable, this capital is likely destined for other assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins, which can create buying pressure. How Does a USDC Mint Affect You as an Investor? You might wonder, “What does a 250 million USDC minted event have to do with my portfolio?” The connection is more direct than you think. Major liquidity events like this serve as leading indicators. When this much stablecoin is created, it often precedes increased trading activity and volatility. For savvy investors, it’s a cue to monitor the markets closely. It suggests that large players see value or opportunity, which can be a useful data point in your own strategy. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation isn’t causation. Always pair this information with your own research. Decoding the Future: What Happens After the Mint? The story doesn’t end with the mint. The critical question is: where will this capital go? Tracking the flow of these funds can provide actionable insights. Will it sit in wallets, waiting for a market dip? Will it be immediately deployed into blue-chip cryptocurrencies or speculative altcoins? Observing blockchain activity following a major USDC minted announcement can reveal the market’s next potential moves. This event underscores the transparent nature of blockchain, allowing everyone to see the footprints of major capital. In conclusion, the report of 250 million USDC minted is far more than a headline. It is a powerful signal of institutional confidence and a precursor to market activity. It highlights the growing role of stablecoins as the essential plumbing of the crypto economy. For informed participants, understanding these flows is key to navigating the market’s waves. While not a direct call to action, it’s a compelling reminder to stay informed and understand the macro forces shaping your digital asset investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does ‘USDC minted’ actually mean? A: It means new USDC stablecoin tokens have been created by the issuer, Circle. This happens when someone deposits U.S. dollars, and an equivalent amount of digital USDC is generated on the blockchain. Q: Who typically mints 250 million USDC at once? A: Such a large mint is almost always executed by institutional players, such as cryptocurrency exchanges, investment funds, large trading firms, or corporate treasuries managing significant capital. Q: Does minting new USDC make the price go down? A> No, USDC is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar. Its price is maintained through reserves, not supply. Minting new tokens meets demand but does not devalue existing ones. Q: How can I track where this newly minted USDC goes? A> You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan. By looking up the transaction hash from the Whale Alert report, you can follow the subsequent transactions from the receiving address to see where the funds are moved. Q: Is a large USDC mint a bullish or bearish signal? A> It is generally considered a neutral-to-bullish signal. It indicates fresh capital is entering the crypto ecosystem, which is often used to purchase other assets, potentially creating upward price pressure. Q: What’s the difference between minting and burning USDC? A> Minting creates new tokens (adding supply), while burning destroys them (reducing supply). Burning occurs when users redeem USDC for U.S. dollars. Found this breakdown of the major 250 million USDC minted event helpful? Share this insight with your network on social media!

Most of the additions will come from linear unlocks on high-profile tokens. Linear unlocks rarely shock the market as in the case of cliff unlocks, but they still present the challenge to absorb more new tokens. Major linear unlocks include the usual SOL supply expansion, TRUMP meme token unlocks, and scheduled linear unlocks for ASTER, AVAX, and TAO. DOGE, the original no-limit mined coin, will also add $1M worth of new coins. TRUMP unlocks will also reach $4M per day for the coming week. Token unlocks will be the main source of token inflows in the coming week, with another $106M in cliff unlocks. | Source: Tokenomist The total value of linear unlocks will exceed $237M. This week’s unlocks follow the previous period’s unlocks of just around $218M. This week will also host the Stable project unlock, valued at $566.38M based on pre-market trading. The unlock will coincide with the main net launch and general native token generation, bringing a new network specialzied in stablecoin transfers. The effect of the Stable launch will be different compared to other projects, which already have a trading history and reactions to regular unlocks. Market expects $106M in cliff unlocks The coming week expects $106M in cliff unlocks, of which several will bring more than $5M in new tokens to the market. Significant cliff unlocks are coming for CONX, APT, STRK, CHEEL, LINEA, and BB tokens. Connex (CONX) expects one of the most significant shifts in its supply structure, with $21.85M in new unlocks. CONX is 82% unlocked, with more linear or scheduled regular unlocks until April 2027. Market prepares to absorb Web3 unlocks Most of the unlocks in the coming week come from Web3 projects, related to infrastructure or individual apps. Pump.fun (PUMP) will unlock $30.9M in new tokens, and may attempt to balance some of the inflows through its regular buybacks. Aptos, one of the busiest chains for DeFi, will add $19.9M worth of tokens. LINEA tokens will add another $11M in new supply. LINEA will add 6.78% to its circulating supply, one of the most impactful unlocks in the coming week. Other notable Web3 unlocks include Mocaverse, Avantis, and others. Web3 projects still carry their legacy unlocks from early VC backing, while continuing to absorb the price pressure. Overall, token unlocksh have a long-term effect on project reputations. Even with a growing price, the unlocks do not allow the asset to break out to a higher price range. Most of the projects with regular unlocks see their total market cap grow, even with a much weaker token price growth. Not all projects with a rising market capitalization are capable of staging a token breakout.

The hourly price chart confirms that dYdX is attempting a dip below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing an upside recovery rally in the coming hours. If dYdX’s price holds momentum above $0.2637, it will fuel a bullish rally to $0.3284. dydX/USDT price chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the dYdX price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1971, beginning a bearish trend to $0.1667. Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX down today? The overall dydx market sentiment is bearish as buyers failed to defend support channels. This resulted in a drop toward $0.21. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.3 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025? In 2025, dYdX is predicted to reach a minimum level of $3.86. Traders and investors can expect a maximum level of $4.55 and an average price of $3.96 if the bulls show up. Will dYdX reach $10? Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future. It is advised to seek independent professional consultation and investment advice from experts before investing in the crypto market, which has high price volatility. Recent news/opinion on dYdX The dYdX community has proposed a three-month experimental buyback program, running from November 1, 2025, to January 31, 2026, that will use the protocol’s net transaction fees to repurchase DYDX tokens. The initiative, expected to buy back between $5 million and $10 million worth of tokens, aims to boost token value and assess the protocol’s capital efficiency. dYdX price prediction December 2025 dYdX’s price might attempt to surge toward $0.44 from its recent low and be pushed further, at least $0.6, if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection by the bearish side, leading to a consolidation around $0.2. dYdX price prediction Minimum price Average price Maximum price dYdX price prediction December 2025 $0.2 $0.44 $0.6 dYdX price prediction 2025 The price of 1 dYdX is expected to reach a minimum level of $0.2 by the end of 2025.

This New DeFi Coin Surges 250% as Phase 6 Nears Completion,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-this-the-next-30x-altcoin-this-new-defi-coin-surges-250-as-phase-6-nears-completion/,"This new altcoin is gaining momentum and traders are moving at high speed as they seek early high-upside potential seats. Having seen a 250% increase already with the last phase of its allocation window nearing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being mentioned as one of the tokens that would have a much higher impetus than most larger assets in this day and age once entering the next cycle. Progress and Accelerating Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has started its Presale since the start of 2025 at a price of $0.01. The token is currently priced at $0.035 with tremendous increase in development. The project has collected more than $19.2M, over 18,400 holders, and has sold above 810 million tokens. Phase 6 is already over 95% and only a negligible portion of the supply remains at the present level. MUTM will have a price of $0.06 when it officially launches, which is almost twice the existing one. The second stage phase also has a price increment nearly 20% which has contributed significantly to the early-stage participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) uses a 24-hours leaderboard to keep users active every day with its 24-hours leaderboard, with the highest contributor getting $500 worth of MUTM. It also supports card payment, which does not require complicated actions from new users. This is what Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance is a platform that is being developed based on decentralized lending markets. The Peer to Contract market permits users to lend assets like the ETH or USDT. Lenders receive mtTokens. Such mtTokens go up in value with interests paid by borrowers. It is the Peer to Peer market where direct agreements are made between the borrowers and the lenders. Liquidity changes bring with it a movement in borrowing rates. In the case where a strong liquidity situation exists, loaning is at a lower cost. Borrowing costs increase when there is tight liquidity. The loan-to-value regulations regulate the prudent use of collateral and when collateral has collapsed significantly, the liquidators repay a portion of the loan and get a discounted collateral. A buy-and-distribute model is also included in the protocol. Part of the revenue of the platform purchases MUTM on the market. The bought tokens are then given to users who are staking mtTokens. This forms a constant demand cycle connected to the activity of protocols. Security has been at the center stage. Mutuum Finance also underwent a CertiK audit with a result of 90/100. Halborn security has been reviewing the lending contracts and a 50K bug bounty is in force so as to find out the remaining code problems and fix them before launching. Stablecoin and Analyst Growth Outlook Mutuum Finance is working on a USD-backed interest-secured stablecoin. Stablecoins play a vital part in lending ecosystems since they enable foreseeable borrowing, draw users who prefer to have stable collateralization choices and develop deeper liquidity. A well-performing stablecoin will also assist in growing the level of borrowing, furthering the volume of mtTokens yield and buying pressure that pushes the revenue. Chainlink price feeds are deployed as the foundation oracle layer in the project. Backup data sources are useful in averting liquidation errors. This enhances safety of the user and helps in the long run development. Due to such components, there are now some analysts forecasting a potential 10x to 15x range once V1 is operational. More violent models demonstrate that in case of the expanded adoption of the mtToken, the number of those who use stable coins increases, and the deployment of the layer-2 faces a rapid growth, the MUTM can enter the area of 20x possibilities in the next cycle. Phase 6 Acceleration Mutuum Finance assured that V1 testnet should go live in Q4 2025. V1 presents the lending pool, mtTokens, Debt engine and the liquidation module. ETH and USDT will be supported from the beginning. This launch will demonstrate the initial live borrowing and lending processes of the protocol. Phase 6 sells now at a rapid rate since the user is prepping on the subsequent price increment. The latest whale sellout of over 100K has decreased the stock left and increased focus of retail traders. The involvement of whales is usually considered to be a powerful assurance as large buyers get involved when they think that the project is on the point of being given a serious upgrade. With a growing number of audited contracts, a nearing V1 launch, and high initial demand with a limited amount of allocation window, Mutuum Finance becomes a candidate of interest as one of the most active next crypto candidates in 2026.

This is the powerful vision behind Pye Finance, a Solana-based startup that just secured a massive $5 million vote of confidence from some of crypto’s biggest names. This funding round signals a major step towards solving one of decentralized finance’s most persistent challenges: liquidity for locked assets. What is Pye Finance and Why Does It Matter? Pye Finance is developing a specialized marketplace with one core mission: to make time-locked staking positions transferable. In simpler terms, if you’ve staked your SOL tokens to earn rewards but need access to that capital before the lock-up period ends, Pye aims to provide a solution. Their platform will allow users to buy, sell, or trade these fixed-term staking commitments, injecting much-needed flexibility into the staking ecosystem. This innovation could fundamentally change how investors manage their portfolios and risk on the Solana network. Who Backed the Pye Finance $5M Seed Round? The caliber of investors in this seed round speaks volumes about the project’s potential. The funding was co-led by two industry titans: Variant : A well-known crypto-native investment firm. Coinbase Ventures : The investment arm of the leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange. They were joined by other heavyweight participants, including Solana Labs itself, Nascent , and Gemini ‘s venture arm. This coalition of exchange, ecosystem, and venture capital support provides Pye Finance with not just capital, but also strategic expertise and network access crucial for building a successful marketplace. How Will Pye Finance Transform Staking on Solana? The traditional staking model presents a clear trade-off: commit your tokens for a longer period to earn higher rewards, but sacrifice liquidity. Pye Finance’s marketplace seeks to break this compromise. By creating a secondary market for staking positions, it introduces several key benefits: Enhanced Liquidity : Users can exit a staking commitment early by selling their position to another investor. New Financial Products : Developers can structure fixed-term, yield-bearing products with clearer exit options. Efficient Capital Allocation : Capital is no longer stuck and can be redeployed based on market opportunities. This could lead to more sophisticated DeFi strategies and attract institutional players who require precise liquidity management. What Are the Challenges and the Road Ahead? Building a trusted marketplace for a novel asset class is no small feat. Pye Finance will need to establish robust security protocols, clear pricing mechanisms, and deep liquidity from day one to gain user trust. Furthermore, they must navigate the technical complexities of representing and transferring staking rights securely on-chain. However, with $5 million in funding and its all-star backing, Pye Finance is well-positioned to tackle these hurdles. The success of this project could set a new standard for staking across the entire blockchain industry, not just on Solana. Conclusion: A Liquidity Revolution for Staked Assets The $5 million seed round for Pye Finance is more than just another funding announcement; it’s a bet on a fundamental improvement to blockchain economics. By unlocking the value trapped in staking contracts, Pye Finance promises to make the Solana ecosystem more dynamic, efficient, and attractive to a broader range of participants. As they build their marketplace, all eyes will be on whether they can deliver the liquidity breakthrough that staking has long needed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What exactly does Pye Finance do? A: Pye Finance is building a marketplace where users can trade time-locked staking positions. This means you can sell your commitment to a staking pool before it unlocks, or buy into an existing position to earn the remaining rewards. Q: Which blockchain is Pye Finance built on? A: Pye Finance is being developed specifically for the Solana blockchain, focusing on SOL staking assets. Q: Who invested in Pye Finance? A: The $5 million seed round was co-led by Variant and Coinbase Ventures, with participation from Solana Labs, Nascent, and Gemini. Q: When will the Pye Finance marketplace launch? A: A specific launch date has not been announced following this seed funding. The capital will be used to develop the platform. Q: How does this benefit the average crypto staker? A: It provides an “emergency exit” option and greater flexibility. If you need access to your staked funds unexpectedly, you may be able to sell your position instead of waiting for the lock-up to end. Q: Is trading staking positions safe? A: As with any DeFi protocol, security is paramount. The trustworthiness will depend on Pye Finance’s smart contract audits and security practices once the platform is live.

Fresh higher lows on each chart now place the focus on whether buyers can defend support and force a decisive breakout. ETH/BTC Monthly Ratio Shows Early Signs of Recovery Analyst Bracco said the ETH/BTC monthly ratio is “coming back to life” as the market forms a pattern of higher lows. The monthly chart shows Ethereum’s performance against Bitcoin stabilizing after an extended downtrend. Recent candles hold above the prior bottom, indicating that sellers have not been able to push the ratio to new cycle lows. ETH/BTCUSD 1M Ratio Chart. Source: Bracco / TradingView / X He noted that these higher lows create a base that could support a broader recovery. The chart highlights how ETH has attempted to build structure for several months while volume remains steady. This behavior signals that selling pressure may be easing as participants reassess risk across major crypto assets. Bracco added that, if the current bases hold and do not break lower, the pair could enter a squeeze higher. The setup reflects a common pattern in crypto markets, where prolonged compression often precedes sharp directional moves. The analyst pointed to this dynamic as the key scenario to watch in the coming weeks. Analyst Flags Key Support Zone for Ethereum Analyst Jelle said Ethereum has returned to an “interesting spot” on the chart after a false breakout from a large megaphone pattern. Price pushed above the upper boundary of the structure but quickly reversed, turning the move into a fakeout rather than a clean breakout. ETHUSD Price Chart. Source: Jelle / TradingView / X Despite that failure, Jelle noted that ETH has so far held a key horizontal support band. The latest reaction from that zone has carved out a higher low versus the prior major bottom, preserving the broader uptrend structure on his chart. He added that a fresh breakout near the 4,000 dollar area would be the next technical hurdle to watch. If ETH can reclaim and hold above that level, Jelle suggested the move could open room for a stronger continuation rally.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-08 16:01:29

That is the scenario being painted for XRP — a shift from banking stalemate to seamless global liquidity, where XRP may emerge as a foundational asset. According to Good Evening Crypto and its featuring of Jake Claver , supply constraints, rising institutional demand, and macroeconomic stress are lining up like dominoes ready to fall. Fixed Supply and Controlled Release From its genesis in 2012, XRP has had a fixed maximum supply of 100 billion tokens . As of late 2025, roughly 60.1 billion are in active circulation. The remainder sits in escrow or is held by early stakeholders. The company behind XRP, Ripple Labs, releases up to 1 billion XRP per month from escrow — but typically most of those tokens get re-locked. This drip‑feed release mechanism creates structural scarcity. Over time, a rising demand cannot simply be met by printing more supply. In effect, this scarcity could amplify price pressure if demand surges. That supply discipline is a cornerstone of what proponents call the “supply shock.” HOW $XRP REACHES $1,000 AFTER DOMINO THEORY! JAKE CLAVER SUPPLY SHOCK EXPLAINED! CLICK BELOW TO WATCH NOW!! https://t.co/Uz3YNGQvfa — Good Evening Crypto (@AbsGMCrypto) December 7, 2025 Institutional Demand, Liquidity Crises, and the Domino Effect Advocates of the $1,000‑plus XRP thesis argue that several macro‑forces could converge: global liquidity stress, institutions seeking alternative settlement rails, and demand for a fast, cross‑border liquidity asset. If many payment networks, remittance providers, or financial institutions begin using XRP — especially in stressed liquidity environments — demand could spike. As demand climbs while supply remains tightly controlled, prices could react sharply. That reaction could set off what Good Evening Crypto refers to as “dominoes”: one wave of demand triggers another, capital flows shift, and XRP becomes a de facto global bridge asset. In that environment, valuations once dismissed as fantasies may appear plausible. Some supporters even argue XRP could move beyond $1,000 — not because of speculative mania, but through genuine institutional adoption, market‑wide shifts in capital flows, and structural scarcity. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market‑Cap Math Breaks Down When Utility Changes Fundamentals Critics often dismiss such price targets by pointing to the implied market cap: with 100 billion tokens, $1,000 per XRP implies a $100 trillion valuation — a number that dwarfs global GDP by several multiples. That math is correct if one assumes all XRP tokens must trade at that level simultaneously. But what if most tokens remain locked, escrowed, or held by institutions not trading them? In such a case, the “effective float” is much smaller. Price theory then shifts: value becomes a function of utility, demand for liquidity, and velocity — not simply supply multiplied by price. The argument follows that XRP isn’t merely a speculative asset; it could become core infrastructure. Its utility as a settlement and liquidity tool — especially in a world overwhelmed by FX frictions and liquidity shortages — could redefine its valuation framework. What It Would Take, and Why $1,000 Is at Best a Stretch For XRP to realistically approach $1,000 per token, several extreme conditions must align: strict escrow discipline, persistent institutional demand, broad adoption for payment or liquidity flows, and a global liquidity crunch pushing actors toward non‑fiat rails. Even then, such a price implies a dramatic shift in how value is assigned. Most conservative models expect more modest range targets — perhaps $5, $20, or $50 — under reasonable adoption scenarios. The jump to $1,000 demands revolutionary change: a paradigm shift in global finance, not incremental growth. In conclusion, the $1,000 XRP thesis depends heavily on structural change and widespread institutional adoption. It’s not a fantasy of speculative fervor, but a bold view on how liquidity, scarcity, and capital flows might evolve. That said, under current conditions, the gap between bold vision and grounded math remains wide. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This recovery comes after a bearish month that still leaves the price at a 10.11% drop in the last 30 days. Amid the recovery, a key metric tells a different story. Traders now shift focus to the Realized Price-to-Liveliness Ratio support that BTC is currently testing. Ali, a renowned analyst, points out that when Bitcoin slips below this ratio, it often gravitates toward its Realized Price. Source: X That level stands at $56,355. This support held during past market resets and many traders now ask whether it still carries the same weight in a cycle shaped by ETF flows, sovereign accumulation, and reduced miner capitulation. The current setup invites that question. Realized Metrics Resemble Early 2022 Conditions Glassnode data shows rising on-chain stress . The supply quantiles cost basis tracks the cost basis of top buyers. Bitcoin trades below the 0.75 quantile near $96,100. This drop places more than 25% of supply underwater. A break below the same quantile marked the start of the 2022 bear market. Current conditions reflect growing pressure on buyers who entered near cycle highs. Total supply in loss on a seven-day moving average reached 7.1 million Bitcoin. This figure sits at the upper boundary of the 5 million to 7 million range seen in early 2022. The surge in supply held at a loss signals increasing strain on holders who bought during recent strength. Realized cap net change still shows capital moving into the network. Net inflows stand near $8.69 billion per month. This inflow trails the summer peak of $64.3 billion per month. Slowing inflows highlight weakening conviction even though the metric remains positive. ETF and Spot Market Activity Shows Declining Appetite Off-chain indicators show a similar trend. ETF inflows continue to slow . IBIT recorded a sixth straight week of outflows. Total redemptions exceed $2.7 billion over the past five weeks. This streak ranks as the longest negative run since IBIT launched in January 2024. The flow pattern indicates softer demand from institutions that dominated earlier phases of the cycle. Since December started, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $87.77M net outflows. Source: X Spot market liquidity also softens. Cumulative volume delta rolled over. Binance CVD trends negative over an extended stretch, hinting at sustained selling pressure in aggressive order flow. The Coinbase premium looks set to roll over again after a brief positive turn that followed a long negative stretch. The shift suggests less aggressive US-based buying. FOMC Expectations Inject Macro Uncertainty Macro conditions add another layer. The Federal Reserve acknowledges that policy remains modestly restrictive. Officials hold diverging views on risks tied to inflation and employment, and market expectations swing sharply ahead of the 10 December FOMC meeting . Comments from Chair Jerome Powell after the 29 October decision triggered uncertainty. Powell stated that a December cut did not hold a strong likelihood. Minutes from that meeting showed many members leaning against another cut. A government shutdown delayed data collection, leaving fewer indicators before the December meeting. By 19 November, markets priced only 7 basis points of a full 25-basis-point cut. Bitcoin traders now watch how the Fed’s next move shapes liquidity, risk appetite, and ETF demand.

At the same time, Ethereum’s value versus MSTR has fallen back to a long-term support zone last seen in 2018–2019, underscoring how strongly the market now favors the Bitcoin pro Michael Saylor Hints at Fresh Bitcoin Buys With ‘Orange Dots’ Post Michael Saylor signaled he may resume large Bitcoin purchases, sharing a new snapshot of the SaylorTracker portfolio chart on X. He captioned the post “Back to Orange Dots?” alongside the latest equity-value graph for Strategy’s BTC holdings. Bitcoin Portfolio Value. Source: StrategyTracker / X The chart shows Strategy’s Bitcoin position valued at about 57.8 billion dollars, with orange circles marking previous purchase points along the price curve. Saylor’s reference to returning to those “orange dots” suggests the company could be preparing additional buys after recent market volatility. Strategy remains one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, and its entry points have often drawn attention across the market. Saylor’s brief message did not confirm any new transaction, but it again highlighted the firm’s focus on expanding its BTC treasury over time. MSTR Stock Slides as Investor Claims Shares Should Trade Higher Given Larger Bitcoin Holdings An online commentator argued that Strategy’s stock should trade significantly above current levels, pointing to the company’s rising Bitcoin exposure. He noted that MSTR may open near 200 dollars per share while holding four times more Bitcoin than last year, based on figures shown in Google Finance’s six-month performance chart. The chart compares Strategy’s share price, down about 54 percent over the period, with Bitcoin’s performance, which shows a decline of nearly 13 percent. The investor said the mismatch between Strategy’s BTC accumulation and its falling stock price suggests the market is undervaluing the company’s holdings. Although he described the potential for a much higher valuation, the post did not include any new disclosures from Strategy. It instead highlighted the contrast between the firm’s growing BTC treasury and the sharp slide in its equity price over recent months. ETH/MSTR Ratio Drops Back to Long-Term Support Zone Analyst Benjamin Cowen highlighted the weekly ETH/MSTR chart, showing Ethereum’s value against Strategy stock sliding back to levels last seen in 2018–2019. The ratio has trended lower since its 2022 peak, with a steep decline through 2023 and 2024 as MSTR, a listed proxy for Bitcoin exposure, outperformed ETH.

The goal is to turn billions in locked SOL stakes into an active yield market. Variant and Coinbase Ventures led this round, with participation from Solana Labs , Nascent , Gemini , and others, according to the press release. Pye says that it’s building bond markets for validators and stakers on Solana (SOL) . The platform enables validators to draw and keep stake. They can offer rewards across more than a thousand validators. According to the team, they accomplish this by creating transferable, time-locked staking positions with transparent reward sharing. Moreover, they argue that the approach opens up novel DeFi use cases. These include lending and restaking, as well as fixed-yield products for the $60 billion locked in staking. Per Brian Long. CEO of Block Logic & Triton , “Stake Trading unlocks new possibilities for both stakers and validators which is much needed.” According to Alana Levin, investor at Variant , Pye’s staking marketplace could “fundamentally change how staking operates on Solana. By allowing validators and stakers to better align their preferences – for example, enabling validators to offer higher yields in exchange for longer lockups – Pye creates a more efficient, transparent, and incentive-aligned staking ecosystem.” Meanwhile, Pye is the product of Alberto Cevallos, co-founder of Bitcoin yield aggregator on Ethereum BadgerDAO , and Erik Ashdown, an exec with a background in structured products in traditional markets. “Validators have become the underbanked layer of Web3,” Ashdown says. Pye is building a financial infrastructure that lets validators operate like asset managers, offering structured products and predictable returns. Notably, this raise follows a closed alpha. The team plans to launch a private beta in the first quarter of 2026. Early access is currently available to validators and staking providers.

Passive Billions ‘Turning’ Into Active Yield Market Staking is shifting from a passive yield mechanism into a programmable financial layer, the team says. Institutional stakers look for transparent reward structures, customizable terms, and the option to trade or borrow against locked positions. Therefore, Pye says it’s turning validators from node operators into yield providers who can “compete on product offerings rather than just commission rates.” It’s creating the first onchain marketplace for time-locked staking positions on Solana, it adds. With this, they claim, they’ll turn Solana’s billions in locked stake into an active, programmable yield market. The total staked currently sits at 422.6 million SOL , or nearly $59 billion. Source: solanacompass Notably, the team argues that these accounts have seen no updates in years and have no liquidity. Additionally, they lack customization and control over staking rewards. At the same time, institutions and digital asset treasuries (DATs) are asking for a bigger piece of the reward pie, the Solana Foundation’s Delegation Program (SFDP) is seeing a cut, and smaller validators have to scramble to find ways to generate revenue or attract stakers. Pye says its solution is an upgrade to Solana’s native Staked accounts. Validators gain control over their staking rewards and time locks. Validator agreements move onchain as ‘transferable locked stake’ – they are locked but can be traded on secondary markets. These are split into a Principal Token and a Rewards Token (RT). “The aim is to enable validators to offer more flexible and dynamic products, tapping into additional revenue opportunities while delivering greater utility to stakers,” the press release says. “Without the ability to structure term-based deals, reward loyalty, or provide additional utility–such as better accounting, rewards forwarding, or other features–many validators are left vulnerable to sudden outflows that can destabilize operations.” Dan Albert, Solana Foundation’s Executive Director, commented that Pye’s “tradeable, fixed-term positions at the validator level represent a major unlock for both rewards discovery and capital efficiency in proof-of-stake networks, and open up new opportunities.” You may also like: Coinbase Launches Staking in New York After State Approval – ETH and SOL Yields Now Available Coinbase has activated staking services for New York residents, allowing users to earn yields on Ethereum and Solana holdings for the first time.The rollout follows approval from state regulators under Governor Kathy Hochul's administration, ending a restriction that had separated New Yorkers from staking opportunities available to most other Americans.New York users can now stake ETH, SOL, and other supported assets directly through the platform, with rewards earned in the network's...

Officials are studying a regulatory package that would allow banks to integrate crypto trading and custody into standard accounts. The measure signals a shift toward placing digital-asset activity inside supervised channels after years of growth in unregulated platforms. The draft framework follows internal discussions within the government’s digital-assets working group. Although the text is not final, regulators have confirmed that the plan remains active. They are evaluating risk controls, reporting standards, and which assets banks would be permitted to support. The list will likely include Bitcoin, major cryptocurrencies, and dollar-linked stablecoins. Banks in Argentina have shown interest in reentering the sector. Before the 2022 restriction, several institutions tested in-app crypto trading tools. As the review continues, banks are preparing internal systems so they can move quickly if the central bank authorizes the change. Shift Comes After Years of High Inflation and Currency Controls Argentina’s renewed focus on Bitcoin access follows long periods of high inflation and strict currency controls. These conditions pushed many residents toward digital assets, often using offshore exchanges or informal channels. As usage expanded, regulators struggled to monitor flows and enforce compliance requirements across the fragmented market. Because of this, officials have signaled an interest in bringing more crypto activity under direct oversight. They aim to improve data collection, strengthen anti-money-laundering checks, and reduce the reliance on unregulated intermediaries. By moving services back into banks, authorities expect clearer reporting structures and more consistent consumer protections. At the same time, the government has attempted to address public demand for flexible financial tools. While officials avoid commenting on the timing of any approval, the review reflects a broader policy effort to modernize rules without abandoning existing safeguards. This balancing act continues as the central bank weighs industry feedback. Banks Could Regain a Role in the Crypto Market If approved, the new rules would reverse the blanket ban that halted banking crypto services in May 2022. Banks would again be allowed to give customers the option to buy, sell, and hold Bitcoin inside familiar banking apps. This integration would place digital-asset activity alongside traditional products governed by Argentina ’s existing financial regulations. The shift would also pressure local crypto exchanges to maintain higher compliance standards. As banks adopt formal frameworks, independent platforms may need to adjust procedures to compete for users who prefer regulated environments. Consequently, the measure could reshape how digital-asset trading operates across Argentina’s broader financial system. For now, the central bank has not committed to a final deadline. Officials say the review remains ongoing, and approval will depend on completing the necessary supervisory tools. Nevertheless, the proposal marks the clearest sign since 2022 that banks may again handle Bitcoin under Argentina’s national regulatory structure.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-08 16:16:38
