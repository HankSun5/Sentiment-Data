Bitcoin pulled back nearly 4 percent within hours, dragging other assets lower. Yet by Thursday, a rebound in stablecoin liquidity began stabilizing markets, sparking renewed interest in top cryptos for massive growth. The improved volume in major pairs highlighted shifting sentiment toward selective buying rather than blanket selling. In this market, Qubetics gained particular attention because of its soaring presale. At the same time, Aave triggered the launch of its Umbrella security protocol, which introduced an auto‑deficit coverage mechanism and boosted staking yields, particularly for stablecoins, enhancing appeal among top cryptos for massive growth. This led to a 6 percent uptick in AAVE’s daily trading price, signaling renewed confidence in its underlying DeFi utility. Cardano also retained a key support level between $0.58 and $0.61 aligned with its 0.786 Fibonacci retracement. Analysts spotlighted Cardano among the top cryptos for massive growth as stability returned to its chart pattern. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is garnering community momentum in its 37th presale stage. Qubetics: Decentralized VPN Brings Real‑World Utility Amid Presale Surge Qubetics ($TICS) aims to solve VPN Centralization issues by delivering a decentralized network with privacy, reliability, and superior speeds. With the 37th presale stage underway, only 10 million $TICS tokens remain at $0.3370. That scarcity, combined with a slashed total supply of 1.36 billion and a 38.55 percent public allocation, positions it uniquely among top cryptos for massive growth. The Qubetics presale has entered its 37th stage. Over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 27,700 holders, raising upwards of $17.8 million so far. During this stage, $TICS tokens are available for purchase at $0.3370. Analysts project potential prices of $10–15 after the mainnet launch. Early crypto presale participants might enjoy a 20 percent return from a $0.40 listing price. A hypothetical $ 15,000 allocation today could yield significant ROI if analyst forecasts materialize. The decentralized VPN offers advantages for businesses, professionals, and consumers: Privacy Maintenance: Elimination of centralized logs safeguards user data. Professional Accessibility: Secure remote access for distributed workforces. Enterprise Resilience: Redundant node connectivity reduces service disruptions. Consumer Ease: Streamlined, user‑managed encryption in a no‑log system. Qubetics positions itself to fill gaps left by traditional VPN providers. It promises an ecosystem where community governance and scarcity amplify value. It’s an emerging standout among top cryptos for massive growth. Investment Scenario: Calculated Entry with High-Return Potential Qubetics offers a compelling investment narrative for strategic crypto buyers: Stage 37 Entry (Price: $0.3370) If a buyer commits $1,000, they receive approximately 2,966 TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this translates to a 20% instant paper profit of $1,186. Mid-Term Projection Should Qubetics reach the projected mid-range valuation of $5 per token, that same $1,000 investment could grow to $14,830, marking a 1,383% return. Long-Term Upside If Qubetics meets bullish projections of $10–$15, the same tokens could be worth between $29,660 and $44,490, yielding a potential ROI of up to 4,349%. Such upside potential and growing demand for decentralized privacy infrastructure make Qubetics stand out among 2025’s emerging crypto opportunities. Aave (AAVE): Umbrella Protocol Elevates DeFi Confidence Aave strengthened its position in decentralized finance with the deployment of the Umbrella security layer. Integrating auto‑deficit coverage and a revamped staking interface, the feature allocates staked aTokens and GHO toward protocol deficits—shielding stakeholders from systemic risk. Asset TVL reached $36.8 million, with ETH comprising $17.5 million. USDC and USDT yielded 11.0 percent and 10.9 percent respectively, while ETH/WETH earned 6.05 percent, and GHO returned 5.47 percent. AAVE’s price climbed 1.99 percent to $258.14, with a market cap of $3.91 billion. Although trading volume dipped 54 percent to $215.8 million, the narrative around improved security and yield layers positions Aave among top cryptos for massive growth. The protocol’s innovation enhances confidence among liquidity providers and supports long‑term DeFi adoption. As decentralized finance continues expanding into traditional finance models, Aave’s Umbrella rollout could serve as a template for risk‑aware yield strategies. An improved UI with live metrics—total value locked, yield breakdown by asset, and staking utility—enhances transparency. These attributes reinforce Aave’s standing as a mature protocol among top cryptos for massive growth and contribute to its ongoing institutional appeal. Cardano (ADA): Fibonacci Bounce Sets Sights on Recovery Path Cardano has consolidated just above the critical $0.58–$0.61 support zone, precisely aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement—a technical indicator often marking strong reversal points. With current trading at $0.6759, 24‑hour volume near $481 million, and market cap at $23.89 billion, ADA appears strategically positioned among top cryptos for massive growth. Recent technical analysis signals a potential breakout, targeting $1.0463 as the initial resistance level. Extended targets at $1.2145 and $1.3984 lie along Fibonacci extension zones. Continuation depends on staying above the defined support; a breakdown below $0.58 could invalidate the pattern, shifting sentiment bearish. Cardano’s ecosystem continues to expand through interoperability initiatives, academic research collaborations, and regulatory‑compliant smart contract deployment. Benchmarking against top cryptos for massive growth, ADA offers a risk‑aware yet innovation‑centric platform. Its stability around Fibonacci levels combined with real utility in DeFi, NFTs, and governance positions it as a balanced play amid turbulent conditions. Conclusion: Timing, Terrain, and Tactical Edge These three protocols represent distinctive investment profiles under the banner of top cryptos for massive growth . Qubetics capitalizes on unmet needs in online privacy. Aave solidifies its position as a next‑generation DeFi platform with built‑in safeguards. Cardano blends long‑term platform development with short‑term technical breakout potential. Given the current volatility in the crypto world, those seeking exposure to emerging and mainstream trails can monitor Qubetics’ closing presale window, track Aave’s staking yields and usage metrics, and observe Cardano’s momentum around Fibonacci triggers.

The flagship coin rallied over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to reach a local high of about $110,260, less than 2 percent from its all-time high, on Monday, June 9 during the late North American session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), followed in tandem. As a result, the total crypto Open Interest (OI) surged over 6 percent to hover about $154.8 billion at the time of this writing. Additionally, more than $403 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, led by Bitcoin’s $197 million. Major Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Rally Today Favorable Regulatory Environment As Coinpedia reported , the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Atkins, has reiterated the importance of self-custody of crypto assets and clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi protocols. The favoring regulatory frameworks in the United States will have a ripple effect in other countries, thus enabling further crypto adoption by institutional investors. High Demand from Institutional Investors The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline in the past few years, catalyzed by the high demand from institutional investors. Strategy Inc . has led dozens of companies in implementing a Bitcoin treasury management plan. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to relentlessly accumulate, thus recording the fastest ETF growth to $70 billion in modern history. Macroeconomic Outlook BTC price has continued to grow in the recent past in tandem with the rising global liquidity.

Lee won the election with a comfortable margin earlier this month. He has since begun assembling his cabinet after making a series of pro-business crypto and stablecoin -related manifesto pledges. Kim Nam-guk: Key Ally to Take up Gov’t Position TV Chosun reported that Kim, a long-time Lee ally, is the nominee for the post of Presidential Secretary for Digital Communication. The South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-guk speaking outside a courthouse earlier this year. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) However, Kim will first have to overcome a sizable legal hurdle, as the Coin Gate controversy rumbles on. Prosecutors originally hoped to try Kim on suspicion of insider trading. The lawmaker was believed to have sold cryptoassets while serving on a National Assembly committee that dealt with crypto-related policy. However, the prosecution later decided to charge Kim with “obstructing officials in the course of their duties.” Prosecutors wanted Kim to serve a six-month jail term if found guilty. A Korean court has indefinitely postponed President Lee Jae-myung’s retrial on election law violation charges, citing the constitutional immunity granted to a sitting president. https://t.co/77zc8O6I1Y — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 9, 2025 Legal Challenges Remain Officials alleged that Kim had made “false declarations” about his cryptoassets to the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee when submitting mandatory disclosure documents. Kim was found not guilty of the charges at a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court in early February this year . The District Court judge, Justice Jeong Woo-yong, said at the time that the prosecution’s case featured “no evidence” that Kim had committed a crime. But the Prosecution Service thinks it has a strong enough case to try again. The case will be heard at the Southern District Court’s Appellate Division next month. The first hearing will take place on July 17. Kim Returning to Court in July Prosecutors continue to insist that Kim failed to correctly declare approximately 9.9 billion won ($7.3 million) worth of crypto in the period 2021-2022. With the ruling Democratic Party of Korea set to push for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act to postpone any criminal trials involving sitting presidents until they leave office, President Lee Jae-myung will likely be unaffected during his term by the ongoing criminal… — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 9, 2025 However, Kim and his legal team argued that, while declaration laws have since changed (largely as a result of the Coin Gate controversy), at the time, he did nothing wrong. Kim briefly left the Democratic Party shortly after the scandal broke. But he returned to the party under Lee’s leadership. Multiple domestic media outlets, including Hankook Ilbo , have reported that Kim is part of a core seven-member group of Democratic Party allies. The group has “supported the President since 2017,” the newspaper wrote. Their association dates back to the time when Lee made his first bid for the South Korean presidency.

Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH’s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground — if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum’s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row — a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH “still looks pre-tower top,” suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400–$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum’s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle — a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages — including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700–$2,800 region.

The New Data Is Shocking,https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-volatility-decade-low-price-rally/,"Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dropped to its lowest level since 2015, near the 10th percentile. BTC formed an ascending channel pattern, suggesting bullish continuation with a 46% upside potential. The 50-week EMA at $85,136 acts as dynamic support, maintaining the long-term bullish structure. Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to its lowest level in nearly a decade, a sign of a major structural shift in the market’s behavior. According to new data visualized by Ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility sits near the 10th percentile, meaning current market fluctuations are calmer than 90% of all weekly periods since 2015, suggesting Bitcoin is maturing into a more stable asset even as it continues its strong upward trend. This dramatic decline in volatility, which comes despite a sharp rally in May and the asset reaching new all-time highs, marks a significant change in Bitcoin’s risk profile and could make it far more attractive to a new class of institutional investors.

Despite this, the pace of investments appears to be slowing, as investors grow cautious and await clearer guidance from the US Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the broader direction of monetary policy. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin recorded $56.5 million in outflows for a second week, reflecting investor caution amid policy uncertainty. Short-Bitcoin products similarly saw $4.1 million in outflows, which represented their second consecutive week of declining interest. Ethereum continued to lead digital asset investments this week with $296.4 million in inflows, marking its seventh consecutive positive week and totaling $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 10.5% of total assets under management. This is the strongest streak of inflows since the US election in November, which indicated growing optimism among investors. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $6.6 million in outflows for the third week running. Altcoins remained mostly flat during the same period, with the exception of Sui and Chainlink, which brought in modest inflows of $1.1 million and $0.2 million. Meanwhile, XRP faced outflows of $4 million, while Solana and Cardano saw $2.1 million and $0.4 million in outflows, respectively. The United States topped weekly inflows with $175 million over the past week, while Germany followed with $47.8 million. Switzerland, Canada, and Australia contributed $15.7 million, $9.8 million, and $6.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Brazil recorded $9.2 million in outflows. Hong Kong saw $14.6 million withdrawn, ending its recent inflow surge. Sweden also reported weekly outflows totaling $7.7 million.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 548,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is attempting to move into a “price discovery uptrend.” Price discovery often refers to a process when the price of an asset moves to uncharted territory, forcing buyers and sellers to seek agreement on value. Says Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap: Bitcoin is currently in a transitional phase. Price is trying to successfully post-breakout retest its ReAccumulation Range to transition into Price Discovery Uptrend 2. A volatile retest/deviation here could occur.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital says that BTC closing above $104,400 on the week could be the key signal that it has successfully retested the demand zone and is gearing up for higher prices. “The retest continues to be successful. Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” Zooming in on the daily chart, the trader says that BTC needs to close above its immediate resistance and flip it into support to fully confirm a bullish continuation of the trend. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support… Daily Closing & retesting ~$106,600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,528.

The price jump also triggered a wave of short liquidations as the rally gained momentum. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently traded at around $110,286 , marking a 3.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now up nearly 5% over the last seven days, rebounding from a dip below $101,000 on June 5—a pullback that capped a broader decline dating back to late May. With BTC now nearing its all-time high of $111,814 set in May, market watchers are taking note. “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. “If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” Other major altcoins also rose. Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market cap, gained 4.5% to more than $2,679, and Solana (SOL) added more than 3% to hover close to $160. Even meme coins, which have struggled in recent weeks, showed signs of recovery. Dogecoin jumped 4.5%, and Shiba Inu added 2.5%. Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb The market’s uplift coincides with renewed talks between Washington and Beijing over longstanding trade tariffs—discussions that have soothed broader investor nerves. Investors seem optimistic about the potential for resolving trade disputes between the US and one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, will lead their respective delegations in negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Equities responded modestly, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edging slightly on the day. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price surge is increased crypto-related IPOs . Last week, stablecoin giant Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange and saw its shares pop over 168%, jumping from $31 to $69 within the first day of trading. Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, also filed for an IPO According to David Siemer, CEO of crypto asset management company Wave Digital Assets, while the IPO bump is likely short-term excitement, the long-term institutional positioning leads us to be bullish about Bitcoin’s continued performance in 2025. Bitcoin shorts crushed as $323M liquidated in a day In the past 24 hours, close to $323 million of crypto short positions have been liquidated, CoinGlass data shows. Most of the damage was in Bitcoin, which saw around $196 million worth of liquidations. The liquidations come amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and renewed trade tensions, which have rattled investor confidence. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows in five of the last seven trading sessions, reflecting the cautious sentiment. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed a streak of positive momentum, notching 15 consecutive days of inflows. 10X Research wrote in a report released Monday morning that Bitcoin is testing a breakout level, and the market setup appears significantly different from what most investors anticipated just weeks ago. According to the report, negative funding rates, a pattern of market bottoms, and a surprising surge in spot demand combine to create a high-conviction signal.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $323 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, rebounded from the lower border of a consolidation level of around $2,480. As a result, the ETH price has been retesting a crucial local resistance level around $2,681, whereby the Ether price was rejected four times in the past four weeks. Major Reasons Ethereum Price Will Rally Higher This Week Strong Institutional Adoption and ETF Flows According to market data analysis from CoinShares, Ethereum’s investment product dominated last week’s cash inflow with about $296 million. Notably, Ether’s investment product outpaced Bitcoin’s, which recorded a net cash outflow of about $56.5 million last week. As Coinpedia had reported , BlackRock’s ETHA has recorded significant cash inflows in the past two weeks, suggesting a strong demand from institutional clients. Altseason Sentiment Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards a new local high this week fueled by the rising narrative of altseason 2025. With Bitcoin dominance signaling an imminent market reversal, more crypto investors are betting on a major altcoin rally in the near future. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC pair is heavily oversold in the weekly timeframe, amid the recent market reversal. Regulatory Clarity Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Chair Paul Atkins highlighted that American crypto investors have the right to self-custody of crypto assets. Additionally, Chair Atkins highlighted that a new and clear set of DeFi regulations are needed to foster the development of the nascent blockchain technology. With Ethereum harboring the largest DeFi space, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $124 billion, the altcoin is well positioned to rally further in the near future.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 00:28:46

In the 30-second ad shared by Politico , a narrator warns that Democrats Zohran Mamdani, Scott Stringer and Brad Lander would make life costlier by blocking short-term rentals. The ad shows a New York Post headline about Mamdani’s proposed tax increase, alongside a message that these candidates reject “common-sense solutions” to lower living costs. It began airing on Monday across streaming, digital, and social platforms. The ad was made by a group called Affordable New York, which supports Andrew Cuomo. By showing what his rivals believe, the ad makes Cuomo look like a moderate choice. The Hotel and Gaming Trades Council has backed Cuomo, and their super PAC will put $1 million into his mayoral campaign. An Airbnb spokesperson said the group could invest another $1 million before the June 24 Democratic primary. But Bhav Tibrewal, the political director for the hotel union, criticized the move. He noted that Cuomo had clashed with unregulated rentals as governor and vowed to protect tenants and workers if elected mayor. Airbnb pushes for single-family rental exemptions amid union opposition Airbnb has urged the City Council to exempt one- and two-family homes from strict short-term rental rules, a proposal the hotel union strongly opposes. Under state law, renting a home for fewer than 30 days when the host is away is illegal. Since 2022, the city has required hosts to register, which has cut many unlawful listings. Last November, Council Member Farah Louis, backed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, introduced a bill to allow Airbnb in one- and two-family houses. After talks with the hotel union and amid “significant legal concerns,” the council quietly removed key sections of the measure in February, Louis said. Those changes halted the most controversial parts of the plan. Adams, who is also running for mayor, has not been targeted by Airbnb’s ads. The company appears to focus its criticism on candidates openly opposing its proposed exemptions for small homeowners. Stringer, who once managed the city’s finances and has often criticized Airbnb, also doesn’t want the short-term rental rules relaxed. All three say that letting Airbnb grow would make housing harder to find and push rents up. “Affordable New York was set up to back everyday New Yorkers who depend on short-term hosting for income,” said super PAC spokesperson Michael Blaustein. “These candidates keep spreading a misleading story that hosts are causing the housing crisis, despite data showing otherwise. Their rhetoric shields special interests instead of helping New Yorkers.” Lander’s campaign spokesperson, Dora Pekec, added, “While Andrew Cuomo is funded by huge corporations trying to buy their way into City Hall, Brad Lander is a man of the people and can’t be bought.” In his own statement, Stringer noted, “This isn’t the first time Airbnb has spent money to defeat me in my fight for affordable housing. I hope they used my good side in their picture.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 00:46:00

Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continues to gain traction as one of the top cryptocurrencies, fueled by surging DeFi adoption and strong developer activity. But what’s catching fire with retail traders is a new cryptocurrency priced at just $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , quickly earning a reputation as the next big crypto thanks to its low market cap, fast-growing community, and projected 50x upside. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,700 investors. More than $10.2 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. For those asking what crypto to invest in, the current momentum signals it’s time to pay close attention. XRP Consolidates While Solana Eyes New Highs Amid Market Optimism XRP is currently valued at about $2.13 as it continues to show signs of consolidation for around six months. Various analysts forecast that the stable trend of XRP around $2.00 may lead to a major breakout if XRP shatters the key $2.50 resistance level. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is currently at $146.39 and seems to be rising. Some technical indicators predict a potentially strong upward movement for XRP in the range of $180–$195 this year and there are forecasts that it may rise over $400 by the end of 2025, as more users and upgrades appear. Although XRP and SOL are attractive to investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also being noticed for the potential rewards it could generate in the quickly developing crypto market. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $10.2 million and accumulated 11,700 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik-Audited With Upcoming Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a $100,000 giveaway distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. XRP holds firm, SOL shows strength, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the one catching fire. Priced at just $0.03 with a 100% ROI expected at launch and over $10.2M raised, MUTM is a top altcoin to watch now.

Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements in a manner that’s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. “Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,” notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. “Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,” explains the analytics firm. “A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration.” Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?

That left it scrambling to prevent the loss of $223 million of its investors’ funds. Unfortunately, the team’s best efforts couldn’t stop the attacker from making away with $60M of those funds. Consequently, the DEX paused its operations momentarily to audit the incident, Fast forward to 6th June, and the firm teased about relaunching its activities two days later, boldly proclaiming, “This isn’t just about recovery or bouncing back — it’s about resilience, rebuilding, and an unwavering long-term commitment to the entire Sui ecosystem. “ This announcement tore the Cetus community right through the middle, indicating that it would take plenty of effort and goodwill from all the parties to stitch it together. While the decision to relaunch its CLMM pools service is commendable, the DEX has a long way to go in regaining its users’ trust Cetus mounts full-scale recovery after $162M attack Throughout the May 22nd debacle, the Cetus team pulled all stops to contain the situation. Together with its Sui blockchain counterparts, it managed to pause the transfer of $162M of the stolen funds. It then initiated moves to protect itself from further attacks, including identifying and patching the vulnerability that exposed it to hackers. It also rallied its community to work with Sui validators to free the assets they had quarantined after the attack. At the same time, it secured a $30M line of credit from the latter’s foundation to boost its recovery. Next, it resets all the affected pool data to its original settings while aligning it with prevailing market conditions. Additionally, it rebalanced its assets in preparation for pool refills and drew up a compensation contract for the affected. These efforts and many pledges of future enhancements did little to erase the mistrust some held on the DEX’s restart. Investors continue to express misgivings about Cetus’s relaunch Even as Cetus embarks on the audacious relaunch, it can’t play deaf to the concerns part of its community holds regarding the exercise. One such fear is that the token may turn inflationary, as some of its members suggested. Lady Cardano, for instance, was skeptical about the relaunch, suggesting that the DEX would inject 76 million new $CETUS tokens (a 5% supply increase) into circulation. The member concluded that the recipients could sell their allocations, potentially reducing the token’s value. Many members also complained that they’d lost significant portions of their investments. For example, Nikolai (@Nikolai7035) decried losing 30% of his position and swore never to return to that dump (Cetus again). His counterpart Stas (@staasbtc) reiterated this point, asking the protocol if it was using them to cover for the 30% of the liquidity lost in the hacking. It didn’t help that others could not access liquidity pools or remove their funds. If true, this latest failure indicates that technical or organizational hurdles continue to plague trust in the weapon system’s performance. As resentment over Cetus’s slow recovery of full service mounted, some investors like Wesley_ (Redwhite2626) began to call the project a scam . Reservations of such a kind reveal a lack of trust and resentment toward the team and their project. How can Cetus regain its users’s trust? If Cetus had imagined having a smooth restart after the hack, then it had another thing coming. That’s because winning over a community plagued with discontentment and mistrust is exacting. It will require more than PR stunts to pacify people who strongly feel the exchange let them down by failing to provide their investments with the protections they trusted it with. So, with time, tact, and sustained effort the protocol may still cultivate its community’s trust to the pre-hack day levels. However, it must be forthright with its users to achieve that feat. That entails coming clean on the claims that its issuance of 70M+ $CETUS tokens will erode the crypto asset’s value. It should enlighten its users on why making such a huge allocation was necessary and commit to buybacks and token burns to prop up the asset’s value. Secondly, the team should move fast to quell its users’ other concerns: they might have lost some of their funds forever. That calls for a full and timely restoration of the protocol to its pre-hack state, including a full restitution of investor positions and liquidity pools. This move will bolster users’ confidence in the project’s recovery efforts/sustainability. Again, the DEX should double down on allaying its investors’ qualms about its long-term security. Some quarters have questioned the robustness of its systems’ overhaul, given the pace of its relaunch. In this instance, a public and detailed update of the process will go a long way in easing those uncertainties. Add to the platform’s improved operability post-restart, and it’ll inspire more confidence in its offerings. Cetus’s resurgence is about more than just recovering lost funds or lost market share; it is about demonstrating that DeFi can move past its pain points. If it can use the disaster of recent weeks as a spark for reform, it may actually end up stronger, providing, over time, a more secure and stable foundation for the future. Yet, for that to occur, it will need to move beyond this moment of crisis and make security, transparency, and user trust paramount above all else. The DeFi community is watching and waiting for now but knows the next chapter is up to them to write.

The vote, which needs backing from 60 senators , paves the way for the bipartisan legislation to be passed quickly in the coming days. This came after revisions last month that attracted the support of crypto-friendly Democratic senators like Angela Alsobrooks and Mark Warner. John Thune focuses on adding competition in credit card processing with the bill The stablecoin bill is crucial as it would create rules for dollar-pegged tokens used to make payments. It is worth noting that the stablecoins must be backed by reserves kept in short-term investments, such as those overseen by federal debt or state regulators. As the Senate gets ready to vote on a stablecoin bill with support from Trump, debates have been sparked concerning the bill. Progressive Democrats have voiced concerns that the bill lacks safeguards to prevent stablecoins from endangering the financial system or being exploited by criminals. They also argue it overlooks the issue of Donald Trump profiting from his own cryptocurrency ventures. However, Thune’s move to cut off debate on the bill virtually aims that the legislation will contain language pressed by retailers and their allies in the Senate to force competition into Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. in credit card processing. To support this claim, the proposal, backed by Republican Senator Roger Marshall and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, would require major banks to let merchants choose from multiple credit card networks. This includes alternatives to Visa and Mastercard. The aim is to boost competition and reduce transaction fees for merchants. On the other hand, Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott has indicated that his committee might look at the credit card rules as separate legislation instead of including them in the stablecoin bill. This did not stop Marshall from focusing on achieving his goal. On Monday, June 9, Marshall mentioned that he was planning his next move and wanted to schedule a vote on the legislation sometime soon. A Senate aide said late Monday that talks are continuing on the bill and that senators could still offer floor amendments. The stablecoin bill faces criticism as worries grow among individuals A stablecoin linked to the Trump family has seen its market value soar past $2 billion since its announcement in March, but it has also faced criticism. However, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a key Banking Committee moderate, said he would back the measure. He also mentioned that worries about the Trump family’s business activities should not prevent progress on broader stablecoin legislation. Warner described the legislation as “not perfect but far better than what we currently have.” On the other hand, the progressive faction of the party, led by Elizabeth Warren, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, strongly opposed it. During an early vote, Warren and Senator Gillibrand had a heated exchange on the Senate floor. Warren shared a new analysis from her staff criticizing the bill for not including any bans on Trump and his family benefiting from cryptocurrencies regulated by his administration. The analysis also pointed out loopholes that could let criminals and terrorists misuse stablecoins for transactions outside traditional banks. Warren cautioned that passing this bill means they can expect more anonymous buyers—big companies and foreign governments—to use the president’s stablecoin as a secret bank account free from government oversight and as a way to pay off the president personally. She added that for criminals, it was a two-for-one deal. Bankers also worry that stablecoins might take away bank deposits and make it harder for small businesses and farmers to get loans. These groups often depend on banks for credit. So far, bankers have tried — mostly without success — to prevent big companies, like tech firms or retailers, from creating their own tokens.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading below $110,000, changing hands at $109.7K , as Asia continues its trading week. The move challenges a prevailing market narrative of summer stagnation, coming on the heels of a note from QCP Capital that emphasized suppressed volatility and a lack of immediate catalysts. A recent Telegram note from QCP pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as summer approaches. A clean break below $100K or above $110K, they wrote, would be needed to “reawaken broader market interest.” Even so, QCP warned that recent macro developments had failed to spark directional conviction. “Even as US equities rallied and gold sold off in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, BTC remained conspicuously unmoved, caught in the cross-currents without a clear macro anchor,” the note said. “Without a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging. Perpetual open interest is softening, and spot BTC ETF inflows have started to taper.” That context makes the current move all the more surprising. Over the weekend, Bitcoin surged 3.26% from $105,393 to $108,801, with hourly volume spiking to 2.5x the 24-hour average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. BTC broke decisively above $106,500, establishing new support at $107,600, and continued upward into Monday’s session, reaching $110,169. The breakout coincides with a tense macro backdrop: US-China trade talks in London and a $22 billion U.S. Treasury bond auction later this week have injected uncertainty into global markets. While these events could drive fresh volatility, QCP cautioned that recent headlines have mostly led to “knee-jerk reactions” that quickly fade. The question now is whether BTC’s move above $110K has true staying power, or whether the rally is running ahead of the fundamentals. A 'Massive Shift' in Institutional Staking May Drive ETH's Next Rally Ethereum’s critics have long highlighted centralization risks, but that narrative is fading as institutional adoption accelerates, infrastructure matures, and recent protocol upgrades directly address past limitations. “Market participants will pay for decentralization because it's in their economic interest from a security and principal protection standpoint,” Mara Schmiedt, CEO of institutional Ethereum staking platform Alluvial, told CoinDesk. “If you look at [decentralization metrics] all of these things have massively improved over the last couple of years."" There's currently $492 million worth of ETH staked by Liquid Collective – a protocol co-founded by Alluvial to facilitate institutional staking While this figure may appear modest compared to Ethereum’s total staked volume of around $93 billion, what's interesting is that it originates predominantly from institutional investors. ""We’re really on the cusp of a truly massive shift for Ethereum, driven by regulatory momentum and the ability to unlock the advantages of secure staking,"" she noted. Central to Ethereum’s institutional readiness is the recent Pectra upgrade, a significant development Schmiedt describes as both ""massive"" and ""underappreciated."" ""I think Pectra has been a massive upgrade. I actually think it’s been underappreciated, just in terms of the tremendous amount of change it introduces into the staking mechanics,"" Schmiedt said. Additionally, Execution Layer triggerable withdrawals—a key component of Pectra—provide institutional participants, including ETF issuers, a crucial compatibility upgrade. This feature enables partial validator exits directly from Ethereum’s execution layer, aligning with institutional operational requirements such as T+1 redemption timelines. ""EL triggerable withdrawals create a much more effective path to exit for large-scale market participants,"" Schmiedt added. Ultimately, Schmiedt said, ""I think we'll see that a lot more [ETH] in institutional portfolios going forward.” News Roundup Trump Media May Be the Cheapest Bitcoin Play Among Public Stocks, NYDIG Says Trump Media (DJT) may be one of the cheapest ways to get bitcoin exposure in public markets, according to a new report from NYDIG, CoinDesk recently reported. As a growing number of companies adopt MicroStrategy’s strategy of stacking BTC on their balance sheets, analysts are rethinking how to value these so-called bitcoin treasury firms. While the commonly used modified net asset value (mNAV) metric suggests that investors are paying a premium for BTC exposure, NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro argues mNAV alone is “woefully deficient.” Instead, he points to the equity premium to NAV, which factors in debt, cash, and enterprise value, as a more accurate gauge. By that measure, Trump Media and Semler Scientific (SMLR) rank as the most undervalued of eight companies analyzed, trading at equity premiums of -16% and -10% respectively, despite both showing mNAVs above 1.1. In other words, their shares are worth less than the value of the bitcoin they hold. That’s in stark contrast to MicroStrategy (MSTR), which rose nearly 5% Monday as bitcoin crossed $110,000, while DJT and SMLR remained mostly flat—making them potentially overlooked vehicles for BTC exposure. Circle Stock Nearly Quadruples Post-IPO as Bitwise and ProShares File Competing ETFs Two major ETF issuers, Bitwise and ProShares, filed proposals on June 6 to launch exchange-traded funds tied to Circle (CRCL), whose stock has nearly quadrupled since its IPO late last week, CoinDesk previously reported. ProShares is aiming for a leveraged product that delivers 2x the daily performance of CRCL. At the same time, Bitwise plans a covered call fund that generates income by selling options against held shares, two very different ways to capitalize on the stock’s explosive rise. CRCL surged another 9% Monday in volatile trading, continuing to draw interest from both traditional finance and crypto investors. The proposed ETFs have an effective date of August 20, pending SEC approval. If approved, they would further blur the lines between crypto and conventional finance, giving investors new tools to play one of the hottest post-IPO names of the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $109,795 after a 3.26% breakout fueled by institutional buying, elevated volume, and macro uncertainty from US-China trade talks and an upcoming $22B Treasury auction. ETH: Ethereum rebounded 4.46% from a low of $2,480 to close at $2,581, with strong buying volume confirming support at $2,580 and setting up a potential breakout above $2,590. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,314.45, edging up 0.08% as investors watch US-China trade talks in London and a subdued dollar keeps prices attractive. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.51%, as investors awaited updates from ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed slightly higher Monday, boosted by Amazon and Alphabet, as investors monitored U.S.-China trade talks.

The move pushed the firm’s average purchase price to $70,086, after buying at levels above $100,000 in recent weeks.

Weekly Bitcoin Purchases Continue Strategy’s drip-feed gameplan has become routine. The firm bought just under 2,000 BTC over the last two weeks, but split those into smaller chunks. That steady rhythm helps avoid big bumps in the market. It also keeps the firm in the headlines on a weekly basis. Traders watch closely. When the company buys, prices tend to move up. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRDhttps://t.co/blyWfRskjE — Strategy (@Strategy) June 9, 2025 Rather than issue new MSTR shares, Strategy tapped its STRK and STRF stocks. The latest filings show $62.7 million in STRK and $43.3 million in STRF went into Bitcoin purchases. No new common shares were registered this round. That keeps Strategy at about 0.02 BTC per MSTR share—10 times more Bitcoin per share than any other name in the sector. Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase filing with the SEC. Impact On Market Supply Corporate treasuries now hold roughly 3.4 million BTC. That stash includes what miners and governments no longer sell. It leaves less coin on the open market. Over-the-counter desks have seen their inventories drop from 236,000 BTC a month ago to just 123,500 BTC today. Even Coinbase Prime, one of the main outlets for big players, shows only 63,535 BTC available. Corporate Trends And Outlook Strategy’s moves still cast a long shadow. Only 26 other public companies have more than 1,000 BTC, and just seven hold over 10,000 BTC. On-chain data points to nearly 2,000 whale wallets that top those numbers. In the past week alone, five additional firms bought BTC, using their purchases to grab attention on social media. In all, 124 public companies have now listed Bitcoin on their balance sheets or signaled plans to buy.

The crypto space in 2025 is filled with hype, but very few projects are actually showing results. Whitepapers and fancy roadmaps aren’t enough anymore. People want visible progress, strong partnerships, and real-world use. That’s where a new set of crypto top gainers stands out. This article highlights four names, BlockDAG, AVAX, DOT, and NEAR, that are cutting through the noise. These projects are not just talking, they’re building, scaling, and showing up in places that matter. If you’re looking for projects that back bold ideas with action, keep reading. These are the ones worth watching in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: From Startup Roots to Global Reach BlockDAG is stepping onto the global stage with serious momentum. It’s rumoured to sign a potential deal with NBA, following its highly successful ongoing partnership with Inter Milan. BlockDAG isn’t chasing attention; it’s building a brand that delivers. With over $291 million raised in presale, more than 22.1 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, it has become one of the top crypto gainers for a reason. Currently in Batch 28, BlockDAG (BDAG) is priced at $0.0262. However, a limited-time offer brings that down to $0.0018, frozen until June 13th. This isn’t just a discount; it’s a clear opportunity to be part of something that’s gaining real traction. From strong numbers to bold visibility moves, BlockDAG is not just growing, it’s standing out. Among the top crypto gainers, it’s proving that strategic execution can turn a rising name into a major player. 2. AVAX: Powering Multi‑Chain Solutions Avalanche (AVAX) has built a reputation on fast, low‑fee transactions, and in 2025, it’s proving itself. This is the coin that’s all about real usage. From enterprise tools to NFT platforms and DeFi, AVAX is more than theory, it’s active. Plus, its subnets let developers create custom chains without slowing the main network. No flashy headlines here. Just steady work behind the scenes. Developers appreciate its infrastructure, and adopters value the reliability. As one of the top rated cryptos, AVAX offers a stable base for scalable apps. It’s quietly powerful, a top pick among the crypto top gainers for any serious builder. 3. DOT: Linking Blockchains with Solid Tech Polkadot (DOT) might not grab headlines with splashy deals, but its crucial technical work makes it one of the crypto top gainers. As a layer‑zero protocol, DOT links blockchains into a seamless network. This interoperability is essential for multi‑chain strategies. In 2025, parachain auctions and developer tools are gaining traction. DOT is back in the spotlight among tech‑focused audiences. It might not be glitzy, but engineering‑first clarity gives DOT its strength. For anyone building infrastructure‑driven projects, DOT is a key pick. 4. NEAR: Developer-Ready and AI-Driven NEAR Protocol brings developer ease and AI ambition. With quick transaction finality and smooth onboarding, it’s simple to create smart contracts. Already, NFAR has attracted developer attention. In 2025, NEAR is focusing on decentralized AI tools, partnering with machine‑learning startups. This clear direction makes NEAR one of the crypto top gainers that is future‑ready. While still growing, its community‑first approach and practical utilities stand out. It may not dominate headlines, but in tech circles, NEAR’s AI focus and developer ease are earning respect, another reason it’s among the top cryptos today. Which One Should You Pick? To be called a top-rated crypto in 2025, a project needs more than strong tech, it needs execution, visibility, and momentum. BlockDAG delivers all three: over $291 million raised, 2,520 % ROI delivered, 22.1 billion coins sold, and an NBA teaser after Inter Milan. It’s foreign to hype and built for impact, making it one of the standout crypto top gainers. At $0.0262 in batch 28, and a locked presale price of $0.0018 until June 13th, it gives clarity and opportunity. While AVAX shines on infrastructure and DOT powers interoperability, and NEAR leads in dev‑and‑AI usability, BlockDAG grabs the spotlight. When it comes to scale, story, and vision, it’s still the crypto top gainers leader of 2025.

Qubetics is capturing attention with its sale nearing its end and its decentralized VPN (dVPN) service. Stellar secures validation through inclusion in Nasdaq’s reconstituted crypto index, signaling mounting institutional trust. Bitcoin faces warnings of a potential “summer trap” flagged by a respected analyst. This analysis dives into each project’s fundamentals, real-world data, token trends, and risk frameworks for the top crypto coins to buy now . Qubetics and the Rise of Decentralized VPNs: Web3’s Backbone for Online Privacy Qubetics introduces a compelling utility: a decentralized VPN (dVPN) integrated directly into its blockchain ecosystem. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers vulnerable to data collection, Qubetics decentralizes the entire operation. Through a peer-to-peer architecture, users can share bandwidth, earn tokens, and navigate the internet without intermediaries. There is no central server to censor or fail, and no corporate entity to log user activity. The dVPN in Qubetics relies on blockchain-based transparency, incentivization, and encryption. Tokenized incentives, through the $TICS token, reward users who contribute bandwidth. This tokenomic model fuels a self-sustaining ecosystem, giving participants both utility and financial gain. The protocol also implements multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption. These features ensure a user’s IP address and traffic are not traceable by any single node operator. Qubetics sees its dVPN as a gateway to broader Web3 services. As users move into decentralized finance, NFTs, and decentralized storage, a secure and private network layer becomes essential. The dVPN ensures that activity across Qubetics’ ecosystem is protected, fostering a truly autonomous, censorship-resistant environment. Qubetics Presale: Scarcity Meets Demand in Final Phase Qubetics has entered its final crypto presale phase, and the numbers reflect surging demand. Over $17.8 million has been raised to date. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, distributed among over 27,700 holders. The current price sits at $0.3370, with fewer than 10 million tokens remaining. A 20% price surge is expected at listing, with the projected debut price set at $0.40. Recent changes to tokenomics are fueling further momentum. The total token supply has been drastically reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, significantly tightening future circulation. Additionally, the public allocation has increased to 38.55%, giving the community greater governance over future development. Analysts now point to scarcity, robust utility, and decentralization as core reasons for potential price appreciation post-launch. Growth Potential: A $2,000 Growth Scenario in Qubetics If a buyer purchases $TICS tokens at the current presale price of $0.3370, a $2,000 investment yields approximately 5,936 tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.40, this translates to $2,374, offering a return of 18.7%. If the token climbs to $1 after listing, the initial offering would be worth $5,936. At $5, it becomes $29,680. Should the token hit $10 after the mainnet launch, the portfolio would swell to $59,360. If it reaches $15, the initial $2,000 investment grows into $89,040—a staggering 4,349% return. While these figures are projections, they’re based on constrained supply, crypto presale momentum, and growing utility among the top crypto coins to buy now. Bitcoin: The Market Giant Enters a Cautionary Phase Bitcoin’s trajectory is always a topic of global debate. Currently, leading analysts have flagged concerns about a “summer trap” in the BTC market. This term refers to misleading bullish activity that lures investors, only to reverse into sharp corrections. Such traps have historically preceded volatile downturns. Investor sentiment has grown cautious following warnings from industry figures. Regulatory developments are adding further layers of complexity. The recent approval of a NASDAQ Crypto Index featuring Bitcoin alongside altcoins like Solana and XRP has stirred optimism. However, macroeconomic uncertainty persists. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s next policy moves and inflation data could cause further shifts in BTC pricing. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset for institutional investors and retail users alike. With its capped supply of 21 million coins and increasing mainstream exposure, it retains its appeal as a long-term hedge and one of the top crypto coins to buy now. But near-term volatility could increase, particularly as summer months bring lighter trading volumes and heightened emotional trading. Stellar’s Institutional Leap: Joining the Nasdaq Crypto Index Stellar (XLM) has seen a resurgence in market cap and relevance, largely due to its recent inclusion in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF. Now ranked 16th by market cap, Stellar is valued higher than Bitcoin Cash, a key competitor in the payments and remittance space. Inclusion in an index governed by Nasdaq is a signal of institutional confidence. It exposes Stellar to ETF-linked investments and brings its underlying protocol under a new level of scrutiny and validation. This change came during a reconstitution that also added Solana and other top-tier tokens to the benchmark. Such an endorsement can bring liquidity inflows and increased media coverage. Stellar continues to focus on its core mission of enabling cross-border payments and bridging fiat-crypto integration. Unlike Bitcoin, it offers fast settlement times and low transaction costs. Its partnerships with global financial institutions position it as a serious contender in the remittance market. Conclusion: Innovation, Adoption, and Timing Define the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Qubetics, Stellar, and Bitcoin each reflect a different side of the crypto market. Qubetics offers innovation through decentralized infrastructure, providing tools that underpin Web3’s ideals. Stellar presents institutional alignment and scalable financial utility. Bitcoin, the first and largest, commands attention through legacy and macroeconomic relevance, albeit with volatility risk in the short term. Understanding each coin’s role in the current market climate enables better decision-making. These are not just speculative assets; they represent different bets on the future of decentralized technology, financial access, and digital privacy. For those navigating the market today, these three tokens are more than trending tickers—they’re signals of where blockchain innovation is headed. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. What makes Qubetics dVPN different from traditional VPNs? Qubetics dVPN operates without a central server, using peer-to-peer architecture and blockchain rewards to ensure privacy, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. 2. How many tokens are left in Qubetics’ presale? Fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remain at the fixed price of $0.3370. This is the final presale stage before listing. 3. What is the risk of a “summer trap” in Bitcoin markets? A summer trap involves misleading bullish movements that reverse, potentially leading to steep losses. This has been flagged by analysts recently. 4. Why is Stellar’s inclusion in Nasdaq’s crypto index significant? It signals institutional approval, which may drive liquidity and increase Stellar’s visibility in the ETF investment landscape. 5. Can Qubetics’ $TICS token realistically reach $15 post-mainnet? While projections are optimistic, the reduced supply, growing ecosystem, and final-stage crypto presale dynamics lend credibility to long-term appreciation scenarios.

At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has jumped to $3.43 trillion, showing a healthy 4.22% rise in the past 24 hours. Investor sentiment has also turned positive. The Fear & Greed Index now reads 64, firmly in ‘Greed’ territory — a clear sign that traders are feeling confident about the market’s direction. So, what’s fueling this rally? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin Leads the Charge The star of the show is Bitcoin, which finally broke out of a consolidation range it had been stuck in since May 23rd. Currently trading above $109,500, Bitcoin’s breakout is being closely watched by analysts. This move was expected because of a bullish weekly candle formation called a three-inside-up pattern around the $100,000 mark. Historically, this kind of setup often leads to an 8-10% pump within a week or two. If momentum continues, some analysts believe Bitcoin could soon touch $115,000 — or even higher. Global Factors Also at Play Apart from technical signals, positive news on the macro front is also helping the rally. Reports show that trade talks between the United States and China have resumed, easing global market tensions. This, combined with growing institutional interest, has boosted investor confidence. Altcoins Follow Suit Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins are also climbing. Ethereum is up over 8% this week, now trading at $2,699, while Solana and Dogecoin have surged 5% and 6.6% respectively. Interestingly, Sui (SUI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have posted impressive double-digit gains. The Altcoin Season Index, however, remains at 30 out of 100, meaning that while altcoins are rallying, a full-fledged alt season hasn’t arrived yet.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 02:16:03

This move is in line with a broader recovery in the crypto market, with Bitcoin climbing steadily and Ethereum leading the pack with an 8% surge. As Ethereum moves higher, many smaller altcoins like XRP are following the trend. XRP also continues to display a bullish divergence, a signal where the price makes lower lows, but indicators like the RSI show higher lows. This often hints at a possible price bounce. XRP Finds Support, Eyes New Targets Looking at the daily charts, XRP recently bounced off a key support zone between $2.00 and $2.10. This area has proven strong in the past, with prices rebounding from here several times. If the price falls below $2.00, analysts warn that it could drop toward $1.92-$1.95, and possibly as low as $1.80. But for now, the bullish momentum is holding. Bullish Pattern Taking Shape A positive sign for XRP is the formation of a double bottom pattern — also known as a W pattern — on the charts. This pattern often signals a potential upward breakout. If this pattern plays out fully, the next price target would be around $2.44. However, before reaching that level, XRP could face some resistance near $2.35, an area that previously acted as both support and resistance. Long-Term Outlook: Could $5 Be Next? XRP appears to be in the middle of a fifth wave to the upside. This wave started in April after a market correction and could possibly push prices above $5.00 in the coming months, provided current support levels hold. If XRP stays above the April lows and maintains its upward structure, analysts believe the bullish trend could continue. However, a break below those key support areas might delay the rally, meaning that the market is still working through a correction phase.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 02:51:11

Although DOGE is still a cultural emblem with great community support, its expansion mostly depends on sentiment and market cycles. By means of combining artificial intelligence with blockchain architecture, Lightchain AI presents a utility-oriented alternative. Also, Lightchain AI, priced at $0.007 during its presale and already generating $18.3 million, is becoming rather popular among long-term value seekers and the issue now is whether this DeFi-driven token will outperform returns motivated by memes going forward. Can Meme Power Still Provide Significant Returns for Dogecoin? The rise of Dogecoin in 2021 demonstrated how strong meme culture is in influencing bitcoin values and at the time of writing, DOGE is roughly trading at $0.1848 on June 7, 2025 with about 2.54% value increase over the past 24 hours. Recent developments like the addition of Dogecoin to distributed finance (DeFi) systems have been adding to its utility outside its meme past. Apart from this, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust marks the growing institutional curiosity in it. Nonetheless, the coin has to cope with issues including significant price swings and little technological difference from other rivals. Though the main driver of DOGE has been meme rage, future performance of the meme may be mostly dependent on more general use and technological development rather than being only meme-oriented. Before considering Dogecoin as their next investment, traders should, nevertheless, be especially alert and do thorough investigation. Lightchain AI Gains Ground as DeFi Investors Eye Stronger Fundamentals As DeFi investors give stronger basics top priority over hype, Lightchain AI is becoming more and more relevant. Its system is set up for efficiency; artificial intelligence chores are split up, handled by contributor nodes, and checked with cryptographic proof before integration guarantees flawless operations. Low latency made possible by this makes the platform perfect for real-time artificial intelligence uses. By providing developers tools to create intelligent, distributed applications driven by the AIVM, Lightchain AI also promotes strong dApp development. Supported by strong tokenomics , 40% of LCAI tokens go toward presale, 28.5% to staking incentives, and the rest go toward liquidity, marketing, Treasury, team shares. These principles make Lightchain AI a unique for long-term value that draws intelligent investors in the changing DeFi scene. Bet Now on Lightchain AI for Future Serious Long-Term Development Possibilities Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to open countless opportunities across sectors including finance, healthcare, and more, Lightchain AI is guiding long-term success in the DeFi space. Emphasizing utility and practical applications, this project is not merely riding the wave but rather is helping to shape the future. Supported by strong principles and an innovative vision, Lightchain AI has great potential to provide investors outstanding returns. Looking beyond the hype, this project stands out as a wise decision as DeFi keeps expanding and attracting the attention of institutional players. Ignite the transient buzz of meme coins such as Dogecoin. For those hoping to leverage the future of DeFi, Lightchain AI presents a sustainable, forward-looking investment choice.

The price is now consolidating and might aim for an upward move above the $2.320 resistance. XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.220 zone. The price is now trading above $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.320 resistance zone. XRP Price Aims Fresh Increase XRP price formed a base and started a fresh increase from the $2.050 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move above the $2.120 and $2.20 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2.25 level. Finally, the price tested the $2.320 resistance. A high was formed at $2.3294 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high. The price is now trading above $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.350 level. The next resistance is $2.40. A clear move above the $2.40 resistance might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.480 resistance or even $2.50 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.550. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $2.320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.2750 level. The next major support is near the $2.250 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high.

This week’s Bitcoin price prediction leans bullish, following a sharp recovery from the previous week’s dip below $100,400, triggered by the Trump-Musk spat, and a strong bounce fueled by U.S. jobs data and renewed risk appetite. Investors are now watching U.S.–China trade talks in London, a key geopolitical event that may impact risk markets. So far, Bitcoin has remained resilient above $109,000, signaling investor confidence. What’s keeping Bitcoin steady? Apart from macro support, institutional participation is growing fast: Over 80 publicly traded companies (e.g., MicroStrategy, GameStop) now hold BTC The U.S. government owns nearly 200,000 BTC, according to blockchain data Gemini’s IPO filing points to sustained investor interest in crypto firms Together, these factors add legitimacy and long-term demand strength, bolstering bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $111.8K On the technical side, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as BTC approaches the upper trendline of its ascending channel, testing resistance near $111,848. A breakout here would confirm the bullish continuation setup and target higher resistance levels at $115,103 and $118,358. The daily RSI is holding at 61, signaling positive momentum but leaving room before overbought conditions emerge. Also worth noting: the June 7 bullish engulfing candle, which often marks a return to trend after a retracement. Bitcoin price prediction: short-term trade idea Entry: Confirmed daily close above $111,848 Stop-loss: Below $107,616 Target 1: $115,103 Target 2: $118,358 Watch for: RSI divergence or rejection at $111.8K This bullish setup remains valid as long as BTC stays above the lower channel trendline near $107,000. Crackdowns and M&A Signal Maturing Market Beyond price, structural developments are helping shape Bitcoin’s evolving reputation. In Australia, authorities have just charged four money laundering rings involving $123 million in cryptocurrency, showing that even illicit crypto activity can be traced, which boosts trust in blockchain transparency. $NCPL buys Mixie, a blockchain-native platform building infrastructure and tools for Web3 games, creator media, and decentralized community engagement. pic.twitter.com/gRzkZzSyi2 — Joey Rattlesnake (@tallahassee_m) June 9, 2025 Meanwhile, Netcapital (NCPL) acquired the crypto-native platform Mixie, marking a significant step in crypto mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The fintech firm said the deal enhances its Web3 capabilities, reflecting broader institutional interest. This follows a 2025 trend of consolidation led by players like Coinbase and Ripple. These headlines support the broader Bitcoin price prediction narrative: strong demand, growing corporate adoption, and tightening legal clarity are laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next leg up. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $821K—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is taking off as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2, combining speed, scalability, and meme culture. Built to fix Bitcoin’s most significant flaws—slow transactions and high fees—it leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC ecosystem. With over $821,823 already raised, early adopters are betting big on its blend of tech innovation and meme appeal. Core Features That Set It Apart What makes Bitcoin Hyper different? It’s the only Bitcoin-based Layer 2 that combines the speed of SVM with the security of BTC’s base layer. The Canonical Bridge allows seamless BTC transfers, while low-cost gas fees and high-speed execution empower dApps, meme coins, payments, and more. Audited by Consult, it’s built for speed, trust, and scale. Staking Rewards and Utility $HYPER isn’t just a token; it powers the ecosystem. Users can stake it for high APY rewards post-launch, use it for gas fees, and access premium decentralized applications (dApps). Plus, active holders can earn bonuses via governance and early adoption initiatives. That’s real utility in a meme-capable package. Presale Now Live—Don’t Miss the Price Jump The public presale is now live, with 1 $HYPER priced at $0.011825. Over 90% of the funding goal has already been raised.

With strong presale results and innovative tech, Ruvi AI is one of the hottest new projects in crypto. Tron’s loyal investor base, who support decentralized content, are now looking at Ruvi AI’s potential in blockchain and AI, making RUVI a top pick for 2025. Tron (TRX): A Foundation in Decentralization Since 2017, Tron (TRX) has been the backbone of decentralized content sharing. With its cutting edge blockchain architecture, Tron allows creators to share content directly with users, eliminating intermediaries. This empowers creators and reduces fees and increases scalability, Tron can process up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). Tron expanded its reach through strategic acquisitions, including the popular BitTorrent platform, solidifying its position in the peer to peer sharing economy. But competition in the blockchain space has increased and some investors are looking for new projects that combine blockchain with other technologies.

The recovery comes after last week’s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha’s analysis titled “On-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin’s Next Leg Higher,” Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D–1W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months.

Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin’s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning.

Alibaba’s Qwen and Tencent’s Yuanbao also disabled image recognition functionalities during exam hours . In addition to the measures taken by private AI companies, Chinese authorities also implemented a set of methods to prevent cheating attempts. These include biometric verifications, signal jamming, strict filtering of digital devices, and video surveillance to detect abnormal behavior during exams. Data released by the Chinese Ministry of Education (MoE) also confirmed the number of candidates for this year’s Gaokao is roughly 13.35M, ~70K fewer than last year. The Gaokao consists of three compulsory subjects, including Chinese, Math, and English, with exam questions set by the MoE. AI chatbots refuse to answer questions during exam hours 6月8日，接连有网友投稿称，国内的诸多AI在高考期间都暂停了服务，有学生让AI解读代码，遭到AI以“高考”为由拒绝解读。 pic.twitter.com/J24Fy5n9v0 — 李老师不是你老师 (@whyyoutouzhele) June 8, 2025 Qwen and Doubao still offered photo recognition as of Monday but refused to answer when asked questions about a photo of a test paper. Qwen responded that the service was temporarily frozen during exam hours from June 7 to 10, while Doubao said the picture uploaded was “not in compliance with rules.” The Doubao and DeepSeek applications also displayed automated messages announcing the temporary restriction of services, explaining that it was only during the examination tests. Yuanbao and Kimi suspended photo-recognition services during the hours when the multi-day exams took place across the country. The chatbots responded, “To ensure the fairness of the college entrance examinations, this function cannot be used during the test period.” However, none of the AI firms gave an official statement about suspending AI chatbots during the exam period. University students reportedly spread the information on the Chinese social media platform Weibo when they could not access the AI chatbots’ services to study during those exam hours. In addition to suspending AI tools to curb exam irregularities, school administrations in several regions in China announced that they would use AI to watch for “abnormal behaviors,” such as whispers or repeated glances between students during exams. East China’s Jiangxi Province will deploy an AI-powered, real-time surveillance system for all 567,100 candidates. The system will utilize deep learning algorithms to monitor irregular behavior by both examinees and exam invigilators in real time. Actions such as starting early, turning one’s head, passing items, or leaving mid-exam will be flagged and recorded. Exam room footage will be reviewed after the exam, and any violations or misconduct will be dealt with strictly per relevant regulations. Ding calls for fairness as the Education Ministry issues AI guidelines China’s Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang this week called for a “safe gaokao,” stressing the importance of a campaign against cheating. Last month, the Education Ministry also released a set of regulations stating that while schools should start cultivating AI talent at a young age, students should not use AI-generated content as answers to tests. The 2025 edition of the guideline aimed to standardize the ethical and appropriate use of generative AI while addressing privacy risks, academic integrity, and overreliance on technology. A senior Education Ministry committee official said the restrictions were meant to ensure age-appropriate use of AI and prevent younger students from becoming overly dependent on the technology. Primary school students were prohibited from independently using AI tools that generated open-ended content, while educators must ensure that AI can complement but not replace human-led teaching. Middle school students were allowed to explore the logical structure of AI-generated content. In contrast, high school students could engage in inquiry-based learning that involved understanding AI’s technical principles. The guideline also asked educational authorities to formulate localized AI management policies, establish data protection rules, launch ethical review mechanisms, and create dynamic “whitelists” of approved AI tools . Teachers were required to ensure that AI played only a supplementary role in education. The ministry said it will increase investment in AI education infrastructure and gradually establish AI education bases in primary and secondary schools. It also plans to offer more training programs for teachers to improve their understanding and use of AI tools. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Cardano (ADA) holders are taking notice and industry experts are predicting explosive returns on investment (ROI) for early backers by 2025. But what’s behind the hype? And how does Ruvi AI differ from Cardano, one of the biggest blockchain platforms in the crypto space? Whether you’re an experienced investor or just looking for new opportunities, this shift from ADA to RUVI is worth understanding. From their tech to growth potential, there’s a lot to unpack. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain OG Cardano is a well known name in the crypto space and has built a reputation as one of the most reliable and sustainable blockchain platforms. Their Ouroboros proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol made them a green alternative to energy hungry proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin. But no project is immune to market competition. Diversification is always top of mind for forward thinking investors and now Ruvi AI is emerging as a great opportunity for those looking to maximize returns and get in on the next big blockchain wave. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain + AI Ruvi AI is no ordinary cryptocurrency. It’s a leap forward, blockchain + AI. This decentralized superapp isn’t just for trading or holding, it’s designed to solve real world problems for businesses and individuals. Ruvi AI allows users to create AI driven content in almost any format imaginable, text, audio, video, image creation. This benefits industries like marketing, content production and workflow optimization by providing tools that are efficient, secure and adaptive. At the heart of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token which powers the platform and has real utility. It enables seamless transactions, provides token holders with staking rewards and governance rights within the community. Unlike speculative ventures Ruvi AI has real world use cases that make it a future proof project capable of industry disruption. When you combine blockchain’s security with AI’s limitless possibilities you get a technology that’s not only innovative but practical. Ruvi AI’s Presale is a Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is best measured by its presale success. Phase 1 launched at $0.010 and sold out in 2 weeks. Phase 2 increased by 50% to $0.015 and those who joined early got rewarded. Presale has already attracted over 1,400 investors and raised $1.5 million. Ruvi AI is on the move. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI has already listed on an exchange and partnered with a major trading platform to expand its reach. More announcements coming soon. Ruvi AI is building for long term and keeping the momentum going. For those looking for the next big project in the crypto space Ruvi AI is not to be missed. What Do the Numbers Say About RUVI? For investors Ruvi AI’s presale is not just an entry point into a new project, it’s an opportunity for massive capital growth. Here’s a breakdown of the potential returns across 3 investment tiers: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI (Cost = $750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $4,900 (553% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI (Cost = $1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $11,200 (647% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI (Cost = $7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Potential Returns At $0.07 Listing Price: $7,500 (833% ROI) At $1 Post-Launch Price: $75,000 (13,233% ROI) Why Cardano (ADA) Holders Are Switching to RUVI The migration of Cardano holders to Ruvi AI can be attributed to: Technological Advancement Ruvi AI’s blockchain + AI is a leap forward that Cardano doesn’t offer, so those looking for advanced solutions are switching. Clear Signs of Growth Strong presale, early listings and growing community all point to a well structured and scalable project. Real World Utility Unlike tokens that rely on speculation Ruvi AI solves real world problems with practical applications so investors can bet on it. Massive Upside With analysts predicting explosive ROI and low entry price, early adoption could be huge.

45746682,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25383,1749527546,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,BIP177 và cuộc tranh cãi về cái tên Bitcoin?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/bip177-va-cuoc-tranh-cai-ve-cai-ten-bitcoin/,"Cuộc tranh luận lâu năm về việc đặt tên gọi Bitcoin cho số đơn vị sau dấu thập phân phần nào phản ánh mâu thuẫn giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng của Bitcoin trong đời sống. Một đề xuất nổi bật là loại bỏ dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” (số nhiều) làm đơn vị nhỏ nhất thay vì satoshi. Dù satoshi đã trở nên phổ biến, một số người cho rằng “bit” – bằng 100 satoshi – sẽ thân thiện hơn với người dùng đại chúng, đặc biệt khi giá Bitcoin tăng cao. Gần đây, BIP 177 – do John Carvalho (CEO Synonym) đề xuất – đã làm nóng cuộc tranh luận. BIP 177 muốn bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” làm đơn vị hiển thị mặc định. Tuy nhiên, giống như các nâng cấp trước đó như SegWit hay Taproot, sự thay đổi này đòi hỏi thời gian dài thảo luận, thử nghiệm và sự đồng thuận từ cộng đồng. Thành công của BIP 177 phụ thuộc không chỉ vào chất lượng kỹ thuật mà còn vào mức độ sẵn sàng thay đổi của cộng đồng Bitcoin. Sau 16 năm, tại sao vẫn tranh luận về tên đơn vị nhỏ nhất của BTC? Bitcoin, với tư cách là tài sản kỹ thuật số, có thể chia nhỏ thành những đơn vị cực kỳ bé để hỗ trợ nhiều loại hoạt động kinh tế, từ các giao dịch giá trị cao đến các microtransaction. Đơn vị nổi tiếng nhất chính là “satoshi,” đại diện cho 1/100.000.000 của một bitcoin. Thuật ngữ “satoshi” lần đầu tiên được đề xuất trên diễn đàn Bitcointalk.org năm 2010 bởi một người dùng có nickname Ribuck, người cũng gợi ý tên gọi “austrian” để tôn vinh Trường phái Kinh tế Áo. Theo thời gian, cộng đồng đã chọn “satoshi” làm đơn vị nguyên tử của Bitcoin, vừa để vinh danh người sáng lập bí ẩn Satoshi Nakamoto, vừa tạo ra một ngôn ngữ văn hóa ngắn gọn như “stacking sats.” Tuy nhiên, một đơn vị khác – “bit,” tương đương với 100 satoshis hoặc 1/1.000.000 của một bitcoin – cũng từng được đề xuất vì tính trực quan hơn. Một số giọng nói nổi bật như Adam Back đã ủng hộ việc hồi sinh “bits,” lý luận rằng nếu giá Bitcoin đạt mức 1 triệu đô la, thì 1 bit sẽ bằng 1 đô la, giúp việc chuyển đổi dễ dàng hơn. Như vậy, cuộc tranh luận giữa “sats” và “bits” không chỉ là vấn đề kỹ thuật mà còn là câu chuyện giữa truyền thống và thiết kế thân thiện với người dùng. Hiện tại, Bitcoin có nhiều đơn vị khác nhau: BTC, mBTC (millibitcoin), µBTC (microbitcoin hoặc “bits”), và satoshis. Điều này có thể gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người không chuyên về công nghệ. Một bitcoin (1 BTC) bằng 1.000 mBTC, 1.000.000 bits, hoặc 100.000.000 satoshis. Sự đa dạng này tạo ra độ phức tạp không cần thiết, đặc biệt khi người dùng phải đối mặt với các con số nhỏ như 0.000043 BTC hoặc 4300 satoshis. Theo BIP 177, một bitcoin đầy đủ – tức 100 triệu satoshis – có thể được gọi là “Mega Bitcoin.” Việc loại bỏ dấu thập phân và chuẩn hóa đơn vị thành “bitcoins” sẽ giúp giảm bớt cảm giác xa lạ và kỹ thuật hóa, mang lại cảm giác gần gũi hơn với người dùng phổ thông. BIP 177 , do CEO Synonym John Carvalho đề xuất, nhằm mục đích thay đổi cách hiểu thông thường về đơn vị Bitcoin bằng cách sử dụng đơn vị nhỏ nhất (đơn vị nguyên tố) làm tiêu chuẩn hiển thị. Thay vì biểu diễn giá trị Bitcoin dưới dạng thập phân (ví dụ: 0.00004321 BTC), BIP 177 khuyến nghị loại bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và gọi mỗi đơn vị cơ bản là “1 bitcoin.” Với mô hình này, điều từng được gọi là “1 satoshi” (1/100.000.000 BTC) giờ đây sẽ đơn giản là “1 bitcoin.” Các nhà ủng hộ cho rằng hệ thập phân là di sản UI lỗi thời gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người mới tham gia. Mặc dù BIP 177 không thay đổi quy tắc đồng thuận hay dữ liệu trên chuỗi, nhưng nó yêu cầu một sự thay đổi đồng bộ trong giao diện ví và sàn giao dịch, đồng thời đối mặt với thách thức văn hóa khi phải thay thế thuật ngữ “sats” đã ăn sâu bén rễ. Bitkit Wallet là ví đầu tiên áp dụng BIP 177 Bitkit Wallet, phát triển bởi Synonym – một công ty “chị em” của Bitfinex – là ví tự quản lý tập trung vào trải nghiệm người dùng thân thiện, giúp mọi người dễ dàng gia nhập hệ sinh thái Bitcoin. Bitkit tích hợp nhiều tính năng tiên tiến như nút Lightning tích hợp sẵn, thanh toán qua định danh phi tập trung (DIDs), và sao lưu mượt mà qua đám mây mã hóa. Điều khiến Bitkit nổi bật là việc áp dụng sớm và nhiệt tình tiêu chuẩn BIP 177. Thay vì sử dụng BTC hoặc các phân số phức tạp như mBTC, ví Bitkit hiển thị giá trị theo “bitcoins,” giúp người dùng dễ hiểu hơn. Ví dụ, thay vì hiển thị “0.000043 BTC,” Bitkit sẽ hiển thị “43 bitcoins.” Điều này biến Bitcoin từ một loại tiền tệ kỹ thuật khó hiểu thành một phương tiện trao đổi quen thuộc, giống như cách chúng ta sử dụng xu hoặc satoshi. Liệu BIP 177 có nhận được sự ủng hộ đủ lớn để tồn tại lâu dài? Hiện chưa rõ BIP 177 có được cộng đồng chấp nhận rộng rãi hay không, dù đã có một số công ty như Square của Jack Dorsey bắt đầu áp dụng. Các ví và sàn lớn vẫn ưu tiên BTC hay satoshi, cho thấy xu hướng bảo thủ trong cộng đồng Bitcoin. Nhìn lại lịch sử, những thay đổi dù có lợi rõ ràng về mặt kỹ thuật như SegWit ( BIP 141 ) hay Taproot ( BIP 341 ) cũng phải mất vài năm mới được chấp nhận. SegWit chẳng hạn, được đề xuất từ 2015 nhưng đến tận 2017 mới được kích hoạt, sau hàng loạt tranh luận và một cuộc nội chiến trong cộng đồng, gồm cả UASF và các cuộc chạy đua giữa thợ đào. Quá trình thay đổi tiêu chuẩn đã định hình luôn khó khăn, đặc biệt khi liên quan đến giao diện người dùng. Nhiều người dùng và lập trình viên không muốn thay đổi thói quen, dù đề xuất có lợi về mặt trải nghiệm. Thiếu sự phối hợp từ các bên lớn như ví, nền tảng thanh toán, giáo dục – BIP 177 có nguy cơ chỉ dừng lại ở ý tưởng tốt nhưng không được triển khai. Trong hệ sinh thái Bitcoin, BIP là những đề xuất cải tiến – từ giao thức đến giao diện. Một số BIP cần đồng thuận toàn mạng (ví dụ SegWit hay Taproot), còn BIP 177 thuộc dạng tự nguyện áp dụng. Nhưng kể cả vậy, mọi thay đổi có ý nghĩa đều phải vượt qua cộng đồng phân mảnh, thận trọng và hoài nghi. Vấn đề nằm ở cách vận hành của cộng đồng Bitcoin: phi tập trung, cẩn trọng và không ai có quyền ra lệnh thay đổi. BIP 177 là thay đổi không cần đồng thuận toàn mạng, nhưng vẫn phải dựa vào sự tự nguyện của các nhà phát triển và dịch vụ. Khi 1 satoshi dần tiệm cận giá trị 1 đô, cách hiển thị trực quan hơn như BIP 177 (dùng “bit”) có thể giúp giao dịch hàng ngày dễ hiểu hơn. Hiện tại, một số dự án như Spiral , Square , Workit và Cashu đang trong quá trình triển khai BIP 177 ở các mức độ khác nhau. Trong một hệ thống mà mặc định là “không thay đổi”, ngay cả một cải tiến nhỏ như BIP 177 cũng phải đối mặt với rào cản cao để được công nhận chính thức. Tóm Lại Là: Cuộc tranh luận về tên gọi đơn vị Bitcoin phản ánh sự cân bằng giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng. Dù “satoshi” đã trở thành biểu tượng văn hóa, “bit” hay “bitcoins” có thể mở ra cánh cửa cho việc áp dụng rộng rãi hơn. Với sự dẫn đầu của các dự án như Bitkit Wallet và tiềm năng từ các công ty lớn như Square, BIP 177 có cơ hội tạo ra một bước ngoặt trong cách chúng ta nhìn nhận và sử dụng Bitcoin. Trong thế giới Bitcoin, mọi thay đổi dù nhỏ cũng cần thời gian, kiểm chứng và sự đồng thuận rộng rãi. Liệu BIP 177 có trở thành chuẩn mực hay chỉ là một ý tưởng thú vị? Hãy cùng chờ xem!

Ruvi AI (RUVI) Might Have the Edge Over Avalanche (AVAX),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-token-are-analysts-betting-on-for-the-2025-bull-run-ruvi-ai-ruvi-might-have-the-edge-over-avalanche-avax/,"With the 2025 bull run on the horizon, investors are looking for tokens that will deliver. Analysts are zeroing in on Ruvi AI (RUVI) as a strong contender to outshine Avalanche (AVAX). While both tokens have their own opportunities, Ruvi AI’s growth trajectory and innovative approach might just give it the edge. Avalanche (AVAX): The Standard for Scalability and dApps Avalanche has built its reputation as a blockchain that solves some of the industry’s biggest problems. It’s known for its scalability and can process over 4,500 transactions per second thanks to its unique consensus protocol. This has made Avalanche the go-to for dApp developers across finance, gaming and more. Over the years Avalanche has established itself in the crypto space with a thriving DeFi ecosystem and partnerships with big organizations. But some analysts think AVAX’s growth is slowing as the market looks for the next big disruptor. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Ruvi AI is making waves with its blockchain-AI hybrid. The platform is a decentralized superapp where users can generate AI-driven text, audio, video and image content. This makes Ruvi AI the perfect disruptor for industries that rely on creative automation, marketing and workflow optimization. The $RUVI token is the lifeblood of the ecosystem, powering transactions, offering staking rewards and governance rights to holders. By delivering real-world utility in a decentralized framework, Ruvi AI is setting itself up as a leader in next-gen crypto projects. Ruvi AI’s Presale is Booming Ruvi AI’s presale is hot. Phase 1 sold out in just two weeks at $0.010 per token. Phase 2 is now live at $0.015. That’s a 50% increase in value for early backers and more proof of concept. Over 1,400 have already joined the Ruvi AI community.Key highlights include Ruvi AI’s first exchange listing and a partnership with a major trading platform which has increased liquidity and accessibility. More to come as the project is getting attention from across the crypto space. Ruvi AI has raised $1.6 million so far. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI For investors looking to maximize returns Ruvi AI’s presale has tiered VIP options with bonuses. Below are three scenarios based on the presale token price of $0.015, the $0.07 listing price and a projected $1 post-listing value: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). Why RUVI? Ruvi AI stands out in the crypto space for several reasons: Innovative Technology : Blockchain + AI = solving real world problems and new opportunities Results : Phase 1 sold out fast, Phase 2 growing fast. Investors are confident Transparency and Governance : Decentralized governance = community involvement and long term Strategic Growth : Exchange listings, partnerships and more, building for long term Conclusion Avalanche (AVAX) is a well known name in crypto but Ruvi AI’s blockchain + AI makes it a 2025 bull run disruptor. Analysts are expecting big growth, Ruvi AI might be the edge you’re looking for. Presale won’t last forever. For investors looking for innovation and returns, now is the time to get in.

Since 2022, it has formed through real-world use cases, not speculation, as Pioneers exchanged goods and services using PiCoin in a closed-loop economy. It reflects a community-agreed value rather than market prices listed on centralized exchanges. Crypto advocates, including @gfc199 and others, argue that this bottom-up value model is what kept the project alive during years of development. The Numbers Behind the Concern According to the analyst, most Pioneers hold fewer than 300 PiCoin. With exchange prices hovering around just $0.63, this means their holdings are valued at less than $200, far from the life-changing potential many had envisioned. The fear now is that if the Core Team remains silent on GCV or continues to delay its recognition, Pioneers may lose faith entirely. This could trigger a mass sell-off and further disconnect from the network. A Call to Action Before It’s Too Late The upcoming Pi Day 2 celebration could serve as a key inflection point for Pi cryptocurrency. Scheduled for June 28, this event, also known as Tau Day, is expected to reignite discussion around the project and may include major announcements from the Pi Core Team. According to the crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin , the Pi market is consolidating ahead of Pi Day 2, with a potential recovery expected as unlocks slow and investor confidence builds. Interestingly, recognizing GCV isn’t about bending to pressure; it’s about honoring the years of effort poured into the project by its most loyal supporters.

With important legal updates and market developments, many are keeping a close eye on where XRP could head next. Price predictions are making the rounds, and some are turning heads. A user on X (formerly Twitter) says that a $10,000 XRP isn’t impossible, and those dismissing the idea might be overlooking the bigger picture. According to the post, this isn’t just hype. It’s about the numbers, market dynamics, and global financial flows coming together. Dollar’s Decline and XRP’s Rising Role Since 1971, the dollar has lost 96% of its value. With national debt crossing $34 trillion and over $1 trillion spent on interest payments every year, the situation is becoming unsustainable. If the Federal Reserve continues printing more money, the dollar’s value could fall even further, leading to shifts in how assets like gold, cryptocurrencies, and real estate are priced. The Real World Asset (RWA) market could reach $16-30 trillion by 2030, given that big players, such as BlackRock and JPMorgan, are already in. These assets require speed, compliance, and cross-network support, and here’s where XRP enters. XRP: Built to Scale The user said that XRP’s infrastructure is already built for institutions. Supporting this statement, the user gave examples and said that RippleNet connects 300+ banks, ODL is active across 6 continents, RLUSD is a regulated stablecoin, and Ripple Custody secures digital assets. If XRP handles just a slice of global FX, tokenized assets, and debt markets, even at modest transaction speed, it could skyrocket. Its limited supply and high demand could send the price soaring. Is It Just A Wild Prediction? For XRP to reach $10,000, its total value would need to be around $530 trillion, which is not realistic. So, unless XRP powers nearly all global finance, that price is highly unlikely anytime soon. Short Term Price Targets XRP is currently trading at $2.30, up 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

The charges come after an 18-month investigation led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) through the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), in collaboration with Queensland Police, Australian Border Force, AUSTRAC, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and the Australian Taxation Office. Money Laundering Organisation Dismantled According to the official press release of the Australian Taxation Office, the multi-agency probe culminated last week in 14 search warrants executed across Brisbane and the Gold Coast, targeting a scheme alleged to have funneled criminal proceeds through a complex web of businesses, bank accounts, and crypto exchanges. At the centre of the case is a Gold Coast-based security company, whose director, a 48-year-old Maudsland man, and general manager, a 35-year-old woman, have been charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime worth almost $6.5 million. The business allegedly blended legitimate cash transport operations with illicit funds sourced from organised crime groups, which were collected from secret dead-drop locations nationwide and flown into Queensland disguised as domestic cargo. The laundered money was then allegedly transferred into crypto assets or paid out via shell companies, including a promotions business and a classic car dealership. Crypto Wallets, Luxury Assets, Forged Documents Seized A 32-year-old Brisbane man from Heathwood, said to be a major client of the operation, is accused of laundering $6.167 million over 15 months and was charged with multiple offences, including failing to provide access to a secured mobile phone. Authorities allege he controlled the promotions company used to obscure the movement of funds while naming his wife as a straw director. Another Brisbane man, 58, from West End, allegedly received $4.15 million through a classic car business and routed it into the network using multiple bank accounts to conceal the source of the money. He faces four charges, including money laundering, uttering a forged document, and dealing with identification information for an indictable offence. In total, authorities have restrained about millions in assets suspected of being criminal proceeds, including 17 properties, vehicles, and bank accounts across Queensland and New South Wales. During the raids, investigators seized encrypted devices, business records, $30,000 in cash, and crypto wallets containing approximately $110,370 in digital assets. In a statement, AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said, “We allege this organisation intentionally concealed and disguised the source, value and nature of their illicit money, and distanced themselves from the funds to try to avoid getting caught by authorities. This plot was elaborate and calculated, and it demonstrates the lengths criminals will go to make money.” The post Four Charged in $123M Queensland Crypto Laundering Scheme, AFP Says appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Australia,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-10 04:15:01

Andrew Small, a former economic crime investigator with the police, will lead the charge as crypto ownership becomes increasingly common in insolvency proceedings. His appointment reflects a sharp rise in the number and value of crypto-related cases over the past five years. In 2024–25, the agency identified over £520,000 (about $660,000) worth of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases, up from just £1,436 (around $1,820) in 14 cases in 2019–20. Insolvencies with crypto as asset up 420% in 5 years Over £500,000 crypto in insolvency cases last year Ex-police investigator appointed to trace digital assets in criminal cases Insolvency Service hires first crypto expert to help recover funds from bankruptcy cases — Insolvency Service (@insolvencygovuk) June 9, 2025 Rising Crypto Ownership Forces UK to Bolster Asset Recovery Capabilities The move follows growing concerns about hidden or difficult-to-trace wealth in insolvency and enforcement work. With more than 7m UK adults now holding some form of cryptocurrency , according to the Financial Conduct Authority, digital assets are becoming a key part of the personal finance landscape. As a result, they are also showing up more frequently in bankruptcy and fraud investigations. Small will operate within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, focusing primarily on criminal cases. He is expected to provide frontline investigators with technical guidance on how digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and NFTs are stored, traded, and concealed. “There has been a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK, and alongside that, we’ve seen a similar rise in cryptoasset ownership in bankruptcy cases,” said Small. “My role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of cryptoassets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell and store them.” New Crypto Role Aims to Close Gaps in UK Asset Recovery Framework The appointment is expected to have a significant impact on crypto seizures, particularly Bitcoin. As the agency strengthens its ability to detect and recover digital assets, individuals and companies facing insolvency or criminal investigations will find it increasingly difficult to hide wealth in cryptocurrencies. For those attempting to use crypto as a shield, the risks of detection and seizure are now markedly higher. Officials say the new role is a critical part of returning more value to creditors. The agency’s expanding mandate includes tracing assets, as well as recovering them on behalf of creditors. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said the growing complexity of asset holdings made it essential to bring in experts. “Andrew brings a wealth of knowledge to this role,” he noted, adding that his background would strengthen the agency’s ability to deal with crypto-heavy cases. The appointment signals a more aggressive and informed approach to digital asset enforcement in the UK, at a time when regulators and courts globally are grappling with the challenges of decentralized finance.

The deal, split evenly between the two entities, comes after Circle’s highly anticipated public listing on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5. Circle’s stock surged on debut, opening at $69, more than double its $31 IPO price , before closing the day at $83. At one point, shares touched a high of $123.49, giving the company a fully diluted valuation of $32.1b. Circle IPO Marks The Biggest Fintech Listing Since Coinbase’s 2021 Debut The listing was the largest for a fintech firm since Coinbase went public in 2021 and is widely viewed as a signal that the IPO market, long subdued by macro volatility, may be regaining momentum. NYSE President Lynn Martin called Circle’s debut a bellwether, both for crypto-related firms and for the broader IPO pipeline. Notice Regarding the Investment in Circle Internet Group, Inc. https://t.co/CQRlogvFo0 — 北尾吉孝 (@yoshitaka_kitao) June 9, 2025 Against this backdrop of investor enthusiasm, SBI secured one of the largest institutional allocations in the offering. The Tokyo-based group framed the purchase as part of its long-running strategy to lead in digital finance. Institutional Interest Builds As BlackRock And SBI Back Circle’s IPO SBI Holdings, led by Yoshitaka Kitao, has a long track record of crypto-focused partnerships. In 2016, it invested in Ripple Labs and remains the firm’s largest external shareholder. Over the years, the group has also backed blockchain firms such as R3 and Securitize, and formed joint ventures to bring blockchain-based remittance and securities solutions to Japan. Circle represents a new channel for SBI to advance digital dollar infrastructure across Asia. In Nov. 2023, the two firms signed a business alliance. The goal was to promote USDC circulation and develop new use cases in Japan. By March 2025, SBI VC Trade became the first exchange in Japan to offer USDC to the public. Now, the two sides are setting up a joint venture, Circle SBI Japan KK. This venture aims to fast-track integration with Japan’s financial system. Circle, for its part, has been positioning USDC as a stable and regulated medium for international payments. With SBI’s latest investment and its ongoing partnership, Circle gains deeper access to the Japanese market at a time when stablecoins are gaining mainstream traction. The move comes just weeks after BlackRock disclosed plans to purchase around 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, showing growing institutional appetite for exposure to dollar-backed digital currencies.

45750227,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=127938,1749532391,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here is Shiba Inu Price in 5 Years if Shibarium Burns 10T SHIB Per Month,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/here-is-shiba-inu-price-in-5-years-if-shibarium-burns-10t-shib-per-month/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-shiba-inu-price-in-5-years-if-shibarium-burns-10t-shib-per-month,"SHIB price could soar tremendously if Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium burns around 10 trillion tokens monthly over the next five years. Since its mainnet launch in August 2023, Shibarium has served as a major engine for burning Shiba Inu tokens. The L2 blockchain initiates this burn by converting a portion of its transaction fees, initially collected in BONE, into SHIB and then sending them to the official dead wallet. At its initial launch, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team manually conducted Shibarium-powered SHIB burns. This resulted in the incineration of over 50 billion SHIB tokens. However, the process gained full automation in August 2024, with the blockchain burning an additional 1 billion tokens. Although Shibarium’s overall burns represent a tiny fraction of SHIB’s overall supply of 589.5 trillion tokens, many believe that as the network sees broader adoption, its burn rate will accelerate substantially. SHIB’s Price If Shibarium Burns 10T Tokens Monthly for 5 Years Based on this growing optimism, we estimated the value of one SHIB token if Shibarium burns 10 trillion tokens every month for the next five years. For context, if Shibarium burns 10 trillion tokens every month for five years, it would destroy approximately 600 trillion tokens in total. With Shiba Inu’s overall supply standing at 589.5 trillion, this would theoretically burn the entire supply, which is unrealistic. However, if Shibarium successfully burns 500 trillion tokens over the next five years, Shiba Inu would be left with a supply of 89.5 trillion SHIB afterward.A supply reduction of that magnitude would significantly impact SHIB’s price, irrespective of whether Shiba Inu’s market cap remains unchanged or grows exponentially. Notably, Shiba Inu boasts a market cap of $7.37 billion, with a token currently trading at $0.00001251. If Shibarium burns 500 trillion SHIB, reducing the supply to 89.5 trillion, and Shiba Inu’s market cap stays at $7.37 billion, each SHIB would be worth about $0.00008234.This estimated price is still below Shiba Inu’s all-time high of $0.00008845, which was reached in October 2021. Nonetheless, it represents a surge of 558.19% from the current price of $0.00001251. $0.00008 Price Forecast For SHIBRecall that multiple entities projected that SHIB would revisit the $0.00008 region in May 2024. While Changelly predicted that SHIB would reach a maximum target of $0.00008740 by May 2024, CoinCodex set a price target of $0.00008284 in the same month. However, these predictions did not materialize, with Changelly and CoinCodex extending their timelines for SHIB’s potential surge to the $0.00008 territory. Currently, Changelly believes that SHIB will hit the target by February 2029. CoinCodex speculates that SHIB will revisit the $0.00008 mark after 2050, over 25 years from now. Meanwhile, most Shiba Inu community members believe that SHIB will surpass the $0.00008 mark this year, specifically during the peak of this cycle’s bull run. These proponents do not think a hefty burn is necessary to drive SHIB’s price to this target. Despite this optimism, caution is necessary as these commentaries are purely speculative. Other Possible Scenarios However, if Shiba Inu’s market cap soars tremendously following the Shibarium-powered 500 trillion token burn, the price could spike beyond the above-estimated target. For instance, if the market cap doubles to $14.74 billion and supply drops to 89.5 trillion, SHIB’s price could rise to $0.0001646. Moreover, a fivefold increase in market cap would raise the price to $0.000411. Similarly, a tenfold increase in Shiba Inu’s price following the burn would drive the price to $0.0008234.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 05:13:11

The analyst highlighted this arc in one of his recent analyses amid XRP's ongoing recovery effort, with the asset eventually reclaiming $2.3. Recall that analyst The Great Mattsby had previously insisted that until XRP breaks above $3.3, its price action features nothing exciting.Now, EGRAG has identified what could open the pathway for this excitement. Data from his monthly chart indicates that the Guardian Arch, one of three important curves on the monthly timeframe, is a critical element in XRP's current price movements.The Guardian Arch Has Dictated XRP Bull Top Since 2014Among these three curves, the lowest has served as a formidable support for the asset since 2017. Meanwhile, the Guardian Arch, being the middle curve, has acted as a resistance level. Interestingly, when this resistance is broken, it leads to higher prices.Notably, the Guardian Arch has served this purpose since 2014. For instance, when XRP soared to $0.02803 in December 2014, the Guardian Arch acted as resistance at this top. With the asset unable to breach the Arch, this marked the top for that cycle.Also, amid the 2017/2018 explosive run, the Guardian Arch acted as resistance for XRP when the asset reached a peak of $0.3988 in May 2017. This led to a pullback and consolidation. However, after six months, XRP recovered, eventually breaching the Guardian Arch to reach a new all-time high of $3.8 in January 2018. The XRP Guardian Arch | EGRAG Crypto XRP revisited the Arch in April 2021, when it soared to a high of $1.96. Following the resistance at this level, XRP pulled back and consolidated. However, it failed to revisit the Arch, possibly due to legal pressure from the SEC lawsuit. As a result, the $1.96 level marked XRP's top for the 2021 bull run.XRP Eyes $20 to $27 Upon Guardian Arch BreakoutNow, the resistance at the Guardian Arch has played out again. This time, XRP met the Arch at the $3.4 price peak in January 2025. As expected, this has led to a pullback and consolidation like in previous cycles. Interestingly, EGRAG believes XRP will follow the 2017/2018 price action and not the 2021 movement.If he's correct, XRP still has another uptrend left in the current bull run. According to EGRAG, the measured move sets a target of $20 for when XRP breaches the Guardian Arch. Nonetheless, his chart highlights the possibility of a higher upsurge to $27, a price level he has consistently advocated for .Meanwhile, EGRAG is also looking ahead. He suggests the next phase could be harsh for XRP, possibly leading to a massive price plunge. According to him, the downtrend could resemble the 2021 drop, leading to an 86% decline. Notably, if XRP claimed the $27 level this bull run, then such a drop would lead to the support at $3, aligning with the Guardian Arch.While he expects XRP to reach double-digit targets such as $20 or $27, the market analyst advised investors not to try to time the market. Instead, he suggested taking profit at strategic levels instead of relying on a single target.

Atkins criticized applying “century-old regulatory frameworks” to DeFi and blockchain innovation, noting that current securities rules were designed for traditional intermediaries and issuers, not self-executing software systems. “The prior administration discouraged Americans from participating in blockchains by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions.” Key points from Chairman Paul Atkins’ remarks today at “DeFi and the American Spirit,” SEC’s Crypto Task Force Roundtable on Decentralized Finance – a — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) June 9, 2025 Green Light for Ethereum DeFi Atkins also clarified that voluntary participation in a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake network as a miner, validator, or staking-as-a-service provider “is not within the scope of the federal securities laws.” He was also in favor of “affording greater flexibility” to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, and said “publishing staking code or wallet software isn’t brokerage activity.” Moving forward, the SEC chair directed staff to explore guidance for registrants transacting with blockchain systems and consider rule amendments to accommodate on-chain financial systems. He also proposed an “innovation exemption” framework for expedited market entry of compliant on-chain products and services. “An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump’s vision to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.” It was a “huge day for Ethereum,” said former developer Eric Conner, who added, if this becomes policy, the US becomes the crypto capital of the world: “Ethereum gets regulatory clarity for staking, self-custody, and open-source infra” Ethereum is the industry standard for DeFi with an on-chain value of $68 billion, giving the network a commanding market share of 55%, more than all of the other chains combined, according to DeFiLlama. 1/ Huge day for Ethereum & DeFi.

Users retain full control of their assets while collecting these returns, a core principle of the protocol’s DeFi-first design. The initiative is part of Sky’s larger post-MakerDAO ( MKR ) “Endgame” rebranding , which includes a total overhaul of governance, rewards, and utility in addition to a new name.

At the same time, analysts suggest that actively managed ETFs focused on meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe may be on the horizon, reflecting growing interest in retail-driven digital assets. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest-Growing ETF in History as Assets Surpass $70 Billion According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the speed of IBIT’s ascent is unprecedented. “IBIT just blew through $70 billion and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days,” Balchunas wrote in a June 9 post on X.

Launched in 2004, GLD was one of the most influential commodity-based ETFs of its time and became a benchmark for alternative assets in traditional financial markets. IBIT has now surpassed that legacy in record time, underscoring the accelerating institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class.

While the initial greenlighting of multiple products ushered in fierce competition, it quickly became clear that BlackRock’s offering was capturing the lion’s share of investor demand. As of this week, IBIT manages over $70 billion in assets, more than double the AUM of its nearest competitor—Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF—which currently sits at around $31 billion. That significant gap highlights BlackRock’s dominance in the space, driven by brand trust, distribution capabilities, and favorable market conditions for Bitcoin. The fund has also shown consistent investor appetite, recently enjoying an unbroken 34-day streak of net inflows. This performance not only signals sustained interest in Bitcoin but also affirms BlackRock’s execution in bringing a product to market that aligns with the long-term interests of both retail and institutional investors. IBIT’s explosive growth has mirrored Bitcoin’s resurgence in 2025, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a surge in demand following the fourth Bitcoin halving and continued concerns over fiat currency devaluation. The entry of a financial titan like BlackRock into the crypto arena has provided an additional layer of legitimacy to the digital asset sector, encouraging more traditional investors to gain exposure through regulated channels. Many analysts see IBIT’s trajectory as part of a broader structural shift in financial markets, where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable component in diversified investment portfolios. The fund’s success may also accelerate similar offerings for other digital assets, potentially opening the door for Ethereum spot ETFs, or even niche products tied to Solana, Avalanche, or other blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, the performance of IBIT is likely to be cited in future lobbying efforts aimed at pushing for clearer crypto regulations. Its success serves as empirical evidence that well-structured, transparent digital asset investment vehicles can thrive within the US financial system. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite its meteoric rise, IBIT—and by extension, Bitcoin ETFs —still face regulatory and market-related headwinds. US regulators remain cautious about potential market manipulation, custody solutions, and systemic risks. Moreover, Bitcoin’s price volatility means that while inflows may be steady now, they could reverse sharply in the event of a significant downturn in crypto prices. Still, the success of IBIT is a powerful signal that investor demand for digital asset exposure is not a passing trend, but a long-term evolution in capital allocation. With BlackRock at the helm and an established distribution network spanning financial advisors, wealth managers, and institutional desks, IBIT appears well-positioned to continue its dominance. As Bitcoin continues to assert its role as a macro asset in the eyes of institutional investors, the precedent set by IBIT may serve as a roadmap for the next generation of digital financial products. Actively Managed Meme Coin ETFs May Be Closer Than You Think, Says Bloomberg Analyst In related news, according to Balchunas, there is a “really good chance” that a meme coin ETF will be launched in the near future—potentially as soon as 2026. In a June 7 post on X, Balchunas laid out his forecast, saying the market should first expect a series of actively managed crypto ETFs, which will likely be followed by one that specifically targets the volatile and fast-moving world of meme coins. Unlike traditional ETFs, which passively track a single asset or a fixed index, an actively managed meme coin ETF would take a dynamic approach. Such a fund would be curated and frequently rebalanced by a portfolio manager who makes real-time decisions about which tokens to buy, hold, or sell based on their performance and potential upside. This approach resonates with the fast-paced nature of the meme coin market, where trends and sentiment shift rapidly, and the next “hot” token can rise—or collapse—overnight. A team behind the Russia-themed Vladcoin meme coin advocated for exactly this structure, noting in a post that an ideal fund would ”hold the promising ones and sell off the weaker ones.” Retail-Driven Market With Growing Capitalization Meme coins have seen an explosion in popularity in 2025, largely fueled by a new wave of retail investors attracted by their viral potential, social media buzz, and extreme short-term gains. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Trump ( TRUMP ) have become household names in the crypto community—despite their often thin technical use cases. At its peak earlier this year, the total market capitalization of meme coins surged past $60 billion, riding on speculative fervor and political memes. While the market has cooled since the January highs, the sector’s influence remains significant, especially among younger, digitally native traders. Meme coin market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Still, any path toward an active meme coin ETF must first navigate regulatory approval—an area where the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically dragged its feet. Balchunas noted that most tokens must first be excluded from the 1933 Securities Act to be eligible for inclusion in an active ETF, making the regulatory structure a key bottleneck. Nevertheless, momentum is building. Several firms—including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares—have filed for spot Dogecoin ETFs in 2025. Smaller issuers like Osprey Funds and Rex Shares have submitted even bolder filings, aiming to list ETFs tracking TRUMP, BONK, and other politically or culturally charged tokens. “The Dogecoin ETF filing will tell us a lot,” said Balchunas, suggesting that DOGE may become the litmus test for broader meme coin ETF acceptance. While he previously estimated a 75% chance of SEC approval for a Dogecoin ETF this year, that optimism has waned. On blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, odds for such approval have dropped to 44% as of June. Boom, Bust, and the Next Wave The meme coin market has experienced dramatic whiplash in recent months. Following an epic bull run that peaked in January, many top tokens have seen their prices collapse by more than 70%. Dogecoin is down approximately 75% from its highs, while Shiba Inu has lost 85%. TRUMP, once boosted by claims of future acquisition by the Trump family-linked World Liberty Financial, is now down 86% from its all-time high. The sector’s volatility presents both risk and opportunity, precisely the kind of environment where an active fund could outperform. Rather than passively holding declining assets, an actively managed ETF could theoretically pivot quickly between outperformers and underperformers, preserving capital during downturns and riding momentum during rallies. More than 70 crypto ETF applications are still awaiting a decision from the SEC this year, according to Bloomberg data. While most of the attention has been on Bitcoin and Ethereum-based products, the potential emergence of meme coin ETFs adds an unpredictable but fascinating new layer to the evolving crypto investment landscape. For now, the idea of a meme coin ETF still feels slightly surreal—a far cry from the days when Bitcoin itself was dismissed as a “fraud” by mainstream finance. But if history is any guide, today’s internet joke could be tomorrow’s Wall Street product. And if market sentiment, social momentum, and ETF industry trends continue on their current trajectory, a memecoin ETF—especially an actively managed one—may soon become reality.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-10 05:30:00

Founder Charles Hoskinson has introduced the Cardinal Protocol, the network’s first DeFi solution powered by Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin can now be used on Cardano for lending, staking, and more, without the need for third-party custodians. The news has sparked market excitement, pushing ADA’s 24-hour trading volume to $500 million. Currently trading at $0.669, Cardano is also gaining momentum after its inclusion in the Nasdaq crypto index, signaling growing institutional interest. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Bitcoin Enters Cardano’s DeFi Arena Developed by InputOutput HK, Cardinal allows users to put their Bitcoin to work through lending, borrowing, farming, or staking on the Cardano blockchain. This is made possible using “wrapped UTXO” technology, which can be burned at any time to redeem the original Bitcoin or Ordinals. For the first time, Bitcoin holders have a way to tap into DeFi on Cardano without trusting centralized platforms. Safe, Cross-Chain, and Fully Transparent Instead of custodians, Cardinal uses a secure MuSig2 multi-signature system, making Bitcoin transactions safe, transparent, and decentralized. It also supports cross-chain compatibility with networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Cardinal uses BitVMX for off-chain verification, while Cardano smart contracts handle the on-chain logic. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 4 U.S. Economic Reports This Week That Could Make or Break Bitcoin , Users can now interact with popular DeFi platforms like MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens to lend, farm, and trade Bitcoin-backed assets. Ordinals, too, can now be used as collateral for loans and traded on other chains without losing their identity. More Features on the Way Cardano’s CTO Romain Pellerin believes this is a huge step forward, but says there’s more to be done. Future upgrades may include wallet support, zero-knowledge proofs, and deeper liquidity. This launch bridges the world’s biggest cryptocurrency with Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem — bringing Robert Kiyosaki’s belief that Bitcoin is “the people’s money” even closer to reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Officials from both nations met in London on Monday to discuss rare earth shipments and the potential easing of export restrictions, with further negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Gold prices fell below $3,310 per ounce on Tuesday, as optimism over easing US-China trade tensions dampened safe-haven demand. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.78% to above 38,200 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.2% to 2,791 on Tuesday, with Japanese shares extending a winning streak to a third straight day. The Japanese yen weakened to around 145 per dollar on Tuesday, reaching a near two-week low. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told the parliament on Tuesday that the central bank stands ready to raise interest rates again if they ""have enough confidence that underlying inflation nears 2% or moves around 2%."" China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.61% to around 3,403 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.2% to 10,230 on Tuesday, with mainland stocks struggling for clear direction as the Sino-US trade negotiations in London enter a second day, and the offshore yuan remained steady to around 7.18 per dollar on Tuesday, as investors awaited further progress over the US-China trade negotiations. The discussions, focused on easing tensions over shipments of technology and rare earth elements, are set to continue on Tuesday morning. These critical materials play a vital role in industries such as aerospace, semiconductors, and defense, and disruptions in their supply threaten global economic stability. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.25% to 24,222 in early trade on Tuesday. However, the concerns over intensifying competition among China’s top EV makers, as a long-running emissions compliance dispute between BYD and Great Wall Motor escalated, with Geely joining in to criticize BYD’s aggressive price cuts. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.04% were largely flat in morning trade on Tuesday, with the BSE Sensex hovering around 82,472 after rising for the fourth consecutive session. Investor caution also stemmed from the upcoming release of May consumer price data, expected later this week. Markets anticipate that India’s inflation rate could ease to 3%, the lowest since April 2019. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.86% to 8,551 on Tuesday, hovering near four-month highs. The Australian dollar held its gains around $0.651 on Tuesday. In Australia, consumer sentiment rose for the fourth time this year, with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index increasing by 0.5% month-over-month to 92.6 in June. Meanwhile, business confidence improved, with the NAB Business Confidence Index rising to 2 in May from -1 in the previous month. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended mostly higher as high-stakes trade talks between the US and China began in London. Markets are also closely watching upcoming CPI and PPI reports later this week. Earnings results from GameStop and J.M. Smucker Co. are also on the docket.

This proves strong demand for its AI products like ChatGPT and business tools such as its API. The biggest source of revenue is ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, which the company expects will generate around $8 billion by the end of 2025. The tech firm’s business tools show higher adoption rates from enterprises because they now serve 3 million paying companies, up from 2 million in February. API access makes up about a third of the company’s total ARR because it allows outside developers to use the firm’s language models in their own apps. Microsoft’s earnings could be even higher because the $10 billion figure does not include revenue from its licensing deals or large one-time contracts with other companies that bring large sums but don’t recur regularly. Many people now rely on AI for tasks like writing, learning, coding, and organizing information, as OpenAI reports that about 500 million users are active weekly. Additionally, between 800 million and 1 billion people are using ChatGPT globally as of mid-2025. OpenAI is introducing new pricing models or premium features to monetize its massive base of free users in 2026. This will allow it to grow more than tenfold in just four years and achieve its goal of $125 billion in annual revenue by 2029. These new strategies will give the company a stronger path toward long-term growth and profitability and add an extra $25 billion annually in revenue. The firm is setting the pace for what AI companies can achieve when their tools become essential to everyday users and global enterprises, as proven by its fast rise in revenue, users, and business adoption. OpenAI’s rising value brings big spending and major losses OpenAI is now the world’s second most valuable private tech company, valued at $300 billion, just behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Despite strong investor confidence, the company faces pressure to maintain its rapid growth. While revenue is soaring, its operating costs are climbing even faster. Before considering new spending commitments in 2025, the company reported a loss of around $5 billion in 2024. The firm has been pouring money into hiring the best AI researchers and acquiring top design and coding startups. Moreover, it has been building and maintaining powerful computing systems needed to train its large language models. Compute costs likely comprised the largest share of the company’s entire budget because OpenAI spent around $5 billion on its infrastructure in 2024 alone. This includes high-end chips like NVIDIA GPUs, massive cloud servers, and custom infrastructure for running AI models. Industry insiders describe the company’s aggressive spending as a dangerously high burn rate (how fast it spends its available cash). They suggest it needs more funding because it could run out of money in the next 12 to 18 months. Despite leading in AI innovation and product adoption, OpenAI hasn’t built a business model that can support this scale without external funding. To solve this, OpenAI started one of the largest funding rounds ever for a private tech company led by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. It raised $40 billion in March 2025. The funding showed that investors have enormous expectations for what OpenAI might become in five to ten because it valued the company at $300 billion (30 times higher than its annual revenue of $10 billion). Investors are betting that OpenAI will eventually dominate the consumer and enterprise AI markets and possibly expand into hardware, robotics, and other AI-powered tools. Despite investor optimism, the tech firm still has several years of expected losses ahead, as it admitted that it doesn’t expect to be profitable until 2029. The company admits that it must continue to spend heavily on research, infrastructure, and new product development. It must also deal with legal and regulatory issues, such as copyright lawsuits like the one filed by the New York Times and questions about how it collects and uses training data. Competition in the AI industry also puts more pressure on OpenAI to keep investing aggressively because companies like Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta are attracting big enterprise clients and raising billions of dollars with their advanced AI models.

During the fifth meeting of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable titled DeFi and the American Spirit, Atkins outlined plans for a new “innovation exemption” that would provide conditional relief from certain regulatory requirements. While broader regulatory changes remain under development, the exemptions would provide a temporary structure to support the safe deployment of onchain services. Atkins said the exemptions would be designed to support firms that are willing to meet specified conditions while developing blockchain-based systems. These measures, he noted, would allow for responsible innovation within the boundaries of investor protection and market integrity. He also revealed that SEC staff have been directed to evaluate whether additional guidance or rule changes may be needed to help registrants interact with self-executing software systems in compliance with securities laws. “These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises,” he said, contrasting them with centralized platforms that have failed under recent stress. “Many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.” You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Atkins emphasised that most securities regulations were built around traditional intermediaries such as broker-dealers and exchanges. “The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries,” he noted, calling for regulatory flexibility to accommodate these new models. Atkins, appointed earlier this year as part of President Trump’s push to establish the U.S. as a global leader in crypto innovation, has called for a “rational regulatory framework” that balances innovation with investor protection. In contrast to his predecessor’s approach , Atkins is steering the SEC toward inclusive policymaking that recognises the operational differences between traditional financial intermediaries and decentralised systems. Since taking office, he has repeatedly stressed the need for structured, participatory rulemaking that reflects the unique characteristics of blockchain systems and crypto assets. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first policy report in the coming months. The report will contribute to a regulatory foundation that Atkins says is urgently needed to support the growth of onchain technologies and provide long-awaited clarity for market participants.

31788950,https://coinpedia.org/?p=333707,1749534842,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025,https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-slovenia-2024/,"The post Crypto Regulations in Slovenia 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Slovenia, a small but highly developed European country with a population of 2.1 million, boasts a rich industrial history that has significantly contributed to its robust economy. As the most economically developed Slavic nation, Slovenia has consistently grown since adopting the Euro in 2007. Its openness to innovation has been a key driver of success in the industrial sector, making it a favored destination for crypto enthusiasts. Many believe Slovenia is poised to become a powerful fintech hub in Europe. But does its current crypto regulatory framework support such aspirations? Let’s explore Slovenia’s crypto regulations and see if they can propel the country to the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape. My expectation is positive. What’s yours? Before answering, let’s delve deeper. 1. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: An Overview Slovenia is renowned for its pro-innovation stance, providing a supportive environment for emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Under the Act on Payments Services and Systems, cryptocurrencies are classified as virtual assets rather than financial or monetary instruments. Regulation of the crypto sector in Slovenia is decentralized. Various authorities manage different aspects of the ecosystem. For instance, the Bank of Slovenia and the Securities Market Agency oversee cryptocurrency transactions to ensure compliance with financial laws, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing regulations. The Slovenian Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (ZPPDFT-2) incorporates the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) and aligns with the latest FATF recommendations. All virtual currency service providers must register with the Office of the Republic of Slovenia. 2. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: What’s New? Several notable developments in Slovenia’s crypto sector occurred this year: July 25, 2024 : Slovenia issued a €30 million sovereign digital on-chain bond, the first of its kind in the EU, with a 3.65% return, maturing on November 25, 2024. July 1, 2024 : NiceHash announced Slovenia’s first Bitcoin -focused conference, NiceHashX, scheduled for November 8–9 in Maribor. Thank you @CoinEdition for sharing and spreading the news! Come and join us at our NiceHashX conference in Maribor Slovenia in November! https://t.co/AM5XNvOVgI — NiceHashX (@NiceHash_X) July 1, 2024 3. Crypto Taxation Framework in Slovenia Explained Slovenia’s crypto taxation framework provides clear guidelines for both individuals and corporations. According to the Financial Administration of Slovenia, the tax treatment depends on the trader’s status and the nature of the transaction. Individuals : Income earned from cryptocurrencies through employment or ongoing business activities is subject to personal income tax. However, capital gains from trading or market fluctuations are exempt from taxation. Corporations : Capital gains from cryptocurrency activities are subject to a corporate income tax of 19%. The Value-Added Tax (VAT) generally applies at a rate of 22%, although cryptocurrency transactions considered means of payment are exempt from VAT. Companies are not allowed to restrict payment methods to cryptocurrencies alone. Tokens issued during ICOs must follow standard accounting rules and the Law on Corporation Tax. 4. Crypto Mining in Slovenia: What You Should Know Crypto mining is unrestricted in Slovenia, but income from mining is considered business income and is therefore taxable. This includes rewards from validating transactions and any additional income from mining operations. Both individuals and legal entities must comply with Slovenian tax regulations. 5. Timeline of the Evolution of Crypto Regulations in Slovenia Here is a timeline highlighting the evolution of crypto regulations in Slovenia: 2023 : The EU adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a uniform regulatory framework for crypto-assets, their issuers, and service providers across the EU 2017 : The Financial Administration of Slovenia provided more detailed guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, based on factors such as the trader’s status and the type of transaction. 2013 : The Slovenian Financial Administration issued guidelines stating that income from cryptocurrency transactions should be taxed. Endnote Slovenia’s approach to the crypto sector is commendable, reflecting its optimistic view of the future of cryptocurrencies. The country’s balanced regulatory framework supports crypto innovation while protecting user rights and preventing illegal activities. Recent developments show Slovenia’s commitment to continually improving its regulatory environment. Slovenia’s crypto regulation framework sets a positive example for other nations navigating the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-2-4-weeks-away-from-its-final-run-up-heres-what-it-means/,"Market Analyst Mr. Xoom has drawn parallels between XRP’s current price structure and its behavior during the 2017 market cycle. In his tweet, he suggested that XRP is approaching the final phase of a significant upward move. Accompanying his tweet is a chart from TradingView that compares two distinct consolidation periods in XRP’s history, offering a technical basis for a forecasted breakout. According to the chart and commentary, XRP consolidated for 210 days before its explosive move in late 2017, a period that preceded its historic surge to all-time highs. In the current cycle, XRP has already consolidated for approximately 190 days following a sharp price rise earlier in 2025, which saw it exceed $2.00 for the first time in years. I believe by the end of August/ start of September, XRP should have made its final move up & ended its run. NFA but Don’t be left behind being a bag holder with just a screenshot. Take profits. https://t.co/pXj4lU5eZJ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) June 7, 2025 Consolidation Periods Mirror Past Cycle Xoom notes that, if XRP continues to mirror the 2017 pattern, the next move could begin within the next 2 to 4 weeks. This would place the anticipated start of the breakout around late June to early July. He projects that the final move could peak by the end of August or the beginning of September, concluding what he believes may be XRP’s “final run up” of this cycle. The chart highlights the consolidation zones in both 2017 and 2025 using orange boxes, with annotations indicating the duration of each phase. In 2017, the breakout that followed the 210-day consolidation led XRP to its all-time high of nearly $3.40. The present cycle, while still unfolding, shows similar technical behavior, with price action maintaining higher lows within a tight range, a characteristic often associated with accumulation phases.

The move triggered a surge in local crypto-linked stocks. KakaoPay Corp . climbed as much as 18% on Tuesday, its biggest jump in over a year, amid growing investor optimism that the government will back a won-based stablecoin initiative. The Digital Asset Basic Act, proposed by the ruling party, would allow local companies to issue stablecoins provided they meet a minimum capital requirement of 500 million won ($367,000) and guarantee redemptions through adequate reserves. The proposed legislation is designed to improve transparency and increase competition in the digital asset sector, according to party officials . The bill also calls for a Presidential Digital Asset Committee to oversee industry policy and introduces entry rules requiring approval, registration, and reporting to the Financial Services Commission. South Korea’s President Follows Through on Crypto Promises The proposal comes just a week after Lee, a progressive politician known for his pro-crypto stance, won the presidential election . His administration is moving swiftly to implement campaign pledges aimed at modernizing South Korea’s regulatory framework for digital assets. Still, the initiative faces pushback from the Bank of Korea, which has expressed concerns about non-bank entities issuing stablecoins. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has argued that such assets could undermine monetary policy, and insists the central bank should lead any effort involving a won-pegged digital currency. Under the proposed law, all asset-linked tokens, including stablecoins, would require approval from the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s top financial regulator.

Under the guise of crypto startup Evita, he served as a financial intermediary to sanctioned Russian entities through illicit transactions, FBI New York Assistant Director in Charge Raia, noted. “Gugnin’s alleged scheme manipulated our nation’s financial infrastructure to benefit our nation’s adversaries.” Furthermore, his clients included sanctioned Russian financial institutions, such as Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and the state-owned energy company Rosatom. Between June 2023 and January 2025, Gugnin used Evita to process over 80 invoices, digitally erasing the identities of Russian recipients. The accused purportedly routed funds using USDT and USDC stablecoins. A WSJ article published last September, profiled Gugnin as one of the high-net-worth renters in Manhattan, paying $19,000 per month for an apartment. Gugnin Knew He Was Breaking the Law Per the DOJ, the accused was aware that he was breaking the law through various web searches, including queries like “how to know if there is an investigation against you” and “money laundering penalties US.” He also reportedly visited pages like “am I being investigated?” and “what are the best ways to find out if you’re being investigated.” Gugnin was arrested on Monday and if convicted, he would face a jail term of up to 30 years on the bank fraud counts; 20 years for the wire fraud, money laundering; 10 years for failure to implement an effective AML program and 5 years for conspiracy to defraud the US financial system.

Meanwhile, Congress is advancing key crypto legislation—the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act—while debating protections for blockchain developers. In the UK, the Insolvency Service appointed its first crypto intelligence officer to recover hidden digital assets after the recognition of crypto’s role in bankruptcy and crime. SEC Explores Rule Changes The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is exploring a new “innovation exemption” that could pave the way for a much more flexible regulatory environment for on-chain products and services. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who previously worked as a crypto lobbyist, revealed the initiative during a Monday roundtable that was hosted by the agency’s Crypto Task Force, titled DeFi and the American Spirit. (Source: SEC ) Atkins said he instructed SEC staff to consider a framework that would offer conditional exemption relief, giving qualifying firms temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements. The aim is to accelerate the development and market entry of blockchain-based technologies while the SEC works on potential amendments to its existing regulations. Atkins positioned this move as a step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s vision of establishing the US as the global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. He explained that the proposed exemptions will be available to developers and firms that are willing to comply with specific conditions, thereby encouraging compliant innovation in the country. Atkins also shared that many of the SEC’s current rules were not designed to address decentralized financial systems powered by self-executing code, which suggests that regulatory updates are necessary to accommodate these novel approaches. Additionally, Atkins asked staff to assess whether broader amendments to the SEC’s regulatory structure could better support on-chain financial infrastructure. He acknowledged that the foundational assumptions behind most securities regulations do not easily translate to decentralized systems where software may replace traditional actors. This announcement was made amid a shift in tone at the SEC since former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down in January. Under Gensler’s leadership, the agency was frequently criticized for regulating the crypto industry through enforcement actions rather than through transparent rulemaking. In contrast, the current SEC leadership, including acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Chair Atkins, launched a Crypto Task Force with the stated goal of creating a practical and responsive crypto framework. Atkins told the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services on June 3 that the SEC intends to use the “notice and comment” process to refine its approach. He also revealed that the Crypto Task Force is expected to release its first report in the coming months. Blockchain Bills Gain Momentum in Congress Meanwhile, US lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee are preparing for a crucial markup hearing on Tuesday to consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, which is also known as the CLARITY Act. The goal of the bill is to define a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency market, and it could undergo amendments to include new protections for blockchain developers. Committee chair French Hill introduced an amendment focused on the treatment of “non-controlling blockchain developers,” and proposed that such individuals or service providers not be classified as money transmitters, thereby exempting them from related registration requirements. This amendment seems to draw from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, a separate piece of legislation that was introduced in May by Representative Tom Emmer and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. The proposal to integrate the two bills gained support from several crypto advocacy organizations, including the Blockchain Association, which urged lawmakers to unify the legislative efforts to provide clearer guidance for the crypto industry. The markup hearing on Tuesday will serve as a platform for committee members to discuss and vote on amendments to the CLARITY Act, and could potentially pave the way for the bill to be sent to the full House for consideration. Meanwhile, in the Senate, legislators are expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, which seeks to regulate payment stablecoins. Senate Majority Leader John Thune wants to finalize the stablecoin bill within the week. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal praised the bipartisan progress on stablecoin regulation and believes in the importance of a market structure bill for long-term industry stability. He thinks that while rules for stablecoins are essential, the broader regulatory clarity offered by the CLARITY Act is equally vital. Despite this progress, the path forward for the CLARITY Act is still uncertain. Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the committee, expressed strong opposition by criticizing the bill for failing to address alleged corruption linked to President Donald Trump’s connections to the crypto industry. Waters hosted a Minority Day hearing on Friday, arguing that the legislation would only serve to legitimize misconduct rather than prevent it. Nevertheless, there are signs of bipartisan support. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat and co-sponsor of both the CLARITY Act and the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, appears to want to push the legislation forward. UK Insolvency Service Targets Hidden Crypto In the UK, the Insolvency Service took a major step toward tackling the rising involvement of cryptocurrency in bankruptcy and criminal cases by appointing its first crypto intelligence specialist. Andrew Small, a former police investigator with experience in economic crime, will now lead efforts to trace and recover digital assets that have gone unaccounted for in insolvency proceedings. This move comes in response to a staggering 420% increase in crypto-related insolvency cases in the UK over the past five years. The total estimated value of crypto assets in such cases rose from just over £1,400 to more than £523,000. Small’s role will involve using his expertise to identify and track various types of digital assets, from mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to meme coins like Dogecoin and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Insolvency Service is responsible for recovering funds to repay creditors in bankruptcy and liquidation scenarios, and said Small’s appointment will improve outcomes by providing investigators with the technical knowledge that is required to navigate the complex crypto landscape. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, believes that Small’s addition to the team will enhance collaboration and help in cases involving crypto ownership. As digital asset ownership becomes more prevalent, Small said that crypto is now “very much a recoverable asset” in insolvency cases. Andrew Small A recent study by the Financial Conduct Authority revealed that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024, up from just 4% in 2021. The average value held by these individuals was approximately £1,842. In parallel with the Insolvency Service’s ramped-up efforts, UK authorities are also tightening regulations on the crypto industry.

According to a June 9 post on X by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the iShares Bitcoin Trust crossed the $70 billion mark in just 341 days, five times faster than the previous record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 pic.twitter.com/5VeGT9twpQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 9, 2025 IBIT now manages $71.9 billion in assets and holds 661,457 Bitcoin ( BTC ), making BlackRock the world’s largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, ahead of Binance and Strategy. The ETF is currently trading at $61.77 per share and has recorded $201 million in inflows so far in June, following a record $5.9 billion in May inflows. The fund started trading on the Nasdaq on Jan. 11, 2024, a day after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by U.S. regulators. IBIT’s first day of trading saw a volume of over $1 billion, indicating strong interest from institutional and retail investors. You might also like: BlackRock met with SEC to discuss crypto staking, tokenization, and ETF rules In an interview with Yahoo Finance on June 9, Robert Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, attributed IBIT’s success to Bitcoin’s expanding use as an inflation hedge and alternative store of value. He also noted that IBIT has outpaced even the world’s largest gold fund in inflows this year, with $6.96 billion net since January, ranking sixth among all ETFs. The fund’s rapid growth has led some analysts to speculate that BlackRock could eventually overtake Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is estimated to hold around 1.1 million BTC. Balchunas previously projected this could happen by the end of next summer. Adding to its momentum, on June 4, Russia’s MOEX exchange launched futures for IBIT, though these remain limited to accredited investors. IBIT’s rise coincides with the growing interest in crypto ETFs and institutional exposure to Bitcoin, solidifying its position as the industry leader in the rapidly changing digital assets landscape.

Markets in Tokyo, Seoul, and Sydney all gained ground. At the same time, oil prices pumped as the dollar steadied. On Monday, a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese officials under Vice Premier He Lifeng. The talks are aimed at resolving disputes over tariffs and market access that have weighed on global growth. President Trump told reporters in London that the talks “were going well” and that he was “only getting good reports” from his team. Trading in Asia was broadly positive Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 climbed 1% to 38,473.97, and South Korea’s Kospi added 0.9% to 2,881.40. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng edged up 0.2% to 24,242.03, while Shanghai’s Composite index rose 0.1% to 3,403.51. Taiwan’s Taiex led gains in the region with a 2% jump. Meanwhile, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.7%, finishing at 8,578.50. U.S. stocks edged higher on Monday The S&P 500 inched up 0.1% to 6,005.88, leaving it 2.3% below its all-time high set in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 1 point to 42,761.76, effectively flat for the day. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3%, reaching 19,591.24. Hopes that President Donald Trump might roll back some tariffs if new trade deals are struck have helped the S&P 500 recover after a roughly 20% drop from its peak two months ago. The index is now above levels seen after Trump’s surprise announcement of broad tariffs in April, a move he termed “Liberation Day.” Some of the largest share movements on Monday came after takeover news. Qualcomm shares jumped 4.1% when the chipmaker said it would buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion. Electric vehicle maker Tesla also rallied, recovering from a sharp drop late last week. Shares climbed 4.6% following a day of mixed trading, after Tesla slid when CEO Elon Musk’s rapport with President Trump appeared to sour. Oil prices ticked up while the dollar steadied A successful deal between Washington and Beijing could lift the global growth outlook and spur demand for commodities. Oil prices ticked up on Tuesday as traders awaited the outcome of the talks, which could ease trade worries and boost fuel consumption. By 03:30 GMT, Brent crude futures were trading at $67.32 a barrel, up 28 cents or 0.4%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate stood at $65.52, up 23 cents or 0.4%. On Monday, Brent had briefly reached $67.19, its highest since April 28. The U.S. dollar firmed slightly, with the euro slipping 0.17% to $1.14 and sterling at $1.3543. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six rivals, rose 0.2% to 99.189, remaining near the six-week low hit last week. It is down 8.7% so far this year as investors fret over the impact of trade barriers on U.S. growth. At the same time, the Australian dollar held steady at $0.652, often seen as a gauge of risk appetite, while the New Zealand dollar eased slightly to $0.60425 but stayed close to the seven-month peak reached last week.

But could the success have negative implications for Bitcoin? A recent report from crypto market analyst 10x Research suggests Circle’s initial public offering (IPO) may not be as bullish for the broader crypto market as it appears. Instead, it might be a cautionary tale for Bitcoin (BTC) . The sentiment stems from historical parallels. Analysts are comparing Circle’s IPO to Coinbase’s public debut in 2021, which also recorded strong early success. Is Circle’s IPO the Next Coinbase Moment—or a Signal to Sell Bitcoin?

The shares went on to surge as high as $429 during intraday trading, before closing at $328.28. The milestone, however, marked a local top for the market. Bitcoin’s price fell by 54% over the following three months before eventually staging a 130% rebound and the precedent has sparked speculation that a similar pattern could play out again.

In the meantime, Bitcoin’s performance has been largely steady, with the crypto giant holding above the $105,000 range. While gains have been modest since slipping from its all-time high of $111,000, the token trades at $107,630 at press time in an approximate 2% gain over the past 24 hours.

A June 9 report by Matrixport also highlighted growing interest in crypto from public markets.

This joint statement, which includes important organizations such as DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Foundation's policy arm Solana Institute, Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, is considered a critical step in the industry. The BRCA aims not to regulate software developers and infrastructure providers that do not store customer assets in the same way traditional financial institutions do, the statement said. The regulation was first introduced by GOP Majority Representative Tom Emmer and later became a bipartisan proposal with the support of Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres.

BRCA draws that line clearly and protects innovation,” one policy leader told Terrett. The joint statement made following the inclusion of BRCA in the final version of the bill included the following statements: “We welcome the inclusion of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) in the newly proposed version of the CLARITY Act. This is a meaningful step toward protecting peer-to-peer technology developers who do not control customer funds. The updated bill takes a balanced approach, building on FinCEN’s 2019 guidance that developers and infrastructure providers should not be regulated as money transmitters when they do not control customer funds.” *This is not investment advice.

Investors are anticipating a massive rally, and they are buying MUTM tokens in droves. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi project has gained massive attention from the crypto world due to its innovative design. Built for long-term gains, this project could change the face of DeFi forever, according to market analysts. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial lender protocol that allows users to join as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders on the protocol supply capital into audited smart contracts and receive interest on those deposits. The interest they receive is dynamically set by market forces based on a pool’s utilization rate. When borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate starts to climb, and interest rates start rising. This encourages borrowers to pay back their outstanding loans, while also incentivizing more lenders to join. As a result, the utilization rate goes down, bringing the interest. The system is designed to be self-regulating, allowing for optimal capital utilization. Safeguards on the protocol To ensure that lenders and borrowers operate in a safe and thriving environment, the protocol has created various safeguards. One of them is ensuring there is reliable price data to ensure that users get fair market pricing for their assets. For fair pricing, Mutuum Finance will rely on the Chainlink price data oracles. Additionally, it plans to integrate a backup oracle for price data. It could also implement aggregate price data oracles for redundancy when it comes to real-time price discovery. Another source of price data will be time-weighted price averaging, where there is sufficient on-chain data. Token vetting To protect the solvency and long-term health of the ecosystem, new tokens will have to meet certain standards. For instance, new tokens that require a complex integration process may increase gas fees for other platform users. In such a case, the benefits to the community will be carefully weighed against the potential gas fee increases. Another important metric will be the price volatility and liquidity of an asset. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not add assets that have extremely low liquidity and excessive price volatility. Such assets can destabilize the entire protocol through price manipulation. The team will also check tokens for centralization. For instance, if a token is centrally issued or has a single custodian, that creates a single source of vulnerability. Such a coin can be easily shut down by its creators or other agencies, increasing the chances of insolvency of the protocol. Before listing a token, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will weigh the benefits to the community versus the challenges created by the possibility of intervention by a single entity. For all tokens added on the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will conduct dynamic adjustments based on real-time monitoring. That will ensure that a token’s parameters accurately reflect its current liquidity, volatility, and user adoption. Supporting the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) native token The MUTM token, the native token of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, will be crucial to the long-term success of the ecosystem. As such, the team continues to take measures to ensure its widespread adoption within the crypto world. One of these measures is a CertiK audit, which the team recently announced. In the audit, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received a Token Scan Score of 80. The results of the audit have been crucial to the viral spread of the ongoing presale, where over $10.3 million has been raised to date. Another important step towards mass adoption came when the team got a listing on the CoinMarketCap crypto price aggregation platform. The platform, which has over 300 million monthly visitors, will be crucial in this plan. It will provide visibility for the token, which could lead to an increased level of adoption. To promote the long-term success and adoption of MUTM tokens, the team plans to create a buy-back and distribution program when the tokens go live. They will use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and distribute them to stakers. That will apply positive price pressure on the tokens, which will boost demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance has enjoyed massive success in the ongoing presale, where it has raised over $10.3 million. So far, over 11,800 unique buyers have taken part in the presale, which is in phase 5. In the current phase of the presale, tokens are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. The token price is set to increase by 16.67% in phase 6. Since launching around a week ago, over 28% of the phase tokens have been sold. This is a testament to the fast pace of the ongoing presale. If you are looking for an exciting DeFi project with a native token that is expected to experience sustained upward price pressure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the project to join. With a low price of $0.03 per token in the current phase, you stand to make substantial gains when it goes live.

Digital asset platform Uphold is exploring a potential IPO in the U.S. or a strategic sale, CEO Simon McLoughlin told The Block. The company’s board has engaged investment bank FT Partners to evaluate its options, including a listing on the Nasdaq or a possible merger or acquisition with a financial or payments firm. “We’re currently being courted by a number of banks, brokers, financial institutions and payment firms,” McLoughlin told the Block. According to McLoughlin, an IPO could support Uphold’s longer-term acquisition strategy, positioning the company to potentially expand via mergers. Though McLoughlin declined to disclose a target valuation, a person familiar with the matter said Uphold is seeking a figure above $1.5 billion. The company’s exploration of a public listing comes amid significant revenue growth. McLoughlin revealed that Uphold’s annual revenue jumped from $80 million in 2022 to an expected $300 million in 2025, driven by both retail expansion and enterprise partnerships, including work with a German bank. It also comes shortly after Circle, another major U.S.-based crypto firm, completed a successful IPO that saw its shares surge over 300% in the first week of trading.

Gugnin, who lived in Manhattan, was arrested on Monday, taken to court the same day, and ordered to stay locked up until trial. The 22-count indictment claims Gugnin ran the operation through two companies he controlled — Evita Investments and Evita Pay — while hiding the source, flow, and purpose of the funds. Prosecutors say between June 2023 and January 2025, he funneled payments for clients tied to banned entities using a mix of U.S. banks and crypto exchanges, mostly moving the money through Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar. Gugnin lied to banks, erased Russian links, and used shell accounts Justice officials allege Gugnin’s clients included institutions under U.S. sanctions, such as Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and Rosatom, Russia’s state-run nuclear energy firm. These are not random wallets—they’re tied to the Kremlin’s financial and tech backbone. Prosecutors say Gugnin helped them get around restrictions by faking compliance documents, lying to banks, and hiding ties to Russia. They accuse him of using shell companies and doctored records to make payments look clean. He allegedly rewrote over 80 invoices, digitally removing any trace of the Russian entities involved. The goal was simple: get the money past U.S. systems without anyone catching on. U.S. officials say Gugnin also helped them buy restricted American technology. One example given is a server covered by anti-terrorism export laws, which landed in the hands of a Russian client thanks to his operation. Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen stated, “The defendant is charged with turning a cryptocurrency company into a covert pipeline for dirty money, moving over half a billion dollars through the U.S. financial system to aid sanctioned Russian banks and help Russian end-users acquire sensitive U.S. technology.” Gugnin apparently knew he was in deep. The feds say he searched online for phrases like “how to know if there is an investigation against you” and “money laundering penalties US” before his arrest, showing he expected federal heat. And he wasn’t just moving cash. Officials say he kept up direct ties with Russia’s intelligence service and with Iranian officials. Neither country sends people back to the U.S. when wanted. Despite being at the center of a half-billion-dollar laundering case, Gugnin was living large in New York. In fall 2024, the Wall Street Journal featured him in a story about rich renters. He was paying $19,000 a month for a luxury Manhattan apartment. The Justice Department made clear: if Gugnin is convicted of bank fraud alone, he could get 30 years in prison. But if the court finds him guilty on all 22 charges, his total sentence could be stacked into a prison term longer than a full human life. He has not entered a plea yet and is being held without bond as he waits for his next court date. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

BlackRock’s ETH Trust saw 23 straight days of inflows, signaling strong institutional demand. ETH price surged to a 12-day high but faces resistance at $2,700 amid signs of momentum exhaustion. Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone, as the total amount of ETH locked on the Beacon Chain climbed to an all-time high of 34.65 million on Sunday. The move coincides with ETH reclaiming a 12-day high of $2,700, sparking renewed interest in the network’s fundamentals. According to Beaconcha.in , staking levels had hovered above 33 million ETH for much of the past year but began to rise again in early June. BlackRock’s ETH Trust Sees 23-Day Inflow Streak The uptick comes amid growing institutional interest. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has now recorded 23 consecutive trading days without an outflow, signaling sustained demand. Meanwhile, the prospect of spot Ether ETFs incorporating staking components is gaining traction. ICYMI: Over $20 billion worth of ETH is staked via @LidoFinance . pic.twitter.com/ZKKq8FKJYZ — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) June 9, 2025 A recent filing from REX Shares suggests that ETF products tied to staked ETH could enter the market within weeks, depending on regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Data from Dune Analytics and Ultrasound.Money corroborates the surge, with figures between 34.7 and 34.8 million ETH staked, amounting to nearly 29% of the total circulating supply. Higher staking levels are typically viewed as a signal of long-term conviction. Rather than selling, holders are opting to lock in yield, tightening liquid supply and potentially setting the stage for upward price pressure. Ethereum Hits Highest Level Since May ETH has gained over 8% in the past 24 hours, hitting its highest level since late May. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,673 after retreating slightly from an intraday high of $2,707. The short-term trend remains bullish, though momentum is showing early signs of exhaustion across key indicators. On the 2-hour chart, ETH tested resistance near $2,700 for the fourth time this month, failing to break above convincingly. The RSI is hovering near overbought levels (69), suggesting buyers may be running out of steam. MACD remains bullish but is flattening, which could hint at a near-term slowdown. Zooming into the 30-minute timeframe, ETH touched the upper Bollinger Band at $2,742 before pulling back. RSI briefly crossed 72, signaling short-term overheating. However, bullish MACD crossover remains intact, and price is holding above the mid-band near $2,673, offering a key support level. On the 1-minute chart, a sharper pullback was observed, with RSI dropping below 30, indicating a brief oversold condition. MACD also flipped bearish, reflecting short-term profit-taking after the recent surge. In summary, ETH’s bullish structure remains intact, but traders should monitor the $2,700 resistance and $2,660 support. A breakout above $2,707 could trigger the next leg higher, while failure to hold above $2,660 may invite deeper consolidation. With ETH staking at record levels and institutional inflows holding firm, attention now turns to whether the current rally can sustain — or if further catalysts are needed to break past resistance and retest higher ground.

In a new report in the San Francisco Chronicle, Tamim Ghulam Haidar, the former Wells Fargo Union City branch operations associate manager, is accused of putting less money into the bank’s ATMs than he reported and pocketing the difference for his own use. Haidar allegedly deposited the ill-gotten gains he is accused of “knowingly and intentionally” embezzling into his own bank accounts or those he controlled and used the funds to cover losses that “he incurred while trading in the foreign currency markets,” according to legal documents filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California. Haidar allegedly committed the crimes from February 2021 to October 2022. Prosecutors accuse Haidar of sometimes using other bank employees’ credentials to deposit cash in the ATM to “conceal the fact he was inputting false and inflated dollar amounts.” Haidar is charged with embezzlement by a bank employee and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He faces up to 30 years in federal prison. Prosecutors are also seeking to force Haidar to forfeit the money he allegedly stole.

Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data.

Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May.

Ethereum’s price has increased recently, particularly between June 9 and June 10, surging from around $2,400 to over $2,700. This uptick marks a significant rally for the cryptocurrency, continuing its bullish momentum after a brief dip.While Ethereum has experienced considerable volatility in recent months, Peter Brandt, a veteran technical analyst, believes the asset is now setting the stage for a potential breakout.A Potential Breakout in the MakingBrandt highlighted a potential turning point for Ethereum in a post on X. The accompanying chart highlighted how ETH has transitioned from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. According to Brandt’s analysis, Ethereum has been moving within a descending channel since December 2024, when its price peaked above $4,000. Throughout this period, price movements remained capped within the channel’s boundaries, with resistance at the upper end and support at the lower end. Notably, Ethereum's price tested key levels, including $3,700 in January and $1,390 in April.However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-April, Ethereum's price began to form the symmetrical triangle pattern, which typically signals consolidation before a breakout. In this pattern, Ethereum's price has been capped on both ends. On the downside, support has been tested multiple times, most recently on June 6 at $2,392. Meanwhile, resistance near the $2,700 mark has held firm several times since May.Moving Averages and Market SentimentEthereum’s 18-period moving average is trending upwards, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. The moving average is currently acting as dynamic support, which may indicate an ongoing upward trend in the market. This aligns with the recent rally and provides further evidence that Ethereum may be gaining strength.On the other hand, the ADX (Average Directional Index) currently sits at 22.72, suggesting that the current trend remains weak. The ADX reading below 25 typically indicates a market consolidating rather than in a strong directional move. If Ethereum's price falls below the $2,150 support level, it could signal a bearish breakdown, potentially leading to further declines toward the long-term support below the $1,390 mark. However, Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, remarking, ""Every dog has its day — woof woof ETH.” This suggests now could be Ethereum’s time to shine after vastly underperforming Bitcoin.On the upside, resistance is positioned just below the $4,000 mark. Should Ethereum continue its rally, it could surge by approximately 48.7%, moving from its current price of $2,689 to the $4,000 resistance level.Inflows Into Ethereum: A Strong Market SignalMeanwhile, the digital asset market has seen strong inflows, with Ethereum leading the pack. According to CoinShares data , digital asset investment products experienced $224 million in inflows last week, continuing a seven-week streak of positive growth. Notably, Ethereum accounted for the largest share of these inflows, with $296.4 million entering the market. This marks the seventh consecutive week of inflows for Ethereum, pushing the total to $1.5 billion over this period.In contrast, Bitcoin has seen outflows, with $56.5 million leaving the market. This shift in investor sentiment suggests that Ethereum is attracting more attention, further supporting the belief that the cryptocurrency could be positioning itself for a breakout.",Market|Ethereum Price Prediction|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 07:15:37

The warning came after a strange post appeared on his profile, claiming the country had made Bitcoin legal tender and was creating a $5 million Bitcoin reserve fund. The message, written in English, had a Spanish-language image attached that falsely appeared to be an official government notice. The government told the public to ignore anything coming from the account until further notice. Officials said they noticed “irregular activity” that showed signs of “unauthorized entry.” That same morning, the cybersecurity team in Paraguay began working with X’s security department to figure out who got in and how. Officials connect hack to wider crypto scam wave in Latin America According to Reuters , the timing of the breach tracks with a growing wave of crypto scams on social media. These types of frauds usually show up in the form of sponsored posts or fake official messages pushing people to invest. The hacker behind Peña’s account followed that same playbook. The story echoes what happened in Argentina earlier this year, when President Javier Milei promoted a token named Libra on his social media that collapsed almost immediately. That scandal blew up in his face and triggered public backlash, especially after critics accused him of helping to pump a worthless coin. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele actually did make Bitcoin legal in his country back in 2021 and launched tokenized bonds shortly after. But what happened in Paraguay this week wasn’t real policy—it was a digital trap planted by someone exploiting Peña’s account. This isn’t Paraguay’s first brush with hackers. In May, the communications ministry tracked at least 18 attacks on over a dozen public agencies, including the civil aviation regulator and justice ministry. Those hacks targeted email systems, cloud platforms, and login credentials, and no official link to Peña’s breach has been confirmed. As of now, Peña hasn’t made any public statements, and the fake post has been deleted. No arrests or leads have been announced.

According to Simon McLoughlin, the company has hired FT Partners , a top investment banking firm in the fintech sector, to explore strategic options. This move suggests that Uphold is actively evaluating pathways to scale its operations and market presence. Uphold Confirms IPO Talks and Buyer Interest In a recent interview , Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin confirmed that the firm has engaged FT Partners to assess its strategic future. One key direction being explored is a potential public listing. McLoughlin also noted that several leading financial players — including banks, brokers, and payment companies — have expressed interest in acquiring Uphold. However, he declined to comment on the company’s current valuation. Market speculation places it around $1.5 billion . IPO Timing Follows Circle’s Market Boom The timing of Uphold’s potential IPO comes shortly after Circle — a well-known peer-to-peer payments company — went public. Since its debut, Circle’s stock price has jumped from $31 to $115 , showcasing a massive 300% surge . This success appears to have reignited IPO enthusiasm across the crypto fintech space. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Just Made Bitcoin DeFi Possible on Cardano , From $80M to $300M: Uphold’s Strong Revenue Growth Uphold has been on a steady growth trajectory.

The company is also actively promoting XRP-related products , including a US debit card with XRP rewards and yield farming options through the Flare Network . One of its most notable recent collaborations is with a German bank , signaling its growing influence in both US and European markets. Nasdaq Listing Could Drive Acquisitions According to McLoughlin, a Nasdaq listing could provide Uphold with the financial muscle to acquire other companies in what he described as a consolidating crypto market. The strategy signals Uphold’s intent to expand its footprint through aggressive yet strategic moves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This crypto project is not just built on hype or inspired by the meme industry, Neo Pepe was built to be decentralized and a token going against the traditional financial systems and their market controls. As financial markets become more regulated, Neo Pepe offers a better option that is designed for transparency, community governance, and decentralization. As the market continues to anticipate new projects, Neo Pepe is positioned as another entry into the market but with more transformative potential that investors can relate to due to its focus on freedom and financial independence. Experts Can’t Be -More- Excited For This Presale Crypto experts are anticipating the strong narrative backing Neo Pepe’s economic mechanism. Investors see the project as an opportunity, with its token possessing the ability to resist centralized financial controls with profit-oriented features. Its scheduled token unlock ensures that the market circulation is balanced, reducing the risks associated with the launch of new tokens. In addition, its auto-liquidity mechanism assures investors that the value of the token can be sustained, making it the best choice of presale in 2025 for investors. Another attractive feature is the ability of the project to carry its community along in decisions through voting and governance. This allows quick adaptation that is in line with the project’s laid down guidelines in terms of its investors and community choices, a big difference from traditional digital assets. Encouraging Tokenomics at Foundation Neo Pepe’s tokenomics sets it apart in the crypto industry. The tokenomics was set up to accommodate its presale, which will take place in 16 phases, moving the price of the token from $0.05 to $0.16. The project is also aiming for fundraising to hit its target of $50 million. This approach was designed to ensure that the growth of the token is structured, helping it sustain its growth. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. In addition, the token distribution shows that the project is following its purpose, allocating 45% of its supply to the presale, 25% to marketing, 10% to its platform development, another 10% to liquidity, and 5% each to ecosystem development and giveaways. This allocation move will ensure growth and support for its community and the development of its platform. Competitor Coins Run for Cover Allows token holders to make decisions through its governance framework, especially on listings and developments. Sets itself apart from tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by putting its community first and pushing decentralized governance. Stands out among presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), which lacks tools to carry its community along. Positioned as an asset with high potential due to its development model and direction. Avoids centralization risks faced by platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) by allowing community contribution. Seamless Token Acquisition Steps Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Check your transaction details and confirm the transaction details. Safely store your tokens inside your wallet. Potential No Other Coin Can Replicate Neo Pepe is not just looking to be a participant in the crypto space, it wants to lead it. Using its tokenomics and community governance, Neo Pepe ensures its members are updated with the happenings, making it a market leader in the crypto market. Compared to traditional cryptocurrencies, the project’s presale structure and liquidity features position it at the front of the growing crypto market. Neo Pepe’s approach to unlocking its token and liquidity maintenance is different from the volatility experienced by some presales, providing investors with a stable investment, making it one of the best presales in the current market.

Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) will welcome more than 6,400 attendees, 390 speakers, and 64 sponsors and will include 580 side events. Confirmed notable names include Vitalik Buterin, Stani Kulechov, Charles Guillemet, Robinhood’s crypto team, and many more. Additionally, the Mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, will do a keynote on why France should be adopting blockchain. As the event approaches, Cryptonews sat down for a chat about what to expect with Bettina Boon Falleur, Head Organiser of EthCC, and Jerome de Tychey, President of Ethereum France and co-founder of EthCC. How has EthCC evolved since its inception? Jerome de Tychey: It’s been incredible to see how far EthCC has come. What started as a small community meetup has grown into the largest Ethereum-focused event in Europe. Last year alone, we welcomed over 6,400 attendees and more than 350 speakers—an enormous leap from just a few hundred in the early days. Say hello to more EthCC[8] speakers!

The content has evolved alongside the ecosystem, with dedicated tracks now spanning zero-knowledge proofs , Layer 2s , public goods, crypto policy, and more. We’ve also launched programs like EthVC to connect builders with investors, and expanded support services such as childcare and quiet workspaces to make the event more accessible and inclusive. Two things have not changed, however: we still personally select every speaker to maintain the quality of content, and yes, that means turning down well-funded applicants if they don’t meet the bar. And we continue to believe deeply in the power of in-person gatherings to spark collaboration and move the space forward. CN: What themes or initiatives will we see at EthCC[8] that reflect how the Ethereum ecosystem itself is evolving? Bettina Boon: Each year, the themes at EthCC evolve in step with the Ethereum ecosystem itself. In 2025, we’re excited to introduce new tracks and initiatives that reflect where the space is headed. We’re seeing growing engagement from fintech players as integration with Ethereum deepens, so expect more voices from that world on stage this year as well as dedicated programming at the intersection of AI and blockchain, as these two technologies begin to converge in real-world applications. And with adoption top of mind, we’re launching a new track focused on product and marketing, two critical areas for translating great technology into tools that people actually use. CN: How are you balancing EthCC’s growth with staying true to Ethereum’s core values? JdT: As EthCC grows, we’re deeply committed to maintaining the openness and community-driven spirit that defines Ethereum. [As mentioned,] every speaker application is evaluated on the merit of the topic, not the brand name or prominence of the individual. Our goal is to create a platform where diverse voices from across the ecosystem, whether they’re working on core infrastructure, public goods, privacy, or new financial models, can be heard. Growth doesn’t mean centralization; it means widening the tent while staying rooted in Ethereum’s values of inclusivity, innovation, and decentralization.

BB: Events like EthCC[8] play a crucial role in fostering meaningful dialogue between regulators and the Ethereum community. Europe has taken a global lead with frameworks like MiCA, and each year we host more regulatory voices to explore how policy can evolve alongside technology. CN: Why do so many regulators choose to attend this specific conference? BB: Last year marked our largest presence of regulators yet, and we expect even more this year. What sets EthCC apart is that it’s a developer-first, technical conference that gives policymakers a rare opportunity to engage directly with the builders shaping the infrastructure they’re looking to regulate. We believe that the only way to create effective, future-ready regulation is through hands-on understanding. EthCC provides that bridge. CN: Cannes will host the conference for the first time this year. Is there a specific reason for choosing Cannes, especially given the size of the conference? JdT: Cannes offers the ideal setting for EthCC’s next chapter. The Palais des Festivals gives us the space and infrastructure to welcome a growing audience, while the city itself, ranked the best event city in 2024, hosts over 240 conferences annually, proving its strength as a global hub for innovation. ICYMI: Our Guide to Cannes has everything you need to prepare for an incredible week at EthCC[8]! Take a look and familiarise yourself with all of the amazing things this area has to offer: https://t.co/fPz9VflUBY — EthCC – Ethereum Community Conference (@EthCC) June 8, 2025 It’s also a highly walkable and secure city, with over 1,000 surveillance cameras and strong coordination between local authorities and event organizers to ensure safety. CN: Mayor Lisnard will do a keynote as well. Does this indicate general support from the city? JdT: The support from the local government has been remarkable. Cannes’ mayor is actively pro-crypto, and the city has embraced digital assets, with over 30% of shops now accepting crypto payments. Choosing Cannes is more than just a logistical upgrade. It’s also symbolic. Hosting EthCC[8] at the same iconic venue as the Lions, MIPIM, and MIPCOM signals that Ethereum, 10 years on, has earned its place on the world stage. CN: Lastly, what about the community itself – how is it changing? We hear there is a significant addition coming to EthCC. BB: On the community front, we’re also welcoming the next generation, quite literally. As the ecosystem matures, so do its builders, and we’re proud to offer a nursery and childcare options to support parents attending the conference.

The estimated value of crypto assets identified in insolvency cases also skyrocketed 364x to more than £520K (~$710K) in 2024/25, from just a little over £1K in 2019/20.

Freebury added that Andrew’s appointment would help IS investigators dealing with cases where crypto was a factor. “Crypto is very much a recoverable asset, and my role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of crypto assets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell, and store them.” – Andrew Small , Crypto Intelligence Specialist at the Insolvency Services The IS was keen on Bitcoin, Ethereum , DOGE, Litecoin, and Non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

UK to collect specific crypto user and transaction data starting next year The UK government will require crypto companies operating in the country to collect user and transaction information from 1 January 2026. The HM Revenue & Customs announced last week that the UK government’s data collection plan will follow the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The HMRC also said crypto firms may start collecting information earlier to be ready when the new rules come into force. For individual users, the required data will include the user’s name, date of birth, home address, country of residence, National Insurance number or Unique Taxpayer Reference (for UK residents), and the tax identification number (TIN) along with the country where it was issued (for non-UK residents). For entity users, companies must collect the legal business name, main business address, registration number (for UK firms), and the TIN and issuing country (for non-UK firms). In some cases, platforms must also gather details of the company’s controlling persons. Firms must also report sender and recipient names, addresses, tax IDs & full trade details (token type, quantity, GBP value, & timestamp).

But as the initial hype surrounding Dogecoin fizzles out, investors are beginning to shift their focus toward tokens with real-world utility. Enter Ruvi AI , a blockchain-based project that combines artificial intelligence with the power of utility, making it a top contender for smart money investors. With over $1.6 million raised , more than 140 million tokens sold , and its price currently at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 of its presale, Ruvi AI is emerging as a practical, scalable, and utility-driven alternative to Dogecoin. Dogecoin’s Hype vs. Ruvi AI’s Utility Dogecoin became a phenomenon, largely fueled by its meme-based identity and high-profile endorsements. While it has remained popular, Dogecoin lacks the critical factor that turns cryptocurrency from an asset into a solution: utility . Its value is heavily reliant on social media trends and speculative trading, making it volatile and less appealing to long-term, ROI-focused investors. Ruvi AI, in contrast, is built with a purpose. By leveraging artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, it is designed to solve real-world problems across key industries such as healthcare , logistics , and finance .

However, projections from several crypto analytics platforms suggest that its future value could be significantly higher, depending on the token’s long-term trajectory. Current market data and predictions for 2040 and 2050 indicate that SHIB could see moderate gains or astronomical growth. Such forecasts remain speculative and depend on numerous evolving factors, though. At Shib’s current price, a $1,000 investment would purchase approximately 78,369,905 SHIB tokens. Recent market developments, including a brief but sharp drop in SHIB’s price below $0.000012, were attributed to heightened volatility caused by a dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. However, the broader crypto market recovered quickly, and SHIB regained value, hovering around the $0.00001276 mark. This quick rebound has renewed interest in SHIB’s long-term potential . Investors are increasingly interested in projections for the coming decades, particularly for 2040 and 2050, to evaluate what a low-cost investment today could be worth in the distant future. Projected Value of $1,000 in SHIB by 2040 Two key sources — Changelly and Telegaon — have published different sets of price forecasts for SHIB by 2040. According to Changelly , SHIB may reach a minimum of $0.020 and a maximum of $0.023 by 2040. If those targets are met, the current $1,000 investment could be worth between $1,567,000 and $1,802,280, assuming the token supply remains constant and the holder retains the original 78.36 million tokens. Telegaon provides a more optimistic outlook, projecting that SHIB could start the year 2040 at $0.054 and climb as high as $0.089. Under this scenario, the value of a $1,000 investment would surge to between $4.23 million and $6.97 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 2050 Price Estimates For 2050, Changelly estimates a potential trading range of $0.029 to $0.033. If those targets are achieved, the same $1,000 investment in SHIB would be valued at between $2.27 million and $2.58 million. Telegaon, however, sets a far more ambitious target. Their analysts believe SHIB could be worth between $0.62 and $1.06 in 2050. At those price points, the original 78.36 million SHIB tokens could yield a portfolio value between $48.59 million and $83.07 million. Is It Realistic? These projections vary significantly, raising the question about feasibility. For instance, reaching Telegaon’s maximum target of $1.06 would require an unprecedented 8,307,110% increase in price. Additionally, this would result in a market capitalization of $624.87 trillion, far exceeding the total market cap of all global assets combined, assuming SHIB’s supply stays around 589.5 trillion tokens. Given these figures, it is important to approach these forecasts with caution. While some growth is possible, achieving such extreme targets is statistically unlikely. As with any speculative asset, investors should consider the risks and avoid relying on long-term projections as the basis for financial decisions.

During a June 10 press conference , lawmaker Min Byeong-deok announced the bill’s submission, calling it a foundational step toward comprehensive regulation of digital assets, including stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and related service providers. Min said the legislation was designed to enhance transparency and investor protection while positioning South Korea as a global leader in the digital economy. The Digital Asset Basic Act builds on the existing Virtual Asset Investor Protection Act, which came into effect in July 2024. While the previous legislation focused primarily on safeguarding investors, the new proposal outlines a broader framework that defines digital assets, establishes new licensing and approval systems, and mandates oversight mechanisms under the Financial Services Commission. A key feature of the bill is the licensing requirement for issuers of Korean won-backed stablecoins. Notably, issuers must maintain a minimum capital of ₩500 million (approximately $367,890) and obtain approval from the Financial Services Commission. You might also like: Meet the new South Korea president Lee Jae-myung, what is his stance on crypto? Additionally, they must implement safeguards such as bankruptcy remoteness and reserve management to ensure user redemption rights even if the stablecoin issuer becomes insolvent. Furthermore, the regulations lay the groundwork for regulating all digital asset issuances and trading activities. It includes provisions to establish a Digital Asset Committee under the President’s office to coordinate national digital asset policy. Meanwhile, a separate entity dubbed the Digital Asset Industry Association would be tasked with monitoring market practices and evaluating the eligibility of tokens for exchange listings through dedicated subcommittees. To address market misconduct, the bill grants the Financial Services Commission investigative authority and empowers it to impose penalties for unfair trading activities. It also introduces approval, registration, and reporting requirements for companies operating in the digital asset sector. The introduction of the Digital Asset Basic Act comes just days after President Lee Jae-myung’s inauguration on June 4. Lee, who won the presidency with over 49% of the vote, had campaigned on a platform that included strong support for digital asset adoption and regulatory clarity. His campaign proposals included legalizing spot crypto ETFs, expanding institutional access to digital assets, and enabling the nation’s pension fund to allocate capital into crypto markets. Min Byeong-deok, who led the party’s digital asset committee during Lee’s campaign, has advocated for broader crypto regulation but has placed particular emphasis on the urgency of launching a domestic stablecoin framework to counter U.S. dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT.

The fund is intended to include the INJ token and allow staking and generating passive income. Canary Capital registered a Delaware company in advance of applying for an Injective (INJ) ETF. The entity has been filed under the number 10221067, under the name ‘Canary staked INJ ETF.’ The Injective team also announced the possibility for an ETF filing in the near future. BREAKING: CANARY STAKED $INJ ETF REGISTERED IN DELAWARE 🚨 — Injective 🥷 (@injective) June 9, 2025 The creation of a trust in Delaware precedes additional filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, starting the discussion and waiting period until the ETF is approved. The fund will initially be tailored to US-based investors. INJ is also among the tokens known as ‘Made in USA’, based on the team’s main location and US-based fundraising. INJ is already gaining mainstream exposure from the European markets, where 21Shares launched an ETP. The product also offers proceeds from staking. ETPs are sometimes easier to launch, though funds still attempt to build full ETFs for greater exposure and higher liquidity. Altcoin ETFs are still relatively few, as most of the buyers accumulate BTC or ETH. Canary Capital has been known for attempting a long list of ETFs for older, well-established altcoins, which may shine if given new attention. The investment fund has proposed ETFs for TRON, Litecoin, Hedera, Sui, Axelar, and even Pengu. The investment company aims for expansion, where most of the new ETF filings focus on Solana and XRP. Injective may bring traditional finance to DeFi The attempt to create an ETF based on Injective will potentially invite mainstream investments into the DeFi space. Injective has been one of the most active chains, claiming to be built specifically for scalable decentralized finance. In the past few months, Injective increased its daily active users, up to 48K daily. Injective’s user base expanded in the last two months, as DeFi regained the interest of investors. | Source: Token Terminal The chain still pays out incentives to its validators, while generating around $40K in daily fees. Currently, Injective has negative daily earnings of over $1M, mostly due to incentives. However, INJ is not inflationary, and has a total supply of 100M tokens, with around 97M in circulation. The attention for a wider selection of crypto assets suggests this cycle has not abandoned altcoins and tokens, but may continue to boost liquidity. Currently, Injective locks in $28.86M in total value, lagging behind other L1s. The platform is just building up its DeFi liquidity, tapping increased demand for lending and DEX swaps. Following the news of a potential ETF, INJ tokens expanded by 4.7% up to $13.56. INJ has rallied up to $40, and is considered undervalued compared to other L1 tokens. INJ open interest is near its higher range for the past three months, recovering to $68M. The overall consensus is that INJ lags due to the slow altcoin season, but may hold the potential for a higher price range and wider adoption. INJ tokens are 100% unlocked, expecting no shocks of increased circulation. Staking also takes INJ off the market. INJ is listed on Binance, though most of its volumes are currently on DigiFinex.

The move comes after a brief rejection near the $2.3278 mark, which has emerged as a near-term resistance zone. While the broader market has stabilized, XRP price volatility is beginning to pick up again as bulls and bears battle near key short-term trendlines. What’s Happening With XRP’s Price? XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The XRP price action has recently formed a tightening range following a breakout from a lower consolidation wedge. On the 30-minute chart, XRP has bounced off the Ichimoku cloud base at $2.2894, showing early signs of defending this structural support. The cloud is beginning to flatten, signaling a potential pause in momentum, while the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen lines remain tightly compressed — a setup often preceding a breakout move. Stochastic RSI is deep in the oversold zone at 4.84/1.91, indicating a potential bullish reversal if price holds above the cloud. At the same time, price continues to trade just above the flat Kijun-Sen line, which has previously served as a bounce… The post XRP Price Prediction for June 11: Key Support at $2.25 Holds as Bulls Eye Rebound appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Price Prediction|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-06-10 07:58:23

Phase 6 is now live at $6 per token, and the next major step is a centralized exchange listing projected at $20 — a 233% increase for current participants. What stands out isn’t the jump alone. It’s the framework supporting it. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t launching on paper. It’s backed by active audits, functioning mechanics, and a sharply defined 21 million token cap. That’s what’s drawing capital — not influencers, not empty ads, but protocol-level logic. What Powers This Demand? Every strong presale has a reason it doesn’t need to push marketing gimmicks. For Bitcoin Solaris, that reason is structural. The token isn’t diluted by staking inflation or burdened with team-controlled emissions. Only 4.2 million BTC-S have been designated for presale across all phases: there is no secret allocation, and no dev wallet minting event waiting down the line. The blockchain itself operates on a hybrid architecture: a base consensus layer combining Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity, paired with a high-throughput Solaris Layer running Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. Together, this system clears over 10,000 transactions per second with a finality time of two seconds — all while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. Audited. Verified. Positioned. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have completed independent audits of the protocol and mobile infrastructure. Smart contracts, consensus logic, and application data have been tested for both security and performance compliance. Cyberscope Audit PDF Freshcoins Audit PDF KYC Verification This level of pre-launch transparency isn’t typical — and it’s exactly why capital is flowing. The protocol doesn’t rely on trust. It shows its work. Analyst Attention Is Already Here Ben Crypto , a known figure in crypto forecasting, recently spotlighted Bitcoin Solaris in a full analysis, citing its scarcity mechanics and audit-backed infrastructure as reasons the token could easily cross $100 within 24 months. That analysis is based on a functioning ecosystem with working code, a defined user base, and a presale designed to reward early participants — not trap them in vesting cliffs or delayed unlocks. $6 Entry Is Still Open Bitcoin Solaris is still in Phase 6 of its presale. BTC-S tokens are available at $6 for a limited window before the project moves to centralized listing and public exposure. With benchmarks set for $20 upon launch, the entry spread is what’s driving urgency. Investors aren’t waiting on marketing events or big promises. They’re entering a network where functionality is live, and the multiplier is locked in by math — not guesswork.

Bitcoin Has Seen A Spike In Exchange Inflows Recently In a new post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Netflow for Bitcoin. The Exchange Netflow is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of the asset that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchange inflows outweigh the exchange outflows. As one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the holders are taking out a net number of tokens from exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow since the start of the month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has recently mostly been contained in the negative territory, but the latest value (yesterday’s) has been positive. In total, the investors have deposited a net $262.75 million of the asset to the exchange-connected wallets with this inflow spike. According to the analytics firm, this marks the first day of significant deposits since May 27th. As mentioned before, exchange inflows are something that can turn out to be bearish for the coin’s value. So far, however, the opposite has happened for Bitcoin, as its price has soared instead. This could indicate that even if there are some large holders looking to sell with these deposits, enough demand has surfaced at the same time that BTC has not only been able to ride out this wave of potential selling pressure, but actually add to its recovery. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin According to the analytics firm Glassnode, short liquidations have registered a notable uptick alongside this surge in the cryptocurrency. “Over just 4 hours, total short liquidations spiked from $105K to $359K (24H SMA),” notes Glassnode. Generally, large liquidations end up providing fuel to the price move that caused them, so in this case, it’s possible the short squeeze may have provided support to the Bitcoin rally.

The crypto market overall is holding a solid $3.38 trillion valuation. But as investors gear up for the next big Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, many are starting to temper their expectations, especially when it comes to interest rate cuts. No FED Rate Cuts—At Least Not Yet For months, traders expected the Fed to begin cutting rates by summer. But recent job data changed the mood. Hiring remains strong, and inflation is still running above the Fed’s comfort level. That gives the central bank little reason to ease up on its current policy. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 99.9% chance the Fed will keep rates steady in June, with just a 0.1% chance of a 25 basis point cut. Looking to July, the odds of a rate cut sit at just 14.5%. Back in May, those chances were much higher, showing how much sentiment has shifted in just a few weeks. Trump, ECB Push for Cuts—but Fed Holds Its Ground The pressure is building on the Fed. The European Central Bank just cut its interest rates by 25 basis points. And Donald Trump is calling for a much more aggressive 100 bps rate cut in the U.S., saying it would be “rocket fuel” for the economy. He’s also criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted that Kevin Warsh could replace him. Still, the Fed remains cautious. Officials are watching how tariffs and inflation will affect the economy before making any big moves. So for now, it looks like interest rates will stay between 425–450 basis points for the foreseeable future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , How Crypto Is Reacting Crypto markets are in a bit of a mixed mood. Bitcoin and Gold are showing strength, and some traders are shifting out of the U.S. dollar into riskier assets like crypto. According to Sergei Gorev from Youhodler , this trend is helping keep Bitcoin’s price elevated. But not all signs are bullish. Gorev also points out that Bitcoin’s chart is showing a potential “Head and Shoulders” pattern, which, if it plays out, could pull prices down to around $92,000. With the FOMC meeting coming up and inflation data on the way, the crypto market is walking a fine line between optimism and caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The announcement was made by Cardano ( ADA ) founder Charles Hoskinson on June 9 via X. Developed by Input Output, the research and development team behind Cardano, Cardinal allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders to access DeFi services such as lending, staking, and borrowing without using traditional custodians or centralized bridges. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Cardinal functions by wrapping Bitcoin, particularly its unspent transaction outputs. UTXOs are bits of Bitcoin that have been left over from transactions and are used to represent ownership. They are converted into wrapped tokens by the protocol, which maintains a 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. Users can redeem their wrapped BTC at any time through a secure, fraud-resistant process. What makes Cardinal different from typical wrapped Bitcoin solutions is its trust-minimized structure. Instead of depending on a central custodian or federated system, Cardinal uses MuSig2, a cryptographic system that allows multiple parties to sign transactions together. This ensures that the original Bitcoin stays locked on its native chain and that the system functions securely, even if only one participant is honest. You might also like: Brave Wallet expands support with Cardano integration Another key feature is Cardinal’s approach to rehypothecation. In traditional finance and some crypto systems, rehypothecation allows custodians to reuse user assets, often without full transparency. Cardinal avoids this by allowing users complete control over their assets while preserving the original Bitcoin. In addition, the protocol makes use of BitVMX, an off-chain execution system that maintains decentralization while enabling complex Bitcoin operations. This configuration facilitates safe, easy asset transfers between the two networks when paired with Cardano smart contracts and Bitcoin’s built-in scripting capabilities. The project was showcased during a live demo at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where IO performed a bridgeless BTC-to-Cardano transfer using BitVMX. The event marked a major step in Cardano’s efforts to become a platform for Bitcoin-native applications. Despite recent progress, Cardano’s DeFi total value locked has declined, from peak of $415 million in May to around $334 million by June 10, as per DefiLlama data . The team hopes Cardinal will help bring in new liquidity by offering Bitcoin holders more ways to use their assets within a DeFi environment, without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Lee, a progressive leader who narrowly defeated his conservative opponent in last week’s presidential election, had made stablecoin regulation one of his biggest talking points in his campaign. He argues that allowing regulated issuance of asset-backed digital tokens will boost transparency, expand the domestic crypto sector, and place South Korea ahead of several countries in matters of digital finance. The legislation was submitted to parliament on Tuesday, with provisions that could see South Korean firms issue stablecoins if they meet a minimum equity capital requirement of 500 million won, equivalent to about $367,876. These issuers would also be required to carry sufficient reserves to guarantee refunds and security of customer funds. Post-election South Korea: Crypto regulatory clarity South Korea is recognized as one of the most active crypto markets globally. Upbit, the top exchange in the Asian nation by trading volume, has a daily average of $1.5 billion trades. Of an estimated 18 million South Koreans, roughly one-third of the population, are digital asset traders. Daily volumes on local exchanges often exceed those on the nation’s major stock indexes, the Kospi and Kosdaq. Just as in the US, where Congress is set to vote on its own stablecoin bill this week, South Korea’s proposed legislation mandates that all asset-linked digital currencies, including stablecoins, must receive approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the country’s top financial regulator. According to Bank of Korea data cited by Yonhap News, transactions involving major stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, and USDS on five domestic exchanges totaled 57 trillion won in the first quarter alone . Despite the enthusiasm surrounding stablecoins, Lee’s initiative is facing institutional pushback, specifically from the country’s central bank. Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong believes stablecoins issued by nonbank entities will have monetary implications for South Korea’s monetary policies. “These instruments, if allowed outside regulated institutions, could serve as vehicles for capital regulation arbitrage,” Rhee told reporters in a press conference in May. The governor wants BOK to take responsibility for any won-pegged stablecoin, insisting that Korea should not take capital flow risks “lightly.” “Financial stability concerns demand that we consider capital controls more thoroughly before allowing non-bank entities into the payments sector. This concern is shared by other Asian economies as well,” he concluded. Financial markets respond to legislation proposal After news of Lee’s stablecoin proposal was published on several outlets, shares of financial services firm KakaoPay Corp. surged as much as 18% on Tuesday, its highest daily gain since January 2024. The period also boded well for the broader KOSPI index, which closed at 2,882, a gain of 26 points, or 0.92%, from the previous session. Over the past four weeks, the index is up 10.53%. However, not all observers are convinced that the policy shift will translate into tangible corporate gains. In a client note, JPMorgan analysts Stanley Yang and Jihyun Cho were far less confident about the rally in Kakao-affiliated stocks. “ The rally in Kakao-related shares is fundamentally unjustifiable, as any concrete benefit from Lee’s stablecoin policy remains uncertain ,” they wrote. Fears from the collapse of TerraUSD, a South Korean-created algorithmic stablecoin that failed in 2022, are also still clouding the chances of crypto firms to succeed in the country. The implosion erased $40 billion in value and is a painful memory for many South Korean investors. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin could reach $1 million within a decade as trust in fiat declines. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the influential book Rich Dad Poor Dad , has issued a stark warning about rising unrest in the United States, drawing connections between violent incidents and deeper economic turmoil. In a recent post on X , Kiyosaki declared, “Civil War has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence… I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot violent summer.” The statement comes amid growing political division and economic instability. Kiyosaki Links U.S. Unrest to ‘Fourth Turning’ Crisis Cycle Kiyosaki tied the unrest to what historians William Strauss and Neil Howe have described as the “fourth turning,” a cyclical period of crisis that reshapes the fabric of society. Previous fourth turnings, according to the theory, include the Great Depression and World War II, the Civil War, and the American Revolution. Kiyosaki suggests that the current upheaval will be driven by public backlash against central banking practices, especially the sustained printing of money and inflationary policies. He argues that these policies erode public wealth, framing them as a form of institutional theft. “The issue is our bankers are stealing the wealth of the people via fake money, counterfeit money the central bankers print,” he wrote. He added that this era is ending, and that people should turn to alternative stores of value. As a solution, Kiyosaki is urging individuals to protect their financial futures by investing in hard assets. “Sound money, gold, silver, and Bitcoin take away the power from the corrupt bankers,” he noted. He describes gold and silver as “God’s money” and Bitcoin as “people’s money.” CIVIL WAR has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence. BIG QUESTION: Will it spread? MY ANSWER: I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot, violent summer. This turmoil is described in the FOURTH TURNING by Strauss and Howe, who posit that society… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 9, 2025 Kiyosaki’s latest comments reinforce his long-standing belief that traditional financial systems are broken. Amid warnings of prolonged violence and social disruption, he advocates for individual financial sovereignty, calling on followers to “become your own bank” and stop saving “fake money.” Kiyosaki Sees $1M Bitcoin by Next Decade A longtime advocate of hard assets, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as a modern hedge against inflation and a tool for preserving wealth over time. In his latest prediction , Kiyosaki said he “strongly believes” the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year. Over the next decade, he sees BTC at $1 million, gold at $30,000 per ounce, and silver at $3,000. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure.

The upward trend reflects growing investor confidence in digital assets, particularly among publicly traded firms seeking to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. Leading the day’s movement was Nasdaq’s recent entrant, Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which jumped 7% and rose another 2.2% in after-hours trading, closing at $117.79. Major crypto miners followed suit. Core Scientific Inc. (CORZ) rose 4.27%, with a slight 0.87% bump after market close. Competitors CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK) and MARA Holdings Inc. (MARA) each climbed over 3%, with both stocks ticking up another 1% in after-hours activity. Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) also added 2.74% during the day, followed by a 1.2% increase after-hours. These gains coincided with Bitcoin’s own 4% surge to $110,150, edging closer to its record high of $112,000 set on May 22. Market sentiment appeared to improve amid reports of U.S.–China trade discussions held in the UK. Mixed Results for Trading Platforms’ Stocks Not all crypto-related stocks enjoyed Monday’s rally. Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) was among the few laggards, falling nearly 2% to $73.40 after being left out of the S&P 500 index during its latest rebalancing. The omission came as a disappointment to investors who had speculated on Robinhood’s inclusion, a move that often brings a boost in share price due to increased institutional interest. In contrast, rival trading platform eToro Group Ltd. (ETOR), which recently went public , surged 10.5% and climbed another 2.4% after hours to $77.79. American crypto exchange giant Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) posted a modest 2% gain to $256.63, reflecting steady investor support amid the broader market uptrend. Bitcoin Holdings Fuel Investor Confidence Several public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR), already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, gained 4.71% and added over 1% in after-hours trading to reach $396.61. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) became the latest firm to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, announcing the purchase of 100 BTC following an $18 million share offering. Despite the news, BMNR fell 8.7% before slightly rebounding by 5.2% after hours to $7.25. Energy tech company KULR Technology Group Inc. (KULR) also made headlines after announcing it had purchased another $13 million in Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 920 BTC at an average price of $98,760 per coin. Its stocks responded positively, climbing 4.2% on the day.

Attorney Bill Morgan took to social media and criticised VanEck for playing both sides. Morgan brought to attention VanEck’s inconsistency as they pushed for fairness in ETFs, but chose to remain silent for XRP when it was in a similar situation. Don’t recall you complaining about SEC favoritism when Ripple was sued over XRP sales and Ethereum received a free pass. https://t.co/h8CJ2qk9Yt — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 9, 2025 For the unversed, asset managers like VanEck, Canary Capital, and 21Shares signed a joint letter to the SEC Chair Paul Atkins, urging a fair and consistent process for approving crypto ETFs. Bill Morgan Slams VanEck’s Silence on XRP Case They requested the SEC to adopt a fair “first-to-file, first-to-approve” rule for crypto ETFs explaining that favoritism damages innovation in the ETF market. This came after long delays and growing uncertainty around spot ETF approvals. But Morgan slammed VanEck for staying silent during the Ripple lawsuit. Morgan wrote on X, “Don’t recall you complaining about SEC favoritism when Ripple was sued over XRP sales and Ethereum received a free pass.” XRP faced legal actions, while Ethereum walked away clean when it was called a non-security by SEC official William Hinman in a 2018 speech. Key Court Deadline Could Trigger Major Moves This has raised concerns over conflicts of interest at the SEC. Critics like John Deaton have also questioned how credible Hinman’s speech actually was and whether the SEC is being fair and transparent with its crypto rules. These comments come as the crypto community anxiously awaits for updates on a likely settlement between the Ripple vs SEC. A key deadline for the SEC to report to the Appeals Court is coming up on June 16. XRP Holding $2.29, Can Bulls Push Toward ATH? XRP is up 2.7% in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at $2.29. The next move will now depend on updates from the Ripple case and spot ETF news. A breakout above $2.35 could push XRP to $2.50, then $2.65, and possibly $3 or even its all-time high of $3.55. But if it drops below the 50-day EMA, bears could drag it down to $1.93.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 08:19:01

Amid its recent breakout from a bullish formation, some market watchers suggest that the cryptocurrency could recover its start-of-year glory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Chart Flexes Strength—Is The Moonshot Just Getting Started? Solana Breakout Eyes $164 Solana is recording a 2.45% surge in the weekly timeframe after recovering from its recent drop to the $140 area. The altcoin has seen a significant recovery from its multi-month downtrend, which led the token to hit a 14-month low of $95 during the early April retraces. However, SOL lost the $160 area amid the recent market corrections, dipping 11% in one week. Over the weekend, its price bounced nearly 10%, reclaiming the $150 level as support and forming an ascending triangle pattern. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the 3-day formation in Solana’s chart, suggesting a potential 6% jump to its recently lost support level. According to the post, the cryptocurrency broke out of the triangle formation on Monday after reclaiming the $155 area. A retest and breakout confirmation could propel Solana to the $164 barrier, which has not been seen in two weeks. Analyst CW noted that if SOL breaks through the selling barrier around the $160 level, “the previous price will recover quickly,” as reclaiming this level could send the price straight to the $180 area. Notably, the altcoin’s next significant selling wall is around the $180 resistance, which it has been unable to reclaim despite touching a $187 three-month high during the recent market rally. Recovering this key barrier could also push SOL’s price toward the $200 mark, enabling a rally to new highs. However, failing to hold the current levels could send the cryptocurrency’s price back toward the $142 buying wall, which served as support last week, or even the $135 level, where the next buy wall sits. SOL Preparing To Climb Higher? Market watcher Jeremy pointed out that Solana is “finally breaking out from this downtrend consolidation.” Per the post, the cryptocurrency has been consolidating in a descending channel since late May, hovering between the $140-$187 price range. Throughout this period, SOL’s price moved from the $180 mark toward the $144 support. Nonetheless, it broke out of the two-week descending channel after reclaiming the $155 level. Jeremy suggested that Solana’s price could “actually climb higher” if global conflicts and political disputes, like the Trump-Musk online feud, don’t continue to affect the market, concluding that “1 SOL = $300 is just a matter of time.” Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric Meanwhile, crypto trader Coinvo recently affirmed that SOL’s bottom “is finally in,” highlighting a potential bullish megaphone pattern in SOL’s chart. The 18-month pattern shows that the fourth wave bounced from the formation’s lower boundary during the April pullback. This could signal a potential surge to the upper boundary, around the all-time high (ATH) levels, during the fifth wave. A breakout above the pattern’s resistance line could propel Solana to new highs As of this writing, Solana trades at $156, a 1.88% increase in the daily timeframe.

Turnkey, a leading firm specializing in crypto wallet infrastructure, has just announced a significant milestone: the successful closure of a $30 million Series B funding round. This substantial investment, spearheaded by the prominent venture capital firm Bain Capital Crypto, marks a pivotal moment for Turnkey and the broader ecosystem of web3 development. In an industry where security, usability, and developer experience are paramount, Turnkey is building essential foundational technology. Their focus on providing robust APIs for developers to easily create secure, user-friendly wallets addresses a critical need, simplifying what can often be a complex and daunting task in blockchain development. Why is Robust Crypto Wallet Infrastructure Crucial for Web3? Think of crypto wallets as the keys to the decentralized world. Without reliable and secure ways for users to manage their digital assets and interact with decentralized applications (dApps), mass adoption of Web3 remains a distant dream. Developers face numerous challenges when building wallet functionalities from scratch: Security Risks: Managing private keys securely is complex and prone to errors if not handled expertly. User Experience: Creating intuitive interfaces that abstract away blockchain complexities for the average user is difficult. Integration Headaches: Connecting wallets to various blockchains, protocols, and dApps requires significant development effort. Maintenance: Keeping up with evolving security standards and blockchain updates is an ongoing challenge. This is where specialized providers like Turnkey come in. By offering APIs that abstract away much of this complexity, they allow developers to focus on building their core product or service, rather than getting bogged down in the intricacies of crypto wallet infrastructure. This accelerates innovation and lowers the barrier to entry for web3 development. Accelerating Web3 Development Through APIs Turnkey’s core offering revolves around providing developers with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow them to easily embed wallet functionalities directly into their applications. What does this mean in practice? It means platforms can offer users seamless wallet creation and management experiences without users needing to download separate browser extensions or mobile apps initially. It enables features like: Programmatic wallet creation and management. Secure transaction signing without exposing private keys directly to the application layer. Flexible authentication methods tailored to the application’s needs. Simplified integration with various blockchain networks. This API-first approach is a game-changer for web3 development teams. It allows for greater customization, tighter integration with existing user flows, and ultimately, a much smoother experience for the end-user. Imagine signing up for a Web3 service and having a secure, non-custodial wallet created for you instantly, linked to your account within that service – that’s the power of robust wallet APIs. A Closer Look at the $30M Blockchain Funding Round The $30 million secured by Turnkey in this Series B round is a significant vote of confidence from investors, particularly in the current market climate. Leading the round is Bain Capital Crypto, the dedicated crypto and Web3 investment arm of the global private equity giant Bain Capital. Bain Capital Crypto has been an active and respected investor in the space, backing foundational technologies and promising protocols. Their decision to lead Turnkey’s funding highlights a belief in the critical importance of infrastructure layers for the future growth of the decentralized web. While much attention goes to consumer-facing dApps or specific protocols, the underlying infrastructure that makes them usable and secure is equally, if not more, vital. This blockchain funding round will provide Turnkey with the capital needed to significantly scale its operations and technology. What’s Next for Turnkey ? Expansion and Innovation According to reports, the primary use of the $30 million investment will be to support the expansion of Turnkey’s engineering team. This is crucial for several reasons: Accelerated Feature Development: A larger team can build new APIs and functionalities faster, keeping Turnkey at the cutting edge of crypto wallet infrastructure. Enhanced Security: More engineers dedicated to security research and implementation are vital in the ever-evolving threat landscape of Web3. Broader Blockchain Support: Expanding the team can help Turnkey integrate support for more blockchain networks and standards. Improved Developer Experience: Investing in the team also means improving documentation, support, and tools for developers using their APIs. This focus on engineering expansion suggests that Turnkey is prioritizing the core technology and aiming to solidify its position as a leading provider in the space. As web3 development continues to mature, the demand for sophisticated, secure, and easy-to-integrate wallet solutions will only grow. Who Benefits from Turnkey ‘s Infrastructure? Real-World Examples Turnkey already boasts an impressive roster of clients across different sectors of the Web3 ecosystem, demonstrating the versatility and need for their service. Clients mentioned include: Polymarket: A decentralized prediction market platform. For Polymarket, seamless wallet integration is key for users to easily place bets and claim winnings using various cryptocurrencies. Turnkey’s infrastructure likely helps them manage user wallets securely and efficiently. Magic Eden: A prominent non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace. On platforms like Magic Eden, users need reliable wallets to buy, sell, and store NFTs. Turnkey’s APIs can simplify the wallet creation and transaction signing process, improving the user experience on the marketplace. Bridge: A stablecoin firm owned by Stripe, the global payment processing giant. Bridge likely requires robust, compliant, and scalable wallet solutions to handle stablecoin transactions for businesses. Turnkey’s enterprise-grade infrastructure can cater to such demanding requirements. These examples highlight how diverse applications, from consumer-facing marketplaces to enterprise-level financial services, rely on solid crypto wallet infrastructure to function effectively and securely. Turnkey’s ability to serve these varied clients underscores the strength and flexibility of their API platform for web3 development. Navigating the Future of Web3 Development While the funding is a major win, the path forward for Web3 development and its underlying infrastructure isn’t without challenges. Regulatory clarity, achieving true mass adoption beyond early enthusiasts, and continuously innovating on security paradigms remain key hurdles. However, investments like the one in Turnkey indicate a strong belief in the long-term potential of the space. For developers, this funding means that essential tools like Turnkey’s wallet APIs will likely become even more powerful, reliable, and feature-rich. This should make building the next generation of Web3 applications easier and more secure. For investors, it signals that the infrastructure layer supporting decentralized applications is a key area of growth and opportunity within the broader blockchain funding landscape. Compelling Summary Turnkey’s successful $30 million Series B funding round, led by Bain Capital Crypto, is a significant development for the crypto wallet infrastructure sector and the broader Web3 ecosystem. By providing developers with powerful APIs to build secure and user-friendly wallets, Turnkey is addressing a fundamental need, accelerating web3 development across various applications like prediction markets, NFT marketplaces, and stablecoin services. This substantial blockchain funding will fuel the expansion of their engineering team, promising enhanced features, security, and support. As the decentralized web continues to evolve, robust and accessible infrastructure like that offered by Turnkey will be indispensable in bringing Web3 to a wider audience. This investment underscores the growing maturity and importance of the companies building the foundational layers of the decentralized future.

The ongoing negotiations, focused on easing tariff measures, have rekindled hopes of a breakthrough between the world’s two largest economies. A positive resolution would mark another de-escalation in a trade conflict that has roiled markets since early 2025. Historically, such progress has triggered a shift into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s rally comes after its breakout to all-time highs in May, following the announcement of a 90-day tariff pause between the US and China. That agreement had provided the first real signs of diplomatic traction and acted as a tailwind for both equities and digital assets. With Bitcoin pushing toward new highs amid improving macro conditions, retail investors are increasingly turning to speculative tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now approaching the final stretch of its presale. Momentum-driven capital is rotating into early-stage projects as traders hunt for assets with asymmetric upside potential. This appetite for risk is being fueled by a broader crypto rebound, underpinned by institutional flows and easing macroeconomic headwinds. Corporations continue plans to accumulate BTC Siebert Financial Corp., a Nasdaq-listed financial services firm, announced on Monday that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has declared its S-3 shelf registration statement effective, allowing the company to raise up to $100 million for investments in crypto assets, artificial intelligence, and potential acquisitions. According to the company’s statement, proceeds from the offering will support a range of strategic initiatives, including the purchase of digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, as well as investments in AI-powered technologies and services. The S-3 filing enables Siebert to offer a mix of securities over time, up to the $100 million threshold. While no specific offering details were announced, the company signaled a clear intent to build exposure to digital assets and modernize its technological capabilities. Siebert joins a growing list of public firms expanding their Bitcoin treasuries. On Monday, Michael Saylor-led Strategy disclosed it had acquired another 1,045 BTC for approximately $110.2 million, lifting its total holdings to 582,000 BTC. Elsewhere, K33, Trump Media, and GameStop have recently announced plans to bolster their crypto reserves. In Japan, Metaplanet last week launched a $5.4 billion equity raise to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. BTC’s adoption may help Bitcoin Pepe’s rise With Bitcoin eyeing new highs amid rising institutional adoption, a foundation is being laid for broader market momentum. In this increasingly risk-friendly environment, investors with higher risk tolerance are rotating back into speculative and early-stage projects that carry the potential for outsized returns. Positioned at the intersection of meme culture and Bitcoin infrastructure, Bitcoin Pepe has gained traction as a standout bet among retail participants chasing high-reward plays. As the first meme-focused Layer 2 built on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe aims to combine the blockchain’s core security with the scalability typically associated with Solana-style architectures. With over $14 million raised in its ongoing presale, Bitcoin Pepe is drawing significant investor interest amid a broader shift toward early-stage, high-upside tokens. To strengthen its ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has also secured partnerships with various projects, including Super Meme, GemuPlay, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. With a listing announcement scheduled for June 17, the project continues to position itself as a notable player in the cryptocurrency market.

He emphasized that DeFi aligns with American values of economic freedom and innovation, and criticized outdated regulations that stifle blockchain growth. According to him, past actions discouraged U.S. users and builders through legal threats and unclear rules. In a major shift, Atkins clarified that operating as a validator, miner, or staking service provider does not fall under federal securities laws. He also stated that publishing code for staking or wallets is not the same as acting as a broker. This is a crucial win for Ethereum, the backbone of DeFi, with over $68 billion in total value locked—more than half of the entire DeFi market. Looking forward, the SEC plans to issue clearer guidance and possibly amend current rules to accommodate on-chain financial systems. Atkins proposed a special ""innovation exemption"" to fast-track new crypto projects under specific conditions, echoing former President Trump's goal of making the U.S. the top crypto hub globally. The Ethereum community responded with optimism. Former developer Eric Conner called it a “huge day,” highlighting how the update provides clarity for staking, self-custody, and open-source infrastructure. Despite the positive momentum and an 8% price increase, Ethereum still struggles to break the $2,800 resistance level, remaining in a tight trading range for now.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-06-10 09:32:32

The stablecoin will be issued on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains, a Tuesday announcement noted. SG-Forge, the bank’s crypto subsidiary, already launched a MiCA-compliant EUR-backed stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), on the Stellar network. French banking giant @SocieteGenerale crypto subsidiary #SGFORGE launches its MiCA-compliant EUR-backed #stablecoin $EURCV on @StellarOrg . https://t.co/yw0PjFaoLw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 21, 2025 This time, the bank has announced the USD CoinVertible (USDCV), which would offer clients instant 24/7 conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoin. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY) would serve as the custodian for the assets backing the stablecoin, the announcement read. The bank has planned for the USDCV trading rollout to commence next month. “After the release of a MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoin (EURCV), the launch of a US Dollar version (USDCV) was the obvious next step for Societe Generale–FORGE as market adoption of stablecoins is growing exponentially,” said Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-Forge. Stenger noted that the stablecoin market is largely USD-denominated. The launch of these “institutional-grade stablecoin” would benefit institutions, corporates or retail investors, he added. USDCV, EURCV are MiCA-Compliant Stablecoins: SocGen The bank noted that both USDCV and EURCV are among the first stablecoins fully compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulation . According to a recent report from Bitvavo and Kaiko, MiCA-compliant stablecoins have begun to dominate Europe’s stablecoin market in 2024. Over 91% of the euro-based stablecoin market share in Europe was held by compliant tokens like EURCV. Both SocGen’s stablecoins are designed to support crypto trading and cross-border payments, on-chain settlement, forex transactions and collateral management. The stablecoins will be listed on various crypto exchanges, the bank said, adding that institutional, corporate and retail investors can access these through different crypto brokers and payment service providers. However, USDCV and EURCV are not available for US clients as they are not registered under the US Securities Act. Stablecoins Become Priority Among Banks The announcement arrives at a time when some major banks and fintechs have started different stablecoin initiatives. Analysts at Bernstein Research forecast that global stablecoin circulation could grow to nearly $2.8 trillion by 2028, driven by broader adoption. Early this year, Standard Chartered partnered with Animoca Brands, and HKT to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin . Additionally, Bank of America CEO said that the institution is open to launching a stablecoin tied to the U.S. dollar if legal frameworks allow it.

The breakout happens just a day after whales accumulation was noticed, as Hyperliquid continues to draw attention and new traders. Arthur Hayes, crypto influencer and the co-founder of BitMex, expects a rally above $40 with the unpredictability of price discovery. HYPE reached $39.18, adding over 10% for the past day, after a period of almost non-stop recovery since the lows of $12 in April. Traders are already putting higher targets on HYPE, due to the long period of preparation and accumulation. HYPE broke out as trading volumes increased over 137% in the past day, up to $1.7B. The HYPE rally liquidated $1.44M in short positions. HYPE rallied above $39, expecting an even bigger breakout on increased DEX activity and signs of whales accumulation. | Source: CoinGecko Currently, HYPE long and short positions are nearly equally balanced, with some drift toward more shorting, as HYPE may backtrack to a lower range in the short term. HYPE remains unpredictable as it shifts toward a new price range. Traders are split between an irrational rally similar to meme tokens, and an opportunity to short an over-valued asset. HYPE is still trading neutral, not showing signs of being overbought. The asset is not even among the hottest trending crypto, leading to predictions for a more gradual and extended rally.

The concentrated liquidity has brought out aggressive whales, who have engaged with token during previous rallies. A whale deposited $9.975M $USDC into #HyperLiquid and bought 259,367 $HYPE at a price of $38.46. Previously, the whale has made over $10M in $HYPE trades. https://t.co/iKAuQmwO0d pic.twitter.com/VkKsVWaQgg — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 10, 2025 Whales are also coming from external ecosystems, even using Solana’s Kamino Lend to borrow USDC and deposit it to Hyperliquid. HYPE was bought near its peak price in the past 24 hours, and some of the whales staked the tokens, easing the potential selling pressure. The current Hyperliquid activity may repeat the peak statistics of May, with record volumes and over $70M in generated fees. However, in the past weeks, liquidations slowed down as traders became more strategic. Hyperliquid remains one of the few exchanges to offer up to 40X leverage for BTC. Most of the open interest on Hyperliquid is still for BTC and ETH. However, trading other tokens is accelerating, including the native token. The DEX currently holds $558M in liquidity locked, expecting more significant expansion to compete with older DEXs and even centralized markets. Some of the engagement with HYPE may be organic, due to the ability to tap into the new BTC bullish trend. However, there are also rumors of an eventual second airdrop, which may drive additional activity and social media posting. An additional source of interest came from the trade moves of James Wynn with high-value positions which were publicly liquidated. Recently, Wynn stated he is back on Hyperliquid with an unknown account, continuing his strategy of longing BTC with high leverage. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Users can now access USDtb instantly — no applications, no waiting. USDtb is a next-generation stablecoin developed by Ethena, designed to maintain a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar. Rather than being backed by cash reserves, USDtb is collateralized by U.S. Treasury assets — yield-generating government securities. This structure enables USDtb to offer the best of both worlds: the stability of traditional finance combined with the speed and flexibility of crypto. For users, it provides access to a liquid and income-generating asset, all in one. With this update, users can now mint USDtb directly by depositing USDT, USDC, or USDe through Bybit. The process is fast, simple, and requires no intermediaries. When it’s time to redeem, USDtb can be instantly swapped back into those same stablecoins — no delays, no hidden steps. “Stablecoin yield is entering a new era,” said Emily Bao, Head of Spot at Bybit. “Bybit’s integration of direct USDtb minting removes longstanding barriers and empowers users with the autonomy and liquidity they expect from the future of on-chain finance.” Before this upgrade, getting USDtb was limited to spot trading or restricted access through Ethena. Now, with Bybit On-Chain Earn, anyone who completes Identity Verification Level 1 and deposits at least 5,000 USDT, USDC, or USDe can start minting USDtb right away — and automatically earn dynamic yields without staking or lock-ups. There are no gas fees, and the process takes just one transaction. USDtb minting is now live on Bybit On-Chain Earn .

Reports indicate a powerful coalition of major trade associations and prominent companies are joining forces to support a crucial piece of legislation: the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). Why is the BRCA Act Inclusion So Important? At the heart of this push is the desire for much-needed regulatory clarity, especially concerning which entities within the crypto ecosystem should be subject to stringent financial regulations, like those applied to money transmitter businesses. The current regulatory landscape in the U.S. is often described as fragmented and uncertain, creating challenges for innovation and growth. Many states and federal bodies have different interpretations of how existing laws apply to novel blockchain technologies. This ambiguity can stifle development and deter businesses from building and operating within the U.S. borders. The BRCA Act aims to address a specific part of this puzzle by drawing a clear line. Understanding the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA Act) The Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act is designed to provide a safe harbor for certain participants in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Specifically, it seeks to ensure that developers and service providers who do not take custody of customer funds are not treated as money transmitters under the law. Think of entities like: Software developers creating blockchain protocols or decentralized applications (dApps). Miners or validators who process transactions but do not hold user assets. Providers of non-custodial wallets where the user holds their own private keys. The core principle is simple: if you don’t hold customer money or crypto assets, you shouldn’t be regulated in the same way as a bank, exchange, or traditional money transfer service that does hold and transfer funds on behalf of others. This distinction is critical because applying money transmitter rules (like Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering requirements) to entities that merely provide software or infrastructure, without ever touching user funds, is often impractical, burdensome, and inappropriate. The CLARITY Act: A Vehicle for Crypto Policy Reform The support for the BRCA Act is specifically aimed at getting it included in an updated version of the CLARITY Act. While details on the exact form of this updated CLARITY Act are still emerging, its name suggests a broader legislative effort focused on bringing clarity to the regulatory environment for digital assets. Including the BRCA within a larger bill like the CLARITY Act could provide a legislative pathway to enact this specific, targeted reform regarding non-custodial services. This approach leverages existing legislative efforts to advance specific crypto-friendly provisions. It signals that the industry sees the CLARITY Act as a potential vehicle for meaningful crypto policy changes that can foster innovation while still addressing legitimate regulatory concerns. A Unified Front: Industry Support for BRCA The news, reported by Eleanor Terrett, highlights the significant unity within the U.S. crypto sector on this issue. A joint statement is anticipated from eight major U.S. crypto trade associations. This level of collaboration among diverse industry groups is powerful. It demonstrates a consensus view on the necessity of the BRCA’s principles. Beyond trade associations, specific companies like Uniswap and Jump are also reportedly backing the inclusion. Uniswap, a leading decentralized exchange protocol, is a prime example of a non-custodial service that would directly benefit from the clarity provided by the BRCA. Jump, a major trading firm active in the crypto space, also interacts with various protocols and services, making regulatory certainty important for their operations. This broad support across different facets of the industry – from DeFi protocols to trading firms and lobbying groups – underscores the widespread impact of current regulatory uncertainty and the shared belief that the BRCA Act offers a sensible solution for non-custodial activities. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Regulation and Innovation? The successful inclusion of the BRCA in the CLARITY Act could have several positive impacts: Boosting Innovation: By clearly exempting non-custodial developers and service providers from money transmitter rules, the BRCA would reduce legal risk and compliance burdens, encouraging the development of new protocols, dApps, and tools within the U.S. Attracting Talent and Investment: A clearer regulatory environment makes the U.S. a more attractive place for blockchain companies to build and operate, potentially bringing in talent and investment that might otherwise go to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Focusing Regulatory Resources: By clearly defining who is not a money transmitter, regulators can better focus their resources on entities that do handle customer funds and pose greater financial risks. Setting a Precedent: Enacting the BRCA could set a precedent for future crypto policy discussions, emphasizing a functional approach to regulation based on the actual risks and activities of different market participants. However, legislative processes are complex. Even with broad industry support, the inclusion and passage of the BRCA (or the broader CLARITY Act) are not guaranteed. There may be opposition from those who believe all crypto-related activities should be heavily regulated, or concerns about potential loopholes. The path through Congress involves multiple committees, debates, and votes. The Path Forward for Crypto Policy The joint statement supporting the BRCA’s inclusion in the CLARITY Act is a significant step in the ongoing dialogue about US crypto regulation . It highlights a key area where the industry believes targeted legislative reform is necessary and achievable. As this legislative effort progresses, stakeholders will be closely watching how Congress responds to this unified call for clarity regarding non-custodial services. This development underscores the increasing maturity of the crypto industry’s lobbying efforts and its commitment to working towards a predictable and innovation-friendly regulatory framework in the United States. The focus on the BRCA Act within the context of the CLARITY Act represents a strategic effort to achieve a specific, impactful policy change that could have far-reaching benefits for developers and users alike. Conclusion: A Step Towards Clearer Skies The expected joint statement from leading U.S. crypto trade associations and companies like Uniswap and Jump, signaling support for including the BRCA Act in the updated CLARITY Act, marks a pivotal moment. It represents a unified industry voice advocating for sensible crypto policy that distinguishes between custodial and non-custodial services. Achieving clarity on the money transmitter definition for non-custodial entities is seen as essential for fostering innovation and ensuring the U.S. remains competitive in the global blockchain landscape. While the legislative journey is ongoing, this concerted effort provides hope for a more predictable future for US crypto regulation .

Bitcoin’s price has experienced a clear upward trend over the past week, seeing a significant jump from below $104,000 to over $110,000. As of today, Bitcoin is trading at $109,318, showing a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours and a slight 0.1% rise over the past 7 days. Following this surge, an analyst on X suggests Bitcoin might be poised for a broader surge, even reaching new highs based on an inverted ascending scallop.Technical Patterns and Price TargetsThe chart analysis shared by crypto analyst SuperBro highlights the formation of an ""Inverted Ascending Scallop"" pattern on Bitcoin's weekly price chart. This pattern unfolds in multiple phases, beginning with a rise from $49,500 in August 2024 to a peak of $109,000 on January 20, 2025. From there, Bitcoin dipped to $74,400 in early April before making a comeback. This upward trend has brought the price back near the January peak, with the final phase projecting further increases.SuperBro highlights that if Bitcoin records a weekly close above $109,358, it will confirm the inverted ascending scallop pattern, which he has continued to watch since February 2025. Interestingly, the analyst provides two potential price targets for Bitcoin. The conservative target, based on a linear estimation, is set at $148,000. This target is derived from calculating 64% of the price difference between points A and B. In contrast, the more aggressive logarithmic target suggests that Bitcoin could reach as high as $244,000.When asked about the possibility of Bitcoin hitting $130,000 this week, the analyst stated that it is possible, as the market is likely on the cusp of a parabolic move.Bitcoin's Strong Buying PressureMeanwhile, data on Bitcoin holder inflows reveals strong buying pressure in both the short and long term. The 7-day change in inflows has increased by 168.70%, indicating heightened short-term demand. Bitcoin Large Holders Inflow Bitcoin Large Holders Inflow | IntoTheBlock More notably, the 30-day change has surged by 522.76%, suggesting that large holders have been accumulating Bitcoin over the past month. However, despite the strong inflow data, the 90-day change in inflows shows a massive decline of 95.04%. Bitcoin’s Potential for Long-Term GrowthOn the macro scale, Bitcoin's potential for future growth has drawn attention from prominent analysts. Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, remains confident that Bitcoin could reach an all-time high of $250,000 by the end of 2025.He attributes this optimistic outlook to Bitcoin's fixed supply—95% of its maximum supply has already been mined—combined with the growing imbalance between Bitcoin's demand and available supply. Lee speculates that more institutional and retail investors will enter the market, pushing Bitcoin’s price higher as demand continues to outpace its available supply.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 09:43:59

Stablecoins such as Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT have ruled the digital dollar space for years, their logos as ubiquitous on DeFi home pages as the dollar sign itself. But suddenly, in one move, the established order of finance had entered the blockchain warfront. SG-Forge, SocGen’s digital asset arm, wasn’t just dabbling. Their new token, USD CoinVertible (USDCV), would exist on both Ethereum and Solana—two of the world’s most important blockchains. But what made this launch truly different was the promise of full regulatory compliance. USDCV would be issued against a MiCA framework but would be issued with every token being fully backed by dollars that would lie in the custody of none other than the BNY Mellon, which is the world's largest custodian bank. Every day, the bank would publish the value as well as the composition of the reserves, offering even a level of transparency that most established crypto stablecoins have rarely matched. For Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-Forge, this wasn’t just about innovation—it was about trust. “This new currency will enable our clients, either institutions, corporates, or retail investors, to leverage the benefits of an institutional-grade stablecoin,” he said. In a world where regulators are tightening their grip on digital assets, that phrase — “institutional-grade” — carries weight. The timing couldn’t be more significant. Europe’s MiCA regulations have just come into force, making it much harder for unregulated stablecoins to operate. Tether’s USDT, for example, faces new restrictions in the EU, and even Circle’s USDC must adapt to stricter rules. Suddenly, a stablecoin issued by a major European bank, fully MiCA-compliant, looks like a lifeline for institutions and corporates who want to stay on the right side of the law. Crypto Twitter lit up with speculation: “SocGen just dropped a USD stablecoin on Ethereum & Solana. TradFi is coming for DeFi’s crown,” wrote @CryptoInsider. Others were quick to point out the significance of BNY Mellon’s involvement. “This is the regulated stablecoin the market’s been waiting for,” tweeted @DeFiWatchdog. But can USDCV really threaten the dominance of USDC and USDT? On the surface, the numbers are daunting. Tether and Circle’s coins are everywhere, with over $200 billion in combined circulation. Their liquidity, integrations, and global reach are unmatched. Yet, USDCV brings something new to the table: the trust and compliance that only a global bank can provide. For institutional investors — especially in Europe — this could be the deciding factor. Imagine a world in which a multinational pays a bill in seconds on Solana with USDCV, or a European pension fund invests in DeFi knowing that its stablecoin exposure is as safe as a bank deposit. The transparency of ordinary reserve postings, combined with regulatory clarity of MiCA, could free up billions of institutional capital previously stuck on the sidelines. Of course, USDCV isn’t for everyone — at least not yet. U.S. residents are excluded, and the initial focus is on institutions and corporates. But for those who need a stablecoin that regulators can’t frown upon, USDCV might be the only game in town. As the dust settles, one thing is clear: the stablecoin wars are entering a new phase. The arrival of SocGen’s USDCV is more than just another token launch—it’s a signal that the world’s largest financial institutions are ready to compete head-on with crypto’s biggest players. For the first time, the banks may have the upper hand.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-10 09:46:21

As the AI arms race continues to heat up from the Big Tech companies on down, and AI is fused into just about every industry there is, the inevitable panic is also beginning to set in: when AI “replaces” us—whether we be doctors, engineers, lawyers, teachers, financial analysts or writers—just how in the hell are we going to be able to make any money? You might also like: AI could destroy crypto within five years | Opinion Take a deep breath. Don’t panic. If you look just a little closer, this is the logical extension of what we saw with so much automation of the information age in the last few decades, if not the industrial age of the last few centuries. The original tech paranoiacs were the Luddites , the class of British workers who objected to the increased use of mechanized looms and knitting frames. These were artisans who had given their lifeblood, creatively and physically, to a craft, and they argued that those now operating these new machines were taking away their livelihoods. Sound familiar? These protests rose to the level of violence, including the destruction of factories where these machines were being operated. Whatever short-term catharsis this might have provided to the Luddites, it was not a very effective long-term strategy. The mechanized looms and their descendants won out in the marketplace of money and ideas. Present alternatives misvalue both man and machine The very human problem of existential crises in the face of machine-based integration is not just a tale as old as time, but one that inevitably keeps repeating in any era where man has come to rely on some type of technology. Amazon had its own version of the Luddites in the early 2000s when it introduced the first robots to automate its warehouse operations, with employees experiencing the same fears the Luddites did. Who knows, there were probably even protests against the wheel by those who had made their livelihood carrying items on their back, it just wasn’t documented. No one ever wins by moving backwards, only by figuring out how they adapt to the current tide that is always moving forward. In this most recent stage of AI development, it is just the latest, and perhaps the last stage, of a fully automated information age, effectively bringing an end to that information age and bringing on the next new thing, whatever that might be. It might seem strange and dangerous now, but all it requires is the kind of small-scale and large-scale adaptation we’ve always had to make. As the development of artificial intelligence exponentially proliferates, economies are contending with the fact that they’ve historically worked by being very labor-driven and the uncertainty that is created when the burden of labor shifts almost entirely away from humans to algorithms in the form of AI agents. Whether it’s physical labor, manual labor, intellectual labor, or creative labor, it has always been labor that has served as the locus of monetization. No one has yet proposed a workable solution for what will succeed this centering of labor. A popular alternative that is often proposed is Universal Basic Income, which negates labor in monetization entirely. However, this has never been practicable outside of very small pilots because it does not sufficiently take into account hierarchies and priorities driven by the innately human desire for incentivization. Enter the Intellect Economy When looking at the disruption caused by the technology revolutions of the past, we tend to focus on the technology itself, rather than how that technology was deployed and who was deploying it. The fears around these technologies are not really about the technologies themselves, but how those with economic power were able to exploit these technologies, and the creative labor they were mimicking, to create greater economic imbalance. As a means of protection against this outcome, we propose a different kind of UBI: Universal Baseline Intellect. Just as the mechanization of the industrial age took human patterns of physical creation and merely repeated them on assembly lines, the same is now taking place when it comes to the patterns of ideas-based creation. Intellect is being utilized, thus, it deserves to be monetized. We need to ensure that the proper value is being attributed to the input being put into these new systems, and not necessarily on the output, not just because it is the right and fair thing to do, but because it will create the full buy-in across industries at all levels to sustain this new economy. In building a new economy with new priorities, we have to ensure that individuals retain the right to the usage and monetization of their own intellectual property. Of all the avenues available to do this, decentralization has offered perhaps the easiest and best means of ensuring ownership belongs to the original possessor, with unmatched ability to monetize every type of intellectual “asset” in the digital space. We must prioritize an Intellect Economy where personal AI agents that learn from the human experience are also owned by that very human, and can create earning opportunities on an ongoing basis. We still have time to make the new AI economy a transformative shift that works for the many, rather than a dangerous disruption that enriches the few at the expense of those many. As we transition to a post-agentic, post-web world, shifting from attention-based to intention-driven systems, we need solutions that ensure humans remain at the center of intelligence. If we can do that, then the fears around AI will turn into hopes of liberating humanity from the chains of useless labor and toward a better and more enlightened form of intellectual value creation.

Benjamin Cowen, the founder of Into The Cryptoverse, identified this trend in an X post on June 10. He drew the data from Bitcoin’s historical tops in correlation with the 200-week simple moving average (SMA), emphasizing how it affects current prices.This follows Bitcoin’s close above $110,000 yesterday. The leading cryptocurrency by market cap rallied 4% on Monday to an intraday high of $110,617 before moving a bit lower.Bitcoin Cyclical Top’s Correlation With the 200W SMACowen noted that Bitcoin’s price action and the 200-week SMA have a pattern: the indicator has consistently predicted its cyclical top. For the uninitiated, the moving average calculates the average closing price of Bitcoin over the past 200 weeks.Historically, BTC usually reaches its top for the cycle when the weekly indicator crosses its all-time high from the previous cycle.An accompanying chart further confirms this correlation. For perspective, Bitcoin topped at $1,242 in November 2013 when the 200W SMA crossed its previous high. The same happened with the ATH of $19,804 in December 2017. Specifically, the 2017 cycle peak occurred when the 200W SMA reached $1,157, aligning with the $1,242 ATH from 2013. This pattern also played out with the $69,000 peak price in November 2021. Notably, when Bitcoin hit the November 2021 high of $69,000, the 200W SMA had climbed close to the previous cycle's peak. This marked the top for the 2021 bull run. Bitcoin Top Correlation With the 200W SMA | Benjamin Cowen More Upsides for Bitcoin?Meanwhile, according to the chart, the 200W moving average has yet to reach 2021’s ATH. In fact, the chart shows it has more ground to cover to get the extended line from the price high. For context, the 200W SMA stands at $48,353, a difference of $20,644 from the 2021's peak of $68,997.As a result, Cowen’s analysis suggests Bitcoin has more upside from here. While he did not mention a specific price target in the Tuesday analysis, he stressed it is “something to keep in mind.”Interestingly, other analyses align with this bullish outlook. Earlier, Klarch highlighted a similar cyclical recurrence in Bitcoin, suggesting further upside to $180,000 per coin. His optimism hinges on the idea that, according to the cyclical timeline, there is more time for further upside and continued capital influx into the crypto market.Furthermore, other bullish predictions, including a rally to $200,000 and $250,000 , remain in place. In the meantime, Bitcoin trades at $109,274, with its market cap surpassing $2.1 trillion.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 09:47:04

According to CNBC, the pan-European Stoxx 600 stayed flat. The FTSE 100 in London rose by 0.4%, while Germany’s DAX dropped 0.2%. The CAC 40 in France saw a small uptick. But despite those numbers, no one was taking real positions, especially not with the tension around trade hanging in the air. Pressure weighed hard on the defense sector, with the Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index down 0.8%, extending its losses for a third straight day due to rising uncertainty around rare earth mineral supplies. In April, China retaliated against U.S. tariffs by restricting the export of key minerals needed in defense tech, affecting Europe’s manufacturing and military industries. Gilts gain as UK labor market weakens Investors didn’t just have trade tension to stress over. UK government bonds — known as gilts — saw prices rise across the board after fresh labor market data was published Tuesday morning. The Office for National Statistics reported average wage growth of 5.3%, below the 5.5% forecast by Reuters. The miss on wages added to news that job vacancies had dropped 7.9% over the past three months ending in April, compared to the previous three-month period. The slowdown points to softening in the job market, fueling speculation that monetary tightening may ease. Following the release, 10-year gilt yields fell 7 basis points, while the 5-year lost 6. The 2-year gilt yield also slipped 7 basis points, and the 30-year dropped 6. As bond prices move up, yields go down — a clear signal that demand for gilts is growing amid market caution. Gold rises, metals fall, and Japan’s yen sinks after Ueda remarks In the commodities space, gold edged higher, trading at $3,333.89 an ounce by 08:18 GMT, after dropping earlier to $3,301.54. US gold futures were steady at $3,354.70. The precious metal is seeing steady buying ahead of this week’s U.S. inflation numbers, which could impact the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates. With investors avoiding risk ahead of potential macro shifts, safe-haven buying ticked upward. But not everything in the metals space was up. Silver dipped 0.6% to $36.51 per ounce, despite hovering at a 13-year high. Platinum fell 1.1% to $1,206.42 after reaching its highest point since May 2021, and palladium slipped 1% to $1,063.22. The action in metals mirrored the broader caution seen in equity and bond markets across Europe. Over in Japan, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda faced parliament and made it clear the central bank is nowhere near ready to hit its inflation goal. Ueda stated, “Our short-term policy rate is 0.5%. We can say in general that our room to stimulate the economy when it confronts strong downward pressures is very limited.” That line alone was enough to shake the yen, which dropped from 144.69 to as low as 145.29 against the dollar, before recovering slightly. Ueda downplayed the chance of a near-term rate cut, but hinted at potential economic support, which traders took as a signal that rate hikes won’t come soon. Japan’s inflation rate is the highest in the G7, yet it still maintains the lowest policy rate. Ueda’s position reflects a need to eventually lift rates, but not until the economic outlook clears up. Reports also surfaced suggesting Japan’s finance ministry might reduce issuance of super-long bonds, and even buy some back — another reason the yen lost steam. The Bank of Japan is expected to keep rates unchanged at its upcoming policy meeting next week, citing what it called “extremely high uncertainties” in the economic forecast. As investors juggle risks across currencies, bonds, commodities, and geopolitics, the pressure is mounting fast. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The financial world is always buzzing, and today, we’re kicking things off with a look at traditional finance. Specifically, the US stock markets have opened higher today. Now, you might be thinking, “Why should I care about stocks if I’m focused on crypto?” Great question! While crypto marches to its own beat in many ways, understanding broader stock market trends can offer valuable context for navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. Understanding the US Stock Markets Open At the start of trading today, major indices in the United States showed positive momentum. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: Index Change S&P500 +0.07% NASDAQ +0.08% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) +0.06% These are modest gains, certainly not earth-shattering moves, but they signal a positive start to the trading day in traditional finance. The S&P 500 is often seen as a benchmark for the overall health of large U.S. companies, the NASDAQ is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, and the Dow represents 30 large, publicly owned companies. Exploring Crypto Market Correlation So, how does a slightly higher open in the US stock markets potentially relate to the crypto world? This is where the concept of crypto market correlation comes into play. In recent years, especially as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained more mainstream attention and institutional investment, their price movements have sometimes shown a correlation with traditional risk assets, particularly tech stocks represented by the NASDAQ. Here’s the thinking: Risk-On Sentiment: When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, they often invest in assets perceived as having higher growth potential, such as technology stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. A positive open in stocks can sometimes reflect or contribute to this ‘risk-on’ sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: The same big economic news that moves stocks (like inflation data, interest rate decisions, employment numbers) also influences investor sentiment and capital flows globally, impacting crypto markets as well. Investor Overlap: As more traditional investors allocate a portion of their portfolios to crypto, their decisions might be influenced by their overall market outlook, which is heavily tied to stock market performance. It’s important to note that this correlation isn’t always perfect or consistent. Crypto markets have unique drivers like regulatory news, technological developments (protocol upgrades, new projects), and adoption rates that can cause them to diverge significantly from stock market trends. What’s the Potential Bitcoin Price Impact? Given the potential crypto market correlation , what could a positive open in the US stock markets mean for the Bitcoin price impact ? While a 0.06-0.08% rise in stocks is tiny by Bitcoin’s volatile standards, it contributes to the overall market sentiment picture. Think of it this way: A positive stock open adds a small green signal to the global financial dashboard. If this positive trend continues throughout the day and is driven by strong underlying economic signals, it could reinforce ‘risk-on’ behavior that might spill over into demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if stocks had opened sharply lower, it might signal broad risk aversion, potentially putting downward pressure on crypto prices. However, it’s crucial not to overstate the immediate Bitcoin price impact of such small stock movements. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market are known for their significant intraday volatility, often moving several percentage points in either direction based on crypto-specific news or market dynamics that have nothing to do with stocks. Analyzing Broader Stock Market Trends for Crypto Clues Beyond the daily open, keeping an eye on general stock market trends can provide valuable insights for crypto investors. Are tech stocks leading the way? Is the market reacting positively or negatively to inflation reports? These larger trends often reflect the prevailing market sentiment regarding economic growth, inflation, and the future path of monetary policy – all factors that have shown a clear influence on crypto markets over time. For instance: When central banks signal tighter monetary policy (raising interest rates, reducing stimulus), both stocks (especially growth stocks) and crypto have historically faced headwinds as investors become more cautious. When inflation appears to be cooling, it can sometimes lead to a rally in both asset classes as the pressure for aggressive rate hikes eases. Monitoring how traditional markets digest major economic news can offer a sneak peek into the macro environment that crypto also operates within. It’s like checking the weather report for the broader financial climate. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can you actually do with this information about US stock markets and their slight rise today? Here are a few actionable insights: Use it as a Sentiment Indicator: View the stock market’s open and daily trend as one data point among many for assessing overall market sentiment . A strong upward trend in stocks, particularly tech, might suggest a favorable environment for risk assets, including crypto. Observe Correlation (But Don’t Rely Solely On It): Pay attention to whether crypto is following stock movements on a given day or week. Is the crypto market correlation strong or weak? This can help you understand the current market dynamics, but always remember that crypto can decouple rapidly. Understand the Macro Drivers: Look into *why* stocks are moving. Is there specific economic news? This underlying reason is often more important than the movement itself, as those macro factors directly influence crypto as well. Manage Expectations: Don’t expect a 0.07% rise in the S&P 500 to cause Bitcoin to jump 5%. Stock market moves are typically much smaller in percentage terms than crypto moves. Use stock market data for context, not as a direct price predictor. The benefit here isn’t a guaranteed trading signal, but rather a more holistic understanding of the financial landscape. Challenges include the imperfect nature of the correlation and the need to filter out the noise – small daily stock moves are less significant than major trend shifts or reactions to big economic events. In Conclusion: A Piece of the Puzzle Today’s higher open in the US stock markets is a small positive signal from the traditional financial world. While the direct, immediate Bitcoin price impact of such minor moves is limited, monitoring broader stock market trends and understanding their potential crypto market correlation offers valuable context for crypto investors. It helps us gauge overall market sentiment and understand the macroeconomic forces at play. Remember, successful navigation of the crypto market involves looking at a wide range of indicators, from on-chain data and regulatory news to global economic signals, including those from traditional markets like stocks.

While the total crypto market cap slipped 2.2% over the past 24 hours to $3.4 trillion, ICP surged 8% to an intraday high of $5.66—bringing its total market capitalization above $3 billion and placing the token 32% higher than its year-to-date low. The rally follows the Dfinity Foundation’s high-profile unveiling of Caffeine at the World Computer Summit in Zurich on June 5. In a live demonstration, founder Dominic Williams showcased how the platform enables users to build blockchain applications in real time using simple natural language prompts, effectively removing the need for traditional programming skills. Built on the Internet Computer’s secure canister-based architecture, Caffeine aims to radically simplify Web3 development and make decentralized apps accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The platform has now entered alpha testing with waitlist registration open, and a public beta is expected to go live within the next month. As word spreads, investor sentiment has turned sharply bullish, with whale wallets—those holding between 1,000 and 1 million ICP—actively accumulating tokens, according to Santiment data. Historically, such large-scale accumulation has triggered FOMO among retail traders, often accelerating bullish momentum. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Prediction Source: TradingView Over the past week, Internet Computer (ICP) has experienced a significant price increase of 14.60%, trading between $5.01 and $5.90. This upward movement is supported by technical indicators, with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 62.11 and a Stochastic value of 73.67, suggesting strong buying momentum. The 10-day Simple Moving Average stands at $5.60, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $5.18, indicating a short-term bullish trend. Despite the recent gains, ICP's price change over the past month is a modest 3.48%, and it has declined by 52.04% in the last six months. This long-term downward trend highlights the volatility of the cryptocurrency. If the current momentum continues, ICP could test the nearest resistance level at $6.25, representing an increase of approximately 6% from its current price. Breaking this level might pave the way toward the second resistance at $7.14. On the other hand, if the price faces rejection at these resistance levels, it may find support at $4.47, which is about a 24% drop from the current price. The second support level lies at $3.58. Traders should watch these key levels closely to gauge ICP's next move, as breaking through resistance could signal further growth, while falling below support might indicate a continued downtrend. But while ICP’s AI-fueled breakout has captured headlines during a red week for crypto, another project is quietly gaining traction with even bolder upside projections: XYZVerse ($XYZ). Dubbed the meme coin for fighters and underdogs, $XYZ is riding a presale wave that’s already raised over $13 million, with its token climbing from $0.0001 to $0.003333 and projected to hit $0.1 upon listing—a 25,000% return from its earliest stages. XYZVerse ($XYZ) Price Prediction 2025-2030 XYZVerse is one of the latest meme coin contenders catching fire among investors. Merging the hype of meme coins with the passion of sports fandom, $XYZ is backed by bold branding, a real decentralized sportsbook, and an ambitious roadmap. With over $13 million raised in presale and a price increase from $0.0001 to $0.003333, interest in its future potential is mounting fast. How We Built This Forecast This price prediction blends meme coin trend analysis with market modeling, drawing parallels with early-stage giants like PEPE, DOGE, and FLOKI. We factored in tokenomics, presale traction, roadmap milestones, and expected market cycles across six years. XYZVerse Price Forecast (2025–2030) Year Potential Price Range Market Cap Estimate Key Catalysts 2025 $0.003 – $0.1 $30M – $100M Post-presale listing, bullish meme coin cycle, user growth 2026 $0.05 – $0.15 $50M – $150M Expansion of utility, NFT integration 2027 $0.25 – $0.3 $70M – $250M Meme coin mainstreaming, more utility added 2028 $0.3 – $0.45 $50M – $200M Market correction or crypto bear cycle, community retention tested 2029 $0.8 – $0.9 $80M – $300M Bullish sentiment, potential token burn or limited supply upgrades 2030 Above $1 $100M – $500M Global adoption, strong community, successful meme branding With a unique mix of meme appeal, sports culture, and real utility through its Web3 sportsbook, XYZVerse stands out in an increasingly crowded space. While high volatility remains a risk, early-stage investors could see 10x–50x returns by 2030 if the project executes on its roadmap and capitalizes on market momentum. For those hunting high-upside meme coins in the early innings, $XYZ may just be the next breakout story. Bottom Line ICP shows strength, but XYZVerse, the pioneering all-sport memecoin uniting fans, aims for 20,000% growth, attracting whales seeking significant potential from early adoption.

This growth was primarily driven by the introduction of Caffeine, a new AI-powered platform announced by the Dfinity Foundation at the World Computer Summit in Zurich on June 5. Caffeine, designed to facilitate blockchain application development through simple natural language prompts, marks a significant step forward in making blockchain technology more accessible. While the entire crypto market saw a decline, ICP's value notably increased by 8% to $5.66, signaling a recovering interest despite the overall downward trend. This growth phases into a broader appeal as large investors, or 'whales', begin to show increased activity around ICP, particularly after the announcement of the Caffeine platform. ICP's Market Performance and Future Prospects Source: TradingView With a current trading range between $5.01 and $5.90, ICP shows a relatively strong position in the market, supported by a series of bullish indicators. A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 62.11 and a Stochastic value of 73.67 suggest a robust buying momentum. However, potential resistances at $6.25 and $7.14 could challenge its upward trajectory. Conversely, support levels at $4.47 and $3.58 will be critical should the token experience a reversal. Simultaneously, the cryptocurrency space is also buzzing about XYZVerse ($XYZ), a new entrant described as a meme coin with substantial growth potential. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse intersects the realms of sport and decentralized finance, boasting a staggering forecasted growth of 25,000%. This projection is based on its impressive presale, where it managed to elevate its price from $0.0001 to $0.003333. XYZVerse: The Next Big Meme Coin? XYZVerse positions itself uniquely in the crypto market by integrating a sportsbook platform, leveraging the global sports fandom and the meme coin trend. The enthusiastic market reaction to its presale, gathering over $13 million, hints at its potential trajectory in the coming years. Year Potential Price Range Market Cap Estimate Key Catalysts 2025 $0.003 – $0.1 $30M – $100M Post-presale listing, bullish meme coin cycle, user growth 2026 $0.05 – $0.15 $50M – $150M Expansion of utility, NFT integration 2027 $0.25 – $0.3 $70M – $250M Meme coin mainstreaming, more utility added 2028 $0.3 – $0.45 $50M – $200M Market correction or crypto bear cycle, community retention tested 2029 $0.8 – $0.9 $80M – $300M Bullish sentiment, potential token burn or limited supply upgrades 2030 Above $1 $100M – $500M Global adoption, strong community, successful meme branding Both ICP and XYZVerse showcase the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where innovation and community support play pivotal roles in shaping a token's success.

Trading for USDCV is scheduled to start in early July 2025. According to a recent press release , SG-FORGE, the integrated subsidiary of Societe Generale Group dedicated to crypto, is preparing to issue its upcoming USD-backed stablecoin on Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ). Trading for the stablecoin is projected to start sometime in early July 2025. The USD CoinVertible will be the second stablecoin issued by SG-FORGE. Its release comes a few months after the firm deployed its first euro-backed stablecoin on Stellar ( XLM ), the EUR CoinVertible. With the addition of its latest USD-backed stablecoin, clients will be able to convert fiat currencies into stablecoins, enabling immediate transactions in both USD and EUR. Much like its euro-based counterpart, the USD CoinVertible’s collateral composition and real world-asset backing will be shown publicly on the SG-FORGE website and updated on a daily basis. Based on the press release, the U.K.-based Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has been tapped to be the token’s reserve custodian . Even though the token is backed by USD, the crypto arm of Societe-Generale informed clients that the stablecoin is not available to trade in the United States . This is because the token has not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended the “Securities Act.” You might also like: South Korean Democrats want to accelerate KRW stablecoin rollout As a result, the USDCV may not be offered, sold, pledged or transferred to customers based in the United States at any time except in an “offshore transaction.” Not unless it has obtained the all-clear from U.S. financial authorities. On the other hand, EU customers will be able to freely trade USD CoinVertible as it is deemed fully-compliant with Europe’s Markets in Crypto-assets or MiCA regulations. SG-FORGE is also licensed as a stablecoin issuer under the Electronic Money Institution by the French ACPR. Chief Executive Officer of Societe Generale-FORGE, Jean-Marc Stenger, said that issuing a USD-backed stablecoin was an obvious next step for the company as global stablecoin adoption continues to show significant growth. “The stablecoin market remains largely U.S. dollar denominated. This new currency will enable our clients, either institutions, corporates or retail investors, to leverage the benefits of an institutional-grade stablecoin,” said Stenger in his statement. Last February, Societe Generale-FORGE issued the company’s first stablecoin, the euro-backed EUR CoinVertible on the Stellar blockchain. Earlier in November 2024, the firm also announced plans to launch a stablecoin on the XRP ( XRP ) ledger.

As investor attention zeroes in on these developments, analysts caution that traditional HODLers could be blindsided unless they broaden their focus. While XRP ETF approval hype intensifies and HODLers hold steady, smart money is strategically reallocating capital, liquidating portions of XRP to seize a low-cap, high-upside asset currently in presale. These smart money insiders believe the presale could deliver explosive 200x gains in the coming weeks. The XRP ETF Surge: Sentiment Soars, But Is There Room To Run? According to a latest post on X, the Polymarket probability metric now places a staggering 98% confidence in the approval of a Ripple-backed XRP ETF by 2025. The optimism sparked by this XRP ETF development has contributed to a recent 27% spike in the XRP price. With HODLers energized and sentiment shifting, many believe the XRP ETF approval rating represents a shadow of what broader regulatory acceptance of crypto could feel like. Yet, even as XRP ETF gains confidence, smart money is already diversifying into emerging assets like FloppyPepe (FPPE) , targeting the next 100x narrative before the mainstream catches on. Where The Smart Money Moves: From Legacy Coins To Microcaps Despite the XRP ETF hype, discerning capital isn’t resting on XRP alone. While traditional HODLers remain fixated on legacy tokens, smart money buyers are aggressively targeting microcap assets with explosive asymmetric upside potential, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) has emerged as a standout favorite for them. Analysts are now sounding a clear warning to legacy coin HODLers to diversify their portfolio or risk missing out on the next wave of outsized gains. Currently in presale at just $0.00000035 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers an 80% FLOPPY80 bonus, presenting a well-structured play engineered for parabolic returns. For HODLers who have long held larger cap tokens and seen steady but limited growth, this presale is a unique opportunity to get in early on a project with a 200x ROI potential. To stay ahead and truly capitalize on the opportunistic crypto market, diversifying into low-cap tokens like this not only hedges against potential losses but defines the next set of portfolio winners. More Reasons Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is Drawing Smart Money Attention FloppyPepe (FPPE) boasts a robust ecosystem with smart contracts verified by SolidProof and tokenomics featuring zero tax, a deflationary burn model, staking rewards, and holder redistribution. Its AI-driven tools include FloppyX for real-time video generation and Meme-o-Matic for dynamic meme creation. These integrated AI utilities with a completed SolidProof audit verifying the platform’s authenticity position this project to capitalize on the projected $66 billion AI token market. Meanwhile, exchange listings on Uniswap, CoinMarketCap, and Tier 1 CEXs are already in motion. Campaigns, giveaways, referral rewards, and airdrop incentives are being built out to support international engagement. Meanwhile, strategic partnerships with key opinion leaders, influencers, and established meme coins are rapidly expanding the ecosystem, exactly the kind of roadmap that radicalizes smart money. HODLers Hesitate, Smart Money Moves: FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Is Set For 200x Gains With XRP ETF approval confidence at 98% dominating headlines, this signals that its potential is largely priced in, leading to diminishing marginal returns for HODLers. History shows that those who arrive after the crowd often miss the biggest gains. This is why smart money is moving beyond it, targeting microcap token ecosystems like FloppyPepe (FPPE), where explosive upside is multiplied and deliberately engineered. In addition to its compelling low-cap potential, the FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale generous 80% FLOPPY80 bonus is also drawing strong interest from smart money investors. Priced at just $0.00000035 and powered by advanced AI integration, investors see the project positioned at a powerful crossroads of AI and crypto. This unique combination sets the stage for rapid adoption and explosive growth potential in the AI meme coin market. With its perfectly timed presale, FloppyPepe (FPPE) remains an early opportunity with ample room to thrive, especially as events like the XRP ETF inject massive capital and positive sentiment into the crypto markets. HODLers who overlook this moment risk missing out on life-changing potential gains.

On June 9, Plasma announced on X that its public token sale for XPL sold out in just 40 minutes. The team initially planned to raise $50 million but had to revise it twice, first to $250 million, then to $500 million, after overwhelming interest from buyers. In total, more than 1,100 wallets participated in the token sale, with a median deposit of approximately $35,000 per wallet. The XPL token sale accounted for 10% of Plasma’s total token supply, implying a fully diluted valuation of $500 million, consistent with the valuation from its earlier equity round, which was backed by Founders Fund. Participants in the sale were required to deposit stablecoins into a vault hosted on Ethereum, with support for USDT, USDC, USDS, and DAI. Unlike traditional first-come-first-served token launches, Plasma implemented a time-weighted deposit model that rewarded early and longer-held deposits with a greater allocation of tokens. All deposits were processed through smart contracts audited by Veda, a well-regarded blockchain infrastructure firm. At the time of the sale, Veda’s audited contracts managed over $2.6 billion in total value locked, lending credibility and security assurances to the process.

Plasma is a blockchain designed to enable fast, scalable, and low-fee stablecoin transactions. It is a Bitcoin sidechain that is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows it to support a wide range of decentralized finance applications while benefiting from Bitcoin’s robust security layer. The XPL token will function as the native cryptocurrency of Plasma’s planned blockchain. By optimizing for stablecoin transactions and enabling zero-fee USDT transfers, Plasma wants to position itself as a high-performance settlement layer for payments, remittances, and DeFi services. Plasma has steadily drawn the attention of top-tier investors since late 2024, including Founders Fund, Framework Ventures, and Bitfinex . The project kicked off with a $3.5 million seed round in October 2024, followed by a $20 million Series A in February 2025, led by Framework and joined by Nomura, Bybit, and 6th Man Ventures. Plasma’s token sale comes at a time when major jurisdictions across the globe are advancing stablecoin regulation. For instance, regulators in the United States recently moved forward with the GENIUS Act , a bipartisan proposal that would establish a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Meanwhile, last year, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets framework (MICA) came into force, with stablecoin provisions taking effect in June 2024 and full implementation coming into effect by the end of December.

The blockchain refers to a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records digital data. Quintenz possesses strong crypto policy experience, having previously worked as global head of policy at a16z Crypto, the cryptocurrency arm of Andreessen Horowitz. Clear Crypto Rules Required to Safeguard U.S. Leadership Quintenz asserted that the U.S. must move quickly to implement clear and thoroughgoing crypto rules. “Weak regulation opens the door to fraud and jeopardizes our leadership in blockchain innovation,” he cautioned . He called on Congress to create legal certainty regarding token classifications and define appropriate oversight functions for the purpose of user protection and regulatory certainty. “I am more than ready to offer the value of this experience to members of this committee and to Congress generally,” he said. Promises to Support Innovation and Resolute Oversight Quintenz reiterated his commitment to maintaining the innovation-friendly nature of the CFTC, which draws from the Commodity Exchange Act’s (CEA) underlying principles-based model of regulation. He underscored the need for rulemaking on international harmonization and risk-based rules and said that the CFTC is “a global standard-bearer in market innovation.” During his previous tenure as a CFTC Commissioner, Quintenz was unanimously confirmed in 2017 and was praised for his balanced approach to new technologies. Senate Hearing Against Leadership Vacancies at CFTC His hearing, set for 3:00 PM on June 10, is timely. The Senate is considering the Clarity Act, a bill that would grant the CFTC greater authority over digital assets by defining a “digital commodity” category. But the agency is having internal issues. Two of the commissioners—Summer Mersinger and Goldsmith Romero—resigned last week. The lone remaining Republican commissioner, Caroline Pham, has said she will resign if Quintenz is confirmed. This lack of leadership has made Quintenz’s confirmation along with the future of U.S. crypto regulation even riskier.",Blockchain|Regulation|US,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-10 09:56:32

Industry Pros Suggest XYZVerse (XYZ) Over Dogecoin (DOGE) for Beginners,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/under-1-crypto-investments-industry-pros-suggest-xyzverse-xyz-over-dogecoin-doge-for-beginners,"Beginning crypto investors seeking coins under a dollar have fresh options to consider. Though Dogecoin remains a staple, experts are now spotlighting XYZVerse (XYZ) as a promising alternative. This introduction explores why professionals recommend XYZVerse for beginners and examines its potential advantages over more established choices. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $13 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin has experienced a downward trend in recent times. Over the past week, its price decreased by 7.05%. In the last month, it fell by 11.81%. Looking back six months, the price has dropped by 54.18%. Currently, Dogecoin is trading between $0.17 and $0.20. Indicators show mixed signals about where the price might go next. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 40.60, which is below the neutral mark, suggesting some selling pressure. The Stochastic value is 10.00, indicating the coin is in oversold territory and might soon see a price bounce. The nearest resistance level for Dogecoin is at $0.22. If it climbs past this point, the next target is $0.25. These levels represent potential gains of about 10% to 25% from the current price range. On the downside, the closest support is at $0.15. Falling below this could see the price heading toward the second support at $0.1166, which would be a decrease of around 30% from current levels. Conclusion Though other coins have merit, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends meme culture with sports, aiming for massive growth and offering early adopters a chance to join a community-driven movement.

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Inflows Skyrocket BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new record by becoming the fastest ETF ever to surpass $70 billion in assets under management, reaching this milestone in just 341 trading days since its launch. Calling out this development, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas pointed out , “ IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days.” Consider this, the previous record-holder, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), needed 1,691 days to hit $70 billion. IBIT achieved the same feat about five times faster, illustrating a high adoption rate. BlackRock’s IBIT now holds over 660,000 BTC—outpacing MicroStrategy’s 582,000 and inching closer to Satoshi Nakamoto’s legendary 1.12 million. This milestone aligns with growing institutional interest, as crypto ETFs saw a $224 million inflow last week, driven by strong IBIT performance. With a 2023 NBER study suggesting that institutional buying could stabilize crypto markets in the long term, ETFs will continue to be a game-changer in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, a supply shock looms in the BTC network with exchange balances recently hitting a 7-year low, hinting at a growing hodling trend. Therefore, heigthened ETF inflows, robust institutional interest, and the possibility of a supply shock continue to paint a bullish Bitcoin picture. Bitcoin Enthusiasts Keep Fingers Crossed about the U.S.–China Trade Talks The ongoing U.S.–China trade talks are injecting a fresh dose of optimism into global markets, with Bitcoin among the major beneficiaries. Market analysts point to easing trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies as a key driver behind Bitcoin’s recent surge, which saw the flagship cryptocurrency rebound to the psychological price of $110,000. This has spurred positive sentiment among investors seeking refuge in alternative assets like Bitcoin, which historically performs well amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Experts say the renewed optimism stems from expectations that a thaw in trade tensions could stabilize global supply chains, reduce inflationary pressures, and bolster risk-on assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. “When trade tensions ease, investors tend to rotate capital into higher-risk, higher-reward assets,” explains Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. “Bitcoin stands to benefit from that tailwind.” On the macroeconomic front, traders are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s signals. While the Fed has kept interest rates steady at 4.25% since April, the market is now pricing in a potential rate cut by September, adding to the bullish sentiment for risk assets like Bitcoin. With U.S.–China trade negotiations progressing, supply chain issues easing, Bitcoin enthusiasts are betting on a sustained rally. Conclusion With Bitcoin being a stone’s throw away from reclaiming its historical price of $111,814 bullish sentiments continue to rock its ecosystem. For instance, BlackRock is leading the pack in terms of soaring Bitcoin ETF inflows, illustrating heightened institutional adoption. With the world’s largest cryptocurrency expected to be a major beneficiary of the trade talks between China and the U.S., it might be a matter of time before BTC sets a new price record, which might ignite a crypto market rally.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-10 09:59:05

Crypto crime is evolving, increasingly targeting human psychology as an attack vector. According to the report, published on Tuesday, June 10, social engineering scams are becoming more common, and many now leverage AI to increase their success rate. “In 2024, nearly 40% of high-value frauds involved deepfake technology. And behind most scams—whether Trojan job offers or Ponzi-like “staking platforms”—is some form of social engineering designed to exploit trust, fear, or greed,” Bitget report.

AI videos are also being used to bypass KYC systems and even lure victims into live phishing Zoom calls. Other types of social engineering scams are surfacing in the job market. Scammers often pose as recruiters seeking developers, directing job seekers to download what appears to be a task project. In reality, the file contains a Trojan virus capable of taking over the victim’s computer. You might also like: Deepfake frauds in crypto spiked by 245% globally, Bitget says How to protect yourself from AI crypto scams Blockchain security firm SlowMist outlines several steps users can take to avoid falling victim to scams. First, users should be highly skeptical of promotional content on social media. Posts offering jobs, ChatGPT trading bots, or high staking returns should be approached with caution. Social engineering scams often create a false sense of urgency. Traders should always pause to consider whether an offer seems too good to be true. The same goes for videos of public figures promoting crypto launches—users should verify through official websites or trusted news sources. “Bottom line? In an age where AI can mimic anyone, security must start with skepticism—and end with collective defense,” Bitget report. SlowMist also warns against clicking on links or downloading files shared in group chats or social media comments. Tools like ScamSniffer can help by automatically blocking phishing links. For suspected rug pulls, users can check MistTrack to see whether a wallet address is tied to known scams.

With its presale price holding steady at just $0.03 per token in Phase 5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention from smart investors who recognize the explosive upside potential tied to its platform roadmap, advanced features, and rapidly growing community. With over $10.20 million already raised and more than 11,700 holders onboard, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that interest in the platform isn’t theoretical—it’s actively growing. And the math doesn’t lie: a $1,000 investment at the current $0.03 price point equates to 33,333 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.60, that same $1,000 holding becomes $20,000. That’s a clean 20x return—based entirely on actual price movement and without relying on speculation. An Ecosystem Engineered for Growth At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that enables users to operate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Unlike conventional platforms that force users into one-dimensional interactions, Mutuum will offer two powerful options: P2C (pool-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending. The P2P model will offer a unique edge by enabling users to lend and borrow non-mainstream tokens that most platforms ignore, including volatile assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This will unlock a deeper layer of opportunity for those who want more than just blue-chip DeFi interaction. Borrowers on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be able to access capital without selling their holdings, using their assets as collateral to unlock liquidity. This will create strategic advantages, especially for users aiming to retain exposure to potential asset growth. Simultaneously, lenders will benefit from dynamically adjusting interest rates that scale with market demand—ensuring that the platform remains competitive and liquid. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will have a sustainable, scalable system for passive income. Depositors will receive mtTokens, a tokenized representation of their position in the liquidity pool. These mtTokens will accrue interest automatically over time, reflecting a user’s growing share in the pool. Beyond this, Mutuum will distribute passive dividends by using protocol revenue to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be sent to users who stake mtTokens in a special safety module, offering another layer of rewards. The longer you participate and stake, the greater your share of the buyback-driven MUTM rewards. Built for Speed, Security, and Scale One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s most technically compelling features will be its Layer-2 integration, which will enhance performance while slashing gas fees. This design will ensure smoother user experience, faster transactions, and minimal friction—solving two of the biggest pain points in today’s DeFi space: congestion and cost. Security will not be an afterthought either. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has undergone an external audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain security firms. With a Token Scan Score of 80, the protocol has been verified through both manual review and advanced static analysis. For users, this means confidence in the safety of smart contracts and protection against common DeFi vulnerabilities. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) roadmap is already in motion, with Phase 1 milestones such as presale launch, community growth campaigns, the $100,000 giveaway, AI helpdesk and smart contract audit already executed. For the Phase 2, the team is actively developing the DApp front-end, backend infrastructure, and advanced features like dynamic interest modeling and real-time analytics. Phase 3 will bring the demo version of the platform to testnet, along with full development finalization and multiple external audits. By the time the token goes live, users will already be able to test and engage with a beta version of the platform—making Mutuum one of the few projects to deliver a working product at launch. Finally, Phase 4 will include live platform deployment, exchange listings for the MUTM token, a bug bounty program, regional compliance integration, and institutional partnerships—positioning the protocol for mainstream adoption and long-term growth. Stablecoin Utility, Strengthened by Design Mutuum’s future will also include the release of a decentralized, fully overcollateralized stablecoin minted directly from on-chain assets. This stablecoin will add significant depth and utility to the platform, offering users a reliable, transparent borrowing option backed by robust collateral and algorithmic supply controls. As users borrow and repay using the stablecoin, a portion of interest payments will cycle back into the ecosystem through protocol-controlled buybacks of MUTM. These buybacks will be distributed to users who stake mtTokens, creating a passive income opportunity for liquidity providers. This feedback loop—combining lending activity, stablecoin adoption, and revenue redistribution—will enhance treasury resilience and support long-term value for the protocol. With each cycle of usage, Mutuum’s economic foundation and utility for MUTM will grow stronger. MUTM is more than a speculative token—it plays a key role in the value distribution within the Mutuum ecosystem. While it won’t offer fee discounts at launch but there is an ongoing $100K giveaway , it becomes increasingly valuable through the platform’s revenue-sharing mechanism. As users borrow and repay loans, a portion of interest revenue is used to buy back MUTM from the market and redistribute it to users who stake mtTokens—the interest-bearing tokens received when assets are deposited into the protocol. This system creates a recurring buyback-and-distribute cycle that rewards long-term liquidity providers and ties token utility directly to platform activity. With a supply of 4 billion tokens and an early presale price of $0.03, many early adopters view this as a rare opportunity to gain exposure to a token designed to benefit from real DeFi usage, not just market speculation. As the team continues to hit milestones, release beta versions, and expand to new chains, early investors won’t be waiting for utility—it will already be live. For those seeking a serious DeFi project with real rewards and visible momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be where the math—and the market—align.

A significant leap forward in this transformation is the recent Chainlink CBDC pilot , successfully demonstrating seamless digital currency exchange between different systems. This groundbreaking initiative, involving major players like Visa and Fidelity, highlights the increasing maturity of blockchain technology in enabling sophisticated financial operations. What Did the Chainlink CBDC Pilot Achieve? Chainlink recently announced the successful completion of a pilot program focused on cross-border digital currency exchange. This specific pilot facilitated the exchange between a Hong Kong Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and an Australian stablecoin. The primary goal was to test the feasibility and efficiency of using distributed ledger technology (DLT) for such complex cross-border transactions. Key participants included global financial giants like Visa and Fidelity, alongside asset manager ChinaAMC, indicating strong institutional interest in the potential of blockchain for traditional finance use cases. This Chainlink CBDC pilot is a crucial step towards understanding how different forms of digital money can interact securely and efficiently across borders. Why is CBDC-Stablecoin Exchange Significant? The ability to exchange a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) for a stablecoin represents a vital bridge between sovereign-backed digital money and privately issued digital assets. A CBDC stablecoin connection could unlock new possibilities for instant settlement, reduced counterparty risk, and increased liquidity across various digital markets. This pilot specifically explored how Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) could facilitate atomic swaps or similar mechanisms, ensuring that the exchange happens simultaneously across different ledgers, thereby minimizing settlement risk. This capability is particularly relevant for future models of digital currency exchange in a multi-chain or multi-ledger world where various forms of digital value need to interact seamlessly. How Does This Impact Digital Currency Exchange? This pilot provides a tangible, real-world example of how sophisticated digital currency exchange could function on a global scale. It moves beyond theoretical discussions to practical implementation, demonstrating that different digital ledger systems can communicate and transact securely. For the future of digital currency exchange, this suggests a potential path towards greater interoperability and efficiency, significantly reducing reliance on traditional, often slower, correspondent banking networks for cross-border movements of value. The success of this pilot underscores the potential for a more integrated and efficient global digital financial infrastructure. Exploring the Role of Blockchain Finance Blockchain finance , particularly the use of robust and secure protocols like Chainlink, is proving essential in building the foundational infrastructure for future digital economies. Chainlink’s CCIP, which was utilized in this pilot, acts as a secure and reliable bridge between different blockchain networks or even between traditional systems and blockchains. In the context of this pilot, CCIP likely enabled the secure transfer of information and value between the ledger hosting the Hong Kong CBDC and the ledger hosting the Australian stablecoin. This demonstrates how blockchain finance can provide the necessary interoperability layer for a potentially fragmented digital asset landscape, ensuring secure and reliable cross-chain communication. Addressing Challenges in Cross-Border Payments One of the long-standing challenges in traditional finance is the complexity, cost, and speed of cross-border payments. This Chainlink CBDC pilot directly addresses these issues by proposing a faster, potentially cheaper, and more transparent method for exchanging value across borders using digital currencies. By enabling direct CBDC-to-stablecoin exchange, it bypasses multiple intermediaries typically involved in international transfers, streamlining the process and reducing settlement times from days to potentially minutes or seconds. This advancement in cross-border payments highlights the transformative potential of distributed ledger technology and blockchain finance. Key Benefits Demonstrated by the Pilot: Increased Speed and Efficiency: Transactions can potentially settle much faster than traditional cross-border transfers. Reduced Costs: Fewer intermediaries mean lower transaction fees. Enhanced Transparency: Transactions recorded on distributed ledgers offer greater visibility. Improved Interoperability: Demonstrates the ability to connect different digital currency systems (CBDC and stablecoin). Lower Counterparty Risk: Mechanisms like atomic swaps reduce the risk of one party failing to fulfill their side of the exchange. Potential Challenges Ahead: Regulatory Hurdles: Harmonizing regulations across different jurisdictions is complex. Security and Scalability: Ensuring the infrastructure is secure and can handle high transaction volumes. Adoption: Gaining widespread acceptance from institutions and users. Privacy Concerns: Balancing transparency with user privacy. Actionable Insights from the Pilot: This pilot signals that major financial institutions and central banks are actively exploring and testing blockchain solutions for core financial functions. It suggests increasing institutional demand for reliable, interoperable digital asset infrastructure. For market participants, this underscores the importance of protocols like Chainlink that facilitate secure cross-chain communication and real-world data integration, which are critical for the future of digital finance. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Connected Digital Future The successful Chainlink CBDC pilot marks a significant milestone in the evolution of digital finance. By demonstrating the seamless exchange between a CBDC and a stablecoin across borders, it showcases the potential for greater efficiency, speed, and interoperability in future digital currency exchange and cross-border payments .

Cardone Takes Aim at XRP In a tweet , Cardone said XRP “will take any path it needs to survive,” even if that includes working with “oppressive people.” He took particular aim at ECB President Christine Lagarde, referring to her as “Ms. Cringe,” and accusing her of wanting to turn Europe into a “prison continent.” Cardone went further, likening XRP’s influence in finance to a new virus, calling it “COVID-19 Part Two in finance.” He warned that continued support for the token amounts to voting for “European warmongers,” framing XRP’s ambitions as a threat to freedom rather than a step forward in financial innovation. XRP will take any path they need to survive including coordinating with the most oppressive people on planet Earth, one of them pictured below, Ms Cringe, who will do whatever is needed to turn Europe into a Prison Continent, so there is martial law everywhere and they can scam… https://t.co/ZfXFhWQoiD — Gary Cardone (@GaryCardone) June 9, 2025 The comments drew immediate backlash from the XRP community, which labeled the remarks as inflammatory and unfounded. Robert Doyle, known online as Crypto Sensei, countered Cardone’s statements by noting that “there is no official confirmation” that Ripple technology will be used for the digital euro. He emphasized that, while the ECB is exploring CBDCs, no final decision has been made regarding the technology stack. Ripple has actively engaged with several central banks in recent years, including those in Palau and Georgia , for CBDC pilot projects. However, critics argue that such partnerships contradict crypto’s original ethos of decentralization and resistance to surveillance-driven financial systems. Still, Ripple supporters point out that mainstream adoption is a necessary step for real-world impact. “If we want crypto to scale, we need to work with institutions, not fight them,” one user commented. Cardone’s Comments Draw Sharp Criticism Cardone’s comments also drew a sharp rebuke from YouTuber Moon Lambo, who accused him of spreading misinformation. “Either Gary is gullible and fell for fake news or he’s spreading it intentionally,” he said, referencing the lack of any official ECB statement on Ripple’s involvement. Moon Lambo further accused Cardone of suffering from “XRP Derangement Syndrome,” arguing that he is pushing a narrative that suits his worldview, rather than sticking to verified facts. Attorney Bill Morgan also chimed in, calling it ironic that Cardone would suggest “a public, permissionless network like the XRP Ledger” could be aiding oppressive regimes. He questioned how such a decentralized system could be accused of aligning with authoritarian agendas. How does a native token on a public permissionless blockchain coordinate with the most oppressive people on earth to survive. Did it gain sentience. https://t.co/Nh4gecifh7 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 10, 2025 At present, the ECB has stated that a digital euro could be launched if approved by the European Parliament, but has not selected a specific platform or partner.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/traditional-finance-warms-up-to-crypto-french-banking-giant-prepares-to-launch-stablecoin-here-are-the-details/,"SG Forge, the cryptocurrency subsidiary of French banking giant Société Générale, is preparing to launch a new US dollar-backed stablecoin, USD CoinVertible (USDCV), on the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. The new stablecoin is expected to begin trading in early July. SocGen's Crypto Arm Makes Dollar-Backed Stablecoin Move: USD CoinVertible Is Coming According to the statement made by SG Forge, the reserve custody service of the USDCV token will be undertaken by Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), one of the heavyweights of the traditional finance world. This move is considered an important step towards the integration of traditional finance (TradFi) and digital finance (DeFi). SG Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger emphasized that interest in the stablecoin market is rapidly increasing and made the following statement: “Following the euro-backed stablecoin EURCV, which was developed in accordance with MiCA regulations, the launch of a dollar version was a natural next step for Société Générale–FORGE.” MiCA, which Stenger was referring to, is the European Union’s new regulatory framework for cryptocurrency markets. SG Forge was the first bank to issue a regulated stablecoin in Europe with EURCV. The new stablecoin USDCV will compete with existing market giants like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. The stablecoin market is currently largely denominated in dollars. USDT has a market cap of around $155 billion, while USDC has a market cap of around $60 billion. SG Forge stated that both USD CoinVertible and EUR CoinVertible stablecoins can be used in many areas such as crypto trading, cross-border payments, blockchain settlement transactions, foreign exchange transactions, collateral and cash management for institutional investors, companies and individual investors. However, the company specifically emphasized that both USD CoinVertible and EUR CoinVertible stablecoins are not available to US citizens. This development suggests that major European banks are becoming more deeply integrated into the crypto ecosystem, reinforcing the trend towards developing regulatory-compliant digital asset solutions. *This is not investment advice.

In a recent post, Cardone warned that XRP would do whatever it takes to survive — even if it means aligning with what he called “the most oppressive people on planet Earth.” He singled out European officials, accusing them of working to turn Europe into a surveillance-heavy, police-state-like continent. Cardone went so far as to compare XRP to COVID-19 part two in finance , implying it could become a tool for financial control and oppression. This strong reaction came after a viral claim suggesting that the so-called “European surveillance coin” would run on the XRP Ledger.

At the time, his decision shocked many in the XRP community, which is known for its loyal following. Cardone listed six personal principles behind his move, including concerns over XRP’s supply and demand transparency, the difficulty in explaining its mechanics, and the risks of getting caught in hype-driven price speculation.

Many companies eagerly embraced AI solutions, hoping to revolutionize their operations. However, recent data suggests this rapid pace of corporate AI adoption may be hitting a plateau. Understanding Corporate AI Adoption Trends According to the fintech company Ramp, whose AI Index tracks U.S. business adoption based on transaction data, the rate of deploying AI products and services appears to have leveled off. After nearly ten consecutive months of growth, Ramp’s AI Index stabilized at 41% in May. This indicates that while a significant portion of businesses have integrated some form of AI, the initial rush might be slowing down. Ramp’s data provides a snapshot across different company sizes as of May: Large businesses: 49% adoption Medium-sized firms: 44% adoption Small companies: 37% adoption While large companies naturally lead the charge in enterprise AI adoption due to resources and scale, the data shows widespread interest across the board, albeit with differing penetration rates. The Reality Check: Why AI Adoption Trends May Be Pausing It’s important to note that Ramp’s AI Index has limitations. It relies on a sample of approximately 30,000 companies and identifies AI spend primarily through merchant names and line-item details, potentially missing some expenditures. Nevertheless, the trend aligns with a growing realization among businesses: there are limits to what today’s AI capabilities can achieve. One notable example is Klarna. The company, which had planned to replace hundreds of support agents with AI, recently had to rehire some workers. This decision came after the AI-driven cuts led to a noticeable drop in customer service quality, highlighting that AI is not yet a perfect substitute for human interaction in all scenarios. Generative AI Pilots Facing Challenges Further supporting the idea of a slowdown or a phase of reassessment, data from S&P Global indicates a significant increase in companies abandoning their pilot projects, particularly those focused on generative AI pilots . The share of companies discontinuing most of their generative AI initiatives has jumped to 42%, a substantial rise from 17% just a year prior. This suggests that while the potential of generative AI is immense, the practical implementation, integration, and realization of tangible benefits in pilot phases have proven challenging for many organizations. The initial hype is giving way to the complexities of real-world deployment, data requirements, and achieving desired outcomes. Beyond the Hype: Realistic AI Productivity Gains The leveling off in AI adoption trends and the high rate of abandoned generative AI pilots point towards a maturation phase. Businesses are moving past the initial excitement and are now grappling with the practicalities of integrating AI effectively to achieve sustainable AI productivity improvements. This involves understanding where AI truly adds value, the infrastructure needed, the potential pitfalls, and the need for human oversight or collaboration. While the overall trajectory for AI in the enterprise remains upward in the long term, the current data suggests a period of recalibration. Companies are likely becoming more strategic and cautious, focusing on proven use cases and addressing the complexities before scaling their AI investments further. This shift from rapid adoption to deliberate integration is a natural part of the technology lifecycle. The data from Ramp, supported by observations like the Klarna case and S&P Global’s findings on generative AI pilots , paints a picture of corporate AI adoption entering a more measured phase. It’s a sign that businesses are moving beyond the initial hype to tackle the real-world challenges and opportunities presented by enterprise AI .

The proposal for the change, which was confirmed in an update on GitHub , had sparked debate within the Bitcoin community. Critics argued that removing the limit could encourage increased embedding of arbitrary data, potentially leading to network spam and a shift from bitcoin's BTC primary function as a financial tool. This decision to go ahead marks another significant moment in the community's debate about blockchain usage, highlighting persistent tensions between network efficiency, practical use cases and ideological principles. The OP_RETURN code allows Bitcoin users to include data in transactions. The functionality is conceptually similar to, though technically distinct from, the way Inscriptions embed images and text directly into the blockchain using Ordinals and witness data. Some argue that adding this transaction data is ""arbitrary"" and contradicts the original vision for the Bitcoin blockchain as proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. The 80-byte limit on OP_RETURN encouraged alternative methods of data storage, some of which caused issues like bloating the unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. In a detailed GitHub summary and subsequent X post, Bitcoin Core developer Gloria Zhao outlined the reasoning behind the change. Zhao emphasized the intention to mitigate unintended consequences of the existing limit, noting, “The primary motivation for this [change] is to correct a mismatch between the harmfulness and standardness of data storage techniques.” Developer Greg Sanders, who authored the merged pull request, said in GitHub discussions that the removal of the limit “yields at least two tangible benefits: a cleaner UTXO set and more consistent default behavior.” Debate over governance Zhao also addressed broader governance issues on her X page , highlighting Bitcoin Core's commitment to transparency and meritocracy. She stressed the importance of the community’s role in maintaining these principles, warning against the risks of social engineering or corporate pressure influencing the software developers' decision-making process. “If Bitcoin Core’s contributors ever abandon these values, e.g., to appease social media or corporate wishes, the community will switch to another node implementation that does it better,” Zhao wrote, urging users to remain vigilant and informed. Developer Luke Dashjr has consistently opposed easing the limits, labeling the move as potentially harmful. He encouraged users to avoid upgrading to the new version or to adopt alternative node implementations, such as Bitcoin Knots. The debate mirrors the controversies of 2023 , notably around Ordinals and Inscriptions, when users embedded substantial non-financial data, such as images and text, into Bitcoin transactions, prompting similar concerns about blockchain misuse and network congestion. Despite these concerns, Zhao maintained that attempts to censor transaction types through relay policy are impractical and ineffective against strong economic incentives. Bitcoin Core's approach should remain neutral, reflecting the network's foundational principles of censorship resistance and decentralization, she said. The Core 30 release will retain manual control options, allowing users to enforce stricter limits through existing command-line parameters. However, these options are now marked as deprecated and will trigger warning messages, indicating potential removal in future updates without a set timeline.",Tech|Bitcoin|btc|Bitcoin ordinals|Bitcoin Core|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-10 11:43:06

According to CryptoQuant, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio recently hit 1.1, marking a rise in aggressive buying behavior, while short-term holders are locking in profits instead of exiting early. This, paired with BTC’s 1.84% daily price gain to $107,642, highlights growing confidence in a potential price breakout. Buyers Dominate Again – What Does It Mean for Bitcoin? “After 4 months of red, green CVD bars are back, signaling renewed buy pressure… Historically, green phases often precede strong uptrends.” – By @IT_Tech_PL Read more https://t.co/fG1RCWCM4d pic.twitter.com/IrSkRMkcp5 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 10, 2025 Long-Term Holders Build the Base CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin’s Realized Cap for long-term holders has now exceeded $56 billion, a level that reflects increasing conviction. Coins older than 155 days are moving into inactive wallets, suggesting holders aren’t looking to sell into the recent rally. Historically, this type of accumulation signals early stages of long-term bull trends, forming a strong foundation beneath BTC’s price. Moreover, Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dropped to 21.68%, the lowest in weeks. While low volatility may seem dull, such periods often precede explosive price moves. Combined with strong LTH buying and bullish short-term signals, it may set the stage for an upward breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Surge If Bank of Japan Eases Policy , Coin Days Destroyed: A Minor Blip? While Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) rose slightly, up 3.83% to 291.4k, indicating some older coins moved to exchanges, analysts say the shift is minor. Rather than a sell-off, this could reflect normal rebalancing. Overall, bullish metrics continue to outweigh bearish signals. Short Squeeze Possible? CoinGlass data reveals that over 60% of Binance traders are shorting BTC. With such a crowded short trade, a price move higher could trigger a short squeeze, adding fuel to BTC’s rally. Altogether, strong buyer activity, long-term holder confidence, and low volatility suggest Bitcoin may be primed for its next big move upward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new post on the social media platform X, Armstrong says Coinbase has made fixing unwarranted account freezes a top priority, while acknowledging the issue has lasted longer than it should have. “Account freezing has been a major issue at Coinbase for longer than is acceptable. I could list a bunch of the underlying reasons why it got so bad in the first place, but what’s more important is that we’ve made it a priority to fix, and we have been making good progress… The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming. We’ll keep you updated as further improvements roll out.” Armstrong also promises a more timely response to customers whose accounts are frozen. “If your account is still restricted (not for sanctioned or illegal activity) please direct message @coinbasesupport and we’ll prioritize getting it looked at ASAP.” Armstrong gives credit to Coinbase’s product team member Dor Levi, who was hired in April, for achieving the fix. Says Levi, “If you’re on CT (crypto Twitter), you know how significant this issue has been for users. I myself am a Coinbase user, and our restriction experience is not meeting my own bar. The goal is clear: account freezes should be rare, limited to situations that warrant them, primarily when we’re legally obligated (e.g. sanctions or court orders) or protecting users (e.g. from scams or account compromises). We’re committed to getting this right. Recent releases have enabled us to make huge improvements without sacrificing our legal and regulatory obligations or our commitment to safety. In short: We’ve reduced the frequency of account locks by ~82% so far, and new changes are currently rolling out that will bring further reductions. We’ve made significant investments in our ML (machine learning) models, infrastructure, modeling, and teams. So far, we’ve improved the precision and recall of all our models, and are seeing fewer restrictions/freezes as a result. We’ve established guardrails and checks/balances to ensure we maintain focus on this and won’t stop iterating. We’re also tackling this problem from the other end by moving processes like source-of-funds verification and enhanced KYC (Know Your Customer) into the app. This means most restriction types will have self-service flows to remove restrictions, which is much more efficient than previous options.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The outage has impacted access to ChatGPT, the Sora text-to-video AI tool, and associated APIs. Reports of problems began surfacing on Downdetector around 7 AM UTC, although OpenAI did not acknowledge the issues publicly until 9 AM, via its status webpage . At that time, the company confirmed “elevated error rates and latency” in several services, stating that it is “continuing to investigate” the matter. By 11 AM, OpenAI issued an update stating that elevated error rates were mostly related to 14 APIs, 4 incidents in Sora, and 21 components of ChatGPT . The company labeled the service disruption as a “partial outage.” ChatGPT still responsive for some users Affected users attempting to interact with ChatGPT were greeted with the error message: “Hmm…something seems to have gone wrong,” as shared by numerous social media users. Although some subscribers reported sluggish performance and significant delays in generating chatbot responses, others said the service was operating normally for them. According to outage tracking metrics, over 1,000 complaints were registered in the United Kingdom alone, with nearly 500 reported in the United States within hours of the initial reports. Roughly 90% of those reports involved issues with the web version of ChatGPT, while the mobile app and API services accounted for less than 10% of complaints. Some users also reported problems with login functions and API connectivity. In 2025, there have been three major incidents of ChatGPT’s outage. Earlier in January, a partial outage affected ChatGPT’s ability to generate image content via DALL·E and slowed down GPT-4 responses, but it was resolved within hours. Another major incident occurred in late April when both the ChatGPT web app and API services went offline intermittently over a two-day period. At the time, OpenAI cited issues with its cloud provider, but did not give any further public explanation beyond confirming a service degradation on its status page. Performance issues after AVM and translation feature rollout The outage comes at a time when OpenAI is rolling out upgrades to its Advanced Voice Mode (AVM) feature in ChatGPT for paid subscribers. In its recent statement , the AI firm claimed that the new features have more natural, human-like interactions through voice and offer real-time speech translation between multiple languages without interruption. The enhancements are embedded on OpenAI’s GPT-4o model, a natively multimodal system capable of both understanding and generating audio. According to the company’s June 7, 2025, release notes , users can now simply instruct ChatGPT’s voice interface to translate between languages, and it will continue doing so in real time until directed otherwise. OpenAI first demonstrated live speech translation in May 2024 and followed it with voice interaction technology released in September of the same year. The new “Realtime API,” which allows developers to integrate speech-to-speech functionality into their apps, debuted in October 2024, and additional voice options were added in April 2025. “This changes everything if you’re traveling abroad. ChatGPT can now stay in translation mode no reset needed, just talk. The new voice sounds way more human. More emotion, better pacing. It’s getting scary good,” reckoned one user on social platform X. Still, per reports from the early testing of the feature, there are some quality issues. The company admitted that users may encounter occasional inconsistencies in audio output, such as tone and pitch irregularities, depending on the voice selected. “ We expect to improve audio consistency over time ,” OpenAI stated in its release notes. It also explained that the issues are noticeable with certain voice options and may affect the user experience in live translations or phones using accessibility support.

The study spotlights Ripple’s collaboration with Bitso , a leading Latin American crypto exchange, showcasing how blockchain is transforming payment corridors, particularly between the U.S. and Mexico. Academic Spotlight on Ripple and Bitso’s Cross-Border Model The FGV research underscores how digital assets and stablecoins are disrupting traditional remittance systems by cutting costs, accelerating transactions, and improving transparency. Central to the study is the partnership between Bitso and Ripple, which leverages RippleNet’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution to facilitate seamless cross-border payments using XRP as a bridge currency. Headquartered in Mexico, Bitso plays a critical operational role in this framework. Through ODL, U.S. dollars are converted to XRP, sent across the border, and then converted to Mexican pesos, bypassing intermediaries and enabling near-instant settlement. According to the research, this system has already processed billions of dollars in remittances, providing users with significantly lower fees and faster delivery compared to conventional financial channels. This model reflects XRP’s practical utility—not as a store of value, but as a liquidity facilitator capable of removing friction from international transfers.

While stablecoins offer fiat-backed price stability and are increasingly used in payments, they often rely on centralized issuers and traditional banking rails, which can reintroduce bottlenecks. In contrast, Ripple’s ODL model enables direct currency exchange without the need for pre-funded accounts. This gives XRP a unique advantage in regions like Latin America, where conventional banking infrastructure may be limited and where remittances are a financial lifeline for millions. The researchers point out that both stablecoins and assets like XRP serve valuable but distinct roles in the emerging financial landscape. However, XRP’s capacity to provide real-time, trustless liquidity sets it apart as a tool purpose-built for global value transfer.

By highlighting a real-world use case that’s already moving billions, the paper strengthens the case for blockchain as a credible solution to longstanding inefficiencies in global payments. Beyond the technical benefits, the paper emphasizes the model’s contribution to financial inclusion. By eliminating reliance on intermediaries and enabling direct access to payment rails, Ripple’s ODL empowers individuals and small businesses in underserved regions to participate more fully in the global economy. This aligns closely with Ripple’s long-term mission: to create an internet of value where money moves as seamlessly as information. FGV’s research represents more than just academic interest, it marks a milestone in the institutional validation of XRP’s utility in real-world finance. As regulators, banks, and fintechs increasingly explore blockchain integrations, case studies like Ripple and Bitso’s partnership stand out as proven, scalable solutions. By removing friction from cross-border payments, Ripple’s ODL and XRP are not only solving legacy financial challenges, they’re laying the groundwork for a more inclusive and efficient global monetary system. The Brazilian university’s findings are clear: XRP is not theoretical. It’s operational, impactful, and already moving billions.

Digital asset investment firm Canary Capital has reportedly taken a notable step forward, completing the registration of the corporate entity designed to underpin its proposed Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Delaware, United States. What Does Registering a Delaware Entity for a Solana ETF Mean? For those tracking the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency, the registration of a Delaware Entity for a financial product like an ETF is a standard, yet crucial, procedural step. Delaware is a popular jurisdiction for incorporating businesses in the U.S. due to its well-established corporate law and court system. Registering an entity here is a foundational move for any firm planning to launch a regulated financial product like an ETF. Think of it as laying the legal groundwork. Before you can file the necessary paperwork with regulatory bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to actually launch an ETF, you need a legally recognized structure (the entity) to house the fund’s assets and operations. Canary Capital’s action signals their serious intent to bring a Solana-focused investment product to market. Why is a SOL ETF a Big Deal? Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become incredibly popular investment vehicles because they offer investors an accessible and often cost-effective way to gain exposure to an asset class, index, or sector without directly owning the underlying assets. For cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), an ETF wrapper could potentially unlock significant institutional and retail investment that might otherwise be hesitant to deal with the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets, managing private keys, and navigating exchanges. A SOL ETF would trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easy to buy and sell through standard brokerage accounts. This familiarity and ease of access can dramatically lower the barrier to entry for a broad range of investors, potentially leading to increased capital flows into the Solana ecosystem. It represents a maturation of the asset class, moving from niche digital markets to mainstream financial platforms. Canary Capital’s Move: Who Are They and Why Solana? While the report via BWE News on X highlights Canary Capital’s registration, it’s important to understand the context. Digital asset investment firms are actively exploring ways to package cryptocurrencies into regulated products following the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year. This success demonstrated significant market demand and established a potential regulatory pathway for other digital assets. Solana has emerged as a prominent blockchain platform known for its high transaction throughput and speed, attracting significant development activity and user adoption, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs. Its growing prominence makes it a natural candidate for firms looking to offer diversified crypto exposure through ETFs. Canary Capital’s focus on a Solana ETF indicates their view on the asset’s potential and market demand. The Staking Advantage: What Does Staking Support in a Crypto ETF Offer? One particularly interesting detail from the report is that the proposed Crypto ETF supports staking. Staking is a process available on proof-of-stake blockchains like Solana, where token holders lock up their assets to support the network’s operations and security. In return, they earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account or dividends from a stock. Including staking support in an ETF is a significant innovation for crypto ETFs. Traditional asset ETFs track the price performance of the underlying asset. However, holding assets like SOL directly allows for staking rewards, which can be a substantial part of the overall return, in addition to price appreciation. An ETF that incorporates staking could potentially pass these rewards onto the ETF holders, offering a more complete return profile that mirrors direct ownership. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Traditional Price-Tracking SOL ETF (Hypothetical) Canary Capital’s Proposed Staking SOL ETF (Hypothetical) Exposure Tracks SOL price performance Tracks SOL price performance + Staking rewards Income Generation None Potential yield from staking rewards Complexity for Investor Low (buy/sell on exchange) Low (buy/sell on exchange) Direct Asset Ownership No No (held by the fund) Potential Total Return Price change only Price change + Staking yield This staking feature could make the proposed SOL ETF particularly attractive to income-focused investors or those seeking to maximize their total return from their Solana exposure without the operational burden of managing staking themselves. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: The Path Ahead for a Solana ETF While registering a Delaware Entity is a necessary step, it is just one part of a long and challenging journey to launching an ETF in the United States. The primary hurdle remains regulatory approval from the SEC. The SEC has historically been cautious regarding cryptocurrency products. While they approved Bitcoin spot ETFs after years of applications and legal challenges, and are currently considering spot Ethereum ETFs, the path for other cryptocurrencies like Solana is less clear. A key factor for the SEC is determining whether a cryptocurrency is considered a commodity (like Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum) or a security. The SEC has previously indicated that some cryptocurrencies, excluding Bitcoin, may be considered securities, which would fall under a different, potentially more complex, regulatory framework. For a Solana ETF to gain approval, proponents will likely need to convince the SEC that SOL fits within a framework acceptable for an ETF structure, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum are being evaluated. This involves demonstrating market maturity, surveillance sharing agreements with regulated markets, and investor protection measures. Benefits and Challenges of a SOL ETF Bringing a SOL ETF to market comes with potential benefits and inherent challenges: Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Opens up Solana investment to traditional investors via brokerage accounts. Enhanced Liquidity: Trading on major exchanges can increase liquidity for SOL. Regulatory Clarity: Provides a regulated investment pathway, potentially attracting institutional capital. Staking Yield: The potential to earn staking rewards within the ETF structure is a significant draw. Convenience: Removes the technical complexities of direct SOL ownership and staking for investors. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Approval: The SEC’s stance on Solana’s classification remains a major hurdle. Market Volatility: Solana’s price is highly volatile, and an ETF would be subject to this volatility. Staking Risks: While the ETF manages staking, underlying risks like slashing (loss of staked funds due to validator errors) still exist and would impact the fund’s performance. Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which would reduce the overall return compared to direct, self-managed staking. Tracking Error: An ETF’s performance may not perfectly track the underlying asset’s performance due to fees, operational costs, and potential complexities in managing staking within the fund. What’s Next? Actionable Insights for Observers Canary Capital’s Delaware Entity registration is an early step. The next critical phase will be the filing of formal applications with the SEC (likely S-1 and S-1/A filings). These filings will provide much more detail about the proposed ETF’s structure, custody arrangements, staking methodology, and risk disclosures. Investors and market participants should watch for these filings. They will offer insights into how Canary Capital plans to address regulatory concerns and manage the technical aspects of a staking ETF. Monitoring SEC commentary and actions regarding other crypto ETFs (especially Ethereum) will also be crucial, as regulatory precedent plays a significant role. Furthermore, observing the broader market sentiment towards Solana and institutional interest in the asset will provide context for the potential demand for such an ETF. While the timeline for potential approval is uncertain and could take many months or even years, this registration confirms that firms are actively working to bring Solana to the mainstream investment landscape. Conclusion: A Promising Sign for the Solana ETF Future The registration of a Delaware Entity by Canary Capital for a proposed staking Solana ETF is a concrete indicator of growing interest in bringing Solana into traditional finance. While significant regulatory hurdles remain, particularly regarding the SEC’s view on SOL’s classification, this move signals intent and progress. A staking-enabled Crypto ETF for Solana could offer investors a compelling blend of price exposure and yield generation through a familiar, regulated investment vehicle. As firms like Canary Capital continue to push forward with these initiatives, the potential for broader institutional and retail adoption of Solana through accessible ETF products becomes increasingly real. The journey is far from over, but this is undoubtedly an exciting development for the Solana ecosystem and the wider digital asset market.

Circle (NYSE: CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, demonstrated the market’s appetite for crypto equities when its stock surged from an IPO price of $31 to close at $107 in its first week of trading. The new Bybit report looks beyond the ticker to highlight the broader impact on the crypto industry, as Circle made history in crafting compelling narratives under the current crypto-positive climate in the U.S.. The Circle IPO has established a new benchmark for the industry and signaled growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Crypto Valuations Humbled Investment Bankers Investment bankers significantly underestimated Circle’s evaluation. Its blowout debut far exceeded Wall Street expectations, with oversubscription at the IPO stage and an extraordinarily streak of high demands after the company went public. The phenomenon speaks to crypto’s game-changing nature as more blockchain and crypto firms are expected to enter capital markets, rewriting the rulebooks of conventional valuation methods, models, and metrics. The report also examines Circle’s fundamentals and competitor landscape for further gains, while drawing parallels to Coinbase’s post-IPO experience during the 2022 market correction on potential risks. Six Companies Leading the 2025 Crypto IPO Pipeline Circle is just the beginning. The report identified six candidates gearing up for IPO, each with unique edges in crypto and blockchain. From DeFi to the security layer, key players including Fireblocks and Chainalysis, among others, are looking at billions in valuation. The timing could not have been better. Industry experts note that the favorable regulatory environment under the new U.S. administration has created optimal conditions for crypto companies to access public capital markets. The anticipated wave of crypto IPOs is expected to further legitimize the cryptocurrency industry’s role in global finance.

In a move that reflects growing awareness of DeFi’s economic impact, SEC Chair Paul Atkins has called for updated frameworks that safeguard investors without stifling innovation. The shift comes as policymakers aim to balance legal certainty with technological progress, particularly around areas like self-custody, protocol staking, and blockchain-based fundraising. Atkins addressed the evolving regulatory stance during the SEC’s Crypto Task Force Roundtable on Decentralised Finance , where he acknowledged that current restrictions may have constrained growth in the sector. He also suggested the agency is considering conditional exemptions for certain DeFi activities, alongside published guidance clarifying legal grey areas around staking and mining. SEC reviews exemptions for DeFi and blockchain startups A central focus of the SEC’s revised approach is offering “conditional exemptive relief” for qualified DeFi projects. These exemptions would allow startups to operate with fewer regulatory barriers during early development phases, reducing the legal uncertainty that has previously discouraged innovation. As part of this shift, the SEC is reviewing updates to self-custody rules and determining which activities fall within its jurisdiction. This includes examining proof-of-work mining and staking-as-a-service platforms, both of which have come under scrutiny for their potential to involve securities transactions. During the roundtable, Atkins criticised the approach of previous US administrations, stating they had created a “chilling effect” on market participation by pursuing legal action and regulatory threats against DeFi participants and staking providers. Staking and mining guidance define legal thresholds In a rare move, the SEC has released two formal documents outlining the agency’s interpretation of how staking and mining relate to securities laws. These include the Statement on Certain Proof-of-Work Mining Activities and the Statement on Certain Protocol Staking Activities , which identify conditions under which such activities may not be regulated as securities offerings. These guidelines offer developers clearer boundaries on how they can engage users and raise funds without triggering enforcement. While not offering blanket immunity, they suggest that passive network participation, when done without profit-sharing or promises of return, may fall outside the scope of securities law. This technical distinction is seen as vital for DeFi protocols that rely on decentralised consensus mechanisms and community governance. The clarification aims to reduce confusion and enable compliant innovation across decentralised applications. Market response and future policy The SEC’s evolving stance comes at a time when DeFi continues to gain institutional attention. Major investment firms and developers are watching closely, particularly in light of recent industry lobbying for clarity and fair treatment under financial laws. The regulator’s willingness to provide structured exemptions, clarify grey areas, and reference judicial reasoning may signal a more balanced regulatory path going forward. However, stakeholders caution that policy implementation will need to be consistently applied to avoid confusion or selective enforcement. As discussions continue, the SEC’s latest actions suggest a roadmap that includes risk-adjusted exemptions, enhanced transparency, and respect for open-source development—key ingredients for ensuring the US remains competitive in blockchain innovation.

Investors are watching, waiting, and positioning for the next big leap. While many are caught up in the buzz surrounding trending technologies like BlockDAG, another contender is quietly setting the foundation for long-term dominance. That contender is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). And those who’ve seen its core architecture are calling it the most underpriced powerhouse in the making. BlockDAG: A Bold Idea, With Some Growing Pains To be fair, BlockDAG has brought genuine excitement to the crypto space. Its parallel block-processing model was designed to address Bitcoin’s speed limitations. And in theory, it offers a path to faster confirmation times without sacrificing decentralization. However, many BlockDAG projects are still early-stage, and few have demonstrated real-world stability or compatibility with mainstream wallets, centralized exchanges, or mining frameworks. While BlockDAG is promising, it remains a bet on future execution, not proven delivery. Bitcoin Solaris: Engineered for Speed, Built for Scale Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t just promise innovation—it’s actively delivering it. Built on a dual-layer design, BTC-S combines the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW) with the performance of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). The result? A blockchain capable of 10,000+ transactions per second, 2-second finality, and drastically reduced energy usage—over 99% more efficient than Bitcoin’s mining model. But what truly separates Bitcoin Solaris is its laser focus on real-world usability: Dual Consensus Architecture: The base layer secures the network via PoW while the Solaris Layer handles smart contracts and speed through DPoS. Validator Rotation: The DPoS mechanism uses dynamic validator rotation to ensure decentralization and speed. Energy Efficiency: Designed to support mobile-first mining and browser-based participation without specialized rigs. Audited Smart Contracts: The protocol has been rigorously examined by Cyberscope and Freshcoins for smart contract integrity and protocol security. How Bitcoin Solaris Will Make People Rich At its core, BTC-S is engineered to make wealth-building accessible—whether through the upcoming mobile-based mining via the Solaris Nova app or through staking, trading, and ecosystem rewards. Unlike speculative tokens that rely purely on hype, Bitcoin Solaris combines sound economics, robust architecture, and community-first design to deliver lasting value. And it does so with a hard cap of 21 million coins—mirroring Bitcoin’s scarcity while offering dramatically better performance. Meanwhile, its network design allows people to mine and earn even from everyday devices, without needing $10,000 mining rigs or elite technical setups. Break Free from Crypto Limitations—Join BTC-S and Build Daily The $4M Milestone: One of the Shortest and Hottest Presales in Crypto With less than 8 weeks left in one of the shortest presales ever launched , Bitcoin Solaris has already attracted over 11,000 investors and raised more than $4 million. Current presale phase: Price: $7 Next Phase: $8 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 9% Investors are rushing in as the window to lock in a 233% potential launch return quickly closes. And the momentum shows no sign of slowing. What the Community and Influencers Are Saying Crypto analysts and influencers are calling it early—Bitcoin Solaris is the one to watch. Here’s what some of them are highlighting: 2Bit Crypto: Highlighted its unmatched technical depth and speed in a detailed breakdown. Ben Crypto: Focused on the real utility of BTC-S and why it’s a strong alternative to speculative meme tokens. Crypto Enthusiasts: Many in online forums are praising its mining accessibility, dual-layer setup, and early-stage valuation. With Telegram and X communities growing rapidly— join Telegram and follow BTC-S on X —it’s clear this is becoming more than a project. It’s a movement. Roadmap Highlights: Built for the Long Game The team isn’t just planning for launch—they’re architecting for impact: Q2 2025: Token generation, team expansion, and global outreach Q1 2026: Testnet release and dual-layer optimization Q3 2026: Mainnet goes live with full governance 2027–2028: Institutional integration, AI-powered upgrades, and global blockchain adoption Every phase is structured for scale, strategy, and sustained momentum. Final Verdict: The Project That Could Redefine the Cycle While BlockDAG pushes the conversation forward, Bitcoin Solaris is already building the future today—backed by speed, accessibility, and battle-tested architecture. From its dual-consensus engine to its mobile-first mining vision, everything about BTC-S screams scalability with substance. Add to that a thriving community, audit-backed smart contracts, and a presale that’s shattering milestones—and you have more than a promising altcoin. You have a movement with momentum.

BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention in a way few projects can, blending cultural relevance with smart timing and strategy. Rather than relying on the usual tactics, BlockDAG has secured real-world credibility through major sports partnerships. Its confirmed deal with Inter Milan and viral NBA deal teaser have pushed it into the spotlight, making waves well beyond the crypto community. These moves are not just for show. They are driving serious traction in presale numbers and placing BlockDAG at the top of the best crypto presale rankings for those focused on long-term returns. 1. BlockDAG: From Sports Partnerships to Massive $292M Success BlockDAG is taking a different approach to visibility, and it is working. Instead of relying on influencers or loud speculation, the project is aligning itself with global sports powerhouses. The confirmed partnership with Inter Milan instantly raised eyebrows across both the crypto and traditional sports spaces. Then came the NBA deal teaser, which sparked a wave of online conversation and positioned BlockDAG as a serious contender beyond the blockchain world. These partnerships are doing more than just grabbing headlines. They are building trust. When a crypto project aligns with recognized brands, it sends a clear signal that credibility and ambition are part of the roadmap. That trust is translating directly into numbers. With more than $292 million raised and over 22.2 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is not just being watched, it is being bought. Now in Batch 28, the standard price is $0.0262, but a limited-time pricing slashes it to $0.0018 until June 13. With a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, BlockDAG continues to lead the race for the best crypto presale in 2025. 2. Dawgz: Quietly Rising as a Best Crypto Presale Contender While BlockDAG grabs headlines with sports teasers, Dawgz is taking a different route, quietly building one of the strongest grassroots communities in the presale space. With unique rewards tied to participation, including staking bonuses and NFT collaborations, Dawgz is gaining traction by putting its early backers front and center. This community-first model is paying off. Although its presale figures are smaller compared to major names, the loyalty of its user base and focused roadmap are creating serious long-term upside. Dawgz is not chasing noise, it is locking in value through real engagement. For those tracking the best crypto presale opportunities with explosive potential, Dawgz is one to watch closely before the wider market catches on. 3. Snorter: The Meme Coin Turning Hype Into Opportunity Snorter is not trying to be the next corporate-backed chain, it is embracing its meme identity and turning it into a movement. With a sharp focus on viral content and humor-driven marketing, Snorter has found a fast-growing following across Telegram and X. It is not just laughs and memes; it is traction that is fueling real presale momentum. Snorter’s presale is gaining pace as users flock to projects with bold energy and viral appeal. It may not suit the conservative crowd, but for those chasing high-upside entries, Snorter delivers the kind of early buzz that often leads to breakout runs. For meme enthusiasts looking beyond the noise, Snorter could be the best crypto presale play in the speculative lane. Moving Ahead When talking about the best crypto presale opportunities in 2025, BlockDAG continues to stand out with unmatched visibility and strong early traction. Its $292 million raise, 2,520% ROI, and major sports collaborations like Inter Milan and the potential NBA deal on the horizon give it both credibility and cultural momentum. It is setting the tone for how serious projects can dominate early-stage attention. Still, Dawgz and Snorter bring their advantages. Whether it is grassroots loyalty or meme-fueled virality, both offer a different kind of upside. Together, these three projects highlight how the presale space in 2025 offers something for every strategy and risk profile.

While often discussed in the context of cloud computing, the potential for powerful AI to run directly on our devices is a game-changer, offering enhanced privacy and performance – concepts highly valued in the tech community, including among cryptocurrency enthusiasts who prioritize decentralization and control. Exploring Apple’s On-Device AI Capabilities At the recent WWDC 2025 conference, Apple unveiled its innovative Foundation Models framework. This framework is designed to give developers unprecedented access to Apple’s sophisticated AI models, allowing them to integrate advanced artificial intelligence features directly into their applications. The key highlight? These powerful AI models can operate entirely On-device AI , meaning processing happens locally on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, without needing a constant connection to the internet or external servers. This on-device capability is powered by Apple Intelligence , the company’s suite of models specifically built to enhance the user experience across its ecosystem. These models are deeply integrated into iOS and other Apple operating systems, driving many of the smart features users already interact with daily. By opening up access to these models via the Foundation Models framework, Apple is enabling developers to build richer, more intelligent applications that were previously only possible with cloud-based AI. The Benefits of Offline AI and Enhanced Privacy One of the most compelling advantages of Apple’s new framework is the ability to leverage Offline AI . As highlighted by Apple VP of software engineering Craig Federighi at WWDC 2025, this offline capability brings several significant benefits: Enhanced Privacy: Data processing happens locally on the device, reducing the need to send sensitive information to the cloud. This aligns with Apple’s strong stance on user privacy. Cost Efficiency: Developers can avoid potentially high cloud API costs associated with traditional server-based AI processing. Availability: AI features can function even when the user is offline or has a poor internet connection, making apps more reliable and accessible. Speed and Performance: Processing data locally can often be faster than sending it to a remote server and waiting for a response. Federighi provided a practical example: an educational app like Kahoot could use the on-device models to create a personalized quiz based on a student’s notes. This process happens instantly and privately on the device, without incurring cloud costs or requiring an internet connection, making studying more engaging and convenient. What This Means for Developers and Users The introduction of the Foundation Models framework is a significant step for Apple and its developer community. It democratizes access to powerful Apple AI capabilities, allowing developers to innovate and create new experiences that are not only smart but also prioritize user privacy and work seamlessly offline. The potential applications are vast, from creative tools and educational apps to productivity software and accessibility features. For users, this means more intelligent, responsive, and private applications.

The rally has taken FARTCOIN to $1.27 at the time of writing, with short-term indicators signalling further upward pressure—though profit-taking risks remain high.

RSI and MACD show bullish momentum for FARTCOIN FARTCOIN’s price momentum has been reinforced by its technical indicators. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows that a golden cross has formed, typically a bullish sign. A golden cross occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, pointing to positive momentum and a potential sustained price rally. These signals often indicate renewed market interest and increased accumulation. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed above the neutral 50-point threshold, reaching 55.46. While not yet in overbought territory—usually marked at 70 and above—the current RSI level implies building demand. This aligns with the recent surge in trading activity, which has intensified since Coinbase’s listing update. Price heads toward $1.46 as $1.29 resistance nears Following its climb to $1.27, FARTCOIN is now approaching a critical resistance at $1.29. This level marks a short-term barrier that could either strengthen the current uptrend or lead to a local top if bulls fail to breach it. If the price convincingly crosses $1.29 and this level becomes a new support floor, traders may begin targeting the next major resistance at $1.46. This level represents a previous rejection point from late May, and breaking it would suggest a continuation of the coin’s bullish trajectory. However, if sellers begin to offload tokens at current levels, the momentum could reverse. Profit-taking around $1.25–$1.29 may act as a headwind, especially if market sentiment falters or broader crypto markets correct. Potential downside risk to $1.16 or $0.94 Despite the short-term strength, downside risks cannot be ruled out. A failure to break $1.29 could result in a retracement to the immediate support at $1.16. This level served as a consolidation zone in early June and may attract buyers looking for a dip entry. If $1.16 fails to hold, the next major support lies at $0.94. This would represent a full retracement of the June rally and could signal a deeper correction. With meme coins often driven by sentiment and speculative interest, any broader shift in market tone could accelerate such a move. Nonetheless, unless significant selling volume emerges, the near-term bias appears skewed towards the upside. The RSI and MACD signals, combined with the Coinbase listing announcement, provide a technical and fundamental basis for continued price action.

EMRC will feature contributions from prominent builders, researchers and analysts across the Ethereum landscape. It will include original research authored by EMRC contributors, curated material by external sources, thought-leadership pieces and a real-time news feed. Ethereum comprises a large and innovative ecosystem that plays host to the major stablecoin market share, the proliferation of real-world assets (RWAs) and most of the total value locked in decentralized finance (DeFi). But many argue this has not been reflected in the price of the ether ETH token. That's partly because rival blockchains have been more organized and systematic about getting their message across, Mougayar said. “Ethereum is No. 1 when it comes to market share, but we realize it has not been communicating its messages as well as it should,” Mougayar said in an interview. “Meanwhile, Solana has been very aggressive from a marketing perspective.” The new research hub aims to take on some of the educational burden not suited to the developer-focused Ethereum Foundation, and simply to “re-energize the Ethereum message,” Mougayar said. The move is part of a wider drive to push Ethereum into its next institutional phase, while will involve multiple firms and individual leaders, he added. The idea that many competing layer-2 blockchains running on top of Ethereum and offering cheaper and faster transactions has somehow cannibalized the mother chain is more of a misplaced perception than an actual issue, Mougayar said. “Ethereum is really the L2s and the L1 working together,” Mougayar said. “By the end of the year, there will probably be 200 L2s. So it’s about a whole ecosystem and not about a contest of features. Ethereum is very decentralized and it’s going to continue to grow laterally, just like the internet.” Wholehearted decentralization, something lacking in other blockchain ecosystems, Mougayar points out, does make things like messaging tricky for Ethereum. “The problem with a decentralized system is that everything is all over the place and in some ways that can be a weakness,” Mougayar said. “So the way to remedy this weakness is to recentralize some of this. So at some point in time, you have to recentralize the decentralized mass so you can see it, so it can be easier for people to see it all in one place.”",Finance|Ethereum|Education|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-10 12:04:03

Despite stringent American export curbs imposed since 2019, Huawei is leaning on techniques such as cluster computing and innovative multi-element “compound” chips to boost performance, Zhengfei told China’s official Communist Party mouthpiece. Huawei banks on innovation to narrow the gap Zhengfei emphasized that Huawei dedicates roughly 180 billion yuan (about US$25 billion) each year to R&D, splitting that investment between theoretical exploration and product development. “Without a solid theoretical foundation, breakthroughs are impossible, and without breakthroughs, we cannot hope to narrow the lead established by US firms,” he said, noting that approximately one-third of the annual research budget underpins fundamental science, with the remaining two-thirds channeled into practical engineering and design. At the heart of Huawei’s strategy lies a trio of complementary approaches . First, the firm pairs advanced mathematics with conventional physics to simulate and optimize chip behaviour, sidestepping some of the constraints of Moore’s Law, the long-held principle that transistor counts double roughly every two years. Second, by blending varied semiconductor materials into compound chips, Huawei seeks to eke out new performance gains beyond what single-material devices can achieve. Finally, the company is harnessing large-scale cluster computing, linking hundreds of individual processors into a unified system, to compensate for any shortfall in the raw speed of a single chip. “Through weaving mathematics into physical design and augmenting Moore’s Law with non-Moore’s Law techniques, then layering on cluster computing, we can attain results suitable for real-world applications.” Zhengfei. He added that software has not proven to be a bottleneck for Huawei; rather, the limitations lie in the hardware itself. Zhengfei’s frank admission of his firm’s lag comes as senior US and Chinese trade negotiators continue discussions in London, where America’s tech restrictions on China are high on the agenda. The company wants to prove a point Since 2019, Washington has barred Chinese firms, including Huawei, from obtaining the most advanced processors and the high-precision equipment needed to manufacture them, in a bid to curb Beijing’s technological and military ambitions. Until now, neither Zhengfei nor any other Huawei executive has publicly detailed the company’s chipmaking efforts. His comments mark the first official peek at how the Chinese firm is responding to these challenges. “The United States has perhaps overstated Huawei’s prowess,” Zhengfei acknowledged. “We are not as extraordinary as some claim, we must work diligently to prove ourselves.” Zhengfei In parallel with its defensive measures, Huawei has been actively promoting its Ascend family of artificial-intelligence chips, which vie with products from Nvidia , the undisputed leader in AI processors. In April, Huawei unveiled its “AI CloudMatrix 384” system, which stitches together 384 Ascend 910C chips in a single cluster designed for AI model training. Industry analysts have pointed out that on certain benchmarks, this configuration can even outpace Nvidia’s GB200 NVL72 setup, though the American firm still dominates many other metrics. Nevertheless, the US Commerce Department recently ruled that deploying Ascend chips would breach existing export controls, underscoring the fraught intersection of global competition and national security. Nvidia, for its part, has been unable to sell its most cutting-edge GPUs to Chinese buyers, a situation that has enabled Huawei to regain some market share domestically, even as its chips remain technically a step behind. Looking ahead, Zhengfei expressed optimism. He highlighted the promise of compound chips, devices constructed from multiple semiconductor materials, as a potential game-changer. And he reiterated his confidence that, through persistent investment in both theory and engineering, Huawei will continue shrinking the performance gap with its US counterparts. “Worry over Huawei’s chip supply is unnecessary,” he concluded, urging stakeholders to recognize the firm’s resilience and ingenuity under pressure.

The company announced plans to release its modular Bitcoin mining operating system, MOS, as open-source software by the fourth quarter of 2025. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says the software is designed to help new entrants bypass costly vendor solutions by offering a scalable and peer-to-peer architecture that supports existing mining infrastructure. In a parallel development, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has appeared as a pricing benchmark in a Bolivian airport store, signaling increased informal use of digital dollars amid the country’s ongoing economic downturn. Tether’s Bold Bitcoin Play: Mining Software Goes Open Source to Spark Decentralization Boom Tether, the powerhouse behind the world’s most widely used stablecoin USDT, is preparing to take a major step into Bitcoin infrastructure with an ambitious open-source initiative. In a move that could democratize Bitcoin mining and challenge the dominance of incumbent players, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced on Monday that the company will open-source its proprietary Bitcoin Mining Operating System (MOS) by the fourth quarter of 2025. The announcement was made via Ardoino’s official X account, where he emphasized that the initiative would pave the way for a ”horde” of new mining companies to join the Bitcoin ecosystem without being shackled by costly and proprietary third-party software systems. The MOS platform is designed as a scalable, modular system that uses a peer-to-peer Internet of Things (IoT) architecture. Tether says it will be compatible with current mining infrastructure, including mining containers and various power delivery modules. This makes the MOS accessible not just to future projects, but to existing operations that want to cut costs and gain flexibility. Strengthening Bitcoin's Decentralization The move is the latest in Tether’s growing list of initiatives aimed at fostering decentralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. In April 2025, Tether partnered with the Ocean mining pool — a protocol founded by Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr — to decentralize block production and ensure smaller miners could remain competitive in the wake of growing industrial consolidation. The partnership saw Tether commit both its current and future hashrate to Ocean, giving weight to its message that decentralization is essential to Bitcoin’s long-term viability. Ardoino’s consistent emphasis on modularity and accessibility signals a strong strategic intent: break down the walls that separate institutional miners from upstarts and hobbyists, and reinforce the core ethos of Bitcoin — trustless, permissionless participation. Tether’s open-source announcement comes at a time of rapid transformation in the Bitcoin mining industry. The recent halving event has significantly reduced block rewards, forcing miners to rethink their strategies in order to remain profitable. Large mining companies still hold key advantages, including access to cheaper energy, bulk hardware purchases, and favorable financing. Yet even these giants are hedging their bets by diversifying operations into new sectors. Hive Digital, once a pure-play crypto mining firm, has seen better margins from artificial intelligence workloads than from mining Bitcoin. According to executive chairman Frank Holmes, institutional interest in Hive’s AI division now dwarfs interest in its crypto operations. Still, not all miners are diversifying away from Bitcoin. Canadian firm Cango has gone in the opposite direction. After selling off its legacy business units, the company doubled down on BTC mining and has already mined over $100 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months. A Gateway for Global Participation Tether’s MOS rollout could be particularly impactful for miners in emerging markets, where access to proprietary mining software is limited and cost-prohibitive. Open-source tools could help bootstrap local mining operations in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia — regions where the appetite for Bitcoin is strong but infrastructure is lacking. By lowering the technical and financial barriers to entry, Tether’s new software initiative could empower a new generation of miners, further decentralize the Bitcoin network, and ignite innovation across the mining stack — from hardware optimization to energy efficiency. While the project is slated for Q4 2025, Tether has not yet shared the specific licensing model or development roadmap for the MOS release. Questions also remain about governance, community contributions, and long-term support for the project. If successful, this open-source experiment could help balance the scales between large-scale miners and decentralized participants, injecting new vitality into the heart of Bitcoin’s decentralized promise. Tether Stablecoin Spotted in Bolivian Airport Store Amid Economic Crisis Meanwhile, in a vivid sign of the changing global monetary landscape, Tether’s USDT stablecoin appears to be gaining an unlikely foothold in South America — particularly in Bolivia, where the national currency is rapidly losing credibility. Over the weekend, Ardoino shared a series of photos showing items priced directly in USDT at a Bolivian airport store, highlighting the growing unofficial use of crypto as a medium of exchange in a country reeling from economic instability. A New Normal in Airport Retail The photos, posted to Ardoino’s official X account, were taken at Duty Fly, a duty-free shop inside a Bolivian airport. The images show various consumer goods, including sunglasses and candy, with price tags denominated in Tether’s USDT — a US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Most notably, one image displayed a formal notice to customers. The sign clarified that customers could still pay in either Bolivianos (the local fiat currency) or US dollars, but the pricing benchmark was set in Tether. According to the shop, USDT’s value was being used to establish a functional exchange rate between the local currency and the dollar — effectively turning USDT into a proxy for currency conversion amid a rapidly eroding official rate. While neither Tether nor Duty Fly responded to inquiries from media, the post immediately sparked conversation across crypto and economic circles. With one USDT equivalent to one US dollar, many observers saw the moment as both symbolic and practical — a sign that Bolivians are increasingly seeking alternatives to a failing monetary system. This is not the first sign of USDT’s growing presence in Bolivia. Back in October 2024, one of Bolivia’s largest banks, Banco Bisa, began offering custody and transaction services for USDT, allowing its clients to buy, sell, and transfer the stablecoin. The move was widely seen as a significant step in legitimizing crypto’s presence in the country, especially amid the broader Latin American trend of crypto adoption as a hedge against currency instability. More recently, reports have emerged suggesting that Bolivia is considering using cryptocurrencies like USDT to pay for cross-border energy imports — a stark reversal from its historical hardline stance against digital assets. In 2020, the Bolivian government banned all use of cryptocurrencies, but the worsening economic picture appears to have forced a reevaluation of that position. A Nation in Economic Freefall The reasons for crypto’s rise in Bolivia are not hard to understand. Once hailed for its economic stability in the early 2010s, the country is now suffering from one of the most severe macroeconomic crises in Latin America. Bolivia’s usable foreign reserves have plunged from $15 billion in 2014 to just $1.98 billion by December 2024. Alarmingly, less than $50 million of that is in liquid cash, with the rest held in gold — a reflection of how tight the government's access to actual dollars has become. The result has been a thriving black market for US currency, with exchange rates on the street soaring to nearly 10 Bolivianos per dollar, far above the official rate of around 7. USD/BOB exchange rate chart (Source: Google Finance ) At the same time, Bolivia faces massive energy import costs, spending an estimated $56 million each week on diesel and gasoline imports. Despite these outlays, the country still struggles with fuel shortages. Inflation has also skyrocketed, with the Consumer Price Index hitting 14.6% in March 2025. Ardoino’s photo of a pack of Oreos priced at between 15 and 22 USDT is a particularly stark image — not just of crypto adoption, but of the collapse of consumer purchasing power. That’s roughly $15–22 for a basic grocery item, a price point that would be inconceivable in most developed economies, even accounting for duty-free inflation. Global Symbolism, Local Realities While Tether remains a controversial player in global finance, often scrutinized for its reserve practices, its growing real-world utility in countries like Bolivia is becoming harder to ignore. As a dollar-pegged digital currency that can be accessed via mobile apps and peer-to-peer exchanges, USDT offers a practical workaround for citizens in countries with unstable banking systems, hyperinflation, or currency shortages. For now, it remains unclear just how widespread USDT adoption is in Bolivia beyond isolated cases like Duty Fly. But if current trends continue, the stablecoin’s visibility could move from retail novelty to monetary necessity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MINING|TECHNOLOGY|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-10 12:08:02

Communication barriers can slow things down, but imagine a world where language is no longer an obstacle in your daily digital interactions. That future is getting closer, as Apple recently unveiled a significant advancement at its annual developer conference. Introducing Apple Live Translation at WWDC 25 At the much-anticipated WWDC 25 event, Apple pulled back the curtain on a groundbreaking new feature: Apple Live Translation . This capability is set to revolutionize how users communicate across different languages directly within Apple’s core applications. It promises real-time translation for conversations, making it easier than ever to connect with people worldwide without needing third-party apps or manual copying and pasting. Powered by Apple Intelligence: The Brain Behind the Translation The power source for this impressive feature is Apple’s newly emphasized Apple Intelligence . This underlying AI technology enables Live Translation to perform complex tasks like understanding and converting spoken and written language on the fly. A key aspect highlighted by Leslie Ikemoto, Apple’s director of input experience, during the WWDC presentation was that these capabilities are driven by “Apple Built models that run entirely on your device.” The reliance on on-device processing is a significant point of interest, especially for users concerned about privacy. It means that your personal conversations are processed locally on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, rather than being sent to cloud servers for translation. This approach aligns with Apple’s strong stance on user privacy, ensuring that sensitive communications remain personal and secure. Exploring the AI Translation Features Across Apple Apps Apple Live Translation is integrated seamlessly into the apps people use daily for communication: Messages: When texting someone in a different language, Live Translation can automatically translate the text you type before you send it, displaying it in the recipient’s language. Similarly, incoming messages are instantly translated into your preferred language, appearing alongside the original text for clarity. FaceTime: For video calls, the feature provides live captions, translating the spoken conversation into text subtitles in real time. This is incredibly useful for understanding participants speaking different languages during a call. Phone Calls: This feature extends to standard phone calls, whether the other person is using an Apple device or not. As you speak, your words can be translated and spoken aloud to the call recipient in their language. Conversely, when they respond in their language, you will hear a spoken translation of their voice, facilitating a natural, back-and-forth conversation. Developer Opportunities Announced at WWDC 25 Beyond the consumer-facing features, Apple also announced that developers will have access to a new API. This allows third-party communication apps to integrate live translation capabilities into their own platforms. This opens up exciting possibilities for developers to build more inclusive and globally accessible applications, leveraging the same powerful AI translation features Apple uses in its native apps. While the announcement at WWDC 25 was comprehensive in detailing the feature’s functionality and privacy benefits, Apple did not specify the exact number of languages that will be supported at launch. This is a detail users and developers will be eager to learn as the feature rolls out. The Significance of On-Device Translation The choice to power Live Translation with On-device translation models is more than just a technical detail; it’s a fundamental design principle that impacts user experience and trust. Processing translations locally ensures faster performance, as data doesn’t need to travel to and from the cloud. More importantly, it provides a strong privacy guarantee, assuring users that the content of their private conversations is not being analyzed or stored on remote servers for translation purposes. This approach differentiates Apple’s offering and may set a new standard for how sensitive AI features are implemented in consumer technology. Key Takeaways from the Apple Live Translation Announcement: Real-Time Communication: Enables instant translation across text and voice calls. Cross-App Integration: Works within Messages, FaceTime, and Phone. Privacy-Focused: Powered by On-device translation using Apple Built models. Developer API: Allows third-party apps to integrate the feature. Future Potential: Breaks down language barriers for global communication. Apple Live Translation represents a significant step forward in making communication more accessible and global. By integrating real-time AI translation features directly into its core apps and powering them with private, On-device translation via Apple Intelligence , Apple is addressing a fundamental user need while upholding its privacy principles. The announcement at WWDC 25 signals Apple’s commitment to leveraging AI to enhance user experience in meaningful and secure ways, potentially setting a new benchmark for communication technology.

Bitfinex Analysts Respond, Reveal Three Critical Levels to Watch!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-bitcoins-new-ath-near-bitfinex-analysts-respond-reveal-three-critical-levels-to-watch/,"Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) fell to the $100,000 level just a week ago amid tensions between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. However, BTC experienced a rapid recovery and rose above $110,000 after the second round of talks between the US and China. Bitcoin is also close to its previous ATH of around $111,900, and Bitfinex analysts said that the chances of Bitcoin reaching the new ATH are low. Bitfinex analysts said in a recent report that there is little fundamental support for a new ATH. Analysts stated that a strong technical bullish catalyst is needed for the new ATH and said: “Although Bitcoin is rising, the risk of a short-term correction continues to increase. Especially in the absence of a strong catalyst that would propel Bitcoin above its current all-time high. Without a strong macro or structural bullish catalyst, Bitcoin is vulnerable to short-term corrections, especially as long-term holders look to strengthen.” Bitfinex analysts, who think that there is a short-term correction risk for Bitcoin, also drew attention to the critical levels where the BTC price can find support. At this point, analysts determined the main support levels that BTC should follow as follows: “$103,700 (Spent Supply Allocation – SSD 0.95 quantile first support zone) $97,100 (Short-Term Traders' (STH) Cost Floor) $95,600 (Spent Supply Allocation – SSD 0.85 quantile first support zone)” Bitfinex concluded by stating that Bitcoin is currently at a crossroads, balancing between structural support and waning bullish momentum, and awaiting macro signals for the next strong rally. *This is not investment advice.

The MicroStrategy executive chairman weighed in after CNBC’s Jim Cramer criticized Apple’s aggressive repurchase program, saying it “isn’t working” as intended. Saylor’s response was concise and direct: “Buy Bitcoin instead.” The comment comes at a moment when Bitcoin is outperforming legacy assets, and major corporations are quietly adjusting their own treasury strategies. Apple should buy Bitcoin. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 10, 2025 A Widening Performance Gap So far in 2025, Apple shares are down 17%. In the same timeframe, Bitcoin is up 17%. Over a five-year horizon, the divergence is even more stark: Bitcoin has risen over 1,000%, while Apple has gained 137%. For a company known for disciplined capital management, the numbers raise questions. Apple’s buybacks have long been seen as a tool to boost earnings per share and signal strength to investors. But with diminishing returns and a declining stock price, critics argue the strategy is delivering limited shareholder value. Saylor’s proposition reframes the conversation: if Apple seeks long-term value appreciation, Bitcoin may offer stronger risk-adjusted upside than continued buybacks. Corporate Bitcoin Allocations Are Accelerating The timing of Saylor’s suggestion is significant. Recent weeks have seen a notable uptick in Bitcoin adoption at the corporate level. GameStop disclosed the purchase of 4,710 BTC, worth approximately $513 million, following a successful capital raise. Japan’s Metaplanet announced plans to acquire more Bitcoin using 5.4 billion yen in newly raised capital, which pushed its stock up 12% and positioned it as the eighth-largest public holder of BTC. In France, The Blockchain Group revealed it had acquired $68 million worth of Bitcoin, with additional plans to raise $345 million for future purchases. On the institutional front, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $386 million in net inflows on June 9, rebounding after recent outflows. Together, these moves signal growing alignment across geographies and industries: Bitcoin is increasingly being treated not just as an asset, but as a strategic reserve. So, Will Apple Dive Into the Crypto World? For Apple, the calculus is complex. Unlike MicroStrategy, it has not positioned itself as a Bitcoin-forward entity. The company is risk-averse by design and conservative in its financial operations. Still, Saylor’s suggestion points to a broader shift. As more corporates integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets, pressure mounts on market leaders to explain why they’re holding back.

Analysts at the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex say the asset is awaiting its next macroeconomic cue while maintaining a balance between structural support and waning bullish momentum. The coming days will determine if BTC is entering a broader consolidation phase or if the rally will resume. This largely depends on how bitcoin’s price interacts with certain thresholds marked by on-chain pricing models. Bitcoin at a Crossroads Last week, BTC experienced an intense correction fueled by a public dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire businessman Elon Musk. Their feud triggered high volatility that exacerbated market uncertainty. On June 5, BTC fell to a local low of $100,420, triggering $900 million in long liquidations across the crypto market. This marked the largest single-day liquidation since April. In eight days, total long liquidations surged to more than $1.9 billion, creating an aggressive shakeout that helped clear excessive leverage from the system. The wave of aggressive deleveraging reset positioning and potentially paved the way for more stable price action in the coming weeks. However, with long-term BTC holders still distributing their assets and realizing profits , analysts believe the risk of short-term correction will continue to grow. This risk is intensified by the absence of a strong catalyst to push BTC above its current ATH. Key BTC Support Zones Since bullish momentum is still stalling, Bitfinex has used on-chain pricing models to identify potential support areas in the event of further correction. The $114,800 (upper bound), $97,100 (mean), and $83,200 (lower bound) levels show the range of short-term sentiment. Analysts believe BTC will consolidate if its price remains sustained within this range, while a breakout will determine the asset’s direction. If BTC rallies above $114,800, then there would likely be a renewed momentum-driven leg higher, which will be supported by spot demand. A decline below $97,100, particularly below $95,600, would signal cooling sentiment and a possible fall to $83,000. Meanwhile, on-chain data has highlighted the $103,700, $97,000, and $83,000 levels as key support zones in the coming days. “How the price interacts with these thresholds in coming days will offer a high-signal view on whether the rally resumes—or if weʼre entering a broader consolidation phase,” Bitfinex stated.

Notably, the presentation highlighted its potential alignment with two leading crypto assets, Ripple’s XRP and Stellar’s XLM. The finding, shared by crypto researcher SMQKE on X, has stirred excitement across the digital asset space. Visa’s Vision for Digital Fiat Currency The patent in question, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2020/0151682 A1 was filed by Visa International Service Association and published on May 14, 2020. Titled “Digital Fiat Currency,” the application details a system in which central banks could digitize physical cash into a blockchain-compatible format. The technology envisions removing banknotes from circulation and issuing digital equivalents onto a distributed ledger. Remember, Harvard cited VISA’s Digital FIAT Currency Settlement patent as an example of a blockchain based system that utilizes XRP and XLM. XRP + XLM VISA See for yourself: Harvard Presentation: https://t.co/IdZj4hST2H VISA Patent: https://t.co/H40g7irk80 pic.twitter.com/u9D6UPPoXu — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 9, 2025 According to the filing, the system would include a central authority, a blockchain ledger, validating entities, and transaction-processing middleware. The core objective is to preserve fiat currency’s legal status while enhancing its usability with blockchain’s speed, transparency, and security. This kind of model reflects the growing interest among central banks and payment giants in digital currency systems. XRP and XLM: Underpinning the Framework? What elevates this development is Harvard’s inclusion of XRP and XLM as possible settlement mechanisms within such a system. Both networks are known for fast, low-cost international transfers and are built to support fiat-backed tokens—qualities that align closely with the digital fiat model outlined by Visa. Ripple’s XRP Ledger offers a near-instant settlement, a decentralized exchange, and a history of enterprise-grade integrations. Stellar’s XLM, meanwhile, is geared toward inclusion and remittance use cases, providing efficient cross-border transfer solutions for both institutions and individuals. These attributes position both networks as practical infrastructure layers for Visa’s patented system. While the patent does not name XRP or XLM explicitly, the Harvard reference, as cited by SMQKE, strongly suggests that these networks are viewed as viable examples of blockchain systems that could support Visa’s model. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Academic Recognition Signals Institutional Confidence The Harvard presentation marks more than academic curiosity, it represents institutional validation. By showcasing Visa’s blockchain-based fiat system alongside XRP and XLM, the presentation highlights the increasing legitimacy of crypto assets in high-level financial discourse. This recognition is significant. For years, XRP and XLM were seen primarily as speculative assets. Now, they are gaining attention as foundational tools for the future of global finance. The citation suggests that academia sees real-world applications for these assets within regulated, mainstream frameworks. Implications for Crypto’s Role in Finance SMQKE’s discovery has sparked renewed optimism among supporters of XRP and XLM, particularly amid Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While that case has drawn regulatory scrutiny, developments like this one show that the technology itself continues to gain traction in academic and enterprise circles. For Visa, the patented system could be a stepping stone toward digital currency integration that bridges legacy finance and blockchain. If platforms like XRP or XLM are eventually implemented within Visa’s infrastructure, it would mark a historic fusion of traditional and decentralized finance.

Speaking at the SEC’s final Crypto Task Force Roundtable titled “DeFi and the American Spirit,” Atkins implied a more open stance, marking a clear break from the agency’s previous hostile approach. SEC Chair Paul Atkins says the right to self custody crypto ""is a foundational American value."" pic.twitter.com/XLPOUwOWud — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) June 9, 2025 Crypto’s Tide Turning? “The right to have self-custody of one’s private property is a foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet,” Atkins said. “I am in favor of affording greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially where intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities,” he added. Atkins also said that the previous administration hurt crypto innovation, especially for self-custodial wallets. They treated the people making the software like financial brokers, which stopped new tech from evolving. Old case sparks new questions- The X users strongly backed the idea and noted that the tide is now turning in favor of crypto. On the other side, this change in tone has reignited a debate around past regulatory actions, especially Ripple’s long-running battle with the SEC over XRP. One of the users questioned, “What about the right of Ripple to be free of the SEC’s unethical hold on its company in a timely manner?”. In response, former SEC official Marc Fagel clarified that Ripple is not being unfairly targeted. He says they broke the law with an illegal securities offering, which resulted in a $125 million penalty and an order to prevent future violations. He added further that if Ripple wants to challenge these outcomes, it would need to go back to court. Is The SEC Evolving? This came as a pushback to those who believe that Ripple is still being unfairly restricted despite the SEC’s evolving stance. The SEC vs. Ripple case is not yet fully concluded, but it is very close. June 16 is the deadline for the SEC to file a status report to the Second Circuit on the settlement’s progress. All eyes are now on Judge Torres and the Second Circuit. Once the court grants approval to remand the case, the final judgment can be issued, lifting the injunction and formally ending the case. Atkins’ comments come at a time when Congress debates crypto bills, with some potentially restricting self-custody. The SEC Chair’s strong stance on personal crypto wallets could make it harder for lawmakers to completely ban them. “We should not automatically fear the future,” he said.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 12:18:40

And now, it’s changing how we game. Enter play-to-meme culture: a wild mashup of memes, games, and crypto. At the center of this new movement is Pepe Hunt at pepehunt.com , a game powered by the internet’s favorite frog: Pepe. So, What’s Play-to-Meme Anyway? Play-to-meme is what happens when internet humor meets interactive gaming—usually with a blockchain twist. It’s not just about playing to win or pass time. You’re here to create, share, and laugh at memes —and maybe earn some digital cash along the way. It’s the natural next step in meme culture. Remember Dawkins’ idea of memes as ideas that spread and evolve? On the internet, memes have become identity, humor, and even protest . Now they’re becoming the core of how we play online. From Comic Book Frog to Meme Icon Pepe the Frog made his debut back in 2005 in Matt Furie’s indie comic Boy’s Club . He was just a chill frog who said, “feels good, man.” But that chill frog blew up online. Thanks to sites like 4chan, Reddit, and Twitter, Pepe became a blank canvas for every kind of emotion—smug, sad, mad, you name it. Yeah, he went through some rough patches—used in ways Furie never intended—but the internet helped bring him back. Now, he’s once again a symbol of creativity, absurdity, and internet weirdness . Meme Coins and the Leap to Pepe Hunt Fast forward to April 2023: the PEPE token drops on Ethereum. No presale. No taxes. No roadmap. Just vibes. It went full meme mode and exploded—hitting a billion-dollar market cap in no time. That success inspired a wave of frog-themed projects. But Pepe Hunt took it to the next level. Instead of just trading tokens, you play games and go on meme-fueled quests , earning digital rewards and joining a wild, community-run economy. It’s addictive, weird, and kind of genius. Why Pepe Is the Perfect Meme Mascot Pepe works for one big reason: everyone knows him . He’s been around for almost 20 years, he’s insanely expressive, and he fits every mood. Happy Pepe. Angry Pepe. Existential dread Pepe. You get the idea. Plus, frogs are just funny. And there’s something nostalgic about seeing him back in action—especially if you grew up on early meme culture. That emotional connection makes people want to be part of the ride. Pepe Hunt: The Next for Play-to-Meme? Games like Pepe Hunt are just the beginning. As crypto gets easier to use and online communities get smarter, play-to-meme might become a whole new way of living online . Not just playing or investing—but doing both at once while making stuff that spreads. Memes are no longer just jokes. They’re social currency, community badges, and even investment tools . Pepe the Frog—who started off just saying “feels good, man”—is now the face of a cultural movement that’s part game, part economy, and totally internet-native. Final Thoughts Pepe Hunt is more than a meme game—it’s a snapshot of where internet culture is heading . By mixing gameplay, meme creation, and real rewards, it’s reshaping how we connect, create, and earn online. As the lines between gaming, social media, and investing keep blurring, one thing’s clear: the age of play-to-meme is here—and it’s only getting weirder (and funnier) from here.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 12:19:04

The message claimed that Bitcoin would be introduced as legal tender in the country. However, the excitement was short-lived as the Paraguayan government quickly issued a statement reporting unusual activity associated with the President’s X account . This swift denial has led many to suspect the original post was false, potentially the result of an X account hack . What Happened with the Paraguay Bitcoin Post? The sequence of events unfolded rapidly. A post appeared on President Santiago Peña’s official X (formerly Twitter) account making a significant assertion: that Bitcoin was set to become legal tender in Paraguay. This kind of announcement carries immense weight, as it would place Paraguay alongside El Salvador as one of the few nations to adopt the cryptocurrency in such a capacity. However, within a short time, the Paraguayan government, through official channels separate from the President’s X account, communicated that they had detected unusual activity on that specific social media profile. They did not explicitly state it was a hack at first but strongly implied that the post regarding Bitcoin was not legitimate and did not originate from the President or his administration’s official policy decisions. This incident highlights the vulnerability of high-profile social media accounts and the potential for misinformation to spread rapidly, especially concerning sensitive topics like national economic policy and cryptocurrencies. Why is Bitcoin Legal Tender News So Significant? The concept of a nation adopting Bitcoin legal tender is a major development in the world of finance and cryptocurrency. When a cryptocurrency is granted legal tender status, it means it must be accepted as a form of payment for goods and services throughout the country, alongside the national fiat currency. This provides significant legitimacy and potential for widespread adoption within that nation. El Salvador’s decision in 2021 to make Bitcoin legal tender was a landmark event, watched closely by governments and financial institutions globally. While it faced significant challenges and mixed results, it opened the door for other nations to consider similar paths. For Paraguay, specifically, there has been previous interest and legislative proposals surrounding cryptocurrency regulation, particularly concerning Bitcoin mining due to the country’s abundant hydroelectric power. However, these discussions have typically revolved around regulating crypto assets and mining operations, not elevating Bitcoin to the status of legal tender. Therefore, an official announcement of legal tender status would represent a dramatic shift in policy, which is why the now-discredited post caused such a stir. The Impact on Crypto News and Markets False or misleading information, especially when it appears to come from official government sources, can have an immediate and sometimes volatile impact on the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin’s price is highly sensitive to news regarding adoption, regulation, and macroeconomic factors. When the post about Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender first appeared, it likely generated positive sentiment among some investors, potentially leading to a temporary price uptick or increased trading volume as people reacted to the news. However, the subsequent denial by the government would likely reverse this effect, potentially causing price drops as traders and investors adjust to the confirmed misinformation. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of verifying crypto news from multiple, reliable sources before making investment decisions. The speed at which information (and misinformation) travels on social media platforms like X necessitates caution and due diligence. Understanding the Risk of a President’s X Account Hack The possibility that President Santiago Peña ‘s X account was compromised raises serious security concerns. Leaders of nations often have their social media accounts managed by staff, but the accounts themselves are prime targets for malicious actors, including hackers motivated by political reasons, financial gain (through market manipulation), or simply disruption. An X account hack of a world leader can be used for various harmful purposes: Spreading Disinformation: Posting false news, as seen in this case, to manipulate public opinion or financial markets. Political Manipulation: Posting inflammatory or false statements about other nations or political opponents. Phishing/Malware Distribution: Using the trusted account to spread malicious links. Damaging Reputation: Posting inappropriate content. The fact that the post concerned something as economically sensitive as Bitcoin legal tender underscores the potential financial impact of such a security breach. Governments and high-profile individuals must employ robust security measures, including two-factor authentication, strong password policies, and careful management protocols, to protect these crucial communication channels. Verifying Information: A Key Actionable Insight For anyone following crypto news , especially news that could significantly impact market prices or regulatory landscapes, verification is paramount. Do not rely solely on a single social media post, even if it appears to come from a seemingly official source. Always look for confirmation from: Official government websites or press releases. Reputable national and international news agencies (like Reuters, which reported the government’s statement in this case). Multiple trusted financial news outlets. In the case of the Paraguay Bitcoin post, the quick denial from the government through other channels was the crucial piece of information that debunked the social media claim. Investors and enthusiasts should develop habits of cross-referencing information before making any decisions based on breaking news. What Does This Mean for Paraguay’s Stance on Crypto? While this incident involved a false alarm about Bitcoin legal tender , it doesn’t necessarily mean Paraguay is against cryptocurrencies. As mentioned, there have been legislative efforts to regulate the crypto space, particularly mining. This event is more likely a reflection of social media security risks than a definitive statement on Paraguay’s future crypto policy. President Santiago Peña ‘s administration will likely need to address the security lapse that allowed the false post to occur. The incident might even prompt further discussions within the government about how to officially communicate on digital assets and ensure the security of their online presence. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale in the Digital Age The brief saga of the false Paraguay Bitcoin legal tender post is a potent reminder of the challenges in the age of instant digital communication. While platforms like X offer direct access to public figures, they also present vulnerabilities that can be exploited to spread misinformation with real-world consequences for markets and public perception. The quick response from the Paraguayan government to clarify the situation was crucial in mitigating potential confusion and market volatility. This event underscores the need for robust social media security for public officials and reinforces the critical importance for the public and market participants to exercise caution and verify sensitive information through official, secure channels before reacting.

The hearing comes amid Trump’s pledge to become the “crypto president” , reshaping U.S. digital asset oversight. Why Brian Quintenz Is Under the Spotlight Lawmakers focused on Quintenz’s connections to a16z crypto , the blockchain-focused division of venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz. After leaving his role as CFTC Commissioner in 2021, Quintenz joined a16z as Head of Crypto Policy. He also served on the Board of KalshiEX , a prediction market exchange, raising further concerns about potential conflicts of interest. During the hearing, senators pressed Quintenz about his equity in KalshiEX. In response, he pledged to divest his shares if confirmed to lead the CFTC. Quintenz defended his crypto experience, stating it provided “invaluable insights” into the emerging sector. “Congress should create an appropriate market regulatory regime to ensure that this technology’s full promise can be realized,” Quintenz said. “I am fully prepared to use my experience and expertise to assist in that effort.” Quintenz Backs Clear Rules for Crypto Markets In a critical moment during the hearing, Quintenz underscored the urgent need for regulatory clarity in blockchain and digital assets . He argued that well-structured rules could help individuals truly own their digital intellectual property . His remarks align with Trump’s broader agenda to revamp U.S. crypto oversight. The Trump campaign has increasingly embraced crypto innovation, with reports of his family launching a crypto enterprise of their own. What’s Next for U.S. Crypto Regulation? Under Trump’s proposed framework, the CFTC would gain expanded authority to regulate digital assets, marking a significant shift from the SEC’s current dominance. The CFTC itself recently acknowledged that existing rules are inadequate for today’s crypto environment and emphasized that most cryptocurrencies should be treated as commodities —not securities. As the political landscape shifts, the outcome of Quintenz’s nomination could shape how the U.S. governs digital finance in the years ahead.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 12:26:03

With growing institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and bullish social sentiment, some now believe a run toward $3,500 is within reach. Momentum Meets a Wall At the time of this writing, ETH was trading at around $2,775, marking a 9.1% gain in the last 24 hours and a more modest 6.2% increase over the past seven days, per data from CoinGecko. While the asset slightly underperformed the broader crypto market’s 3.3% weekly growth, its recent rally comes on the back of a strong regulatory tailwind. On June 9, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins declared staking and wallet software development outside the scope of securities laws, signaling a dramatic shift in the agency’s stance on decentralized finance (DeFi). Yet despite the bullish news, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap remains range-bound between $2,475 and $2,775. “The price has swept the highs and the lows… and has retested the range high for the 4th time now,” noted Daan Crypto Trades on X, advising patience until a decisive move occurs. Market watcher Michaël van de Poppe echoed the sentiment, suggesting that a breakout past $2,800 could ignite a surge toward the $3,400 to $3,500 level, provided ETH holds above the critical $2,575 support zone. Caution Amidst the Optimism But not everyone is convinced the good times are coming just yet. Analyst Čyrus Ologun cautioned that ETH remains in a downtrend unless it closes decisively above the aforementioned $2,800, predicting a possible pullback to $2,200. His hypothesis aligns with CryptoPotato’s latest technical analysis , which flagged a bearish rising wedge pattern and growing selling pressure, as reflected in the declining 30-day Taker Buy-Sell Ratio. Nonetheless, the fundamentals are improving. As angel investor Momin Saqib highlighted not long ago, Ethereum is enjoying “7 straight weeks of net inflows,” with over $815 million going into ETH ETFs in just 20 days, and a record 34.6 million ETH staked, which is roughly 28% of the total supply. Moreover, the SEC’s remarks have galvanized institutional conviction, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity reportedly increasing ETH exposure. While the asset’s all-time high of $4,878 remains a distant 45% away, the journey back toward that position could be kick-started by the convergence of regulatory clarity, institutional momentum, and increasing on-chain activity, with more than 16 million active addresses recorded so far this week. As pseudonymous trader Master of Crypto put it: “This isn’t just a price pump… People are actually using ETH.” For now, the consensus seems to be that $2,800 is the line in the sand. A break above could open the floodgates to $3,000 and beyond.

Why? Because events impacting the global economy can significantly influence market sentiment and asset prices, including digital currencies. Recent news from London regarding US-China trade discussions falls squarely into this category. US-China Trade Talks: A Glimpse into Diplomatic Progress According to the Walter Bloomberg economic news account via X, the US-China trade talks held recently in London were described as “fruitful” by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. While the specific details of the discussions remain under wraps for now, this positive descriptor offers a potential signal of progress in navigating the complex economic relationship between the world’s two largest economies. Here’s a quick rundown of the reported details: Location: London Participants: Representatives from the U.S. and China, including reported comments from U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick. Duration: Approximately six hours for the recent session. Outcome Description: Characterized as “fruitful.” Next Steps: Talks are scheduled to resume on June 10 at 10 a.m. These high-level trade talks are crucial because the economic ties between the United States and China are deeply intertwined, affecting everything from supply chains and manufacturing to technology and financial markets globally. Any signs of de-escalation or constructive dialogue are generally viewed positively by market participants seeking stability. Why Do These Economic Relations Matter for Crypto? You might be wondering, how does a meeting about international economic relations in London relate to your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings? The connection, while not direct, is significant. The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized nature, does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly influenced by global liquidity, investor risk appetite, and the overall health of the traditional financial system. Think of it this way: Market Sentiment: Positive developments in major geopolitical or economic spheres, like improved US-China trade relations, can boost overall market confidence. This can lead to increased appetite for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, tensions can cause uncertainty and drive investors towards perceived safer havens. Global Liquidity: Trade and economic policies between major powers impact global capital flows. Stable and growing economic relations can support global economic growth, potentially increasing the pool of capital available for investment across various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Trade dynamics can influence inflation rates and, consequently, central bank monetary policies. These policies (like interest rate changes) have a profound impact on market liquidity and investor behavior, directly affecting crypto valuations. Technological Competition: Discussions often touch upon technology, which is intrinsically linked to blockchain and digital innovation. While not explicitly about crypto regulation, these talks set the stage for future international cooperation or competition in digital economies. Therefore, monitoring key geopolitical and economic indicators, such as the outcome of these trade talks , provides valuable context for understanding broader market movements that can affect your crypto portfolio. Challenges and Opportunities in US-China Economic Relations While the term “fruitful” is encouraging, it’s important to acknowledge that significant challenges remain in US-China trade relations. Issues such as trade imbalances, intellectual property rights, technology restrictions, and market access have been points of contention for years. Challenges: Deep-seated structural economic differences. Ongoing technology competition and restrictions (e.g., semiconductors). Trust deficits built over past disputes. Potential for sudden shifts in diplomatic tone. Opportunities presented by ‘Fruitful’ Talks: Reduced uncertainty for businesses and investors. Potential for collaboration on shared global issues (climate change, pandemics). Smoother supply chains, potentially easing inflationary pressures. Improved environment for international investment. For the crypto market impact , reduced global economic uncertainty generally translates to a more stable or positive environment for risk assets. Conversely, a breakdown in talks or renewed tensions could trigger risk-off sentiment, potentially leading to sell-offs in crypto alongside traditional markets. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the influence of these high-level trade talks on the global economy and, by extension, the crypto market, what should a crypto investor do? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay attention to major geopolitical and macroeconomic news, not just crypto-specific headlines. Understand how events like these trade talks can serve as macro indicators. Contextualize Market Movements: If the crypto market sees significant volatility, consider if major global economic or political events could be contributing factors alongside crypto-native news. Assess Risk Appetite: Developments in economic relations between major powers often signal shifts in global risk appetite. A positive shift might favor growth assets like crypto, while negative news could indicate a move towards safer assets. Diversify (Wisely): While crypto is a specific asset class, understanding its correlation with broader markets during different economic climates is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket based solely on crypto news; consider the wider economic backdrop. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term market reactions to news events can be sharp, the long-term trajectory of crypto is driven by its underlying technology and adoption. Use macro news for context, but maintain a long-term perspective on your core investment thesis. The fact that talks are resuming indicates an ongoing process. The outcome of future sessions will continue to be relevant for understanding the global economic climate and its potential flow-through effects on financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Interconnected Global Economy The report of “fruitful” US-China trade talks in London, as noted by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, is a positive signal in the complex landscape of international economic relations . While not directly about Bitcoin or blockchain, these discussions are a vital part of the global economy that ultimately influences market sentiment, liquidity, and investor behavior – all factors that contribute to the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Keeping an eye on these high-level trade talks provides crucial context for any crypto investor looking to understand the broader forces at play beyond the immediate crypto ecosystem. The interconnectedness of global finance means that progress, or lack thereof, in diplomatic and economic dialogues between major powers will continue to have a tangible crypto market impact .

45757226,https://finbold.com/?p=246816,1749561674,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,South Africa’s top crypto exchange VALR goes global with MoonPay’s on-ramps,https://finbold.com/south-africas-top-crypto-exchange-valr-goes-global-with-moonpays-on-ramps/,"South Africa’s top cryptocurrency exchange, VALR , is flexing its muscles on the global stage with the integration of MoonPay’s fiat on and off-ramps, making it easier than ever for people to buy and sell crypto in more than 180 countries. The partnership is a big deal for VALR, expanding its support for fiat currencies from just one – the South African rand – to an incredible 34, including both the big ones like U.S. dollars and euros, and also tons of more obscure ones, such as the Kenyan shilling, Nigerian naira, Turkish lira, Brazilian real and Indonesian rupiah. By adding support for more currencies, it’s clear that VALR is looking to tap into a sizable global audience, far beyond its existing user base, which is primarily African crypto traders. Its users will also gain tons of options in terms of payment methods, with MoonPay able to facilitate fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions via bank transfers, credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and Venmo. VALR is a familiar name to South African crypto-natives, serving as the country’s most popular and visible exchange platform. It enables users to seamlessly trade dozens of cryptocurrencies, with basic spot , futures , and margin trading , plus decentralized finance capabilities such as lending and staking, enabling users to earn passive income through their digital asset holdings. It also provides a way for customers to spend their crypto in the real-world through its VALR Pay service, and features an OTC trading portal for crypto whales and institutional users who need to make large volume trades. Besides its advanced functionality, VALR also offers rock-solid security, with its funds held in a mix of “hot” and “cold” wallets. This allows it to keep just enough funds ready to support trading activities while storing the bulk of users’ assets offline on physical hardware devices that are geographically dispersed and stored in high-security vaults with 24/7 live video monitoring to protect against theft. The hot wallets make use of multi-sig technology to prevent unauthorized access to the exchange’s funds. Users can also implement two-factor authentication to protect their own accounts. With its intuitive user interface and flat 0.75% fee on all trades, VALR provides a simple and affordable trading experience that’s as ideal for new crypto users as it is for more experienced traders. It has come to dominate South Africa’s crypto scene, amassing more than 1.3 million users, but today’s update shows that it now has much bigger ambitions. MoonPay, as one of the industry’s biggest and most trustworthy on-ramp providers, can help VALR to target a much wider, global audience, helping it to compete against some of the biggest exchanges in the business, such as Binance and Coinbase. VALR co-founder and Chief Executive Farzam Ehsani was keen to stress the importance of the integration, saying it will make the exchange more accessible to users worldwide. “This integration empowers our global community with efficient access to cryptocurrencies, aligning with VALR’s vision of building a financial system that reflects the oneness of humanity,” he stated.

Emerging layer-1s are also racing to scale. Regulatory hurdles remain if governments restrict crypto usage or impose new rules around decentralized applications. Increased scrutiny could dampen growth. Market volatility is inevitable, as seen from past crypto winters.

Traders rushed back in after the asset dipped close to $100,000, feeding a sharp rebound that leaves Bitcoin just 2.8% shy of its record high. A blend of forced liquidations, surging derivatives volume, easing US–China trade tensions and steady on-chain withdrawals is driving the move. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Heavy Liquidations Shift The Balance According to Coinglass, nearly $203 million in Bitcoin positions were wiped out over the past 24 hours. Of that, $195 million were against shorts. When so many short bets unwind at once, it forces buyers to cover positions, which can send prices spiking. Yet history shows these “short squeezes” can reverse quickly when traders take profits. Based on reports, Bitcoin’s derivatives volume more than doubled, climbing over 110% to $110 billion. Open interest then followed suit, expanding 7.3% to almost $77 billion. These kinds of inflows indicate that new money is accumulating. Both open interest and volume rising tends to indicate enthusiasm—and a willingness to carry through positions with swings. Trade Diplomacy Lifts Risk Assets Talks resumed in London on June 9 between the US and China over tariffs and export rules. Even a hint of progress tends to boost appetite for riskier assets, and Bitcoin isn’t immune. Headlines of smoother trade ties lifted equities earlier this week—and crypto traders moved in tandem. If negotiations hit a snag, though, Bitcoin could slide with global markets. On-Chain Data Shows Steady Accumulation CryptoQuant’s numbers reveal that centralized exchanges have shed 550,000 BTC since July 2024, falling from 1.55 million to about 1.01 million today. As coins leave exchanges, float tightens. At the same time, the Coinbase Premium indicator rose, with US buyers paying more than overseas investors. Santiment also reports renewed accumulation among wallets holding 10–100 BTC. This pattern hints at long-term holding rather than quick trades. Related Reading: Ignore The Trump–Musk Noise: Bitcoin’s Backbone Stays Solid Correlation And Caution Remain When you consider the rally, Bitcoin still dances on the tunes of equity price swings. Futures have mixed bets between bulls and bears, showing portrait-wise signs that certainly not everybody is convinced this run is going to hold. High volatility would tend to wash out weak hands at the slightest hint of trouble, any reversal of risk sentiment, or a sudden macro shock would cost the rally dearly. Optimism is building as analysts talk of fresh all-time highs. Some even eye $150,000 by the end of the year if US debt levels climb further. But sustaining a rally of that magnitude will require more than forced liquidations. Traders will watch derivatives flows, on-chain reserves and trade headlines for signs of real, lasting demand before pushing prices much higher.

A significant piece of news recently emerged from OpenAI, the company behind the widely popular ChatGPT. They claim to have reached a remarkable financial benchmark: $10 billion in annual recurring revenue. OpenAI’s Astonishing Revenue Leap This reported figure represents a substantial jump for OpenAI . According to a company spokesperson speaking to CNBC, the current annual recurring revenue stands at around $10 billion . This is a dramatic increase from the approximately $5.5 billion reported just last year. Achieving this milestone comes roughly two and a half years after the public launch of their flagship product, ChatGPT, which rapidly brought Artificial Intelligence into the mainstream consciousness. Driving Forces Behind the AI Revenue Growth So, where is all this AI Revenue coming from? OpenAI’s spokesperson clarified that the $10 billion figure encompasses revenue generated from several key areas: Consumer products (like ChatGPT Plus subscriptions) Business products (such as ChatGPT Enterprise) The company’s API, which allows other developers and businesses to integrate OpenAI’s models into their own applications. The company also boasts an impressive user base supporting this growth, serving more than 500 million weekly active users and catering to 3 million paying business customers . This widespread adoption across both individual users and businesses is clearly a major engine driving the significant increase in AI Revenue . The Impact of ChatGPT’s Popularity There’s no denying that ChatGPT has been a game-changer, not just for OpenAI but for the entire technology sector and public awareness of Artificial Intelligence . Its intuitive interface and broad capabilities captured global attention, leading to unprecedented user growth. The freemium model, coupled with paid tiers like ChatGPT Plus and the enterprise-focused offerings, has successfully converted massive user interest into tangible revenue streams. The ability to leverage ChatGPT for various tasks, from content creation to coding assistance, has made it an indispensable tool for many, solidifying its role as a core revenue driver for OpenAI. OpenAI’s Ambitious Future and Challenges Looking ahead, OpenAI has set its sights even higher, reportedly targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. This ambitious goal highlights the company’s confidence in the continued expansion of the Artificial Intelligence market. However, this rapid growth and future ambition come with significant pressure. OpenAI is known to burn through billions of dollars annually. These massive expenditures are primarily directed towards two critical areas: hiring and retaining top-tier talent in the highly competitive AI field, and securing the immense computing infrastructure necessary to train and run their increasingly complex Artificial Intelligence systems. While the revenue figures are impressive, the company has not publicly disclosed its operating expenses or whether it is currently operating at a profit. What This Means for the Tech Company Landscape OpenAI’s rapid ascent and substantial revenue figures firmly establish it as a leading Tech Company in the AI space. This level of financial success not only validates the massive investment poured into artificial intelligence research and development but also signals the increasing maturity and commercial viability of AI technologies. As a prominent Tech Company , OpenAI’s performance is closely watched by competitors, investors, and the broader market, influencing trends and investment decisions across the technology sector. In summary, OpenAI’s claim of hitting $10 billion in annual revenue marks a significant milestone, demonstrating explosive growth driven by the success of ChatGPT, its business offerings, and API usage. While the company eyes a much larger target for the future, the substantial costs associated with pushing the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence remain a key factor in their financial picture, the details of which are not yet fully public. Nevertheless, this achievement underscores the immense commercial potential currently being realized within the AI industry.

Watch for a decisive move above $2.35, which could unleash strong bullish momentum toward $2.5. Until then, XRP remains range-bound with limited short-term direction. XRP Technical Analysis By Shayanmarkets The Daily Chart Ripple is currently trading within a narrow consolidation zone, caught between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, an indication of minimal volatility and indecision in the market. Following a dip below both MAs, XRP found solid buying support near the $2.1 level, prompting a bullish reversal. The price has since climbed back above the 100-day MA at $2.2, signaling early signs of recovery. However, upside momentum remains limited, as XRP now faces resistance at the 200-day MA around $2.35. A decisive break above this level could trigger a fresh wave of buying pressure, propelling the price toward the upper boundary of the long-standing wedge pattern near $2.5. For now, subdued momentum suggests a higher likelihood of short-term consolidation within this tight range. A breakout, either above resistance or below support, will likely define the next major directional move. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4-hour chart, XRP shows clear signs of a bullish reversal after rebounding strongly from the key $2.1 support zone. This move led to a breakout above a short-term descending price channel, reinforcing the potential for further upside. Currently, the asset is testing a critical resistance level at $2.3, where notable supply pressure is expected. A successful breakout and retest of this level would pave the way for a rally toward the $2.5 target. Conversely, failure to breach $2.3 could result in a short-term rejection and a corrective pullback. The upcoming price action around the $2.3–$2.35 region is crucial. A confirmed breakout will likely act as a catalyst for the next bullish leg, while a rejection could keep XRP locked in a consolidation phase.

While there are still gaps, Trump's CFTC chairman nominee Brian Quintenz is preparing for his nomination hearing. As is known, Brian Quintenz was nominated by Trump in February and will appear at a nomination hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee on Tuesday. On this point, Quintenz shared a written statement ahead of the nomination hearing, promising to provide a clear classification and judicial clarity for cryptocurrency market regulation. “The time has come for a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, including clarity of classification and clear jurisdiction for trading market supervision. “I am fully prepared to use my experience and expertise to assist in this effort, to fulfill any expanded mandate that may arise if the legislation is enacted.” Quintenz, who has significant experience working as head of policy at a16z Crypto (the digital asset arm of Andreessen Horowitz), said he is prepared to support and shape U.S. leadership in the crypto sector with his experience. “I've traveled the world, met with regulators and government officials in other jurisdictions and learned what they're trying to do, what they should do, and what's working well or poorly. With my experience and knowledge, I'm ready for the United States,” CFTC nominee Quintenz said. The nomination hearing is scheduled for June 10. *This is not investment advice.

The stock trades at a premium to its BTC holdings, reflecting both the core healthcare business and Bitcoin strategy, but isn't a bargain. Recent negative free cash flow, declining healthcare revenues, and legal uncertainties add risk and cloud the investment case. Given the fair valuation, execution risks, and better alternatives for Bitcoin exposure (buying BTC directly), I rate SMLR stock as a Hold. Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) used to just be a healthcare technology company focused on a cardiovascular testing product, but it's now like a mini Strategy Inc. ( MSTR ) with its Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) treasury ambitions. While it still has a small underlying healthcare business, Semler is now clearly a Bitcoin-focused company, buying up the asset as fast as it can and using debt and share issuances to do so. It's one of the largest corporate holders of BTC globally. The interesting thing is, if you look at the performance of Bitcoin and MSTR this year, up about 18% and 31%, respectively, and then look at Semler's performance of -38%, you'll notice a huge disconnect. Some may view this as an opportunity. I mean, SMLR stock is down more than 55% from its November 2024 swing high, while MSTR is off ""just"" 29% from its November high. At the same time, BTC is trading near an all-time high. So, what's going on with Semler stock? Should you buy it? There are a few reasons to buy but also a few reasons to avoid, and I don't think there's a clear opportunity here relative to buying BTC itself. I believe the stock is more or less fairly valued despite the underperformance. That's because Semler's market cap is still above the value of its BTC holdings (especially when factoring in net debt). So, I believe the difference between the market cap and the net value of BTC holdings can be thought of as how much the market is valuing the underlying health business, and I think the valuation the market assigns is probably fair but not a bargain. More detail on that later. The premium to the BTC holdings likely also prices in future optionality and leverage, so it's a combination of that and the core business. Another positive note to factor is that the stock has pulled back from a big run-up, so from a technical perspective, it could be ready for a short-term bounce. However, there are some risks involved. First of all, the business generated negative free cash flow in Q1 (which is highly unusual for this company), creating uncertainty. Second, it's hard to know the future trend of the healthcare business, with declining revenues and no estimates from analysts. There used to be analysts providing estimates, but it looks like they've given up. There's also execution risk with the BTC strategy, and I'd caution against buying a BTC-related stock with the crypto near an all-time high. As a result, the stock is a Hold. Let's Break Down The Valuation As of June 3, Semler Scientific held 4,449 BTC . At a price of $110,000 USD per Bitcoin, that's worth approximately $489.39 million. The company also had $9.9 million in cash as of March 31 and $96.1 million in debt (net cash of $86.2 million). Therefore, its BTC + net cash value is $403.2 million. Now, with a diluted share count of 15.653 million as of June 3 and a stock price of $33.99, the company’s market cap is ~$532.05 million. This implies that approximately $128.9 million of the market cap is being attributed to the healthcare business and the value of the BTC strategy itself. I also want to briefly mention that some websites understate its share count because they haven't updated it as of the most recent June 3 update, and this leads to the market cap being understated, which leads investors to thinking the stock is cheaper than it actually is. Is The $128.9M Premium Justified? The premium seems normal, given the pros and cons, which I'll explain. For example, Semler's core business has historically been FCF-positive. However, recent trends muddy the story a bit. In Q1 2025, healthcare revenue fell 44% year-over-year to $8.8 million, driven largely by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) reimbursement changes. And management's commentary suggests that it's trying to minimize revenue losses from QuantaFlo, suggesting that growth will be harder to come by. For instance, Jennifer Herrington, the company's COO, stated the following during the Q1 earnings call: Our priority for 2025 is to minimize declines to QuantaFlo revenue while maintaining sufficient infrastructure to support, innovate and grow our operations related to other cardiovascular disease states. In addition, Q1 free cash flow was -$2.116 million, when it has always been positive in other quarters. SMLR's Quarterly Free Cash Flow (Finbox) That's a red flag, but it's also somewhat balanced by management's tone. Management stated that it plans to use the company's cash flow from operations to purchase more BTC. Would management say that if they were expecting negative cash flow? I don't think so, but I can't say for sure. Nonetheless, saying this is one thing, but now we need to see if negative cash flow is here to stay or not. We can also look at the company's historical FCF multiple to help us value the company. Prior to the BTC strategy starting in 2024, the stock's price/FCF multiple settled in the mid-teens. Let's call it 15x, for simplicity's sake. Semler's Historical Price/FCF Multiple (Finbox) But before, it was a business with growing FCF and revenue. Now, both metrics are declining. There's also a $29.8 million contingency reserve, which is how much Semler set aside in Q1 for a potential DOJ legal settlement. That adds more uncertainty. Therefore, a 15x multiple is unlikely now. Maybe 8-10x is more reasonable. With its TTM FCF of $16.7 million, an 8-10x multiple suggests a $133.6-167 million valuation for the core business. But will $16.7 million in TTM FCF be maintained, or will it keep dropping? We can also do a quick price/sales valuation. Eyeballing the chart below, the price/sales ratio was generally around 4.5x before the BTC strategy started. Data by YCharts But again, with the business deterioration, 4.5x is unlikely. Maybe 3x is more realistic. If we take the $8.8 million in revenue from Q1 and multiply it by four, we get an annualized revenue figure of $35.2 million. Give that a 3x multiple, and you get a $105.6 million valuation for the business. Overall, based on my quick napkin math, the $128.9 million valuation premium looks justified more or less , especially if you consider the bit of intangible (and hard to quantify) value of the BTC strategy itself. But being ""justified more or less"" isn't good enough. As investors, we generally want companies that trade at discounted valuations. BTC Yield Is Positive But Dependent On Many Factors One of the KPIs management points to is BTC Yield, or the growth in Bitcoin per share over time. It's formally defined by Semler as ""a KPI that represents, for the period specified (year-to-date), the percentage change in the ratio between our Bitcoin Count and our Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding."" In theory, a high BTC yield, which SMLR has (26.7% YTD and 205.3% in 2024), is a good thing, as it signals that the company is buying BTC faster than it is diluting shareholders, increasing BTC per share. Semler's BTC Yield (Semler Scientific's Investor Relations) Nevertheless, this outcome isn't guaranteed. BTC yield depends on a few variables and also management's expertise in deploying capital. It depends on the timing and pricing of share issuances, pricing of debt offerings, and the healthcare business's ability to generate cash flow for BTC purchases. If Semler can issue shares when its stock is trading at a high premium relative to its BTC holdings, then the BTC yield will look strong. But if BTC rises quickly while Semler's stock underperforms, the company would have to issue more shares per BTC, potentially lowering the BTC yield. Management just needs to be smart with the timing of its purchases and equity raises. It has $362 million remaining in its ATM program, so a lot of dilution could be on the way. Hopefully, it'll be done at a good price. Most of the funds for BTC purchases, as of June 3, have come from ATM issuances and convertible bond issuances, as you can see below. Only 18% came from operating cash flow. Semler's Source Of Funds For BTC Purchases (Semler Scientific's June 2025 Presentation) The Pullback Could Signal A Short-Term Bounce Is Near I'm not going to get into this too much, but in simple terms, SMLR is a volatile stock that has fast upswings and downswings. We're in a downswing period, which suggests a bounce could be near. SMLR Stock Chart (TradingView) At the same time, part of that could depend on how BTC performs, but I'd rather buy SMLR or any other BTC-related stock when the BTC price is relatively low. The Bottom Line On SMLR Stock Semler Scientific may look like a great bargain based on its relative underperformance compared to MSTR and Bitcoin this year, but in reality, I don't see any screaming value. My analysis tells me that it's more or less fairly valued. Meanwhile, the company's high BTC yield isn't guaranteed. Fundamentally, there can be upside if the core business improves (if revenue stabilizes and cash flow returns), but there's not too much clarity about that, and there are no analyst estimates, either. Other upside potential can come from a potential rise in the Bitcoin price, but if you're bullish on Bitcoin at current levels, I do think it would be more efficient to just invest in Bitcoin directly (to avoid overcomplicating things), whether through actual BTC exposure or BTC derivatives. On the other hand, you could buy SMLR stock expecting a short-term bounce potentially, but that's strictly technical-analysis based. At the end of the day, the risk/reward opportunity seems balanced, with the market cap trading at a premium to the company's BTC holdings. Consequently, SMLR stock is a Hold.",BTC-USD|SMLR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-10 13:35:24

Pantoja shared this perspective in a recent tweet, emphasizing the significance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens. He compared its potential to owning one whole Bitcoin or acquiring 50 Ethereum tokens.According to him, every financially savvy individual knows the value of holding 10,000 XRP, 1 Bitcoin, or 50 ETH — and simply waiting for the portfolio to grow, potentially reaching as high as $2.5 million. At that point, he recommends diversifying into even more secure investments, such as real estate.Buying 10,000 XRP and Turning It Into $2.5 MillionNotably, acquiring 10,000 XRP today would require an investment of $22,300, based on the current token price of $2.23. As of now, data from the XRP Rich List shows that only 166,170 wallets hold between 10,000 and 25,000 XRP, while 159,509 wallets hold between 5,000 and 10,000 tokens.For context, XRP has over 6.5 million wallet addresses. Less than 4% of these addresses hold at least 10,000 XRP. This highlights a significant disparity and how few investors meet this threshold. Conversely, over 5 million addresses hold 500 XRP or fewer, indicating that the majority of XRP holders are retail investors, while whales possess most of the supply.Meanwhile, analysts like Pantoja and Edoardo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy continue to stress the significance of holding 10,000 XRP tokens . According to them, this level of accumulation could lead to unprecedented financial freedom. Pantoja’s latest projection that 10,000 XRP could one day be worth $2.5 million reinforces this vision.With fewer than 4% of XRP wallets at this level, the analysts urge investors to consolidate and build their holdings to reach this threshold and join the top tier of XRP holders.Meanwhile, Pantoja’s proposition implies that XRP would need to rise to $250 per token for 10,000 XRP to be worth $2.5 million. This is a staggering increase of 11,111% from the current price of $2.23.Several analysts have echoed this bullish outlook, with some, like Javon Marks, suggesting a $250 price target could be achieved in this cycle. At that price, XRP’s market cap would reach approximately $15 trillion, up from about $131 billion today.Turning Bitcoin and Ethereum Portfolios Into $2.5 MillionPantoja also proposed that a portfolio containing 1 Bitcoin could be worth $2.5 million in the future. Currently, 1 BTC is at around $105,500. His prediction aligns with that of ARK Invest, which projects a potential price of $2.4 million per Bitcoin by 2030 in an extremely bullish scenario.As for Ethereum, holding 50 ETH today is worth about $125,000. For this portfolio to reach $2.5 million, Ethereum would need to rise to $50,000 per coin. According to prediction outlet Telegaon, ETH could reach that level between 2040 and 2050.Still, these projections, while promising, remain highly speculative.What to Do After Reaching $2.5 MillionPantoja suggests that once investors hit the $2.5 million mark, whether through XRP, Bitcoin, or Ethereum, the next step should be to purchase a home and invest in assets yielding 3% to 5% annually. This strategy, he says, would help cover taxes and allow one to live a life of financial freedom.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 13:36:14

For those deeply involved in digital assets and financial technology, the potential applications in areas like trading analysis, risk management, and customer service are incredibly exciting. But for enterprises operating under strict regulations, like those in finance and healthcare, integrating powerful AI models comes with significant hurdles, primarily around data privacy and security. How can you leverage this transformative technology without risking sensitive information or breaching compliance? Understanding Secure Generative AI What exactly do we mean by Secure Generative AI ? At its core, it’s about deploying generative AI models in a way that protects the underlying data used for training, fine-tuning, and inference, as well as the outputs generated. Unlike consumer-grade AI tools where data handling might be less transparent, enterprise-grade secure generative AI requires robust controls. This includes ensuring data never leaves a secure environment, implementing strict access controls, and maintaining audit trails. The goal is to harness the AI’s ability to create new content, analyze complex data, or automate tasks without exposing confidential or regulated information. For businesses dealing with sensitive financial records or protected health information (PHI), standard AI deployments are simply not an option. The infrastructure, the data pipelines, and the AI models themselves must be designed with security and privacy as foundational principles, not afterthoughts. Why AI Data Privacy is Paramount in Regulated Sectors The regulatory landscape for sectors like finance and healthcare is complex and non-negotiable. Regulations such as HIPAA in healthcare, GDPR in Europe, and various financial regulations globally mandate stringent requirements for handling personal and sensitive data. Breaching these regulations can result in massive fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust. This is where AI Data Privacy becomes a critical concern. Generative AI models, especially large language models, are trained on vast datasets. Using these models in a regulated environment means carefully considering: Training Data: Was the data used to train the base model sourced ethically and legally? Does it contain sensitive information? Fine-tuning Data: If you fine-tune a model on internal, proprietary data (like customer interactions or patient records), how is that data protected during the process? Inference Data: When users input sensitive queries or data into the AI, how is that input handled? Is it logged? Is it used for future training? Model Outputs: Can the AI inadvertently reveal sensitive information based on its training or prompts? Are there safeguards against generating biased or harmful content? Ensuring AI data privacy means implementing technical and procedural safeguards at every stage of the AI lifecycle. Building a Foundation for Enterprise AI Security Achieving true Enterprise AI Security involves a multi-layered approach. It’s not just about putting AI behind a firewall; it’s about integrating security throughout the entire AI system architecture and operational processes. Key components include: 1. Secure Infrastructure: Deploying AI models within private cloud environments or on-premises data centers. Utilizing secure hardware and network configurations. Implementing strong access controls and identity management for AI platforms. 2. Data Governance and Protection: Strict data anonymization or pseudonymization where possible. Data encryption at rest and in transit. Implementing data loss prevention (DLP) policies. Clear data retention and deletion policies for AI data. 3. Model Security: Vulnerability scanning and security testing of AI models. Monitoring for model drift or adversarial attacks. Controlling model access and versioning. 4. Monitoring and Auditing: Comprehensive logging of AI usage and data access. Regular security audits and compliance checks. Real-time monitoring for suspicious activity. Building this robust security posture is essential for any enterprise looking to adopt AI responsibly, especially in sectors handling highly sensitive information. Implementing Secure Generative AI in Finance The financial sector stands to gain immensely from generative AI, from enhancing fraud detection and personalizing customer experiences to automating report generation and analyzing market trends. However, the security and privacy challenges are particularly acute given the value and sensitivity of financial data. Implementing AI in Finance requires specific considerations. Use cases might include: Automated Financial Advice: Generating personalized financial plans based on a client’s profile. Fraud Detection: Identifying complex patterns indicative of fraudulent activity. Risk Assessment: Analyzing vast datasets to predict credit risk or market volatility. Customer Service: Deploying AI chatbots to handle customer inquiries securely. For these applications, ensuring that customer financial data is never exposed to external models or used to train publicly accessible systems is paramount. Secure deployments often involve using private instances of models, fine-tuning them on encrypted internal data within a secure perimeter, and ensuring all interactions are logged and monitored for compliance. Applying Secure Generative AI in Healthcare Healthcare is another sector where generative AI holds incredible promise, from accelerating drug discovery and analyzing medical images to automating administrative tasks and providing diagnostic support. However, the strict regulations around Protected Health Information (PHI) make AI in Healthcare deployments particularly challenging from a privacy standpoint. Potential healthcare applications include: Clinical Documentation: Automating the generation of clinical notes or summaries. Medical Imaging Analysis: Assisting radiologists in identifying anomalies. Drug Discovery: Generating novel molecular structures or predicting drug interactions. Personalized Medicine: Analyzing patient data to suggest tailored treatment plans. Deploying AI in this context requires absolute certainty that patient data remains confidential and compliant with HIPAA and other regulations. This often involves using de-identified data for training where possible, processing sensitive data only within highly secure, compliant environments, and ensuring that AI outputs do not inadvertently reveal PHI. Secure sandboxes and privacy-preserving techniques like federated learning are often explored. Actionable Insights for Secure Deployment Drawing from expert discussions, like the panel featuring Cohere’s Solutions Architects, several actionable insights emerge for enterprises navigating secure generative AI deployment: 1. Start with a Data Strategy: Before touching any AI model, get your data house in order. Identify sensitive data, classify it, and establish clear governance policies. 2. Prioritize Private or Hybrid Deployments: For regulated data, public cloud AI services with unclear data handling policies are often unsuitable. Explore private cloud options or hybrid approaches that keep sensitive data within your secure environment. 3. Leverage Fine-tuning Securely: Fine-tuning smaller, specialized models on your internal data within a secure environment is often more practical and secure than relying on massive, general-purpose public models for sensitive tasks. 4. Implement Strict Access Controls: Not everyone needs access to the AI system or the data it processes. Implement granular access controls based on roles and responsibilities. 5. Monitor and Audit Everything: Comprehensive logging and auditing are non-negotiable. You need to know who accessed what data, what queries were run, and what outputs were generated. 6. Stay Informed on Regulations: The regulatory landscape is constantly evolving. Stay updated on compliance requirements related to AI and data privacy in your specific sector. 7. Partner with Experts: Work with AI providers and security experts who understand the unique challenges of regulated industries and offer solutions designed for enterprise security and privacy. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the clear path to secure deployment, challenges remain. The rapid pace of AI development means security threats are also evolving. Ensuring models are free from bias, preventing data leakage through model outputs, and maintaining compliance across different jurisdictions are ongoing efforts. Furthermore, the technical expertise required to implement and manage secure AI infrastructure is significant. However, the potential benefits—increased efficiency, improved decision-making, enhanced customer or patient outcomes—are too great to ignore. By focusing on secure generative AI from the outset, regulated enterprises can confidently explore and adopt this powerful technology. Conclusion: Securing the Future of Enterprise AI The journey to adopting generative AI in regulated sectors like finance and healthcare is complex, but entirely achievable with a focus on security and privacy. As highlighted in expert discussions, deploying secure generative AI requires a deliberate strategy centered on robust AI data privacy measures and comprehensive enterprise AI security protocols. By prioritizing secure infrastructure, strict data governance, continuous monitoring, and partnering with knowledgeable providers, businesses can unlock the transformative power of AI while upholding their critical responsibility to protect sensitive information.

Altseason is likely delayed until Bitcoin reaches the $120K to $140K target zone. The analyst says macro trends and liquidity shifts suggest strong upside for Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency trader James Wynn has issued a warning to altcoin investors, highlighting dangerous positioning patterns as Bitcoin dominance prepares for what he believes to be historic levels. The analyst observes widespread over-leverage in altcoins while investors remain inadequately hedged against Bitcoin’s continued outperformance. Wynn stated that it creates conditions for potential mass liquidations across the altcoin sector. Wynn’s assessment suggests the eagerly anticipated altseason could face substantial delays as Bitcoin dominance climbs to levels never previously seen in cryptocurrency markets. This projection contradicts the popular sentiment among altcoin holders, who expect an imminent rotation from Bitcoin into smaller-cap digital assets.

A New Model for Bitcoin DeFi Integration Announced via X, the initiative positions Cardano as a serious contender in integrating Bitcoin liquidity with advanced DeFi infrastructure, offering a fundamentally different approach to the wrapped Bitcoin models currently dominating the market. At the core of Cardinal is a system that enables users to wrap Bitcoin’s unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) and convert them into yield-generating DeFi assets. This mechanism allows Bitcoin holders to lend, stake, and borrow within Cardano’s ecosystem without involving custodians or federations, a significant departure from existing models that typically rely on centralized intermediaries. How the Cardinal Protocol Works Romain Pellerin, CTO at InputOutput HK, elaborated on the protocol’s framework, highlighting its emphasis on cross-chain interoperability and security. “It’s a fresh approach for Bitcoin,” noted Pellerin in his official X thread quoted by Hoskinson, pointing to the protocol’s non-custodial design and absence of rehypothecation risks. The protocol leverages Cardano’s extended UTXO model, similar to Bitcoin’s, but enhanced with smart contract capabilities, allowing Bitcoin UTXOs to be seamlessly converted into wrapped assets. These wrapped tokens or NFTs remain pegged 1:1 with the underlying Bitcoin, can be transferred on-chain, and are burnable to release the original Bitcoin or Ordinals. Security is enforced through the implementation of MuSig2, an aggregated multi-signature scheme that locks Bitcoin in a trust-minimized manner. Wrapped assets can be redeemed at any time using fraud-proofed peg-out processes, mitigating the risks typically associated with centralized or federated wrapped Bitcoin systems. Cross-Chain and Ordinals Support A defining feature of Cardinal is its ability to interoperate with multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Additionally, it powers a trust-minimized Ordinal bridge, enabling Ordinals to participate in DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, collateralization, and auctions across different chains while retaining provenance. The protocol is also compatible with non-fungible and verifiable off-chain execution use cases via BitVMX. Bitcoin HTLCs combined with Cardano smart contracts support peg-in, peg-out, and ownership transfers, marking a first for cross-chain Ordinal wrapping with publicly verifiable transaction IDs. Future Enhancements and Industry Implications While Cardinal represents a significant technical milestone, Pellerin acknowledged that further development is essential. He proposed integrating zero-knowledge (ZK) technology for solidarity proofs, recursive state proofs, enhanced liquidity provider systems, and expanded wallet integrations to improve accessibility and scalability. The protocol’s launch could reshape how Bitcoin interacts with DeFi ecosystems, offering yield opportunities on Cardano’s DeFi platforms such as MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens. It also aligns with views expressed by figures like Robert Kiyosaki, who advocate Bitcoin as a form of “people’s money.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A key procedural step has just been taken in the US Senate , pushing a pivotal piece of crypto legislation closer to a potential vote. US Senate Pushes Forward on Stablecoin Regulation According to reports, US Senate Republican Leader John Thune has filed cloture on both the bipartisan amendment to the GENIUS Act and the main bill itself. This development, reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett on X, signals a clear intent to bring this important matter to a head. What exactly does filing cloture mean in the context of the US Senate ? It’s a parliamentary procedure used to end a debate and force a vote. In essence, it’s a way to overcome a potential filibuster, demonstrating that there is sufficient will among senators to move forward and decide the fate of the legislation. The filing indicates that the US Senate is preparing for a vote on the GENIUS Act , a bill specifically designed to address stablecoin regulation . The vote is expected to take place this week. For the bill and its amendment to pass, they will require a significant threshold of support – 60 votes. Understanding the GENIUS Act and Stablecoin Regulation The GENIUS Act , or the ‘ Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023 ‘, is a bipartisan effort aiming to establish a clear regulatory framework for payment stablecoins in the United States. The push for stablecoin regulation stems from various concerns, including financial stability, consumer protection, and preventing illicit activities. Key aspects typically addressed in proposed stablecoin regulation include: Requirements for stablecoin issuers, such as obtaining a license or charter. Rules regarding the reserves backing stablecoins, ensuring they are safe and liquid. Supervision by appropriate regulatory bodies (e.g., federal or state banking regulators). Interoperability standards and consumer redemption rights. The bipartisan amendment mentioned by Senator John Thune likely represents modifications agreed upon by senators from both major parties, aimed at finding common ground on how best to approach this complex area of crypto legislation . Why is This US Senate Vote Crucial for Crypto Legislation? The potential passage of the GENIUS Act would be a landmark moment for crypto legislation in the US. Stablecoins play a vital role in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, and providing stability in volatile markets. Clear stablecoin regulation could have several significant impacts: Increased Clarity: Provides legal certainty for issuers, users, and financial institutions. Enhanced Confidence: May increase investor and consumer trust in stablecoins. Potential for Growth: Could pave the way for wider adoption by regulated financial entities. Setting a Precedent: Could influence how other forms of digital assets are regulated in the future. However, navigating stablecoin regulation also presents challenges. Finding the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring safety and stability is key. The specifics of the GENIUS Act and its amendment will determine whether the proposed framework is seen as overly restrictive or appropriately balanced by the industry. What Happens Next? The Vote and Potential Outcomes With Senator John Thune filing cloture, the stage is set for a vote in the US Senate this week. The requirement of 60 votes means that the bill needs significant bipartisan support to pass. This is often a challenging hurdle in the Senate, highlighting the need for broad consensus. Potential outcomes of the vote include: Passage: If the bill secures 60 or more votes, it moves closer to becoming law. It would then need to pass the House of Representatives (likely requiring reconciliation between different versions of legislation) and be signed by the President. Failure: If the bill does not reach the 60-vote threshold, it could stall or be sent back for further negotiation and amendment. Further Negotiation: Even if it passes the cloture vote, the process of enacting crypto legislation is complex and involves multiple steps and potential compromises between the Senate and the House. The actions of Senator John Thune underscore the growing urgency among some lawmakers to address digital asset regulation, particularly stablecoins, which are viewed by many as having the potential for systemic importance. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed on Crypto Legislation For anyone involved in or interested in the cryptocurrency space, keeping an eye on legislative developments like this is paramount. The outcome of this US Senate vote on the GENIUS Act could significantly shape the future operating environment for stablecoins and potentially other digital assets in the US. Here’s how you can stay engaged: Follow reputable news sources covering cryptocurrency and US politics. Understand the basics of proposed legislation like the GENIUS Act . Consider the potential implications for your own use of stablecoins or participation in the crypto market. The move by Senator John Thune is a clear signal that stablecoin regulation remains a priority in the US Senate , and the coming vote will be a critical moment for this evolving area of crypto legislation . Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Stablecoin Regulation The filing of cloture by Senator John Thune on the GENIUS Act marks a significant procedural step, bringing the possibility of federal stablecoin regulation closer to reality in the US Senate . With a crucial vote anticipated this week, the fate of this important piece of crypto legislation hangs in the balance, requiring substantial bipartisan support to advance. The outcome will have profound implications for the future of stablecoins and the broader digital asset ecosystem in the United States, making this a development worth watching closely.

PRYPCO is offering investors the chance to own parts of the property starting at 2,000 AED, which is equivalent to $544. According to Sajwani, the founder and CEO of PRYPCO: “With our second property, we’re continuing to break down traditional barriers and offer high-quality opportunities to a broader, more diverse audience. At PRYPCO, our mission is to democratize property ownership, and this is just the beginning.” The executive also noted that the response to its first tokenized property proved that investors are ready for a smarter, more accessible way to invest in real estate.

According to some observers, Bitcoin, created as a response to this crisis, started to resemble MBS as a large part of the Bitcoin market is now represented by “paper” Bitcoin or sophisticated Bitcoin derivatives. How accurate is that? Should we get ready for another fundamental shakeout? Table of Contents Crisis of 2008 From Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin Crisis of 2008 The 2008 financial crisis was a product of several simultaneous misfortunes and disproportions. One of the factors that made it possible was the development of extremely complex trading instruments. Securitization is the term that describes the contractual debt-based pools of money related to these debts (mortgage, auto loans, etc) sold to third parties in the form of securities. Mortgage-backed securities saw sharp traction, but they turned out to be not collateralized properly. Mortgages were given to people with little to no proof of financial solvency. MBS associated with subprime mortgages became the dynamite for the world economy during the housing bubble boom in 2007–2009. Banks, hedge funds, and mortgage lenders saw bankruptcies, liquidations, bank runs, etc. The results of the 2008 financial crisis included a high unemployment rate, crashed markets, an inflation spike, a decline in household wealth, and the number of bailouts. The governments saved the banking system while most of those responsible for the crisis were not punished . An unknown innovator came up with an alternative electronic cash system, not controlled by the banks and governments, known as Bitcoin. Read more: What is a genesis block? From Bitcoin whitepaper to “paper” Bitcoin While Bitcoin is technically independent from any entity as its network is decentralized, governments and corporations eventually found a way to influence Bitcoin to some extent, as they have the power to funnel millions of dollars into Bitcoin. As public awareness about Bitcoin grew, its price went higher. Investments from institutions and governments were mostly seen positively as they were to increase Bitcoin’s spot price and bring it closer to mass adoption. Soon, Bitcoin started to adopt traditional financial instruments to allow profit from bitcoins you don’t hold. In 2017, Bitcoin futures became available. Bitcoin margin trading was already in place by that time. 2024 saw Bitcoin ETF approval. The introduction and growing adoption of Bitcoin derivatives created patterns that remind some of the MBS movements before the 2008 financial crisis outbreak. These days, certain pension funds in the U.S., UK, and Australia invest in Bitcoin through ETFs, just as 17 years ago they were investing in MBS. Just like 17 years ago, Bitcoin derivatives are so sophisticated that risk management is limited. The same was the case with MBS when no one knew exactly who owned what, as the securities were bundled with other instruments and sort of blended. Today fear of missing out fuels institutional investors the similar way it was in 2008. Academic researchers Rahool Kapoor and Natalya Vinokurova released a piece this March, in which they warned readers of inaccurate analogies. They write that comparing Bitcoin to gold is as risky as comparing MBS to bonds. Bitcoin is similar to gold in many ways, whether it is scarcity or high returns, but authors say that Bitcoin may fail the way MBS did after ungrounded trust in this asset mixed with FOMO. These researchers don’t try to explain why many believe that Bitcoin is not only similar to gold but superior in many instances. Nevertheless, their criticism of the processes surrounding Bitcoin these days resembles some (rare) opinions across Crypto Twitter, signaling that too much paper Bitcoin on the market may end up badly. Paper Bitcoin means that when two people use an exchange so that one will lend their bitcoins to another, the real exchange between the two may not happen. Instead, an exchange will display both persons as having these bitcoins. It distorts the data and engages people in trading uncollateralized assets. It's simple. Short sellers of $IBIT , for example, are creating paper Bitcoin. This happens through Operational Short Selling — where market makers borrow ETF shares and short them, while the fund itself holds real BTC. The result? More claims on Bitcoin than actual coins. https://t.co/G4pxLnFVRV — Josh Man (@JoshMandell6) June 8, 2025 Some believe that paper Bitcoin trading is the reason why the BTC price is still far from being one million or even half of it despite multi-million purchases by Bitcoin treasuries. However, it’s worth saying that Bitcoin treasuries use OTC desks to avoid immediate impact on the markets. My thesis is that if the financial system heals then bitcoin treasury companies will probably collapse. If it doesn't heal the banks and the treasury market are close to collapse — DarkSideOfTheMoon (@DarkSide2030_) June 9, 2025 Some in the crypto community oppose Bitcoin treasures for various reasons, including centralization, paper asset trading, lack of usability, insecurity, etc. The narrative surrounding Bitcoin has shifted from the Wall Street denial to a basis for another unsafe asset traded by it. Time will show how sustainable Bitcoin will be in the event that its derivatives fall apart. As of June 2025, only a few experts express concern about paper Bitcoin trading. Some think that obligatory proof-of-reserves would have lowered the risks associated with paper Bitcoin. However, it requires changing the practice of how exchanges act. Others stick to Bitcoin self-custody and don’t trust their funds to Bitcoin treasury companies and other centralized entities.

Speaking at the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable, “ DeFi and the American Spirit ,” Atkins described decentralized finance as embodying core American values of “economic liberty, private property rights, and innovation.” The timing carries profound significance, coming after his June 3 Senate testimony, in which he condemned the SEC’s previous “regulation-by-enforcement” approach as having “inhibited innovation” and “invited fraud.” Key points from Chairman Paul Atkins’ remarks today at “DeFi and the American Spirit,” SEC’s Crypto Task Force Roundtable on Decentralized Finance – a — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) June 9, 2025 SEC’s Journey From Enforcement Crackdowns to Innovation Champions The previous administration’s approach “discouraged Americans from participating in these market-based systems by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions,” Atkins explained. This regulatory hostility peaked with enforcement actions targeting developers of self-custody software, treating code publication as potential brokerage activity. The absurdity became clear through cases like Tornado Cash , in which developer Alexey Pertsev was arrested and convicted of money laundering . He received over five years in prison, but he was recently released . Other developers, Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, faced similar charges, prompting Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to donate $170,000 to legal defense funds and the Ethereum Foundation to contribute $1.25 million , emphasizing that “writing code is not a crime.” The EF is donating $1.25M to the legal defense of Alexey Pertsev. Privacy is normal, and writing code is not a crime. You can contribute to @alex_pertsev 's defense here: https://t.co/shWFNoDJ9g https://t.co/ITvEiRkAGt — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) February 26, 2025 Atkins embraced judicial reasoning that holding developers liable for third-party misuse would be like suing a car manufacturer “for a third-party’s use of the car to commit a traffic violation or to rob a bank.” He celebrated recent progress, particularly the Division of Corporation Finance’s clarification that voluntary participation in proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks as miners, validators, or staking service providers falls outside the scope of federal securities law. However, he emphasized that staff guidance “is not a duly promulgated rule with the force of law, so we cannot stop there.” The SEC’s new approach is already working. The agency has dropped cases against major players, including Binance , Coinbase , and Ripple , which is a retreat from the previous administration’s aggressive stance. Binance CEO Richard Teng calls SEC case dismissal a “huge win” and credits Trump for a crypto-friendly regulatory shift. #RichardTeng #Binance https://t.co/qZYIaMJCbX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 This shift gained momentum with the January 21 launch of the Crypto Task Force , led by Commissioner Hester Peirce and supported by Commissioner Mark Uyeda. The task force is tasked with developing a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Self-Custody as Financial Sovereignty and Innovation Framework Atkins’s passionate defense of self-custody rights positioned direct control over crypto assets as a “foundational American value that should not disappear when one logs onto the internet.” JUST IN: SEC Chair Paul Atkins says the right to self custody crypto ""is a foundational American value."" pic.twitter.com/B7ghx7pUJ0 — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 9, 2025 This principle gained urgency following spectacular failures of centralized platforms like FTX and Celsius , where billions in user funds were lost. “While centralized platforms waivered and failed under recent stresses, many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code,” he noted. The chairman acknowledged legitimate concerns about user error in self-custody while supporting “greater flexibility to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, especially where intermediation imposes unnecessary transaction costs or restricts the ability to engage in staking and other on-chain activities.” Atkins’ vision extends beyond individual rights to comprehensive market transformation. He expressed excitement about “the use of on-chain software systems by issuers and intermediaries to eliminate economic frictions, increase capital efficiency, enable new types of financial products, and enhance liquidity.” SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the agency is drafting an “innovation exemption” for DeFi, aiming to ease rules for launching on-chain products. SEC crypto lead Hester Peirce noted developers shouldn't be liable for code misuse, but centralized entities can't evade regulation by… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 10, 2025 Most significantly, Atkins proposed an “innovation exemption” framework that would “expeditiously allow registrants and non-registrants to bring on-chain products and services to market” under specified conditions. This conditional relief mechanism could “help fulfill President Trump’s vision to make America the ‘crypto capital of the planet’ by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.” The post SEC Chairman Atkins: “Engineers Should Not Be Subject to Securities Laws” appeared first on Cryptonews .",Crypto Regulation News|Adoption|SEC Chair|Securities,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-10 15:27:18

These trends are reflected by Kaanch Network, a Layer 1 blockchain designed for regulatory compatibility, tokenization and verified digital identity. It has infrastructure for real world asset (RWA) tokenization, allowing for secure and transparent management of assets such as real estate and commodities, which is attractive to enterprises and institutions that are having to comply with new regulatory standards. Kaanch Presale: A High-Potential Opportunity At present, Kaanch Network is at Stage 6 of its presale with tokens priced at $0.32. The price will double to $0.64 in the next stage, which will cause some urgency for early investors. Demand is strong, as the presale has raised over $2,101,425 million. Kaanch has a limited supply of 58 million tokens, which makes it scarce and, therefore, more valuable. During the presale, investors can buy $KNCH tokens using ETH or USDT, and also stake at up to 30% APY. The smart contracts of the project have been audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab to reinforce trust and transparency. Those who are interested can participate in the Kaanch presale website at https://presale.kaanch.com , although stages are selling out fast, so the window to get in is closing. Technical Strengths Driving Adoption The blockchain of Kaanch Network provides a transaction capacity of 1.4 million TPS and 0.8 second finality, allowing instant trade execution and smooth smart contract operations. It is cost effective for decentralized applications (dApps), microtransactions and payment solutions, and this makes it attractive to both developers and businesses. The network is supported by 3,600 decentralized nodes, which ensures robust security and decentralization, which are essential to tokenizing real world assets. This technical capability makes Kaanch a scalable solution for DeFi, gaming and enterprise grade applications. Community and Governance Focus Kaanch’s community driven model is what makes it stand out, with open governance and a staking dashboard where token holders can participate in the decision making. The .knch domains help in the decentralized identity solutions by simplifying the wallet and DAO functionality. This governance framework encourages long term engagement and aligns with the increasing need for community driven blockchain ecosystems which makes Kaanch a compelling choice for investors and developers. Upcoming BitMart Listing Signals Growth Soon, Kaanch Network will be listed on Bitmart and the listing price is expected to be $30, a big jump from the current presale price. This upcoming listing will increase liquidity and visibility, which will attract more investors. With a capped token supply, enterprise friendly infrastructure and tokenization trends alignment, Kaanch is poised for growth in 2025. For those who want to take advantage of this opportunity, they should visit the Kaanch presale website to get their tokens before the price goes up in the next stage. The presale of Kaanch Network is a strategic entry point for investors in a market that is becoming more and more dictated by regulatory clarity and real world utility. As an altcoin, it stands out because of its robust technical foundation, focus on tokenization and community driven governance. With the cryptocurrency landscape changing, Kaanch’s infrastructure and upcoming exchange listing indicate that it could have a big part to play in the next phase of blockchain adoption.

SilverBox Corp IV, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by the reputable investment and advisory firm SilverBox Capital, recently announced a significant move. According to reports from Business Wire, SilverBox Corp IV has signed a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to merge with Parataxis Holdings. What is a SPAC Merger and Why Does This One Matter? Before diving deeper, let’s quickly touch upon what a SPAC is. A SPAC, or Special Purpose Acquisition Company, is essentially a shell company created to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the sole purpose of acquiring an existing company. They are often called ‘blank check companies’ because investors don’t know which company the SPAC will merge with when they invest. The potential merger between SilverBox Corp IV and Parataxis Holdings is particularly noteworthy because it involves a SPAC targeting a digital asset firm . This isn’t just another corporate merger; it signifies a potential bridge being built between conventional public markets and the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency and blockchain space. It allows a private digital asset company to potentially go public through a streamlined process compared to a traditional IPO. Introducing Parataxis : A Key Player in Digital Assets So, who exactly is Parataxis Holdings? The company is closely affiliated with Parataxis Capital Management, a multi-strategy investment firm deeply focused on the digital asset landscape. Unlike some firms that dabble in crypto, Parataxis Capital Management has carved out a niche with specialized expertise. Their focus areas include managing Bitcoin treasuries – helping companies and institutions strategically hold and manage Bitcoin on their balance sheets. They also actively pursue a range of other digital asset investment opportunities, suggesting a broad engagement across the crypto ecosystem beyond just Bitcoin. Understanding the Significance for the Digital Asset Firm Sector This proposed SPAC merger could have several implications for the broader digital asset sector: Increased Legitimacy: A successful merger could lend further legitimacy to the digital asset space in the eyes of traditional investors and institutions. Access to Capital: Going public via a SPAC could provide Parataxis with significant capital for expansion, product development, or further investments. Market Access: It offers public market investors a potentially easier way to gain exposure to a dedicated digital asset investment firm. Trend Indicator: If successful, this could pave the way for more digital asset companies to explore similar routes to the public market. What Happens After the LOI? Exploring the Path for SilverBox Corp IV It’s crucial to remember that an LOI is non-binding. It signals serious intent but is not a final agreement. The next steps typically involve: Extensive due diligence by SilverBox Corp IV into Parataxis’s financials, operations, and legal standing. Negotiation of a definitive merger agreement outlining the terms, valuation, and structure of the transaction. Regulatory approvals from bodies like the SEC. Approval from the shareholders of SilverBox Corp IV. The process can be complex, and there’s no guarantee the deal will close. However, the signing of the LOI indicates that both parties see significant potential value in the combination. Why Focus on Bitcoin Treasuries ? Parataxis Capital Management’s expertise in managing Bitcoin treasuries is particularly relevant today. With more corporations considering or already holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, specialized knowledge in managing the risks and opportunities associated with this unique asset class is in demand. This focus highlights Parataxis’s deep understanding of a specific, growing area within the digital asset space. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Parataxis and the Digital Asset Market The non-binding LOI between SilverBox Corp IV and Parataxis Holdings represents a potentially significant development. For SilverBox Corp IV, it offers a path into the dynamic digital asset market. For Parataxis, it could provide the resources and public platform to accelerate its growth and expertise, particularly in areas like managing Bitcoin treasuries . While challenges remain before a definitive agreement is reached and the SPAC merger is completed, this move underscores the increasing convergence of traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets, signalling confidence in the future of this sector.

Quintenz, who is Donald Trump’s nominee for the new Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chair, made the comments in a prepared remark on Tuesday, prior to his confirmation meeting.He asked Congress to expand the US CFTC’s purview beyond the futures market to include the spot crypto commodity market. Among others, he also pledged a clear regulatory framework for digital assets, calling the innovation transformative.Quintenz Pledges Clear Digital Assets ClassificationNotably, Trump endorsed the Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z executive as the new CFTC chair under his administration in February. As part of the confirmation process, Quintenz would meet with the US Senate Agriculture Committee today for his hearing.Ahead of this hearing FOX journalist Eleanor Terret reported that the former CFTC commissioner is already making demands from Congress. One of which is to give the futures market regulator control of the crypto spot commodity market.Quintenz stated in his prepared remarks that this might turn out to be the most significant and thrilling period in the agency’s history, as Congress evaluates the possibility of granting the agency new authority over the spot crypto commodity markets.He emphasized the need for regulatory clarity, particularly regarding the classification of crypto tokens. Remarkably, the boiling issue was part of the stumbling block in the crypto industry’s fallout with the Gary Gensler-led US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).While the current administration has made significant progress, Quintenz insinuates that the CFTC would better regulate the spot commodity market. He further pledged a clear framework, classification, and jurisdiction for overseeing the trading market.Meanwhile, the former CFTC commissioner is not the first to suggest the move; Coinbase made a similar proposition to Congress in February. If this pulls through, it will diminish the US SEC’s regulatory role in the digital asset sector.Quintenz’s View of Blockchain TechnologyFurthermore, he shared that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are not going away. As a result, there is a need for proper regulation. His remarks also noted that blockchain extends beyond the financial market, affecting various aspects of society.Quintenz highlighted that he would leverage his experience in the crypto sector with a16z to right the wrongs previously done by regulators. He also emphasized his intolerance for bad actors and aims to maintain the CFTC’s focus on striking a balance between risk and innovation.Interestingly, Quintenz holds crypto assets worth $3.4 million, a testament to his strong belief in the innovation.

This feature, the company says, “dramatically” boosts market opportunities for both clients and partners. Intraday Yield (a patent-pending tech) provides investors with benefits from yield proportional calculation and distribution with one-second resolution when a tokenized security is transferred between users. This is the case even when traded intraday, the company claims. And that’s a key point. Investors can maximize their earning potential by partaking in their investments at any time of any day. Per the team, “This means an investor can own a tokenized security for part of the day, transfer it to another investor, and still earn yield for the period they were a shareholder.” Moreover, the Banji platform provides accounting for share transfers and calculates the yield that investors receive each day. This is regardless of weekends or holidays. Meanwhile, the Benji Technology Platform is Franklin Templeton’s proprietary blockchain-integrated stack. It enables trading, management, and administration of token-based investments, the company says. Banks or asset managers can leverage it as white label technology to tokenize securities. They can also access it through one of the tokenized money market funds the company has launched. Both retail and institutional investors use this tool, the company notes. This includes hedge fund trading desks and corporate treasurers managing liquid reserves. Venture capital firms also utilize the platform as a programmable funding tool. New chain unlocked.

Transfers, Self-Custody, Purchases, and Redemptions The press release shared with Cryptonews explains that the current prevailing industry standard is to determine share ownership and calculate yield at the end of a trading day. It’s distributed to investors at the end of the month. Therefore, Intraday Yield works to enhance this approach, the company argues. Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, commented that the new feature is “one example of how we’re bringing the real, tangible advantages of blockchains to our global client base as well as to new partners and investors.” “We believe features that are possible due to the composability of the blockchain environment, like Intraday Yield, have the potential to become an industry standard, ensuring that investors facilitating transactions of any size can realize the increased benefits and utilities of blockchain operating environments,” Bayston says. Moreover, besides Intraday Yield, Franklin Templeton has introduced additional capabilities via Benji. The first is wallet-to-wallet transfers. This enables peer-to-peer transfer of digital tokens via permissioned wallet addresses on supported blockchain networks. Next, the company has added stablecoin on-ramps and redemption. Investors can use stablecoins to buy and redeem BENJI tokens. Lastly, there is permissioned self-custody, allowing external wallets on supported blockchains to hold BENJI tokens. “We believe the future will be a blockchain-based system delivered with the trust, scale, and regulatory rigor that investors expect,” said Sandy Kaul, Head of Innovation at Franklin Templeton.

The analytical platform revealed today that its proprietary Network Activity Index has dropped sharply to 3,470, marking one of the lowest levels recorded in the last 18 months. Bitcoin CryptoQuant Network Activity Index However, CryptoQuant emphasized that such periods of low network engagement have historically preceded major explosions. As a result, the platform suggested that this quiet phase might be the calm before a potential surge.Data Shows Bitcoin Network Activity is DownOne of the major findings from the report was the notable decline in retail investor interest. Specifically, on-chain transaction volumes between $0 and $10,000 have fallen by over 5%. This decline shows a drop in participation from small investors. Retail Investor Demand | CryptoQuant Adding to this subdued outlook, spot trading volumes on centralized exchanges have receded to levels last seen in October 2020. Notably, this represents a 4.5-year low and shows there is minimal movement of Bitcoin across both exchanges and on-chain channels. Bitcoin CEX Spot Trading Volume | CryptoQuant Interestingly, despite the ongoing demand from Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $386 million in net inflows yesterday, the CryptoQuant data indicates that there is a lack of organic interest in direct Bitcoin transactions.LTHs Remain Unfazed While Interest in Futures Trading Grows However, while short-term interest seems to be declining, long-term investor confidence remains strong. For one, CryptoQuant highlighted that about 847,200 BTC have recently transitioned into long-term holder supply. Bitcoin LTH Supply | CryptoQuant What this means is that these coins have remained dormant for over 155 days, suggesting that a large portion of investors are opting to hold their assets rather than engage in frequent trading. For perspective, the market witnessed behaviors like this during the accumulation phases observed in September and October 2024. Such a trend indicates strong conviction in future price growth among market participants.Now, while Bitcoin network activity is down, Ethereum's futures market is showing a different trend. According to CryptoQuant, Open Interest has climbed to an all-time high of 7.17 million ETH. This spike suggests that while the spot market remains dormant, speculative interest, particularly in Ethereum, is growing. Ethereum Open Interest | CryptoQuant CryptoQuant also noted a surge in futures trading frequency among retail investors, with the frequency surpassing its one-year average. This could be signaling overcrowding in derivatives markets, as retail speculation in the futures market grows.https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1932437449382269144Analysts Confident in Bitcoin Upside PotentialAmid these developments, Bitcoin continues its volatile movements. The asset recently peaked at $110,617 before facing a 1.19% drop, settling at $108,911. Despite this dip, Bitcoin remains 8.44% higher than its June 5 low of $100,430. Notably, analyst Henry recently confirmed that BTC is currently holding steady above $105,400. He pointed to a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart, suggesting that it is close to completion. According to him, a breakout above the upper trendline could send Bitcoin soaring to the $120,000 mark. In a separate analysis, Michael XBT, who previously predicted XRP's seven-year symmetrical triangle breakout, identified a long-standing resistance on Bitcoin's one-week chart. https://twitter.com/MichaelXBT/status/1932169291249672304He pointed out that Bitcoin is approaching the breakout point of an eight-year resistance line. Michael believes this breakout will be unlike any other, predicting it will trigger a FOMO-driven rally of unprecedented scale, likening the potential move to a digital gold rush. The Crypto Basic also discussed a recent analysis from Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse. Specifically, he highlighted that the 200-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) has historically served as a reliable indicator for market cycle tops. Cowen noted that when the 200W SMA reaches the previous cycle's top, it often marks the current cycle's peak. At present, Bitcoin trades at $108,911, while the 200W SMA is at $48,711. This considerable gap from the previous cycle's high of $69,000 suggests Bitcoin still has much upside potential in this ongoing cycle.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 15:34:52

With hopes of a favorable outcome in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC and increasing institutional adoption, analysts are optimistic about XRP reaching $5 by mid-2025. However, a new player—Ozak AI—is starting to gain momentum in presale circles, priced at just $0.005. With an ambitious vision and a focus on AI-driven predictive technology, Ozak AI is being touted as a potential 300x gem. So, the big question: will XRP’s steady climb win out, or will Ozak AI’s explosive upside steal the show? XRP’s Road to $5 XRP has been one of the maximum debated tokens in crypto, ordinarily due to Ripple’s protracted prison dispute with the SEC. However, with developing optimism about a favorable ruling and Ripple’s persisted expansion into the worldwide payments quarter, sentiment around XRP is enhancing. At a current price hovering around $0.50, reaching $5 would mean a 10x return, which is impressive for a top-10 crypto with a massive market cap. Ripple is already making inroads into banking corridors across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. These fundamentals could very well support a surge to $5 during the 2025 bull market, especially if the legal uncertainties clear. Still, the pace of gains may remain steady and measured, unlike the explosive growth that early-stage projects sometimes deliver. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI: A $0.005 Bet with 300x Potential? Ozak AI is still in its early presale phase, offering the kind of asymmetric return potential that seasoned investors crave. Currently priced at $0.005 in its 4th presale stage, the token has already raised over $1.2 million in funding. It’s also listed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko , increasing visibility and investor trust. Ozak AI combines artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure to deliver real-time, predictive analytics for financial markets. Key features include: Ozak Stream Network (OSN): Enables low-latency data processing DePIN: Ensures decentralized infrastructure and data security Prediction Agents: Customizable AI bots for tailored insights Ozak Data Vaults: For secure, user-controlled data management Analysts suggest that if Ozak AI gains adoption within the AI and DeFi ecosystems, a price target of $1–$1.50 could be realistic—representing 200x–300x returns from the current entry point. Let’s break it down. A $1,000 investment in XRP at $0.50 yields 2,000 XRP. If XRP hits $5, that turns into $10,000—a solid 10x return. Now take $1,000 into Ozak AI at $0.005—that buys 200,000 tokens. If Ozak AI reaches $1, you’re sitting on $200,000—a 200x return. If it touches $1.50, that’s a 300x windfall. XRP offers a more conservative, long-term play rooted in institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. It’s a lower-risk asset that could provide a respectable 10x gain if things align. Ozak AI, on the other hand, is a bold, early-stage opportunity with unmatched upside potential. Backed by real tech and growing presale interest, it represents the kind of investment that could define 2025’s biggest success stories. If users are seeking stability, XRP is your coin. If you’re after life-changing gains, Ozak AI may be the smarter move—especially at $0.005.

The World Bank now predicts U.S. gross domestic product will expand by just 1.4 percent in 2025, down sharply from the 2.8 percent gain it recorded in 2024. Only five months ago, in its January outlook, the World Bank was expecting U.S. growth of 2.3 percent next year. Higher duties on imports into the U.S. are weighing on exports from many countries. As a result, the bank has trimmed its growth forecasts not only for America but also for other major economies, including the eurozone, Japan, and India.

Mexico faces the biggest setback among large nations, with its growth forecast now at only 0.2 percent in 2025, compared with the 1.5 percent growth projected in January. Globally, the bank now sees total global output rising by 2.3 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2026, down from its earlier forecast of 2.7 percent for both years. “Global growth prospects have deteriorated,” said Indermit Gill, the World Bank’s chief economist. “Without a swift course correction, the harm to living standards could be deep.” The bank cautioned that if tariffs were raised further beyond late-May levels, such as the additional increases announced on April 2, and then paused for 90 days to allow talks to continue, the slowdown could deepen. In a scenario where import duties climbed by another 10 percentage points, global growth would shrink to just 1.8 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 2026, its analysts calculate. They added that such a sudden jump in trade barriers would cause cross-border commerce to stall in the second half of the year. It would also trigger a sharp loss of business and consumer confidence, heightened uncertainty, and turbulence in financial markets. Fresh projections add to earlier warnings from other international bodies Just last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said U.S. growth might slow to 1.6 percent in 2025, and inflation could approach 4 percent because of higher tariffs. The White House dismissed that forecast as another “doomsday prognostication” that it says bears little relation to reality. Still, the World Bank agreed with President Trump’s observation that before the recent hikes, the U.S. faced steeper duties on its exports than it imposed on imports. Gill urged other governments to cut their own levies to help restore trade stability. “This favorable access to U.S. markets was not a sustainable policy,” he said. “The differences should be reduced quickly and this can only happen if everyone acts in good faith.” 60% of developing economies will see slower growth due to tariffs Several other emerging markets that were not expanding rapidly are now set to do even worse, among them South Africa. Many of these countries export raw materials, and prices for commodities have fallen sharply since the tariff increases dented global demand. The bank expects most will still grow rather than contract, though Iran is a notable exception. “This latest setback will extend a long period of subdued progress for developing economies,” Gill said. “Outside of Asia, you’re not seeing improved living standards. The developing world is becoming a development-free zone.” In its Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank said it has cut growth forecasts for nearly 70 percent of all countries. It now expects almost 60 percent of developing economies to see slower growth this year, a downgrade of 0.3 percentage points from January. Low-income nations as a group are projected to grow by 5.3 percent in 2025, down 0.4 points. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

New crypto coin is attracting interest,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/10/could-xrp-see-sub-2-prices-in-june-new-crypto-coin-is-attracting-interest/,"XRP is teetering on a precarious edge, with crypto charts signaling a potential 19% price drop to $1.71 in June 2025.

Meanwhile, a new crypto coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is capturing investor attention with its innovative DeFi lending model.

This level has been closely watched for months and aligns with a mid-June timing window that many analysts flagged as a possible turning point. XRP Price Analysis: All Eyes on $2.25 and $3.00 According to an analyst , after testing lows near $2.10–$2.20, XRP bounced and is now consolidating just above $2.25. The price is moving within a tight pattern, with resistance at $2.50 and $2.65. A breakout above these levels could push XRP toward the $3.00 mark. A close above $3.00 would confirm a bullish breakout. Volume has been decreasing, signaling that a potential breakout is near. On-chain data also shows rising transfer activity and whale accumulation, often a sign of a big move ahead. XRP Price Prediction Ahead of June 16 Deadline in Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Bullish Targets: $3 First, Then $8 to $13 If XRP breaks above $2.65 and $3.00, analysts expect it could run toward $8–$13, especially if legal clarity improves or ETF news boosts sentiment. These targets are based on wave analysis and long-term chart patterns. According to the analyst, EGRAG CRYPTO , the “Guardian Arch” is a long-term price projection for XRP, pointing to a potential rally toward $20–$27. It’s based on time and structural analysis, assuming XRP maintains its bullish setup over time. Downside Risks: Watch $2.20 A break below $2.20 would weaken the bullish case and open the door to a drop toward $1.80 or lower. If legal setbacks or market-wide corrections hit, XRP could fall to $1.25–$1.50. Traders should also be cautious of sudden pullbacks—even positive news can trigger short-term profit-taking. Bottom Line XRP is nearing a major move. Holding above $2.25 is key for bulls, with $3.00 as the next big test. A breakout could lead to much higher levels, but a drop below $2.20 would flip the outlook bearish. Stay alert—volatility is coming. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-traded-funds-etf-approaches-critical-level-in-trading-volume-here-are-the-details/,"Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which launched in the US in January 2024, are on track to reach $1 trillion in cumulative trading volume in less than 18 months. US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Near $1 Trillion Trading Volume Threshold This impressive growth demonstrates that interest in digital assets continues to be strong among both institutional and individual investors. ETFs, which saw a trading volume of $100 billion in the first two months after launch, exceeded $200 billion in April 2024, while the Bitcoin price reached its highest level in that period at $74,000. However, over the following seven months, the Bitcoin price consolidated in the $50,000–$70,000 range, while the momentum in trading volume slowed somewhat. The market was revived after pro-crypto Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2024. While Bitcoin reached new highs, the trading volume of ETFs quickly exceeded $500 billion. In February 2025, this volume reached $750 billion. As of today (June 9), the total transaction volume is $995.2 billion. With a daily transaction volume of $2.3 to $4.4 billion, the $1 trillion threshold is expected to be passed in a few days. This growth puts spot Bitcoin ETFs in the same league as the world’s largest and most established ETFs, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ). In comparison, spot Ethereum ETFs, which launched in July 2024, have generated only $83.4 billion in total trading volume to date. BlackRock's IBIT Fund Leads the Industry The clear leader in the spot Bitcoin ETF market is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT had a 22% market share at launch, but as of today, it has risen to 79%. BlackRock’s ETF also alone holds $70 billion of the $120 billion in assets under management across the industry. IBIT also surpassed the $70 billion AUM mark in just 341 trading days, breaking the previous record of the gold-based SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF, which had a trading record of 1,691 days, by quintuple. *This is not investment advice.

This is a key step, as it allows Siebert Financial to raise a substantial amount of capital – specifically, up to $100 million – through the sale of various securities over time. What Does This Funding Mean for Siebert Financial? This isn’t just about raising money; it’s about funding strategic initiatives. Siebert Financial intends to deploy the proceeds from this offering to fuel growth aligned with its long-term strategic vision. The company highlighted several key areas where these funds will be directed. These include: Potential acquisitions to expand its market reach or service offerings. Significant crypto investment , targeting prominent digital assets . Development and integration of AI-driven technologies across its business lines. This move clearly indicates Siebert’s intent to innovate and adapt to the evolving financial landscape, which increasingly includes digital assets and advanced technology. Why Focus on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana? The press release specifically mentioned investments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These aren’t random choices; they represent some of the largest and most established cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, as well as a prominent layer-1 blockchain known for its speed and scalability (Solana). Targeting these specific assets suggests a calculated approach to entering or expanding within the crypto space. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold and a primary store of value, while Ethereum is the leading platform for decentralized applications, smart contracts, and NFTs. Solana represents a newer generation of blockchain technology. Investing in this mix could provide Siebert Financial exposure to different facets of the crypto market, from foundational assets to platforms supporting innovation. How Will AI Technology Play a Role? Beyond digital assets, Siebert Financial is also earmarking funds for AI development. Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize financial services in numerous ways. For Siebert, this could mean: Enhancing trading platforms with AI-powered analytics or execution. Improving customer service through AI chatbots or personalized recommendations. Streamlining back-office operations and risk management with automated systems. Developing sophisticated tools for analyzing market trends, including those in the digital assets space. Integrating AI could lead to greater efficiency, improved client experiences, and more sophisticated operational capabilities, positioning Siebert Financial for future challenges and opportunities. What Does This Signal for Traditional Finance and Crypto? Siebert Financial’s decision to explicitly allocate significant funding towards crypto investment and AI is a notable event. It reflects a growing trend among traditional financial institutions recognizing the importance and potential of these emerging technologies. While some firms have been hesitant, others are actively exploring ways to incorporate digital assets and AI into their core strategies. This move by Siebert could be seen as a validation of the increasing relevance of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum within broader investment portfolios. For investors, this could mean Siebert Financial might eventually offer more direct access to crypto markets or integrate crypto insights into their existing services. It highlights the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. Are There Challenges Ahead? While the potential is significant, navigating the crypto and AI landscapes isn’t without challenges. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, which can impact investment values. Regulatory environments for digital assets are also still evolving, requiring careful navigation. Implementing new AI technologies requires substantial expertise, infrastructure investment, and careful consideration of ethical implications and data privacy. Siebert Financial will need to carefully manage these risks as it executes its strategic plan. The success of their venture will depend on market conditions, regulatory developments, and the effectiveness of their technology integration. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards the Future Siebert Financial’s plan to raise up to $100 million, with a clear intent to invest in crypto investment (including Bitcoin , Ethereum , and Solana) and AI technology, marks a bold step. It demonstrates a commitment to adapting and innovating in a rapidly changing financial world. This strategic funding positions Siebert to explore new revenue streams, enhance its technological capabilities, and potentially attract a new generation of clients interested in digital assets . It’s a clear signal that established players are increasingly looking towards the future, where traditional finance and decentralized technologies may coexist and even converge.

The executive chairman of MicroStrategy (now Strategy) made the recommendation today shortly after American TV personality Jim Cramer criticized Apple’s stock buyback program. Apple Stock Buyback Program ‘Not Working’For perspective, Apple commenced a $110 billion stock buyback program last year. The move was part of an effort to boost the stock’s price by reducing the number of outstanding shares in the market. Over a year after commencing the initiative, Apple’s stock has plummeted significantly, with its price down 17.13% year-to-date. Following the devastating collapse, Cramer took to X today to criticize Apple’s stock buyback initiative, suggesting that the program is not working. The popular TV personality suggested that Apple should either abandon the initiative to ‘earn a lot’ or integrate with some of the stock. Saylor Urges Apple to Buy BitcoinIn response, Saylor stated that Apple should buy Bitcoin rather than repurchase its shares. https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1932378535676781013Saylor’s commentary does not come as a surprise as the Strategy chairman has been a major Bitcoin advocate since the company acquired its first BTC in August 2020. The Bitcoin advocate has been encouraging retail and institutional investors to acquire BTC as a shield against economic uncertainties. Strategy has continued to express its belief in Bitcoin by scooping Bitcoin almost weekly. Yesterday, Saylor announced that Strategy purchased another 1,045 BTC for $110.2 million. This boosted Strategy’s Bitcoin stash to 582,000 BTC, which is worth approximately $40.79 billion. However, with Bitcoin currently trading at $109,005, Strategy’s Bitcoin portfolio is currently worth $63.44 billion, representing an ROI of over $20 billion. Performance of Apple and Strategy’s Shares Meanwhile, Strategy’s Bitcoin exposure has positively impacted the price of its shares. While Apple’s stock has declined 17.13% since the start of the year, Strategy’s stock has surged 30.26% in the same timeframe. Moreover, Apple’s shares have experienced a slight surge of 5.14% over the past year compared with a 143.98% increase in Strategy’s stocks. Based on the incredible performance of Strategy’s shares, driven by its strong Bitcoin ties, Saylor believes Apple could boost the value of its stock by acquiring BTC. Widespread Adoption of Bitcoin Among Corporate Entities In the meantime, corporate entities are steadily joining the Bitcoin bandwagon and adding BTC to their balance sheets. Although Strategy is spearheading the corporate acquisition of Bitcoin, companies such as Metaplanet , GameStop, and Tether have also purchased significant amounts of BTC. Saylor expects more companies to follow suit in the coming weeks, joining the more than 100 public firms that currently hold BTC in their balance sheets. In his view , companies holding Bitcoin are likely to succeed compared to those that do not own the premier asset. He recently expressed confidence in his $13 million prediction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Saylor emphasized that he is more bullish about the forecast due to factors like increased institutional adoption, a supply squeeze, and regulatory clarity.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Michael Saylor News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 15:40:54

Early Tuesday dip sees Bitcoin retrace 1% to $109,100. Golden cross at $105,400 reinforces bullish momentum. By Artem Shendetskii Bitcoin's price ( BTC-USD ) started the second week of June 2025 on a strong note, rallying by 4.5% on Monday to reach a high at $110,600. This marks the fourth consecutive daily gain and extends its bullish momentum deeper into all-time high territory. What made Monday’s move significant was the increase in trading volume, which exceeded that of the previous three days, highlighting strong conviction from buyers. The surge pushed Bitcoin to within 1.3% of its all-time high at $112,000, setting the tone for potential upside continuation. However, early Tuesday trading has seen some pullback. The price declined gradually from the Monday close and is currently down 1% on the day, trading near $109,100 as of the European session. The slight drop has reduced this week’s cumulative gain to 3.5%, although the month-to-date performance still holds a solid 4.2% advance. BTC price dynamics (Jan - June 2025). Source: TradingView This retracement does not come unexpectedly. On the 4-hour chart, Monday’s price surge pushed the RSI indicator into overbought territory, which likely triggered some profit-taking by short-term traders. Bitcoin golden cross at $105,400 solidifies short-term bullish bias The technical backdrop, however, still paints a bullish picture. Monday’s surge caused a golden cross formation at $105,400 on the 4-hour timeframe. The 20 EMA crossed above both the 50 and 100 EMAs, and the 50 EMA also moved above the 100 EMA, reinforcing upward price momentum. This golden cross now places the 20 EMA around the $107,000 zone, a level that could act as the first line of defense in the event of deeper intraday pullbacks. Despite today’s mild decline, the broader trend remains supported by the daily RSI, which continues to hover in bullish territory without flashing any fresh overbought warnings. If the price finds support at $107,000 and volume steps back in, Bitcoin may resume its ascent. The key barrier to break is the $110,775 supply level. A decisive move above that level could open the path toward testing the all-time high at $112,000. Unless selling pressure intensifies below $107,000, the outlook leans toward a potential recovery in the upcoming sessions, fuelled by the ongoing technical strength and momentum. Bitcoin extends three-day rally from a four-week low but faces intraday resistance . Key EMAs converge to form a critical support zone around $105,350.

The move comes after Guggenheim’s first rollout of its digital commercial paper product last year on Ethereum. Since that launch, over $280 million has been issued, and the new partnership with Ripple now brings that same product to a different chain, according to a report by Bloomberg. Ripple is backing the launch with a $10 million investment into the Treasury-backed asset, according to Markus Infanger, senior vice president at RippleX. “We’re also exploring its use in payments and looking at ways to make it purchasable with our stablecoin,” Markus said. He didn’t give a timeline on when the stablecoin would launch, but the strategy makes it clear Ripple isn’t treating this as a one-off. Ripple injects $10 million and eyes payments use The product—fully secured by US Treasuries and issued with maturity options up to 397 days—is available daily and built to suit institutional demand. It’s being managed using the Zeconomy platform. That means it’s tokenized from start to finish, from investment to settlement, and can be handled entirely on-chain without needing middlemen. The XRP Ledger is currently one of the smaller players in the crypto tokenization space. Excluding stablecoins, the network only holds around $117 million in tokenized assets. In contrast, the total amount of real-world tokenized assets tracked across blockchains sits at $23.4 billion. Most of that is tied up in Ethereum and private networks. But Ripple isn’t trying to compete on size yet—it’s focusing on function. It’s also running pilot tests to connect real estate deeds directly to blockchain tokens, essentially turning home ownership into on-chain entries. This push puts Ripple in line with other traditional finance giants entering the same race. Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Galaxy Digital, the investment firm run by Michael Novogratz, are also building tokenization strategies. Galaxy is reportedly in discussions with US regulators to tokenize its own shares. Tokenization struggles with adoption and regulators The big issue remains adoption. Outside of stablecoins, tokenized assets haven’t picked up momentum. Only around 67,530 entities—mainly institutions—hold tokenized financial assets right now. That’s just a fraction of the overall market, and it makes up only 0.003% of the total value of global assets, based on figures from rwa.xyz. A lot of that has to do with US regulations. Over the past several years, regulators under previous administrations pushed financial institutions to avoid crypto altogether. Tokenized securities, even though they follow the same rules as traditional assets, were often lumped into the same “high-risk” category as shitcoins. That drove big banks and wealth managers toward AI investments instead. They just didn’t want the legal headache. Now though, as President Trump is back in the White House and the 2025 environment shifts, some of that resistance might start to ease. A bunch of money market funds are already planning to issue tokenized versions backed by US Treasuries. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is even reviewing guidelines to let tokenized assets be used as collateral—a key step if this sector is going to get serious. Despite the excitement, not everyone’s sold. Some players in the space are warning about overreach. They say that tokenizing everything could lead to unnecessary risks. Things like hacks, regulatory confusion, and increased investor fees are real problems. There’s also concern that certain assets—especially illiquid ones like real estate or hard-to-sell bonds—might get tokenized when they shouldn’t be, just to chase hype. A 2024 report from Opimas, a research firm, warned that many tokenization startups are either cash-strapped or close to shutting down completely. Ripple and Guggenheim are betting that anchoring to real-world assets like US Treasuries might be the one model that actually sticks.

This rise in expectations comes right after the approval of the NCISU index, which includes XRP alongside other alts. As a result, the price of XRP crypto pushed to a high of June 2025 with a nearly 10% rise seen in the last four 4-daily sessions, and 4% in intraday. Now, the growing optimism for XRP is being flooded everywhere on X, where experts are now targeting a $20 minimum target, if the key catalyst plays well. Why XRP Price Growth Depends On Lawsuit Outcome? So far, the long-running Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit has been a huge hindrance in suppressing the XRP price action over the years, and even now, today, its shadow continues to loom. Although the court’s rulings have been leaning toward a favorable outcome for Ripple. favour after several arguments made, and motions filed, its XRP price action is stuck around $2. There is yet to be a final conclusion to the legal battle before the crowd goes all in for XRP. Moreover, this legal decision will soon declare the final verdict, as the granted 60-day deadline is coming to an end on June 16. If the courts rule in favour, then this could spark a fresh rally in XRP price and possibly drive new investments. BREAKING SEC Decision on Franklin Templeton Spot $XRP ETF Set for Thursday, June 17! pic.twitter.com/vHTDAprxFF — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 8, 2025 As the final verdict is heard, the odds of clearing XRP ETF would accelerate as Franklin Templeton, which has filed a spot XRP ETF application for the Franklin XRP Fund, has an intermediate deadline of June 17. This date is very crucial as it would be just after the final verdict. On this date, the SEC is required to submit a status report regarding the progress towards resolving the case with Ripple. Both events are catalystic; if they successfully end in XRP’s favor, then reaching previous ATH would be a piece of cake for the crypto. This makes June a key month to watch for future moves in XRP’s price action. In addition, there have also been advances in global liquidity, and as the equity market and Bitcoin are expected to advance, the XRP price will increase in tandem as one of the top 5. Guardian Arch Could Take XRP Price To $20 Or Beyond The EGRAG has posted an analysis where his data points on a monthly chart show a guardian arch, which he claims is critical for the upcoming rise. He highlighted past movements in the guardian arch, and he predicts that future movements will be respected by this arch, too. He highlighted that this year in January, like past movements when arch resistance was hit, similar to that, XRP met the Arch at the $3.4 price peak in January 2025. Based on his analysis, he believes that XRP still has another uptrend left in the current bull run. Per his chart, by year-end, the measured move sets a target of $20 for when XRP breaches the Guardian Arch. Nonetheless, his chart highlights the possibility of a higher upsurge to $27. #XRP – The Guardian Arch ($20-$27): Key Targets and Strategy By now, you should understand what I mean about targeting double digits. But please, I urge you, don’t wait for just one target to sell. Always take profits rationally and set clear, specific targets. I can’t stress… pic.twitter.com/ORiSEszwic — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 9, 2025 When these levels are manifested, he believes the next phase could be harsh for XRP, possibly leading to a massive price plunge. According to him, the downtrend could resemble the 2021 drop, leading to an 86% decline. So he urges caution and periodic profit booking to investors. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A proposed bill could open the door for certain crypto businesses to offer services like credit and lending, directly impacting the possibility of leveraged trading within the country. This development is crucial for anyone involved in or observing the South Korean crypto market. What Does This Proposed South Korea Crypto Regulation Entail? A new legislative proposal is making waves in South Korea’s financial and technology sectors. Lawmaker Min Byoung-dug of the ruling Democratic Party is spearheading an effort to introduce a bill designed to provide clarity and structure for the digital asset industry. The core of this proposal, known as the digital asset basic act, is the potential allowance for specific types of cryptocurrency businesses to engage in credit provision and lending activities. Under the terms reportedly being considered, this capability would not be universally granted. Instead, it would be limited to companies that operate in distinct areas of the crypto ecosystem: Digital Asset Trading Platforms: Exchanges where users buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Brokerage Services: Firms facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. Custody Providers: Entities holding and securing digital assets on behalf of clients. This targeted approach suggests a cautious move towards integrating more complex financial instruments into the regulated crypto framework. Why Introduce a Crypto Bill Allowing Leverage? The primary motivation behind this legislative push appears to be the elimination of legal ambiguity. Currently, the absence of explicit rules regarding credit and lending in the digital asset sector leaves these practices in a gray area. A spokesperson for Min’s office indicated that the provision allowing such activities was specifically added to address this lack of clarity. The concern is that without clear guidelines, the default assumption might be that these practices are prohibited. Introducing a specific crypto bill that outlines the conditions under which credit and lending are permissible provides a clear legal foundation. This not only benefits businesses by defining acceptable operations but also potentially offers a framework for regulatory oversight, aiming to protect investors while fostering market development. Potential Impact on Leveraged Trading While the bill focuses on credit and lending, a direct consequence of allowing these activities for trading and brokerage firms is the potential enablement of leveraged trading. Leveraged trading allows investors to gain larger exposure to an asset’s price movements than their initial capital would normally permit, by borrowing funds. In the crypto market, this can amplify both potential gains and losses. By permitting regulated entities to offer credit, the bill could pave the way for these platforms to facilitate leveraged positions. This could significantly change the trading dynamics within South Korea, potentially increasing trading volumes and attracting more sophisticated traders, but also introducing higher levels of risk. Benefits of Clear Digital Asset Regulation Moving from a state of legal uncertainty to clear regulation offers several potential benefits for the South Korean digital asset market: Increased Market Maturity: Explicit rules can help the market mature by defining acceptable practices and encouraging responsible behavior among participants. Enhanced Investor Protection: While leverage adds risk, regulating the entities offering it allows for the implementation of safeguards, disclosure requirements, and suitability checks that might not exist in an unregulated environment. Business Innovation: Clear rules empower businesses to innovate and offer new financial products and services within a defined legal framework, potentially attracting more investment and talent to the sector. Reduced Gray Market Activity: By bringing activities like credit and lending into the regulated fold, the bill could reduce the incentive for businesses and individuals to engage in these practices through less scrupulous, unregulated channels. Global Competitiveness: As other jurisdictions develop clearer crypto regulations, South Korea’s proactive steps help maintain its position as a key player in the global digital asset space. Challenges and Risks Associated with Leveraged Trading While the proposed crypto bill aims for clarity, the introduction of leverage possibilities is not without its challenges and risks: Increased Risk for Investors: Leveraged trading significantly amplifies losses. A small adverse price movement can lead to rapid liquidation of positions, potentially resulting in investors losing more than their initial investment. Market Volatility: The availability of leverage can potentially increase market volatility, as large leveraged positions can exacerbate price swings during periods of high trading activity or stress. Regulatory Complexity: Implementing and enforcing regulations around crypto credit and leverage requires sophisticated oversight mechanisms and expertise from regulatory bodies. Risk of Systemic Issues: While less likely under regulation, poorly managed leverage exposure within platforms could theoretically pose risks if not adequately capitalized and monitored. Regulators will need to carefully consider these risks and implement robust safeguards, including margin requirements, risk disclosure rules, and capital adequacy standards for the businesses offering these services. Actionable Insights for Market Participants What does this potential South Korea crypto regulation mean for you, whether you are an investor, a business, or simply interested in the market? For Investors: Stay informed about the specifics of the bill as it progresses. If leverage becomes available on regulated platforms, understand the significant risks involved before engaging in leveraged trading. Prioritize learning about margin calls and liquidation mechanisms. For Businesses: If you are a digital asset trading platform, brokerage, or custody provider in South Korea, prepare to understand the potential new compliance requirements and opportunities this bill could create. Consult legal and regulatory experts. For Observers: This development is a key indicator of how major economies are grappling with integrating complex financial activities into the crypto framework. Watch how the debate unfolds and the final form of the legislation. The proposed digital asset basic act represents a significant step towards formalizing aspects of the crypto market in South Korea. By addressing the legal ambiguity surrounding credit and lending, it opens the door to services like leveraged trading under a potentially regulated umbrella. While this brings opportunities for market growth and innovation, it also necessitates careful consideration of the amplified risks. The progression of this crypto bill will be closely watched by the global digital asset community as South Korea navigates the path towards clearer, albeit potentially more complex, regulation.

Now, 47 years later, it may be XRP’s turn to lead the next evolution in cross-border payments. This comparison isn’t just poetic. It reflects a growing consensus that SWIFT, though revolutionary in its time, is no longer sufficient for the speed and scale of modern financial systems. As the world shifts toward blockchain-based infrastructures, Ripple and the XRP Ledger are emerging as the natural successors to SWIFT’s aging framework. From Telex to SWIFT: A Necessary Upgrade Telex, developed in the 1930s, allowed banks to communicate payment instructions via typed messages. By the 1970s, its inefficiencies—manual processing, inconsistent formats, and slow delivery- became a major barrier to global finance. DID YOU KNOW THAT SWIFT REPLACED TELEX IN 1977? TELEX: 1930-1977 (47 YEARS) SWIFT: 1977-2024 (47 YEARS) NOW IT‘S TIME FOR SWIFT TO BE REPLACED BY #XRP pic.twitter.com/8JNPjRcJP2 — RipplePumpkin (@RipplePumpkin) June 9, 2025 SWIFT, launched in 1977, solved these problems by introducing standardized message formats and a secure network for interbank communication. It brought automation and reliability, quickly becoming the backbone of international transactions for over 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries. But SWIFT never settled funds; it simply transmitted messages. Payments still depended on multiple intermediaries, creating delays and added costs. The Problem with SWIFT Today In an age of real-time everything, SWIFT’s limitations are glaring. Cross-border payments can still take days, involve multiple correspondent banks, and incur high fees. It remains vulnerable to geopolitical restrictions, as countries can be cut off from the network. Its recent upgrade—SWIFT gpi—adds tracking and slightly faster messaging, but still doesn’t address the fundamental flaw: there’s no native settlement of value. As global finance digitizes, a messaging system built in the 1970s is beginning to feel obsolete. XRP: Born for the Digital Era Ripple’s vision, powered by the XRP Ledger, provides a solution tailor-made for the digital age. The XRP Ledger offers near-instant settlement, low transaction costs, and high scalability. Unlike SWIFT, Ripple’s infrastructure enables both the communication and movement of funds , making it a true payment system rather than just a messaging layer. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product uses XRP as a bridge currency to settle cross-border payments in seconds, eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts in destination countries. Already active in over 70 markets, ODL is helping banks and fintechs save costs and reduce friction. The XRP Ledger processes 1,500 transactions per second and settles in 3–5 seconds, with negligible fees. It also boasts an energy-efficient consensus model and supports tokenized assets, decentralized trading, and smart contract functionality through hooks and sidechains. A Historical Moment for Global Finance The symbolism is undeniable. Telex served for 47 years. SWIFT has now done the same. Ripplepumpkin’s post suggests we’re at another historic inflection point, and the facts support it. XRP is not just faster and cheaper; it is purpose-built for instant global settlement in a decentralized, neutral, and programmable financial future. Unlike SWIFT, which evolved from analog roots, XRP was born digital . Its architecture allows seamless integration with CBDCs, tokenized assets, and next-generation financial tools. Ripple’s partnerships with major banks, regulators, and payment firms worldwide continue to grow, reflecting XRP’s increasing relevance in the real economy. The End of One Era, The Start of Another Forty-seven years ago, SWIFT revolutionized finance by replacing Telex. Today, with the same passage of time, XRP appears ready to take up the mantle. It’s not just about improving what came before, it’s about redefining what’s possible. With its unmatched speed, low cost, interoperability, and growing institutional adoption, XRP is primed to replace SWIFT not as a better version of the past, but as the foundation of the future.

Investors are positioning early, expecting that institutional inflows could catapult both assets into new price territory. SOL continues to show strength as one of the top cryptocurrencies while XRP remains a favorite among those searching for the best crypto to invest in thanks to its expanding real-world use case and legal clarity. However while legacy altcoins await regulatory catalysts, savvy traders are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a DeFi token under $1 now trending as the next crypto to explode in 2025. The project is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already more than $10.3 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance with 11,800 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. Solana and Ripple Navigate Market Volatility Amid ETF Speculation At the moment, Solana (SOL) is being traded at $152 which is up by 2.7% from yesterday’s close. Although there have been recent ups and downs, Solana’s strong standing in the market is supported by its speedy blockchain and more DeFi applications using it. At the moment Ripple (XRP) is worth about $2.18 which is a rise of 2.35% in the last 24 hours. More investors are showing optimism about XRP which has stabilized its price due to ETF speculation and greater interest from institutions. A breakout past $2.60 may trigger a rise to the $5 zone according to analysts, mainly if something good like the approval of ETFs happens. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steam as a Rising DeFi Player Mutuum Finance is attracting even greater investor interest with its growing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technology and crypto lending features, the platform has already raised over $10.3 million and built a community of 11,800 holders. Currently, MUTM tokens trade at $0.03, with the following presale round having the price rise to $0.035. The early investors will achieve returns of up to 100%, with the token debuting at a price of $0.06. Increasing Credibility with Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s groundbreaking lending infrastructure is reshaping decentralized markets while cementing its reputation in the DeFi space. A huge milestone was achieved with the successful conduct of a smart contract audit by Certik a move that drastically boosts investor trust. With this seal of approval Mutuum Finance is now among the top crypto projects to watch. Mutuum Finance’s Leaderboard Feature To further tap into its users, Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard-based gamification featuring the top 50 token owners in real time. The leaders will receive bonus tokens, creating a fun, competitive way to drive more users up the board and remain there, combining social activity with DeFi strategy. Early Investors Rewarded as Community Continues to Grow As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Mutuum Finance has raised $10.3M, welcomed more than 11,800 investors and gone from a price of $0.01 to $0.03. The project is one of the most promising DeFi ventures of 2025.

According to CNBC, this marks Uber’s first foray into “Level 4” autonomy in the region, meaning the cars can operate independently without a safety driver on board. Initiative to push Uber closer to autonomous travel In this partnership with Wayve, a London-based startup backed by SoftBank, Uber aims to bring driverless journeys to passengers in London. Wayve’s AI Driver software teaches vehicles to interpret complex urban environments, reacting in real-time to everything from temporary traffic lights to pedestrians and cyclists. The same breed of self-driving cars already shuttles passengers in San Francisco under Google’s Waymo banner, and global “robotaxi” ventures are vying to match or surpass those early efforts. According to Uber’s president and COO, Andrew MacDonald, teaming up with Wayve pushes the ride-hailing giant closer to its long-held goal of making autonomous travel both safe and dependable. Alex Kendall, Wayve’s CEO and co-founder, echoed that sentiment; he called the initiative “a defining moment for UK autonomy.” “With Uber and a global OEM partner, we’re preparing to put our AI Driver technology into real service on the streets of London.” – Kendall. Kendall added that alongside Uber and a major vehicle manufacturer partner, Wayve is ready to unleash its AI Driver on London’s streets. This is not the first time that the two companies have collaborated. They have partnered previously with Uber participating in a fundraising round for Wayve in August last year, when they planned to bring Wayve’s self-driving technology to Uber’s platform. The firm has to navigate the regulatory pathways Crucial to this pilot is the UK Department for Transport’s new “accelerated framework” for limited commercial autonomous services, drafted last year under the Autonomous Vehicles Act. That legislation passed in 2024 lays the groundwork for self-driving cars to begin operating by 2026. With this lighter regulatory touch, Uber and Wayve will collaborate closely with Transport for London and other authorities to secure the necessary approvals before allowing rides without a safety driver. While details are still being finalized, Uber has signaled that the driverless option could seamlessly integrate into its existing UK app, mirroring its approach in Austin, Texas, where robotaxis operate up to 20 hours a day, seven days a week. And with forecasts from the Department for Transport estimating that autonomous services could generate up to 38,000 jobs and contribute £42 billion to the British economy by 2035, policymakers are keen to balance innovation with social considerations. For now, eager Londoners can look forward to stepping into a back seat rather than taking the wheel sooner than they might have imagined. By harnessing cutting-edge AI and leveraging a newly permissive regulatory landscape, Uber and Wayve are poised to redefine urban mobility, turning the long-heralded promise of driverless taxis into a reality on Britain’s capital streets. For Uber , the initiative comes as the company is also actively championing the crucial role of AI in transportation tech, hoping to leverage the technology for growth.

The rebound unfolded in lock-step with bitcoin’s own recovery from the technically charged $106,800 level to just above $109,000, re-invigorating short-term dip-buyers across the memecoin complex. Dogecoin Needs To Conquer This Price Level Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that the Fib defence has restored bullish structure—but only up to a point. “After coming down to the .382 Fib Dogecoin finally found the support it needed along with BTC finding support at 100K,” he wrote. “As it goes for the immediate future of **DOGE it has a lot of work to do. Big resistance at .19-.21 cent range will need to be broken in order to head back up to that .26-.28 level. Indicators on the daily time frame look bullish.” Bitcoin’s behaviour therefore remains pivotal. Spot BTC is hovering near $109,000 this morning and has so far defended the $106,800 pivot flagged by several high-profile analysts, including Michael van de Poppe, as the “linchpin for a potential rally”. Should Bitcoin extend toward the $120,000-$130,000 band, Kevin argues that Dogecoin will decouple from its dependence on the benchmark “when dominance tops and the market sniffs out easing monetary policy.” Crypto pundit Chandler (“@ChandlerCharts”) is less sanguine. Overlaying DOGE’s four-day price against DOGE/BTC, market cap and a relative-strength oscillator, his graphic highlights three prior compression phases—shaded grey—where the memecoin failed to sustain outperformance against Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bloodbath Incoming? Dogecoin Must Hold This Level To Survive “Even if DOGE breaks above its November highs, it won’t feel great if DOGE/BTC ends up way lower than it was at the November highs,” he cautioned. Chandler calculates that with BTC at $107,600, Dogecoin would have to print roughly $0.52 simply to reach a higher high against Bitcoin. “If BTC runs to $120-130k, DOGE needs to be around $0.60+ for holding DOGE to make sense over BTC.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Going To $1 With The ‘Next Impulse’, Analyst Predicts That threshold underscores the importance of the $0.19-$0.21 supply zone visible on both analysts’ charts. On Kevin’s canvas it coincides with the 0.618-0.703 Fib cluster; on Chandler’s, it overlaps the upper edge of an eighteen-month value area that has repeatedly rejected upside probes. A decisive close above $0.211 would place the May 11 summit at $0.2597 back in play and, more importantly for bulls. For now, traders are watching two numbers: $106,800 on Bitcoin and $0.21 on Dogecoin. A clean break of the latter would validate Kevin’s bullish roadmap toward $0.26-$0.28 and, by extension, keep alive the possibility of Chandler’s higher-high scenario on the DOGE/BTC cross. Until then, the memecoin’s fate indeed “remains in the hands of BTC’s capability in heading higher.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19.

These investment vehicles offer traditional investors an accessible way to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, without directly holding the asset. Recently, the data has painted a remarkably positive picture for these new funds. On June 9th, U.S. spot ETH ETFs experienced a combined net inflow of $52.7 million . This figure, while perhaps modest compared to some days seen by Bitcoin ETFs, is highly significant as it marks the 16th consecutive trading day of net inflows into these products. This sustained positive trend suggests growing investor interest and confidence in the asset class via regulated financial instruments. What’s Driving These Strong Ethereum ETF Inflows? The consistent positive flow into Ethereum ETF inflows is a multi-faceted phenomenon, influenced by several key factors: Regulatory Clarity: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of the necessary regulatory filings (19b-4 forms) was a pivotal moment. Although S-1 registration statements still need final approval for trading to begin, the regulatory hurdle for listing has largely been cleared. This provides a level of legitimacy and certainty that attracts investors who were previously hesitant about direct crypto exposure. Institutional Interest: Large financial institutions often prefer regulated investment products like ETFs. The presence of major players like BlackRock and Fidelity launching their own ETH ETF products signals institutional confidence and provides familiar, trusted avenues for large capital allocation. Market Positioning: Investors may be positioning themselves ahead of the expected launch of trading for these ETFs. Buying into the funds now, even before public trading begins, allows them to secure their desired exposure early. Post-Approval Momentum: Following the SEC’s decision, there’s natural market momentum and media attention surrounding U.S. spot ETH ETFs , encouraging more investors to explore this option. Ethereum’s Fundamentals: Beyond the ETF structure, Ethereum itself has strong fundamentals, including its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader web3 ecosystem. Investors buying the ETF are betting on the continued growth and adoption of the Ethereum network. Breaking Down the Daily Inflows for U.S. Spot ETH ETFs The data from Farside Investors highlights which funds are attracting the most capital. On June 9th, the inflows were distributed among several prominent issuers: Fund Issuer Net Inflow (June 9) ETHA BlackRock $35.2 million FETH Fidelity $12.9 million ETH Grayscale (mini) $4.6 million Other ETH ETFs Various $0 million BlackRock’s significant lead is notable, reflecting the firm’s massive reach and investor trust. Fidelity also captured a substantial portion, while Grayscale’s relatively new ‘mini’ fund (designed as a lower-fee alternative to its flagship product) is also seeing positive movement. The fact that other funds reported no change on this specific day isn’t necessarily negative; it simply means the net activity was concentrated in these three products for that trading session. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Different? Understanding the difference between a Spot Ethereum ETF and other crypto investment products is crucial. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts tied to an asset, a spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, actual Ethereum. This is often preferred by investors because it aims to track the real-time market price of ETH more closely, without the complexities and potential contango/backwardation issues associated with futures markets. The approval of U.S. spot ETH ETFs follows the successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year. The performance and significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs likely paved the way and built confidence for the approval of their Ethereum counterparts. This regulatory step is seen by many as a maturation of the crypto market, bringing it further into the traditional financial fold. What Does This Trend in Crypto ETFs Mean for the Market? The consistent stream of Crypto ETFs inflows, specifically into the new Ethereum products, has several potential implications for the broader market: Increased Legitimacy: The existence and success of these regulated products enhance the perception of crypto assets as legitimate investment classes among mainstream investors and financial advisors. Potential Price Impact: Sustained buying pressure from ETFs can absorb supply from the market, potentially leading to upward price movement for Ethereum. While $52.7 million in a single day might not cause immediate massive spikes, 16 consecutive days of millions flowing in creates a consistent demand floor. Broader Adoption: ETFs make investing in crypto significantly easier for individuals and institutions who are uncomfortable dealing with crypto exchanges, wallets, and private keys. This ease of access can drive broader adoption. Market Infrastructure Growth: The operational requirements for managing these ETFs necessitate robust infrastructure for custody, trading, and administration within the traditional finance system, further bridging the gap between TradFi and crypto. Potential Challenges and Considerations for Spot Ethereum ETF Investors While the inflows are positive, potential investors in a Spot Ethereum ETF should also be aware of potential challenges and risks: Market Volatility: Ethereum and the broader crypto market are known for significant price volatility. While the ETF structure provides ease of access, it doesn’t eliminate the inherent price risk of the underlying asset. Regulatory Uncertainty: Although listing has been approved, the regulatory landscape for crypto continues to evolve globally. Future regulations could impact the market or the ETFs themselves. Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) which can eat into returns over time, especially compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own complexities and costs). Tracking Error: While aiming to track the spot price, ETFs can sometimes deviate slightly due to operational factors, though this is typically minimal for well-managed funds. Not Direct Ownership: Owning an ETF share is not the same as owning ETH directly. Investors do not have control over the underlying ETH (e.g., for staking, using in DeFi, or participating in network governance), which are key aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors For those considering exposure to Ethereum, the availability and performance of U.S. spot ETH ETFs offer a new pathway. The sustained inflows suggest a positive market reception. However, it’s crucial to: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand both the potential benefits and the significant risks associated with investing in volatile assets like Ethereum and the ETFs that track them. Consider Your Investment Goals: Determine if an ETF aligns with your objectives regarding ease of access, long-term holding, and risk tolerance. Compare Products: Once trading launches, compare the different ETH ETFs available, paying attention to issuers, fees, and trading volume. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor who can help you assess if this investment fits into your overall financial plan. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice. Investing in cryptocurrencies and related products like ETFs is highly speculative and involves significant risk of loss. Conclusion: A Bullish Sign for Ethereum’s Integration into Finance The consistent flow of capital into U.S. spot ETH ETFs , highlighted by the impressive $52.7 million inflow on June 9th and the streak of 16 consecutive positive days, is a powerful indicator. It underscores growing investor confidence and the increasing integration of Ethereum into traditional financial markets. While the journey for these products is just beginning, the initial reception, particularly the sustained positive inflows led by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, paints a promising picture for the future accessibility and adoption of Ethereum as an asset class through regulated ETF structures. This trend is a significant development for the entire crypto ecosystem, signaling a maturing market attracting serious capital.

Pi coin ( PI ) token was trading at $0.63 on Tuesday, June 10, where it has remained since May 31. It has dropped by 62 percent from its highest point in March and is well below its all-time high of $3. The 12-hour chart suggests a potential Pi coin price short squeeze as the token continues to consolidate. The spread between the three lines of the Bollinger Bands has narrowed, indicating that volatility has declined. In most cases, a narrowing spread in these bands leads to a strong bullish breakout. A recent example, covered here , occurred in May when the token surged 175 percent to a high of $1.6660. Similarly, the historical volatility indicator has plunged to 22.24, its lowest level since May 7. It has dropped sharply from last month’s high of 356.87. The Average True Range indicator, another key volatility measure, has fallen to 0.025, also its lowest level since May 6. Pi Network has also formed a double-bottom pattern with support at $0.5850 and a neckline at $1.6708. You might also like: The crypto bull run is here: best altcoins to buy now The double-bottom and falling volatility indicators both suggest the potential for further upside, with key targets at the psychological level of $1 and the neckline at $1.6708. These levels are approximately 57 percent and 160 percent above the current price. A drop below support at $0.5497 would invalidate the bullish outlook and point to more downside, potentially toward the all-time low of $0.40. Pi Network price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for Pi coin The first potential catalyst for Pi Network price is the broader crypto market bull run , which has pushed most altcoins higher. Additionally, there are signs that Pi’s social media activity is increasing. Santiment data shows social dominance rising to 0.276 percent, its highest level since May 21 and up from this month’s low of 0.09 percent. Pi token social dominance | Source: Santiment Another possible catalyst is the upcoming Pi Day 2 event on June 28. This annual occasion is considered an alternative to the original Pi Day on March 14. It also marks the end of the .pi domain auction and the Open Network PiFest. Finally, Pi Network may experience a short squeeze if one or more exchanges decide to list the token. For instance, Orca price jumped by 200% after the Upbit listing. Similarly, Axelar, Pocket Network, and Ravencoin prices surged after their Upbit listing.

The bank has announced the upcoming launch of USD CoinVertible (USDCV), a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. This new stablecoin will be available on both the Solana and Ethereum networks . This move positions Societe Generale as the first major European bank to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin on public blockchains. Societe Generale Builds on Previous Stablecoin Success According to the announcement, USDCV will be issued through SG-Forge, Societe Generale’s digital asset division specializing in blockchain-based financial solutions. SG-Forge also works with BNY Mellon, a New York-based financial services company, which will handle custody services for USDCV. This new dollar-based stablecoin follows the launch of EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), a pegged stablecoin introduced by SG-Forge in April 2023. With that product already in place, creating a dollar equivalent became the next logical move for the bank. The U.S. dollar continues to dominate global financial markets and is the main currency in the stablecoin sector. As revealed, the goal of launching USDCV is to offer institutional-grade digital money that a wide range of clients can use. USDCV To Comply With European Crypto Rules Like EURCV stablecoins, USDCV is well-regulated. These stablecoins follow strict guidelines under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which European officials signed into law in 2023 . These regulations were designed to help establish clear and fair rules for digital money. Additionally, USDCV will be a type of digital money called an Electronic Money Token (EMT), which is regulated under MiCA. By following these rules, Societe Generale shows it is serious about safety and trust, making its coins more reliable than many others in the market. Growing Global Interest Toward Stablecoins More people around the world are becoming interested in stablecoins. This news from Societe Generale comes as many banks and companies are looking into stablecoins. Reportedly, some big U.S. banks are working together on new stablecoin plans. Also, Stripe is talking to global banks about using stablecoins in its service. This move shows that banks and companies do not want to fall behind, as the stablecoin market is growing fast. Earlier this month, the total value of stablecoins reached over 250 billion dollars. The market is still led by two large stablecoins, which are Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Many say the entry of regulated institutions like Société Generale may change the landscape. Governments and lawmakers are also paying closer attention. In the United States, a bill called the GENIUS Act is moving forward, even though it has sparked debate. In South Korea, lawmakers have suggested a new system requiring licenses for stablecoin issuers.

BTC faces reversal risk after confirming bearish shark pattern,https://crypto.news/will-bitcoin-continue-rising-btc-faces-reversal-risk-after-confirming-bearish-shark-pattern/,"A newly confirmed bearish shark harmonic pattern has formed on Bitcoin’s intraday chart, pointing to a potential retracement in the short term. With the value area high now under pressure and volume metrics signaling a lack of strong buyer commitment, Bitcoin may be setting up for a healthy pullback into deeper volume-supported zones. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) latest move higher has brought it into technically significant territory, but not without warning signs. A bearish shark harmonic has emerged, suggesting a possible reversal following the recent grind to local highs. As price tests the value area high (VAH), a key inflection point is forming. If Bitcoin loses this level, the next logical targets include the point of control (POC) and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, both offering strong confluence as support zones. Key technical points Bearish Shark Harmonic Confirmed: The pattern signals the potential for a price reversal or retracement from current levels. Critical Support Zones Below: The point of control and 0.618 Fibonacci lie beneath current price, acting as logical targets if VAH is lost. Volume Participation Remains Average: The recent move lacks the explosive profile of a short squeeze, raising doubts about sustainability. BTCUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView The bearish shark harmonic adds structure to the current market setup. This specific pattern typically forms at the end of extended corrective moves and often precedes short-term pullbacks. Bitcoin now faces its first major hurdle: the value area high. Failure to hold above this level could trigger a return to the point of control, which represents the highest volume node within the visible range. A further breakdown may open the path toward the value area low, suggesting a complete rotation within the current trading range. You might also like: Ethereum scales strong, but Lightchain AI leads presale with dev-first design Volume behavior supports this retracement thesis. Unlike previous surges characterized by short squeezes, the current rally has unfolded on average volume, without signs of aggressive forced buying. This weakens the bullish case and opens the door to a long squeeze, a slow unwind of long positions that forces traders to exit as price dips toward lower support levels. What to expect in the coming price action All eyes are now on the VAH. A decisive breakdown from this level would confirm the bearish harmonic and signal a controlled move into deeper support areas. Such a retracement would not only be technically valid but also constructive, allowing Bitcoin to reset within its current range before attempting another breakout.

Changpeng Zhao , widely known as CZ, the influential founder and former CEO of Binance , has made a significant move back up the ranks of the world’s wealthiest individuals, according to the prestigious Forbes richest list . This development underscores the dynamic nature of wealth accumulation in the digital asset space and the enduring impact of key figures like CZ. Who is Changpeng Zhao and Why is His Net Worth Making Headlines? Changpeng Zhao is arguably one of the most recognizable figures in the cryptocurrency industry. As the visionary behind Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, he built a financial empire on the back of the digital revolution. His journey hasn’t been without its significant challenges, including recent legal battles and regulatory pressures that led to his stepping down as CEO. Despite these hurdles, his personal net worth has seen a remarkable rebound, placing him firmly back among the global elite on the Forbes richest list . According to Forbes’ official tracking, CZ currently holds the 24th position globally, boasting an estimated net worth of $65.7 billion. It’s worth noting that while often associated with his origins, Forbes lists his nationality as Canadian. This staggering figure highlights the immense value still tied to his stake in Binance and the broader recovery seen in the crypto market since its recent downturns. How Did Binance’s Founder Reclaim a Spot on the Forbes Richest List? The primary driver behind Changpeng Zhao ‘s impressive net worth stems from his substantial ownership stake in Binance . Even after stepping down from the CEO role, his equity in the exchange remains his most significant asset. The rebound in cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, over recent months has naturally inflated the value of assets held by exchanges and individuals heavily invested in the space. Furthermore, despite regulatory challenges, Binance has largely maintained its dominant position in the global crypto trading market, continuing to generate significant revenue from trading fees, which indirectly supports its valuation and, consequently, CZ’s net worth . Several factors contribute to this financial resurgence: Crypto Market Recovery: The overall positive trend in the crypto market, with major assets regaining significant value. Binance’s Resilience: The exchange’s ability to retain a large user base and trading volume despite regulatory pressures and leadership changes. Strategic Investments: CZ’s personal investments and holdings, likely diversified within the crypto ecosystem. Equity Value: The underlying valuation of Binance itself, based on its profitability and market share. This combination of market dynamics and the inherent value of the platform he built has propelled him back into the upper echelons of the Forbes richest list , solidifying his status as a leading crypto billionaire . The Volatile World of a Crypto Billionaire’s Wealth Being a crypto billionaire means your net worth is often tied to the notoriously volatile digital asset markets. Unlike traditional billionaires whose wealth might be primarily in stable stocks, real estate, or established companies, a significant portion of a crypto billionaire ‘s fortune can fluctuate wildly based on market sentiment, technological developments, and regulatory news. Changpeng Zhao ‘s journey on wealth lists has been a prime example of this volatility, with his ranking and net worth seeing significant swings over the years, reflecting the peaks and troughs of the crypto cycles. While the current trend is upwards, illustrating the potential for massive wealth in crypto, it also serves as a reminder of the inherent risks. A sudden market downturn could just as quickly impact the net worth of even the most prominent figures like CZ. What Challenges Did CZ and Binance Overcome? The road back to a high ranking on the Forbes richest list wasn’t without significant obstacles for Changpeng Zhao and Binance . The company has faced intense scrutiny from regulators worldwide, culminating in a major settlement with U.S. authorities. This involved substantial fines and CZ agreeing to step down as CEO and plead guilty to a charge. Key challenges included: Regulatory Pressure: Navigating complex and often conflicting regulations across different jurisdictions. Legal Battles: Facing lawsuits and enforcement actions from various governmental bodies. Reputational Management: Maintaining user trust and confidence amidst negative headlines and compliance issues. Leadership Transition: Implementing changes at the highest level while ensuring business continuity. The fact that CZ’s net worth has recovered significantly despite these severe challenges speaks to the underlying strength of the Binance platform and the enduring interest in the crypto market it serves. Understanding the Net Worth Surge: Factors at Play Analyzing the surge in Changpeng Zhao ‘s net worth requires looking beyond just the price charts. While rising crypto values are a major component, the operational performance of Binance is equally critical. The exchange’s ability to adapt to regulatory demands, albeit after facing penalties, and continue providing services to a global user base ensures its revenue streams remain robust. This sustained performance, coupled with the market recovery, provides the foundation for the increase in his estimated wealth. Forbes’ methodology for calculating net worth typically includes publicly available information on asset holdings (like crypto), equity in private companies (like Binance ), real estate, and other investments, while also factoring in known debts or liabilities. The $65.7 billion figure is an estimate, but it reflects a significant positive shift in the perceived value of his assets, primarily driven by the performance of Binance and the broader crypto ecosystem he helped build. Comparing Crypto Wealth: CZ vs. Elon Musk and Others While Changpeng Zhao ‘s return to a high spot on the Forbes richest list is impressive, it’s helpful to put it into perspective alongside other global billionaires. As the original note mentioned, Tesla CEO Elon Musk currently tops the list with an estimated net worth significantly higher than CZ’s. This comparison highlights the scale of wealth concentrated in established tech and industrial sectors, though the rapid ascent of figures like CZ demonstrates the potential for wealth creation in newer industries like crypto. Here’s a simplified look at the top of the list (Note: rankings and figures fluctuate frequently): Rank (Approx.) Name Primary Source of Wealth Estimated Net Worth 1 Elon Musk Tesla, SpaceX, etc. ~$401.4 billion (as per source) 24 Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Binance ~$65.7 billion … other billionaires … CZ’s position at number 24 globally places him among the wealthiest individuals across all industries, not just crypto. This is a testament to the massive scale and financial success of Binance . Actionable Insights: What CZ’s Story Tells Us About Crypto The saga of Changpeng Zhao ‘s fluctuating net worth and his position on the Forbes richest list offers several insights for anyone interested in the crypto space: Volatility is Key: Crypto asset values can lead to rapid increases (or decreases) in wealth for those heavily invested or whose businesses are tied to the market. Regulation Matters: Regulatory actions can significantly impact companies and individuals, even those at the very top. Navigating this landscape is crucial. Resilience Pays Off: Despite major challenges, companies and individuals with strong fundamentals and user bases can demonstrate remarkable resilience. Binance’s Scale: The sheer size and profitability of Binance are evident in the valuation that contributes to CZ’s immense wealth. While most individuals won’t become a crypto billionaire overnight, understanding the factors that influence the wealth of industry leaders provides valuable context for the market dynamics and the potential (and risks) involved in the world of digital assets. In conclusion, Changpeng Zhao ‘s return to a prominent position on the Forbes richest list with a staggering net worth of $65.7 billion is a major headline in the crypto world. It reflects the ongoing recovery of the digital asset market and the continued strength of Binance , the exchange he founded. Despite facing significant regulatory and legal challenges, CZ remains a powerful figure whose financial standing is intrinsically linked to the health and performance of the crypto ecosystem. His story is a compelling chapter in the still-unfolding narrative of crypto wealth.

At this point, BTC, which fell to the level of $ 100,000 a few days ago, rose above $ 110,000 yesterday. While the CPI and PPI data coming from the USA are expected to increase volatility in BTC, analysis company Matrixport said that the upward trend in Bitcoin is expected to continue. Matrixport analysts said that Bitcoin broke out of the symmetrical triangle formation with its recent rise, signaling that the uptrend will continue. Analysts noted that Bitcoin's rally was powered by new capital inflows and gradually easing concerns about tariffs. Analysts also argued that although the inflation data to be released this week is expected to be high and put pressure on the BTC price, it will not be able to disrupt the upward trend. “Bitcoin broke the $106,000 downtrend line and even climbed above the symmetrical triangle pattern. This move indicates a new capital inflow, which bodes well for Bitcoin, and concerns about tariff uncertainty in the market appear to have eased. Although the US May Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to be higher, Bitcoin's current bullish momentum will be difficult to disrupt. Because the US economy is more resilient than expected and as long as Bitcoin maintains $105,075, the uptrend is expected to continue.” *This is not investment advice.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/ethereum-eth-slams-into-key-resistance-ready-to-rocket-higher-price-analysis,"Plenty of price fluctuations are sending Bitcoin this way and that, but Ethereum (ETH) appears to be holding its own. With $BTC in the red, along with a good part of the altcoins, $ETH is up on the day and threatening to break through the $2,700 major resistance. Is $ETH about to break much higher, or is another rejection in the offing? ETH/USD at critical juncture Source: TradingView Going straight into the higher time frame for $ETH it can be seen that the number 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization is at a critical juncture. The price has been in a range during the last few weeks and is right at the top of this currently. If the bulls can tip the price over and into the horizontal resistance band that stretches from $2,750 up to $2,900, the $ETH price could have the chance to consolidate here; perhaps moving sideways for a period until shorter-term time frame Stochastic RSIs can reset. $ETH confirms breakout against $BTC pair Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for ETH/BTC reveals that $ETH has just penetrated the descending trendline, has come back to test it, and is now consolidating above. A higher high has been made, although out in the higher time frame of the weekly, the Stochastic RSI indicators have reached the top, meaning that there could be a longer period of consolidation to come. Huge task confronts $ETH bulls against $BTC Source: TradingView Zooming out into that weekly time frame for ETH/BTC the sheer size of the task confronting the $ETH bulls becomes apparent. While $ETH is up 40% against its $BTC pair recently, this is still a drop in the ocean compared to what needs to be done. It can be noted just how strong the current horizontal resistance level is. However, the bulls have to start somewhere and if this level can be overcome, the next resistance is at 0.03 BTC. The $ETH bulls will need all the luck they can get.

The result is often a shift in blockchain adoption—one that many miss until it’s too late. Right now, Qubetics ($TICS), GateToken, and Bitget Token are sending unmistakable signals. Updated figures show GateToken trading at $18.43 with a daily volume of $11.8M, and Bitget Token climbing to $4.74 backed by $22M+ in daily activity. Meanwhile, Qubetics has shattered presale records, surpassing millions in early-stage participation. Qubetics ($TICS) emerges as a strategic solution to persistent inefficiencies in real-world asset tokenization, offering a more integrated and transparent framework. Traditional digital assets have failed to fully bridge the gap between tangible assets and decentralized finance. But Qubetics has engineered a more robust path forward. With a deep-rooted foundation in solving real economic challenges—like liquidity fragmentation and legacy transfer delays—Qubetics is becoming a favored contender among those searching for the best crypto to buy now. It’s time to examine what sets each of these projects apart. Qubetics: Real World Problems, Real-Time Blockchain Solutions The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace has long promised accessibility, but in practice, it’s been riddled with slow settlements, ownership ambiguity, and regulatory friction. Tokenizing real estate, commodities, or intellectual property has often involved patchwork solutions. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) steps in—its decentralized, compliant platform streamlines ownership tracking, asset transfer, and global access, all in one ecosystem. A logistics network where warehouse ownership or shipment rights are instantly verifiable on-chain. Think about intellectual property royalties paid out in real time as streams are verified. Qubetics isn’t reimagining utility—it’s actualizing it. Through dynamic smart contract infrastructure, real-world asset tokenization becomes scalable. Asset-linked tokens on Qubetics operate with verifiable transparency, eliminating third-party validation hurdles. An agricultural product can be sold globally without waiting weeks for banking rails. A token representing vintage art can change hands in seconds, backed by encrypted provenance data. These aren’t distant possibilities—they’re native to Qubetics’ architecture. As of June 9, 2025, the $TICS presale is in final Stage 37 with a price of $0.3370, already drawing over 27,800 token holders and selling more than 515 million $TICS tokens. The presale tally has exceeded $17.9 million, marking it as one of the most actively watched crypto presale events of the year. Projections indicate that $TICS reaching $1 after presale would reflect 197% ROI, with 1,383% at $5, 2,867% at $10, and 4,350% at $15 post mainnet launch. Those exploring the best crypto to buy now should watch this closely. Qubetics Approaches Final Sale—Scarcity and Demand Build With just 10 million $TICS tokens left and a firm listing price of $0.40, the final phase of the public sale presents a clear closing window for entry. The protocol’s supply has been aggressively reduced to 1.36 billion, immediately increasing scarcity. Analysts anticipate strong post-listing demand due to limited supply and expanded community control. In a scenario where $TICS eventually reaches $10, a $1,000 acquisition at this stage could be worth over $29,000—demonstrating the asset’s long-term upside potential. GateToken News: Steady Surge in 2025 Highlights Real Utility as Ecosystem Expand GateToken, the native token of Gate.io, has proven its staying power in 2025. With a live price of $18.43 and a 24-hour trading volume of $11,809,285, the token reflects consistent ecosystem engagement. It supports transaction fee discounts, token buybacks, early access to new listings, and staking opportunities on the platform. For participants who value long-term functionality, GateToken provides a well-rounded solution rooted in one of the most established exchanges. The consistent 1.20% price increase in 24 hours reflects not a temporary pump, but a pattern of gradual momentum. The token has carved out a reliable niche, ideal for those who want real utility alongside capital preservation potential. Its ecosystem integrations continue to expand, further solidifying its presence as a versatile digital asset, one of the best crypto to buy now. Bitget Token: Strength Through Strategy and Global Reach Bitget Token, currently priced at $4.74 with a 24-hour volume of $22,041,307, represents more than just a trading token—it’s an operational backbone. Designed to support one of the fastest-growing crypto trading platforms, it rewards usage, promotes liquidity, and supports decentralized finance features within its native ecosystem. Its recent 1.92% increase shows mounting demand. Its appeal extends beyond just trading perks. Bitget’s architecture and integrations with lending protocols make its token viable across DeFi and CeFi platforms. These fundamentals, combined with rapidly rising trading volume, make Bitget Token a top candidate for those hunting for the best crypto to buy now. Not speculative noise—just clear signals of a token gaining momentum on a global stage. Why These Three Coins Are Turning Heads in 2025 Each of these projects—Qubetics ($TICS), GateToken, and Bitget Token—is executed in real-time, not waiting for future potential. They’re backed by use cases, trading volume, and rapidly growing communities. Whether it’s Qubetics solving inefficiencies in asset tokenization, GateToken offering long-term utility, or Bitget Token strengthening its exchange ecosystem—each one speaks directly to what digital finance needs today. For community members exploring the best crypto to buy now , ignoring these tokens might mean missing out on one of 2025’s biggest digital finance shifts. Qubetics’ presale continues to attract attention for good reason. GateToken remains a resilient core asset. Bitget Token is becoming synonymous with flexible, incentive-driven participation. There’s still time to be early—but not for long. Those who understand where the numbers are headed know exactly where to position themselves. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What makes Qubetics ($TICS) different from other crypto tokens focused on real-world assets? Qubetics addresses real-time ownership, liquidity access, and global trading by simplifying how physical assets are tokenized and traded on-chain. How is GateToken used within the Gate.io platform? GateToken offers benefits like fee discounts, buybacks, and early access to token sales, making it essential for regular platform users. Why is Bitget Token gaining attention in 2025? With strong integration across trading, lending, and staking features, Bitget Token supports a growing exchange ecosystem and rewards participant engagement.

The question now arises whether they are getting ready for a price pump, perhaps fueled by encouraging news on the ADA ETF front. Stacking More ADA The renowned analyst, going by the pseudonym Ali Martinez on X, disclosed that Cardano whales purchased more than 120 million ADA in the last 48 hours. The USD equivalent of the stash equals over $85 million (calculated at current rates). Martinez’s chart shows that the buying spree was conducted by investors holding between 100 million and 1 billion tokens. He also revealed that, as of the moment, they collectively own 3.14 billion ADA, or approximately 8% of the asset’s circulating supply. The whales’ actions are usually closely monitored by smaller players who may decide to mimic the move and join the ADA ecosystem or increase their exposure. It is also a common theory (or at least a suspicion) that such large investors sometimes have inside information about vital events that can impact the price, which might explain their accumulation (or dumping) efforts. One development that Cardano proponents might be waiting for is the potential approval of the first spot ADA ETF in the United States. One of the companies with intentions to introduce this type of product is Grayscale. Just a few weeks ago, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on the fund until July 15, with its final “yes” or “no” expected to be announced before the October 22 deadline. At the start of the business week, the chances of approval (before the end of 2025) on Polymarket dropped to nearly 40%. However, over the past few hours, the odds briefly surged to 70% and currently stand at 66%. ADA ETF Odds, Source: Polymarket The improved chances come shortly after the SEC greenlighted a NASDAQ crypto US settlement price index, which includes numerous altcoins, such as ADA. Poised for an Uptrend? Cardano’s native token currently trades at around $0.70, representing a 5% daily increase but an 11% decline over the past month. Nonetheless, important indicators suggest that a more substantial resurgence may be on the way. For instance, ADA’s exchange netflow has been predominantly negative in the past several months. ADA Exchange Netflow, Source: CoinGlass This suggests that many investors may have shifted from centralized platforms to self-custody methods, which reduces immediate selling pressure. Meanwhile, some well-known analysts on X, including Lucky, have made bullish predictions about ADA’s future price. Those willing to explore that in detail can take a look at our article here .

On Monday, the company revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved its S-3 shelf registration. This approval allows the Nasdaq-listed firm to invest the money raised in cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence (AI), and possible new business acquisitions. This decision comes as many public companies increasingly invest in digital assets and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. Siebert Financial To Invest in Digital Assets and Technology Siebert clarified that this fundraising effort is part of a bigger plan. The firm wants to expand its technology capabilities and strengthen its position in digital finance. John Gebbia, Siebert’s CEO, called the shelf registration a foundational step for growing the company’s technology strategy. Siebert plans to invest some of the funds in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). These digital assets have become more popular among companies looking to diversify their holdings and tap into the potential of blockchain technology . The company will also explore using AI-powered services to improve its operations and client service. Siebert’s Move Signals Strategy for Long-Term Growth Siebert’s leaders see this capital raise as essential to their long-term growth plan. For context, a shelf registration, like the S-3 type, is designed to allow a company to sell stocks or bonds over time when market conditions are favorable. With approval from the SEC, Siebert can move quickly when new opportunities arise. This will enable the Nasdaq-listed firm to explore fast-growing innovative sectors, including AI and blockchain technology. In addition, the approval also gives Siebert the advantage of not having to raise the full $100 million at once. The firm can offer smaller amounts based on its needs and market trends. Using an S-3 shelf registration, Siebert focuses on growth and innovation as it moves into new areas like crypto and AI. Siebert Follows a Bigger Trend in Corporate Crypto Adoption Siebert’s move is not insolation. Many other companies are increasing their investments in cryptocurrencies. Strategy, led by popular Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, remains the largest public holder of Bitcoin. On the same day as Siebert’s announcement, Strategy disclosed it had bought another 1,045 BTC for about $110.2 million. This brings its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 582,000 BTC. Other firms are also making moves. Trump Media, GameStop, and research firm K33 have all revealed plans to increase their Bitcoin holdings. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet recently launched a $5.4 billion equity offering to buy even more Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's 11.1% climb in May, outpaced gold and broke through key resistance levels, said ARK. Gains also coincided with clear signs of stress in the housing and auto sectors, traditionally seen as pillars of U.S. consumer strength. In housing, the number of sellers has far outpaced buyers, a trend ARK links to the Federal Reserve’s steep rate hikes since 2022. With affordability deteriorating, pressure is mounting on prices in what remains the largest source of household net worth. Meanwhile, auto sales, which surged earlier this year in anticipation of tariffs, collapsed in May — falling to 15.6 million units from above 17 million just a month prior. As these markets soften, bitcoin appears to be catching some of the capital looking for yield and resilience, ARK noted. Spot bitcoin ETFs drew $5.5 billion in May — more than triple the inflows seen in gold ETFs, which dropped sharply during the same period. ARK noted that bitcoin’s current rally doesn’t yet reflect speculative excess. Profit-taking behavior remains measured, with unrealized gains sitting well below the levels that marked prior bubbles.

Here’s Who It Is,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/breaking-potential-replacement-for-jerome-powell-as-fed-chair-revealed-heres-who-it-is/,"US President Donald Trump announced that he will “very soon” announce the name of the person who will replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. Among the names that have come to the fore for Powell’s successor, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s name has increasingly begun to be mentioned. Advisers close to Trump and some outside the administration argue that Bessent is a strong candidate for the Fed chair. Although the formal interview process has not yet begun, Bessent stands out for his role in implementing Trump’s agenda on economic, trade and regulatory policies. As Treasury Secretary, Bessent is expected to play a key role in the selection process for the new Fed Chair. However, it is not yet clear whether Bessent will withdraw from the process during Trump’s decision-making process. Commenting on the matter, Bessent said, “I have the best job in Washington. The president will make the best decision for the economy and the American people.” The White House declined to comment on the matter. Tim Adams, president of the Institute of International Finance, said Bessent is a trusted name in the global financial community, adding, “He’s an obvious candidate.” Adams also said former Fed governor Kevin Warsh is a strong choice. Trump responded to a question about Warsh on Friday by saying, “He’s a very well-respected person.” Bessent has also been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s trade talks with China. “Scott Bessent has proven during a difficult first six months that he can execute Trump’s agenda.

Solana (SOL) continues to shine among the top cryptocurrencies, recently reclaiming bullish momentum as its ecosystem sees renewed activity in DeFi, memecoins, and tokenized assets. SOL’s growing utility and scalability have analysts projecting strong gains, possibly pushing it toward the coveted $1,000 mark by year-end. But while Solana grabs headlines, one new crypto coin under $1 is generating serious buzz for its disruptive DeFi model and low market price, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now considered by some to be the next big cryptocurrency of 2025. The token is owned by over 11,800 investors and has collected capital worth over $10.3 million. Most investors are investing at $0.03 because the next 16.67% increase, to $0.035, is imminent. Those who are getting in now want a 100% profit when the project goes live at the $0.06 price. Solana Eyes $500 in 2025 The latest price of Solana (SOL) is $150.83 which is a tiny increase of 0.02% from where it ended the previous day. SOL is being watched by investors because of its speedy network and increasing number of meme coins. In contrast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) puts great effort into DeFi development. Mutuum Finance Presale Surge MUTM utilizes a two-way lending model that has made the project take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,800 investors have invested $10.3 million in the presale. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors trading in DeFi has become safer more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) $100,000 giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Solana (SOL) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as two of the best cryptos to buy now for investors eyeing major upside in 2025. With SOL potentially climbing toward $400–$1,000 thanks to its robust DeFi ecosystem, and MUTM offering up to 100% ROI before launch—from $0.03 to $0.06—both coins bring distinct strengths to the table. Backed by over $10.3 million in presale funds, 11,800+ investors, and a successful Certik audit, Mutuum Finance’s dual lending model, stablecoin initiative, and early investor rewards make it a standout in the DeFi market.

Phase two of the e-HKD pilot will try moving tokenized Hong Kong dollars across borders. The plan is to swap e-HKD for A$DC, an Australian dollar stablecoin. This could cut settlement times from days to seconds. It may also show how central banks can work together with blockchain technology.

They will swap e-HKD for A$DC and aim for instant settlement. Based on reports, this setup could serve as a model for other central banks.

It brings two big pieces of tech to the table. CCIP handles the cross-chain messages, acting like a bridge between different blockchains. The Digital Transfer Agent, or DTA, deals with compliance. It keeps track of who owns what token and makes sure rules in different countries are met. In May, World Liberty Financial tapped Chainlink for cross-chain stablecoin transfers covering USD1. That earlier deal hinted at what’s possible this time around. Big Names Join The Pilot Visa and ANZ are helping with payment processing for e-HKD and A$DC. Asset managers Fidelity International and ChinaAMC will also take part. Their job is to manage the tokenized funds on both sides. This mix of banks, asset managers and tech firms shows the project is more than a small test. It has real money and real risks involved. Reports disclosed that those risks are managed by a Payment-versus-Payment model. This means funds are only released when both sides confirm they have received the other asset. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Market Moves And Reactions LINK, the token for Chainlink, jumped by 6% after news of the pilot broke. It now trades at $14.70. That rise follows a wider market rally driven by hopes that Bitcoin may hit $110,000 before the week’s end. According to market data, crypto traders often chase big targets. Short-term gains can be tempting. But they can also lead to quick sell-offs if the main story fades. Despite the rally, Bitcoin still tracks the equity swings rather closely. There is a mix of bulls and bears in futures data that suggests some people are not yet convinced this run will last. High volatility can shake out weaker hands at the first sign of trouble. A sudden change in risk sentiment or a fresh macro shock can quickly reverse gains.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May. At the start of June, Tron is trending near the $0.270 range, maintaining its price above $0.268.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 17:31:00

Are you watching the charts? Because Bitcoin price just made a move that’s got everyone talking. After a period of consolidation, BTC has decisively broken out of a significant technical pattern, suggesting that the upward momentum might be far from over. This isn’t just noise; it’s a signal that many analysts believe points towards the continuation of the current bullish trend . Understanding the Bitcoin Bullish Triangle Breakout So, what exactly happened? Bitcoin’s price action recently formed what technical analysts call a ‘bullish triangle’ pattern. This pattern typically occurs during an uptrend when the price consolidates between converging support and resistance lines. The key characteristics include: Converging Lines: A descending resistance line (lower highs) and an ascending support line (higher lows) squeeze the price into a narrower range. Decreasing Volume: Often, volume tends to decrease as the pattern forms, reflecting indecision in the market. The Breakout: A decisive move, usually accompanied by increased volume, breaking above the resistance line. This is the signal that buyers have regained control. The recent price surge saw BTC push above the upper boundary of this triangle, confirming the crypto breakout . This specific type of triangle is generally considered a ‘continuation pattern,’ meaning that once the breakout occurs, the prior trend (in this case, bullish) is likely to continue. What’s Driving This BTC Analysis and Market Sentiment? According to insights shared by crypto financial services firm Matrixport, this breakout isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors seem to be aligning: Renewed Capital Inflows: The technical breakout is often a catalyst, attracting fresh capital back into the market as traders and investors see a clear directional signal. Diminishing External Concerns: Matrixport points to easing concerns over potential tariffs and limited expected impact from upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. While CPI is crucial for assessing inflation and potential Federal Reserve actions (which heavily influence risk assets like crypto), the market seems to be pricing in a scenario where the next report won’t derail the current positive sentiment significantly. This combination of positive technical signals and favorable market sentiment is powerful. When the technical picture aligns with the fundamental or sentiment-based analysis, it strengthens the conviction behind the move. Why Key Support Levels Matter for the Bullish Trend In any market, identifying and respecting support levels is critical, especially after a breakout. A support level is a price point or zone where buying interest is strong enough to potentially halt a decline. For the current bullish trend in Bitcoin to remain robust, holding above key support is paramount. While specific numbers can change as the market evolves, analysts are closely watching previous resistance levels that could now act as support. A successful breakout often means the former resistance becomes the new floor. If the price were to fall back below the breakout level and significant support zones, it could signal a ‘fakeout’ and potentially invalidate the bullish view. Therefore, monitoring these levels is a key part of any sound BTC analysis right now. Navigating the Crypto Market: Opportunities and Risks A confirmed crypto breakout like this presents potential opportunities for traders and investors looking to participate in the continuation of the uptrend. However, it’s crucial to approach the market with caution and a clear strategy. Potential Opportunities: Trend Following: Entering positions based on the confirmed bullish signal. Target Identification: Using technical analysis (like measuring the height of the triangle) to project potential price targets. Increased Confidence: The clear technical signal can boost confidence for those already in long positions. Potential Risks: Fakeouts: Breakouts can sometimes fail, with the price quickly reversing back into the pattern or below support. Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and sharp pullbacks can occur even within a strong uptrend. External Factors: Unexpected macroeconomic news or regulatory developments could still impact sentiment. This is why risk management is non-negotiable. Using stop-loss orders and managing position sizes are essential practices. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Strategy Based on the current BTC analysis and the confirmed breakout, here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor Key Support: Keep a close eye on the price levels that previously acted as resistance and are now expected to provide support. A sustained hold above these levels strengthens the bullish case. Watch Volume: Continued healthy volume on upward moves is a positive sign. Declining volume during rallies or increasing volume on declines could be cautionary signals. Stay Informed on Macro News: While the immediate CPI impact might be limited, future economic data and central bank commentary remain important drivers for the broader crypto market . Plan Your Entry/Exit: If you’re considering entering a position based on this breakout, have a clear plan for your entry point, potential targets, and most importantly, your stop-loss level. Be Mindful of Volatility: Don’t over-leverage. The potential rewards in crypto come with significant risk. Looking Ahead: What Could Drive the Bullish Trend Further? Beyond the immediate technical breakout and current sentiment, several factors could contribute to the continuation of the bullish trend for Bitcoin price : Institutional adoption continues to be a significant narrative. The approval and success of Bitcoin ETFs have opened new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure. Continued inflows into these products could provide sustained buying pressure. Halving events, while already priced in to some extent, reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, which historically has been a bullish catalyst over the medium to long term. Global economic conditions and the actions of central banks will continue to play a role. A shift towards more accommodative monetary policies, if it occurs, could increase appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Technically, traders will be looking for the price to clear subsequent resistance levels on its way up. Each successful break of resistance reinforces the strength of the trend. Summary: Is the Path Clear for Higher Bitcoin Prices? The recent crypto breakout from the bullish triangle is a significant technical development for Bitcoin price . It aligns with positive sentiment indicators like renewed capital inflows and diminishing immediate concerns over macroeconomic data like CPI, as highlighted by Matrixport’s BTC analysis . While the market is always subject to unpredictable events and volatility, the technical picture, supported by underlying sentiment, suggests that the bullish trend has a strong chance of continuing.

45762393,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107204,1749576733,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Analyst Says Ethereum Is ‘Closer to $20K Than Most Anticipate’ Based on This Technical Pattern,https://zycrypto.com/analyst-says-ethereum-is-closer-to-20k-than-most-anticipate-based-on-this-technical-pattern/,"Ethereum (ETH) showed renewed strength this week, clim bing strongly alongside Bitcoin since Monday and edging out of a multi-day stretch of low volatility some jokingly called the newest “stablecoin.” But while the recent price movement may seem modest, some analysts believe the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization could be gearing up for a much larger breakout. According to market analyst Gert van Lagen, Ethereum may be significantly undervalued at current levels. In a post on Monday, van Lagen pointed to a clear inverse head and shoulders formation developing on Ethereum’s two-week chart. This bullish technical pattern often signals a major trend reversal. He projects a potential upside target of $19,500, a price level that would mark a new all-time high for ETH and nearly five times its current value. “ ETH [2W] may be closer to $20k than most anticipate,” van Lagen tweeted , emphasizing that a 1.5-year descending broadening wedge, a separate bullish pattern, is also unfolding, reinforcing the potential for a powerful upward breakout. Elsewhere, analyst Master Ananda added weight to the bullish case, noting that Ethereum recently broke above the 200-day moving average, a long-term indicator that traders often view as a signal of sustained bullish momentum. According to Ananda, this is the first time ETH has moved above this line from a low point since November 2024. “This is massive,” he stated on Tradingview, describing it as one of the most reliable bullish indicators in technical analysis. “ Ethereum is now ready to grow for six months straight, minimum.” Ananda forecasted potential price levels of $5,790 and $8,513 in the coming bullish wave, but cautioned that the real upside could extend far beyond those figures. In the background, activity on the Ethereum network is also soaring, which has historically been a precursor for price growth, according to data from blockchain analytics platform GrowThePie. Additionally, institutional confidence in Ethereum appears to be strengthening. According to a research note by analysts at Bernstein on Monday, Ethereum is entering a critical phase of recognition as a foundational layer for financial innovation. The analysts cited rising inflows into Ethereum ETFs, $815 million over the past 20 days and $658 million year-to-date, as evidence of growing investor interest. They noted that while Bitcoin remains a popular store of value, Ethereum is gaining attention for its real-world utility, particularly in areas like stablecoin issuance and tokenized assets. That said, as global payment firms like Visa, Stripe, and Mastercard build stablecoin strategies, Ethereum’s role in powering these systems is becoming harder to ignore. Bernstein analysts argued that Ethereum is no longer just an experimental protocol but a key player in the evolving digital finance landscape. ETH was trading at $2,739 at press time, reflecting an 6.69% surge over the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-10 17:32:13

The move indicates ever-more mature institutional demand for access to regulated crypto-adjacent equities. The ProShares Ultra CRCL ETF utilizes leverage to deliver the daily performance of CRCL stock twice over, targeting more aggressive investors. The Bitwise CRCL Option Income Strategy ETF will generate yield through a covered call approach and, indeed, will attempt to minimize any downside risk given a covered call strategy that writes out call options on CRCL stock. Both will have effective dates of August 20, 2025. These filings indicate that established finance participants view Circle’s equity as a solid basis for diversified investment platforms, ranging from high-risk leveraged products to conservative income strategies. IPO Sparks Surging Interest and Valuation Circle went public through an IPO on June 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the company started trading at $31 a share. The stock rose to 170% on the first day of trading, but the rally did not hold over until the next morning’s premarket trading as the stock price surged another 16% putting the price over $117 and making the market capitalization of Circle cross $20 billion. Support from leading financial institutions gave the company credibility: BlackRock announced a 10% stake in equity, and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest invested $150 million. World Capital Looks to Circle’s Expansion Circle is not just attracting ETF interest based in the U.S. Japan’s SBI Holdings, via its subsidiary SBI Shinsei Bank, just invested $50 million in a joint venture with the company. The action speaks to Circle’s expanding global institutional appeal. Circle, which created the world’s second-largest stablecoin USDC, is now also the first company to be officially compliant with the EU’s MiCA regulation. This regulatory milestone—alongside its IPO triumph—positions Circle as a gateway between old finance and the new generation of digital assets.

That’s what analyst Colin Langan said in a note to clients this week, according to Wells Fargo, laying out a brutal reality: the company’s sales are slipping, demand is shaky, and price cuts disguised as promos are eating into profits. “TSLA fundamentals of the core auto business continue to weaken,” Colin wrote. The report came with a downgraded $120 price target, a huge dive from the $308.58 closing price on Monday. That kind of plunge would wipe billions from Tesla’s market cap. The issue isn’t just the price tag—it’s what’s going on under the hood. Global deliveries in May dropped 23% year over year, which signals big trouble for a company still pretending things are steady on the surface. Even though official online prices look unchanged, the company has been running aggressive financing promotions that act as stealth discounts, pulling down actual revenue. Pressure builds as Robotaxi launch nears Colin said the buzz around the June 12 robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, isn’t going to be enough to turn things around. “Most investor attention is directed at the June 12th Austin Robotaxi deployment. We doubt the likely limited debut will be enough to overshadow the poor fundamentals,” he said. The Robotaxi rollout, led by Elon Musk, is supposed to be a major moment, but the core problems aren’t going away. And the so-called tailwinds like autonomous driving and tech play don’t hold the same weight anymore. Colin believes they aren’t strong enough to offset how bad the core auto sales have gotten. Meanwhile, Tesla is still under pressure from China, where competition has been heating up, and local EV companies are pushing harder. That’s been killing momentum, especially with Tesla’s pricing edge fading fast. Then there’s the Trump administration, back in power and creating new problems. Fresh tariffs from President Donald Trump could shake up supply chains, but nobody really knows how much yet. The uncertainty is piling on top of everything else. Tesla’s stock is down 22% in 2025 and nearly 10% in June alone. The selloff lines up with the ongoing political chaos between Elon and Trump. The two have been publicly clashing after Elon trashed Trump’s tax cut plans in Congress. Trump fired back with personal attacks. They dragged the fight onto X and Truth Social, trading jabs while the company’s stock kept falling. The whole thing followed Elon’s exit from his short-lived role as a “special government employee” for Trump, where he oversaw something called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Things may have gone quiet between the two in recent days, but the damage is already done.

Kaspa , Sui , and Aptos are among those generating significant buzz. This article delves into their unique architectures and evaluates which could dominate by 2025. Discover the innovative features and competitive edges that set these blockchain projects apart. Kaspa Price Dynamics Show Past Downturn and Critical Levels KAS prices dropped by 18.41% within one month and plunged nearly 45.40% over six months. Price action stayed within a range of about $0.065 to $0.1167 during that period. The decline coincided with shifting market sentiment and dampened momentum. Measurements and statistics during these stretches signaled growing bearish pressure and volatility. Price fluctuations reflected cautious trading as investors responded to short-term setbacks and longer-term fears. Technical readings pointed to resistance areas and hints of recovery. Overall market activity during these time frames highlighted hesitation among traders in the absence of strong bullish support. Current trading sees the coin operating between $0.065 and $0.1167 with the nearest resistance at $0.1496 and the next barrier at $0.2011, while support is pinned at $0.0466. Price levels offer a clear window for decision-making even though a strong trend remains elusive. The momentum indicator at 0.0060 combined with an RSI reading around 45 signals indecision among participants. Bulls appear to be on the back foot after sustained declines, while bears maintain control from previous selling pressure. Traders might consider stepping in near the support level hoping for a bounce or testing resistance for potential short-term reversals. Cautious strategies with tight stop orders enable risk management within these bounds. SUI Price Trends: Analyzing Recent Behavior and Key Levels SUI showed modest weekly gains of 2.18%, but both monthly and six-month performances indicate significant declines of 17.36% and 22.21%, respectively. Price fluctuations have occurred within a specific range, suggesting uncertainty among investors. This consolidating behavior has reflected a period of volatility with limited upward movement. Caution has prevailed in the market, even in the wake of short-term resilience. Currently, SUI trades between $2.77 and $4.01, facing resistance at $4.77 and support at $2.29. The Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.344 indicates waning momentum, whereas the Momentum Indicator at 0.157 and an RSI of 50.07 show a balanced market with no clear dominance. Traders should monitor these key levels closely, as a rise above $4.77 could trigger bullish entries, while a fall below $2.29 may signal bearish opportunities. Aptos Price Movements and Market Outlook Over the last month, Aptos experienced a noticeable dip of almost 19%, and the decline reached nearly 62% over the past six months. A modest gain of about 0.62% in the past week temporarily offset the longer-term downward trend. The price behavior reflects a period of volatility, indicating significant pressure over time. Momentum has fluctuated, with sentiment remaining subdued despite some brief recoveries. Recent weeks showcased an environment where downside risks were more evident than short rallies, marking a challenging period for the coin. The current price trades within a range of approximately $4.08 to $5.83, with key support near $3.43 and resistance around $6.92. A secondary support is identified near $1.68, while an upper resistance near $8.67 indicates a potential barrier for upward movement. Oscillators show a near-neutral relative strength index at 47.99 and a slightly negative moving average recommendation, hinting at an absence of a strong trend. Traders might consider buying near support levels and selling near resistance areas, as bearish pressure continues to dominate while brief bullish signals are challenged. Conclusion Kaspa (KAS) , Sui (SUI) , and Aptos (APT) each offer unique strengths and are all strong contenders for leadership in 2025. KAS focuses on speed and simplicity. SUI emphasizes high throughput and innovative consensus methods. APT offers flexibility and aims for optimal performance. Their different approaches make them appealing to various sectors and use cases. The continued development and adoption of these platforms will determine which one secures a leading position in the tech space. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Understanding these macro movements is crucial for any investor. Recently, the US Dollar has demonstrated strength, largely buoyed by positive sentiment surrounding ongoing trade negotiations, while the British Pound faced pressure following disappointing domestic economic figures. What’s Driving the US Dollar’s Strength? The primary catalyst behind the recent appreciation of the US Dollar appears to be a renewed sense of optimism surrounding international trade talks . Markets are reacting favorably to signals suggesting potential breakthroughs or de-escalation in trade disputes, particularly those involving major economies. Here’s a breakdown: Improved Sentiment: Positive rhetoric from negotiators reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in assets perceived as safer or linked to potential economic growth from resolved disputes. The US Dollar, as a global reserve currency, often benefits from this sentiment shift. Reduced Risk Aversion: As trade tensions ease, the immediate need for safe-haven assets might decrease slightly, but the underlying strength of the US economy relative to others makes the Dollar an attractive destination for capital flows. Economic Fundamentals: While trade talks are a key driver, underlying US economic data, though not the primary focus of this specific move, provides a stable backdrop supporting the Dollar’s position. This strengthening Dollar impacts the entire Forex market , influencing exchange rates globally and affecting the cost of imports and exports for numerous countries. British Pound Hit by Weak Jobs Data Across the Atlantic, the British Pound has been on the back foot. The main factor cited for its recent decline is the release of weaker-than-expected jobs data . Employment figures are a critical indicator of economic health, influencing everything from consumer spending to central bank monetary policy decisions. Key takeaways from the recent data included: Higher Unemployment: An unexpected rise in the unemployment rate signals potential slack in the labor market. Slower Wage Growth: Stagnating or slowing wage increases can dampen consumer confidence and spending, which is a major component of economic activity. Implications for Bank of England Policy: Weak jobs data can reduce the likelihood of the central bank raising interest rates, or even increase the probability of a rate cut, making the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield. The combination of these factors painted a less optimistic picture of the UK economy, leading traders and investors to sell the British Pound . How Do These Movements Affect the Forex Market? The simultaneous strength in the US Dollar and weakness in the British Pound has created significant movement in the GBP/USD currency pair. This pair is one of the most actively traded in the entire Forex market . When the Dollar gains and the Pound falls, the GBP/USD exchange rate declines, meaning it takes fewer US Dollars to buy one British Pound, or conversely, one British Pound buys fewer US Dollars. These movements are not isolated. They influence other currency pairs as well: A strong US Dollar can put pressure on other currencies, especially those in emerging markets or those heavily reliant on dollar-denominated debt. Weakness in a major currency like the Pound can affect its crosses (e.g., GBP/EUR, GBP/JPY) and potentially impact trading sentiment in the European session. Understanding these interdependencies is vital for anyone participating in or observing the Forex market . What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts? While there isn’t a direct, immediate correlation between every Forex fluctuation and crypto prices, macro-economic trends and currency strength/weakness can have indirect impacts relevant to cryptocurrency investors: Global Liquidity: A strong Dollar can sometimes tighten global liquidity as capital flows into dollar-denominated assets. This can potentially reduce the pool of risk capital available for more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Investor Sentiment: Confidence (or lack thereof) in traditional markets, driven by factors like trade talks outcomes or jobs data , influences overall investor risk appetite. Positive sentiment in traditional markets might lead some investors to diversify into crypto, while negative sentiment could cause a flight to perceived safety (though ‘safety’ is debated for both USD and crypto in different contexts). Capital Flows: As investors reallocate capital based on changing economic outlooks and currency strength, some of that capital could potentially flow into or out of the crypto market, especially from institutional players. Inflation/Deflation Concerns: Currency movements are linked to inflation expectations. While crypto is sometimes viewed as an inflation hedge, the dynamics are complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond simple Forex pairs. Observing these traditional market signals provides a broader context for understanding the overall financial environment in which cryptocurrencies operate. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights For traders and investors, whether in Forex or potentially impacted markets like crypto, these developments offer several points to consider: Stay Informed: Keep track of key economic data releases (like jobs data ) and significant geopolitical or trade developments (like trade talks ). These are fundamental drivers of currency values. Risk Management: Volatility in the Forex market , driven by these factors, highlights the importance of robust risk management strategies if you are trading currency pairs or assets indirectly affected by currency swings. Look for Trends: Instead of reacting to every piece of news, try to identify underlying trends. Is the Dollar showing sustained strength? Is the Pound facing structural weakness or temporary headwinds? Consider Correlation (or lack thereof): While correlations between Forex and crypto can be inconsistent, understanding the macro environment helps in forming a holistic market view. Don’t assume a direct cause-and-effect, but be aware of the potential influence of major currency moves on global liquidity and sentiment. Summary: A Tale of Two Currencies In conclusion, the recent performance of the US Dollar and the British Pound offers a clear example of how distinct factors—optimism from trade talks for the Dollar and disappointing jobs data for the Pound—can drive significant divergence in the Forex market . These movements underscore the importance of economic fundamentals and geopolitical events in shaping currency valuations. While the connection to the cryptocurrency market is indirect, these macro shifts contribute to the broader financial landscape that influences investor behavior and capital flows globally. Staying informed about these traditional market dynamics provides valuable context for navigating the increasingly interconnected world of finance.

Today, we delve into the traditional Forex market, specifically the EUR/USD forecast , as analyzed by ING. Their recent commentary highlights a critical point: the popular currency pair is currently stuck in a low volatility environment, and bulls hoping for significant upward movement are likely waiting for a significant market catalyst. Understanding the Current EUR/USD Forecast ING’s perspective on the EUR/USD pair is straightforward. They see the pair consolidating, lacking the strong directional momentum needed for a sustained rally. This lack of movement is directly tied to the current state of currency volatility , which remains subdued compared to more active periods. Think of it like a coiled spring. Without external force (a catalyst), it stays put. For EUR/USD bulls, this means simply wanting the price to go up isn’t enough; the market structure needs a shake-up. The pair is trading within a relatively tight range. Trading volumes can be lower, reducing price discovery. Market participants are hesitant to take large directional bets. What is Driving This Low Currency Volatility ? Several factors contribute to the current soft volatility landscape: Lack of Major Economic Surprises: Recent economic data from both the Eurozone and the United States has largely met expectations or offered only minor deviations. This reduces the element of surprise that typically triggers sharp currency moves. Central Bank Stance: Major central banks, particularly the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed), have entered a phase where their policy paths are somewhat clearer or at least priced in by the market. While rate cuts are anticipated at some point, the timing and pace aren’t causing significant day-to-day swings in expectations. Geopolitical Calm (Relative): While global tensions exist, there haven’t been recent, sudden geopolitical shocks directly impacting the core G10 currencies like EUR and USD to the extent that they would spike volatility. Market Positioning: Sometimes, market participants are simply positioned neutrally, or there’s a balance of opposing views, leading to sideways price action. Why Does Low Volatility Matter for Forex Market Analysis ? Low volatility isn’t just boring; it presents specific challenges and opportunities for traders and investors engaging in Forex market analysis : Challenges: Reduced Profit Potential: Smaller price swings mean less opportunity for large gains on directional trades. Increased Transaction Costs Impact: Brokerage fees and spreads can eat into profits more significantly when price movements are small. False Breakouts: The market might attempt to move out of its range, but the lack of underlying momentum can lead to failed breakout attempts. Opportunities: Range Trading Strategies: Traders can focus on buying at the low end of the range and selling at the high end. Lower Risk (Potentially): Smaller moves can mean smaller potential losses on individual trades, assuming proper risk management. Time to Analyze: Quiet periods allow traders to step back, analyze the fundamental and technical landscape, and prepare for when volatility returns. Understanding the volatility regime is a crucial part of any effective Forex market analysis . According to ING Analysis : What Catalyst is Needed? Based on ING analysis , for the EUR/USD bulls to gain traction and push the pair higher, something significant needs to change the market’s current state. What kind of catalysts could break this cycle of low currency volatility ? Stronger-Than-Expected Eurozone Data: A string of positive economic reports from the Eurozone (e.g., inflation, GDP growth, consumer confidence) that significantly beats forecasts could shift expectations about the ECB’s policy path or the health of the Eurozone economy relative to the US. Weaker-Than-Expected US Data: Conversely, surprisingly weak data from the United States could increase the likelihood of earlier or faster Fed rate cuts, weakening the dollar. Shift in Central Bank Rhetoric: Explicit signals from either the ECB or the Fed about future policy intentions that differ from current market pricing would act as a powerful catalyst. Geopolitical Developments: A new, significant geopolitical event that disproportionately affects one currency over the other could trigger a move. Major Market Shock: A sudden event in global financial markets (e.g., a banking issue, a major shift in commodity prices) can sometimes trigger cross-asset volatility that spills over into Forex. ING’s view implies that without one of these forces, the path of least resistance for EUR/USD is likely continued range-bound trading. The Euro Dollar Outlook : Waiting Game for Bulls The immediate Euro Dollar outlook , according to ING, is one of patience for those hoping for a strong bullish trend. The low currency volatility environment means that minor news events are unlikely to cause a significant shift. Here’s a simple comparison of the current state versus what bulls would prefer: Condition Current Low Volatility Needed for Bullish Trend Price Movement Sideways, small ranges Strong directional moves up Market Sentiment Neutral/Uncertain Clearly Bullish Catalysts Absent or minor Significant, market-moving events Trading Strategy Focus Range trading, patience Breakout trading, trend following This waiting game is a key part of the current Euro Dollar outlook . Traders must adapt their strategies to the prevailing market conditions. Actionable Insights for Traders Given the ING analysis and the current low currency volatility , what can traders do? Be Patient: Avoid forcing trades in choppy, range-bound conditions. Sometimes, the best trade is no trade. Focus on Ranges: If trading, consider range-bound strategies, setting clear entry and exit points at perceived support and resistance levels. Lower Position Sizes: If directional trading, consider smaller position sizes to manage risk during unpredictable, low-momentum periods. Wait for the Catalyst: Identify potential upcoming events (economic releases, central bank meetings) that could act as catalysts and prepare trading plans for potential breakouts. Monitor Related Markets: Keep an eye on bond yields, equity markets, and other currency pairs, as they can sometimes signal shifts in underlying sentiment or capital flows that might eventually impact EUR/USD. Adapting to the environment, as highlighted by the ING analysis , is crucial for navigating the Forex market analysis successfully. Summary: The Waiting Game Continues In conclusion, the EUR/USD forecast , as seen by ING, points to a market stuck in neutral due to soft currency volatility . For bulls hoping for a significant upward move, the current environment is challenging. A powerful catalyst – likely a surprise in economic data, a shift in central bank communication, or a major geopolitical event – is needed to break the pair out of its range and inject the momentum required for a sustained rally. Until such a catalyst emerges, the Euro Dollar outlook remains one of consolidation, requiring patience and adaptable trading strategies focused on the prevailing range rather than strong trends. Traders following Forex market analysis should remain vigilant for the event that could finally shake things up.

Yet a long-term trend reveals that the currency is weakening in real terms. According to historical data, the U.S. dollar has lost approximately 96% of its purchasing power since 1971. In addition to this erosion, the U.S. national debt has surpassed $34 trillion, while annual interest payments have exceeded $1 trillion. This is widely considered unsustainable without continued monetary expansion. As the Federal Reserve prints more dollars to meet obligations, each existing dollar loses value. This inflationary dynamic naturally shifts capital into assets perceived as having stronger long-term value. Pumpius (@pumpius), a long-time crypto investor, shared his opinion on this trend on X, noting that the biggest monetary reset in history is coming, and explaining how this movement could send XRP to $10,000. If you think $XRP can’t hit $10,000… You’re already priced out of the future. This isn’t hopium. It’s math, markets, and macroeconomics. Let me walk you through the biggest monetary reset in human history — and why XRP sits right at the center of it. pic.twitter.com/NI60FREIcJ — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 7, 2025 Real-World Asset Tokenization and XRP’s Role Institutions are beginning to reshape how assets are stored, moved, and settled. BlackRock, HSBC, Citi, and JPMorgan are all pursuing real-world asset (RWA) tokenization strategies, a sector projected to reach $16–30 trillion by 2030. These tokenized assets require interoperable infrastructure and rapid liquidity mechanisms. XRP is positioned to serve as a neutral bridge in this emerging financial system. As an asset designed for cross-border value transfer, XRP enables fast, low-cost, and compliant settlements. Pumpius noted that XRP is engineered for this purpose—designed to support institutional liquidity needs at scale. Ripple’s Infrastructure and Institutional Focus Ripple has already deployed infrastructure that supports institutional finance . Pumpius stated that Ripple’s payment network connects more than 300 banks and financial institutions across six continents.

Ripple has also launched RLUSD, a regulated stablecoin, native programmability on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and offers institutional custody solutions . Understanding the $10,000 Price Model Pumpius argued that XRP reaching $10,000 is not based on speculation but on potential volume and velocity within a redesigned financial system. The projection assumes XRP captures fractions of daily foreign exchange volume, tokenized asset flows, and debt markets. With velocity multipliers and XRP’s limited supply, the result is a very high valuation. The logic rests on XRP acting as a liquidity layer, moving across chains and asset classes. Its programmability, escrow functionality, and native decentralized exchange make it function in roles typically filled by multiple systems. As Pumpius concluded , pricing XRP based on hype misses the broader macroeconomic and infrastructure-driven argument. In his words, “$10,000 XRP isn’t crazy. What’s crazy is ignoring the setup.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

We’re seeing compelling evidence that U.S. Bitcoin demand is experiencing a notable resurgence, driven by factors that suggest long-term conviction rather than speculative trading. Understanding the Surge in U.S. Bitcoin Demand One of the most closely watched indicators for U.S. buying interest in Bitcoin is the Coinbase Premium. This metric tracks the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase, a major U.S. exchange, and other global exchanges like Binance. A positive premium suggests stronger buying pressure on Coinbase compared to elsewhere, often signaling demand from U.S.-based investors, both retail and institutional. According to data from on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the Coinbase Premium has recently reached its highest level since February 3rd, hitting a significant $109.55. This substantial premium indicates that buyers on Coinbase are willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin, a clear sign of robust U.S. demand entering the market. Significant Bitcoin Exchange Withdrawals Point to Long-Term Holding Beyond the premium on U.S. exchanges, another critical data point supporting the narrative of increasing Bitcoin exchange withdrawals. Since July 2024, a staggering 550,000 BTC have been pulled from known exchange wallets. This movement is particularly significant because it often suggests investors are moving their assets into cold storage or private wallets, signaling an intent to hold for the long term rather than keeping funds on exchanges for potential quick selling. Think of it this way: if you plan to sell your Bitcoin soon, you keep it on an exchange for easy access. If you believe the price will rise significantly over time and you intend to hold for months or years, you withdraw it to a more secure, non-custodial wallet. The large volume of these withdrawals points to a collective investor mindset focused on accumulation and holding. What Does the Coinbase Premium Tell Us About BTC Demand? Let’s delve a little deeper into the Coinbase Premium. While $109.55 might seem like a small number relative to Bitcoin’s price, it represents a significant percentage difference that traders and analysts pay close attention to. Historically, periods of sustained positive Coinbase Premium have coincided with strong upward price movements for Bitcoin, as it reflects consistent buying pressure from a major market participant base. The recent spike suggests that despite any recent price corrections or sideways movement, the appetite for acquiring Bitcoin among U.S. investors remains strong. This persistent buying is absorbing available supply, contributing to the upward price pressure observed in the market. Expert Bitcoin Market Analysis on Current Trends On-chain data provides valuable insights, but expert interpretation helps piece the puzzle together. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan weighed in on the trend of exchange withdrawals, suggesting that this behavior reflects a typical pattern seen during a post-correction bullish cycle. In such cycles, savvy investors tend to accumulate during price dips and then move those holdings off exchanges in anticipation of future price appreciation. Another analyst, known as Baykuş, echoed this sentiment, noting that investors are steadily pulling BTC off exchanges. Baykuş interprets this as a clear signal of strong conviction to hold rather than sell. This reinforces the idea that current buyers are not short-term speculators but rather individuals and institutions with a longer time horizon, confident in Bitcoin’s future value. Here’s a quick summary of the key data points and analyst insights: Coinbase Premium: Reached $109.55, highest since Feb 3rd, indicating strong U.S. buying pressure. Exchange Withdrawals: 550,000 BTC withdrawn since July 2024, suggesting movement towards long-term holding. Crypto Dan’s View: Withdrawal behavior is typical of a post-correction bullish accumulation phase. Baykuş’s View: Steady withdrawals signal strong investor conviction to hold rather than sell. Implications of Strong U.S. Conviction What does this mean for the broader Bitcoin market analysis? When long-term holders remove supply from exchanges, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin readily available for sale. With persistent demand, especially from a major market like the U.S., a reduction in available supply can create a supply shock, potentially leading to upward price pressure. The combination of rising Coinbase Premium and significant exchange outflows paints a picture of a market where new demand is being met with reduced selling pressure from those accumulating. This dynamic is often characteristic of periods preceding or during bullish price trends. Challenges and Considerations While the data is compelling, it’s important to remember that the crypto market can be volatile. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and unexpected events can still impact price action. However, the underlying trend of strong U.S. accumulation and withdrawal from exchanges provides a bullish fundamental backdrop that is difficult to ignore. Actionable Insights for Investors For those following the market, these indicators suggest that significant players, particularly in the U.S., are positioning themselves for potential long-term gains. While this analysis is positive, it is crucial to conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Understanding these on-chain metrics can provide valuable context, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from the West The data is clear: U.S. demand for Bitcoin is surging, and investors are backing up that demand with action, moving hundreds of thousands of BTC off exchanges. The elevated Coinbase Premium confirms robust buying interest, while the large-scale withdrawals signal a strong conviction to hold for the future. Coupled with expert analysis pointing towards a post-correction accumulation phase, these trends paint a decidedly bullish picture for Bitcoin from the perspective of U.S. market participation. This confluence of factors suggests that many are anticipating further upside and are securing their positions for the long haul.

Ripple Labs , a major player in the crypto and blockchain space, is making a substantial Ripple investment of an additional $5 million dedicated specifically to advancing blockchain research and nurturing talent across the vibrant Asia-Pacific region. This move signals Ripple’s strong commitment to fostering innovation and education in a key global market. Driving Asia Pacific Blockchain Innovation Through UBRI This fresh injection of capital is being channeled through Ripple’s established University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI). If you’re not familiar, UBRI is Ripple’s global program designed to support academic institutions in furthering blockchain, cryptocurrency, and digital payments research and development. Since its inception, UBRI has partnered with universities worldwide, providing resources, technical expertise, and financial support to build a strong foundation for the future of this technology. The goal? To equip the next generation of engineers, business leaders, and policymakers with the knowledge and skills needed to contribute meaningfully to the blockchain ecosystem. This latest Asia Pacific blockchain focus under UBRI is set to expand its reach and impact significantly. Expanding Reach: Where the Funding Goes According to a recent blog post from Ripple Labs, this $5 million allocation will extend support to institutions across six countries within the Asia-Pacific region. This isn’t Ripple’s first foray into supporting academia in the area, but it marks a notable expansion of their efforts. Key beneficiaries in this latest round of grants include universities in: Taiwan Australia These additions build upon existing, successful collaborations in the region. For instance, UBRI has already committed $1.1 million over six years to Yonsei University in South Korea. Furthermore, institutions in Japan have also received significant backing, with Kyoto University and the University of Tokyo collectively benefiting from a $1.5 million pledge. This strategic distribution of funds aims to create interconnected hubs of blockchain research Asia , fostering collaboration and shared learning across different nations and institutions. Why the Asia-Pacific Focus? The Asia-Pacific region is widely recognized as a hotbed for technological adoption and innovation, including significant interest and growth in blockchain and digital assets. Ripple’s increased focus here is a smart move, tapping into a large talent pool and a growing market for blockchain solutions. Investing in academic research and talent development in this region helps Ripple in several ways: Cultivating Expertise: It helps train skilled professionals who can contribute to the broader blockchain industry, potentially working with or building on Ripple’s technologies like the XRP Ledger.

Within hours of the stablecoin company hitting the public markets, ETF firms scrambled to register new products directly linked to the red-hot stock. Circle, which issues the USDC token, saw its shares triple in value just minutes after trading began — a rare sight in this dry IPO market. That surge cracked the floodgates wide open. By Friday and Monday, Bitwise Asset Management, ProShares Advisors, and REX Financial had all submitted filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for new ETFs built around Circle. Bitwise filed for the CRCL Option Income Strategy ETF, a covered call fund aiming to boost yield. ProShares wants to launch the Ultra CRCL ETF, and REX is pushing for the T-Rex 2x Long CRCL Daily Target ETF, which aims to double Circle’s daily price moves using derivatives. REX also updated a previous filing to speed up the approval process. ETF firms move fast to capitalize on crypto demand These filings landed just as Circle finished its third trading day with a 270% gain, making it the biggest crypto equity debut since Coinbase listed in 2021. The New York-based firm raised $1.1 billion through the IPO and immediately drew the attention of high-risk traders. Unlike other crypto firms, Circle makes money from interest on U.S. Treasuries and other safe assets that back its token. That gives it a different business model from transaction-fee-driven firms like Coinbase. The new ETFs are coming at a time when single-stock funds are seeing a major rise in popularity. So far, in 2025, they make up 16% of all new ETF launches. Bloomberg Intelligence says more than 15 issuers are already in the race, most chasing retail traders who want fast exposure to volatile names. The funds being designed around Circle are among the most aggressive yet. Their expected volatility is nearly double that of ETFs that already got approved. Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said, “It’s an alignment of the stars. It’s a crypto company, so that’s high demand, it’s leveraged, and it’s a market hungry for IPOs.” That combo was enough for these firms to act immediately. Traders react to drop ahead of stablecoin bill vote But the rally didn’t last forever. On Tuesday, Circle stock dipped as much as 10% — the first drop since its public debut. That selloff came just before a key vote on stablecoin regulation, which is scheduled for Wednesday. The crypto industry is backing the bill, and so is President Donald Trump, whose administration has taken a much friendlier stance toward crypto than the last one. Trump’s family-backed firm, World Liberty Financial, has even launched its own stablecoin. Circle currently controls 29% of the stablecoin market through USDC, which is tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. Its approach to revenue — earning yield on reserves — is drawing in institutional attention. One of the first big buyers was Cathie Wood, whose firm ARK Investment Management picked up more than 3 million shares of Circle for its flagship ETF, ARKK, on the day of the IPO. That instantly pushed it into ARKK’s top 10 holdings. ARK also added Circle to its other ETFs. The IPO also signaled something bigger. New crypto firms are lining up to follow Circle to the public market. Gemini, the crypto exchange run by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, has quietly filed for its own IPO. Blockchain.com has been hiring executives and prepping to go public too. And the ETF industry is tracking them closely. Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital, said, “This is the new trend. As certain companies IPO, we are seeing ETFs, and more specifically some levered ETFs, sprout to take advantage of any tailwinds.” After Circle’s huge performance, Bajaj said, “Some ETF issuers are trying to create a product based on it — in hopes that it will have success too.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The broader crypto market experienced a pullback led by Bitcoin’s dip to around $108,923 at press time. However, ADA’s resilience over the past few days, with four consecutive bullish daily candles since Friday, has analysts eyeing a potential breakout that could rival its all-time highs. Popular crypto analyst Javon Marks has reignited bullish sentiment, tweeting that Cardano could surge as much as 666% from current levels. “Using ADA (Cardano)’s previous bull cycle as a guide for this one,” Marks wrote, “ prices could be setting up for another move to and above its 1.272 Fibonacci Level, which is currently at the ~$5.35 price point.” Notably, this mirrors a similar prediction he made in March, reinforcing his long-term outlook based on Fibonacci extension models. If his forecast holds, it would mark one of the most substantial rallies among major altcoins. Marks isn’t the only analyst turning bullish on ADA. Master Ananda also pointed to a consistent pattern of higher lows since June 2023. According to him, recent support zones formed between February and April 2025 suggest a breakout could soon take shape. “Cardano looks great,” Ananda tweeted . “ After four weeks of retrace, we can expect soon higher prices. $2.65 and $4.29 are the main targets.” Adding to the optimism, analyst Trend Rider highlighted a possible “double bottom” formation in ADA’s chart. This is a bullish reversal pattern that, according to academic research, predicts price increases with about 65% accuracy when confirmed by trading volume. That said, the growing bullish sentiment is also being supported by on-chain data. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed Tuesday that whales have accumulated over 120 million ADA tokens in the past 48 hours, based on data from Santiment. Whale activity of this magnitude often precedes price rallies, as it signals rising confidence from influential market players. Beyond price charts and market speculation, Cardano’s fundamental developments are strengthening the case for a long-term rally. On Monday, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced the launch of “Cardinal”, the blockchain’s first Bitcoin-backed DeFi protocol. Cardinal allows users to engage in defi using BTC on Cardano without relying on centralized custodians, utilizing advanced cryptographic tools like MuSig2 and wrapped UTXO. The Cardinal protocol enables BTC to be used across DeFi platforms such as MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens for trading, lending, and collateral, all while preserving full self-custody. Following the announcement, ADA’s trading volume soared nearly 70% to $839 million, with ADA climbing 2.36% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.7 at press time.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-10 17:45:11

Powell’s current term ends in May 2026, but Trump confirmed on Friday at the White House that he’ll announce a successor “very soon.” Though Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, has also been under consideration after being interviewed by Trump in November 2024 for the Treasury Secretary role, Bessent’s name is now being discussed just as seriously. Discussions are active, but formal interviews haven’t started yet, two individuals involved in the planning said. Bessent’s name enters Fed chair race as Trump reshapes economic team Scott Bessent has been leading Trump’s economic team through a push to rewrite America’s trade terms, overhaul taxes, and scale back federal regulations. His current role as Treasury Secretary puts him in a position that traditionally helps guide the process of picking a new Fed chair, but it’s not clear whether he’ll step back from that responsibility now that he’s being eyed for the job himself. When asked about the possibility, Bessent told reporters, “I have the best job in Washington. The president will decide who’s best for the economy and the American people.” Tim Adams, who serves as President and CEO of the Institute of International Finance, called Bessent “an obvious candidate” due to the level of trust he holds among global financial leaders. Still, Adams referred to Bessent as “a dark horse candidate” and said Warsh also remains a credible pick. Trump, when questioned about Warsh on Friday, said, “He’s very highly thought of.” Warsh previously served on the Fed board from 2006 to 2011. Bessent’s recent work includes driving talks on a trade agreement with China, which Trump considers a top priority in his wider effort to reset U.S. trade policy worldwide. He’s been directly involved in those negotiations while managing the broader strategy to revive the domestic economy. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and now an outside adviser, told Bloomberg that Bessent had already proven he could handle Trump’s agenda during the chaotic opening stretch of his second term. “He’s not just the star of the cabinet, but a safe pair of hands for global capital markets,” Bannon said. Trump pressures Powell over rates as more names surface Trump has never hidden his frustration with Powell, who he nominated back in 2017. He’s repeatedly called out Powell for refusing to lower interest rates in the face of economic uncertainty. Just last month, Trump met with Powell at the White House and urged him to cut rates, but the Fed has kept them unchanged in 2025. Officials at the Federal Reserve have defended the pause, saying it’s necessary due to inflation risks tied to Trump’s evolving tariff strategy. They believe the tariffs could slow growth and increase consumer prices, so a cautious approach makes more sense. Still, the president doesn’t agree. Trump has said the Fed is making a mistake, and he’s also floated the idea that he should be able to influence monetary policy, raising concerns about the independence of the Fed under a new chair. Whoever takes Powell’s seat will have to prove they won’t be a puppet of the White House. Adams from the IIF said both Bessent and Warsh would likely be seen as strong enough by financial markets to maintain some degree of Fed independence, at least in the short term. But not everyone agrees Bessent is the right fit. Economist Arthur Laffer, one of Trump’s longtime allies, said, “Bessent is wonderful, but he already has a job. And his specialty is not monetary policy.” Laffer said he had already told the president that Warsh is “just perfect for the job.” While Warsh and Bessent are the top two being talked about most often, Trump’s team has other names in the mix. Those include Kevin Hassett, current head of the National Economic Council, Christopher Waller, who is a sitting Fed governor, and David Malpass, who led the World Bank under Trump’s first term.

DOP’s proposed tokenomics reset — which was introduced earlier this year — was approved with an overwhelming 96% majority, with 732.7 million tokens voting in favor of the motion (against just 23.3 million opposing it). The vote concluded on May 26th after a week-long period of deliberation, with the ambitious DOP-v2 transition now looming large on the horizon, potentially establishing new standards for the entire industry to follow. What’s changing? Straight off the bat, the approved proposal introduces what the team calls “adaptive, price-linked vesting,” a mechanism that ties token unlocking directly to market performance rather than following the traditional fixed-schedule approach that has plagued countless projects with premature selling pressure. Furthermore, under the new DOP-v2 framework, token unlocking processes occur on 30-day cycles where the contract automatically calculates the average price over the previous month and determines how many tokens should be released for the next cycle. When prices rise above certain thresholds, more tokens naturally become available to meet the increased demand. Conversely, when market conditions turn bearish and prices fall below key levels, the unlocking process slows down or even stops entirely until recovery begins. For illustration sake, one can see that if DOP-v2 maintains a 30-day average price of $0.18, approximately 2% of the eligible tokens unlock over the upcoming month. However, if the price drops below $0.04, unlocking freezes completely until market conditions improve. Perhaps most significantly, the development team has demonstrated their commitment to the project’s long-term success by permanently forfeiting 30% of their own allocation. Timeline considerations With the vote now in the rearview mirror, DOP backers are now facing a straightforward yet important process as they are now required to migrate their tokens between June 15th and August 14th, 2025 — during which they can swap their existing DOP tokens for the new DOP-v2 on a 1:1 basis. The window will close permanently on August 14th, 2025, at 23:59 UTC, following which the “un-migrated” tokens will have zero utility. The team has provided reassurances when it comes to maintaining DOP-v2’s price around the levels of the final private sale rounds throughout the first cycle, thus potentially allaying any migration-related anxiety among holders. For those who have already unstaked their tokens, staking rewards they’ve earned will continue to be distributed as usual during the 90-day cooling period. For those who have not yet unstaked, it is important to do so as soon as possible to avoid being left with the old version of the token, which will no longer have any utility. Regardless of when individual holders complete their migration during the two-month window, everyone will begin the new vesting regime simultaneously on August 15th, creating a unified starting point for the entire community. Last but not least, the vote has also ushered in a new ‘dynamic inflation system’ designed to adapt in real time such that when $DOP-v2’s fully-diluted market cap sits below $50 million, inflation runs at 5% monthly to fund development activities. Conversely, inflation can decrease too, dropping to just 1% monthly when exceeding $500 million. The beginning of a new chapter is here By moving away from traditional tokenomics models that often create perverse incentives and unwanted selling pressures, DOP is positioning itself as a pioneer in sustainable token design. In this regard, the 18-cycle checkpoint built into the system adds another layer of sophistication to the model because if DOP-v2 maintains a healthy average price above $0.12 during the 18th cycle (roughly 18 months post-migration), all remaining locked tokens will be released linearly over just six additional cycles — rewarding sustained success. Looking ahead, DOP’s community-driven approach is offering a compelling alternative that other projects would be wise to study.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 17:48:19

Eyes are now on three specific projects poised for significant growth. Discover which altcoins are primed to explode following Bitcoin's impressive rally, offering potential high rewards for keen investors. Aave Price Movements Reinforce Key Entry and Exit Zones Aave has seen dynamic price swings over the past month and six months. The coin rose about 26.62% in the last month, showing a burst of short-term strength and increased buying interest. In contrast, performance over the past six months slipped approximately 4.32%, highlighting a mixed longer-term picture. A weekly gain of roughly 12.01% adds to the recent optimism, even though the extended view reveals persistent challenges. Price volatility remains evident as the market digests these varied trends. Currently, Aave trades between $179.40 and $298.70, with a key resistance level near $350.42 that traders watch with keen interest. Bulls are entering aggressively at times, driving the price upward, yet bears still step in during pullbacks, resulting in an unclear overall trend direction. While the short-term rally hints at bullish energy, the technical setup remains cautious. A support level at approximately $111.81 offers a potential floor, encouraging entries close to this zone if a bounce is detected. A breakout above $350.42 could trigger aggressive buying, though traders should be mindful of the second resistance at $469.73. Uniswap Market Snapshot: Recent Volatility and Key Price Levels Price action over the past month and half-year shows notable swings. Uniswap advanced by 9.60% in one week, yet declined by 6.39% over the month and dropped sharply by 58.74% over the half-year period. Fluctuations reached heights in a narrow range, hinting at recovery attempts after deep corrections. Movements spanned from resilient surges to broad downtrends, revealing periods of optimism followed by significant pullbacks. These variations point to a market that, while capable of sharp upward bursts, remains vulnerable to extended declines during broader market weaknesses. Currently, Uniswap trades within a range between $4.62 and $7.58, with a key support level at $3.20 and nearby resistance at $9.12. Second support at $0.239 and an additional resistance near $12.08 further outline trading boundaries. Indicators suggest mixed signals with upward pressure present, yet caution is warranted due to earlier declines. Bulls are attempting to assert dominance, but the lack of a clear trend encourages careful trading. Traders should consider positioning near support while planning exits at resistance if the price breaks above this area. Bittensor Price Trends and Key Levels for Trading Opportunities Bittensor experienced mixed behavior in recent trading sessions. In the last month, prices declined by about 7.7% after a brief rise of 6.19%. Over the past six months, the coin’s value dropped significantly by almost 28.65%, showing prolonged downward pressure. The recent weekly bounce did little to offset the negative trend, emphasizing the coin’s vulnerability to volatility. These statistics highlight a short-term strength amid ongoing weakness. Current trading levels for Bittensor show a price range between $346 and $507, with immediate resistance at $583.90 and support at $262.30. A second resistance is at $744.70, while a lower support lies at $101.50. Technical indicators suggest that bulls and bears are balanced, as the price moves within a narrow channel. Traders might consider buying near support levels while remaining cautious until a clear trend emerges. Conclusion The recent surge in Bitcoin has set the stage for other cryptocurrencies to shine. AAVE , UNI , and TAO are among the projects poised to benefit. These coins have strong fundamentals and promising potential. This momentum can translate to significant growth for these assets, making them worth watching in the coming months. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas says in a post on the social media platform X that IBIT has surpassed the $70 billion mark five times faster than the gold-based GLD product. “IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days… When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30k and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X According to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham , BlackRock currently holds $76.19 billion worth of digital assets in its crypto wallets. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened, not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Why Is The Bitcoin Price Going Up,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/best-crypto-to-buy-now-why-is-the-bitcoin-price-going-up,"Bitcoin’s rebound over the last 48 hours has flipped expectations. After sitting near $102000, the token climbed beyond $110000 in a move that few saw coming this quickly. Investors who had braced for a slide toward the $97000 range are now reassessing. While the recovery itself has already captured attention, there is more in play. A string of developments, both regulatory and institutional, has begun surfacing at the same time. These aren’t just headlines, but also point to deeper shifts that may support further growth. If the current momentum holds, this phase may prove more meaningful than a simple short-term bounce, especially with renewed confidence in digital assets growing in multiple directions at once. Why Is Bitcoin Going Up - Crypto Market Structure, Policy Shifts, and Technical Analysis The past few days have delivered a sequence of updates that paint a clearer picture for the blockchain space today. At the policy level, SEC Chair Paul Atkins has made a rare but important statement in favor of crypto autonomy. Speaking at a DeFi roundtable, he backed the idea that users should have full control over their digital assets without being forced into centralized custody. Atkins also called for a tailored exemption that would allow builders to bring DeFi products to market without the friction that has so far slowed innovation. If this framework gets adopted, it could speed up development across the space. Two single stock ETFs based on peer to peer payments Circle Internet Group $CRCL which only just IPO'd last Thursday:ProShares Ultra CRCL ETF (leveraged 2x)Bitwise CRCL Option Income Strategy ETF (covered call)ticker/fees: tbaeffective date: August 20, 2025Circle Internet… pic.twitter.com/y57RvMgKjf — ETF Hearsay by Henry Jim (@ETFhearsay) June 9, 2025 In parallel, filings for two ETFs tied to Circle’s stock have landed on the SEC’s desk. One comes from Bitwise, the other from ProShares. Both are designed to offer investors exposure to Circle’s equity performance, a company that already plays a major role in stablecoin infrastructure. If greenlit, these funds would begin trading in August and may create a path for traditional investors to engage indirectly with stablecoins. Technically, Bitcoin’s structure supports the optimism. After testing the top end of its Bollinger range near $110800 , the price pulled back modestly but continues to hold above the midline. Volume has eased slightly, but the lack of strong selling pressure suggests there may still be room for another upward push. When paired with the policy shift and the institutional interest around stablecoin-backed equities, this setup feels less speculative and more grounded. The conditions that once pointed toward a breakdown are now pointing elsewhere, and for altcoins, this may be the window they have been waiting for. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Cryptos That May Pump 10x Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a recently introduced presale that focuses on fixing the well-known efficiency issues of the original network. It does so by introducing a custom-built Layer 2 that uses the Solana Virtual Machine. This allows for fast, low-cost transactions while still being anchored to Bitcoin’s security model. The process is simple but intentional: users send Bitcoin to a specified address, which gets validated via smart contracts, and in return, they receive a token that behaves like Bitcoin on the faster chain. Where Bitcoin Hyper separates itself is not just in design, but in execution. The early stages of the rollout have moved quickly, with strong user uptake and consistent presale traction. Many L2 solutions stumble when it comes to integrating with existing Bitcoin holdings, but this protocol seems to have made that bridge less clunky. With Bitcoin avoiding the correction that many anticipated, and renewed confidence spilling over from regulatory discussions and ETF filings, projects built on Bitcoin’s infrastructure have more room to grow. The project has also been covered by top creators like ClayBro and others. Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t rely on trendiness or slogans. It’s aiming to solve a problem that has been discussed since Bitcoin’s early days. If its system continues to scale without network hiccups, it could find serious traction especially now, when speed and flexibility are no longer optional for protocols that want to stay relevant in an increasingly impatient market. SUBBD SUBBD is focused on creators, but not in the shallow, tokenized way that’s been tried before. This is not another tipping system or content paywall. SUBBD builds a structure around the concept of audience equity, where creators issue their own vault tokens backed by community staking, engagement, and visibility. These tokens are tradable, but what matters more is what they represent, which is ownership in a creator’s trajectory. That idea has existed before, but SUBBD is the first to make it operational with smart contract enforcement, a native marketplace, and token utility layered across multiple tools. Its real value becomes more noticeable during periods when crypto sentiment begins to lean constructive, like now. Bitcoin’s recent climb and a growing interest in decentralized product frameworks have made investors more attentive to utility-driven protocols again. Want exclusive content?

Ready to unlock? pic.twitter.com/ofKnYzzrCs — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) June 8, 2025 SUBBD fits this mood. Instead of chasing volume with gimmicks, it’s proposing a full shift in how creators monetize influence, moving the financial power away from centralized platforms and toward token-backed ecosystems controlled by communities. With its presale still open and social numbers climbing, the project appears to be gaining ground without overextending itself. The architecture allows room for staking, governance, and resale markets, and the visual dashboard already makes clear how the economics of creators and followers are linked. If market interest continues to lean toward decentralized solutions, SUBBD has the structural ingredients to benefit from that shift without needing a market boom to stay relevant. Solaxy Solaxy focuses on something most projects only claim to support, which is scalability across networks. Built as a Layer 2 bridge for both Solana and Ethereum ecosystems, it enables token movement, staking, and on-chain activity between the two without locking users into a single blockchain. This might sound technical, but the practical impact is simple: less friction, more options. And in crypto, that often makes the difference between a tool being used or ignored. Its own token, SOLX, plays a double role. First, it fuels staking rewards for users who provide liquidity across supported chains. Second, it underpins validator infrastructure tied to Solana’s internal growth. This second piece is worth noting, especially now. With policy shifts showing signs of softening, and interest growing around stablecoins and chain infrastructure, projects with cross-chain liquidity mechanics are better positioned to gain user attention and capital flow. Solaxy is expanding faster than the universe! 🛸46M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/RM3lsZeMha — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 9, 2025 Solaxy has also benefited from not being overexposed. It hasn’t promised absurd returns or flooded social media with hype. Instead, it’s been quietly building, maintaining validator integrations, and expanding bridge support. That approach fits well with the current environment, where noise is fading and real use cases are gaining visibility again. The market may still be cautious, but when Bitcoin holds strength and policy commentary favors innovation, frameworks like Solaxy become more than just technical achievements. They start to look like necessities. And that’s when growth stops being speculative and starts being organic. Snorter For what it’s actually trying to do, simply calling Snorter a trading bot wouldn’t be fair. The project essentially acts as a market utility layer that connects user intent with real-time execution across volatile tokens, especially memecoins. It uses adaptive tracking mechanisms, sentiment feeds, and social trend data to identify potential breakout movements before they become obvious. The interface simplifies all this into one-click decision funnels for users who want exposure but not noise. What’s interesting is that Snorter isn’t just meant for day traders or high-frequency players. Even passive users can set predefined triggers, letting the system allocate and adjust micro-positions as markets shift. This kind of automation has existed before, but not often with the kind of meme-sector integration that Snorter is building toward. Its relevance is clearer now as Bitcoin’s recovery has prompted a fresh wave of activity across smaller-cap coins. Whenever BTC moves with conviction, liquidity tends to spill over, and this is the zone where Snorter thrives. The protocol doesn't rely on Bitcoin, but it gains operational advantage when overall volume rises. Unlike many automation platforms that quietly run scripts in the background, Snorter brings visual feedback and in-depth breakdowns to the front. With market participation rising and self-custody becoming a renewed priority at the regulatory level, tools like this that emphasize transparency, speed, and strategic access may not just stay useful. They could become part of the new normal. BTC Bull BTC Bull doesn’t need to chase attention. The token openly reflects a thesis that has existed since the early days of crypto: community is Bitcoin’s strongest multiplier. Instead of trying to extend Bitcoin’s technology, BTC Bull builds around its idea, using design, token incentives, and shared ownership to create a loyalty loop that ties users to Bitcoin’s rise in a more interactive way. There are no layers or chains being added here. The draw lies in the way participation is rewarded. Every element, from visuals to staking logic, is shaped to mirror and support Bitcoin’s movements while still offering separate upside to holders of the token. That creates a unique layer of connection that isn't forced or symbolic. It's built into the structure. With Bitcoin regaining strength and proving more stable than many expected, BTC Bull is gaining visibility as a community-forward option that benefits when confidence returns. Its early stages are still unfolding, and that works to its advantage. There’s no baggage from previous cycles. No overpromises to walk back. It exists now, during a moment where regulatory signals are softening and investor interest is widening again. BTC Bull doesn’t pretend to be infrastructure. It’s culture. But within that simplicity, there’s a clear use case offering a stake in Bitcoin enthusiasm without needing to directly hold or move BTC itself. That’s not a replacement. It’s a companion. And for many in the current market, that’s exactly the kind of exposure they’re looking for. Conclusion The past few days have shifted the outlook. Bitcoin held above key levels, avoided the expected drop, and showed signs of stability that weren’t present earlier. At the same time, policy comments and structural developments have pointed toward fewer restrictions and more room for innovation. When technicals and external signals begin to align, it often marks the start of a new phase. Whether this turns into a broader trend depends on follow-through, but the conditions no longer suggest a market under pressure. They now suggest one preparing for its next move, making the options mentioned above some of the best worth considering.

Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 The launch is a step forward for both blockchains, allowing users to tap into Bitcoin’s liquidity while using Cardano’s smart contract capabilities and lower transaction fees. Non-Custodial, Cross-Chain DeFi with Bitcoin at the Core Unveiled this week, Cardinal introduces a trust-minimized model for wrapping BTC without relying on centralized custodians or federations—an issue long debated within the crypto space. “Wrapped BTC today comes with tradeoffs,” said Romain Pellerin, CTO at InputOutputHK. “Custodians. Federations. Risk. Cardinal flips the model.” At the core of Cardinal is a new primitive that allows users to wrap any BTC UTXO, so it can be used in DeFi use cases such as lending, borrowing, and staking. The protocol allows Bitcoin to remain locked under MuSig2 aggregated multisignature schemes, while a wrapped UTXO is minted cross-chain and remains redeemable at any time via a fraud-proofed peg-out system. “No rehypothecation. No compromise,” Pellerin added, emphasizing security and transparency. Built on a combination of Bitcoin HTLCs, Cardano smart contracts, and BitVMX for verifiable off-chain execution, Cardinal is designed to be compatible with any smart Layer 1, not just Cardano. It also introduces the first trust-minimized Ordinal bridge from Bitcoin to Cardano’s mainnet. “Ordinals can now be used in DeFi, serve as collateral, be auctioned across chains, and borrow or lend value without losing provenance,” Pellerin explained. The protocol creates wrapped assets—whether NFTs or tokens—that are natively pegged 1:1, transferable on-chain, and burnable to release BTC or Ordinals. With Cardinal, Cardano is positioning itself as a serious contender in cross-chain DeFi by bringing Bitcoin’s value and security into the programmable environment of smart contracts, all while staying true to Bitcoin’s trustless motto. A Strategic Play in the Multi-Chain DeFi Arena Cardinal’s debut comes amid growing demand for decentralized, trustless alternatives to traditional finance. In the wake of multiple high-profile collapses of custodial platforms, protocols like Cardinal are gaining attention for bringing Bitcoin into DeFi without compromising its core principles. Analysts suggest that this move could strengthen Cardano’s position in the multi-chain DeFi race, especially as Ethereum’s gas fees remain high and Bitcoin lacks programmability. Cardano’s strengths in formal verification and academic development may appeal to developers looking for a more secure foundation for cross-chain applications. Cardano Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) has fallen nearly 16% in the past month as the crypto rally faltered amid rising trade tensions between the United States and China , reports Alejandro Arrieche for CryptoNews. Investor sentiment has also been souring lately as reflected by the Fear and Greed Index , whose value has dropped from a local peak of 76 (Greed) to 55 at the time of writing, meaning that investors have now adopted a more cautious approach in what is a relatively uncertain scenario. Cardano’s price prediction centers around the $0.66 level—an area that has acted as a key accumulation zone and one that ADA quickly reclaimed after its recent bearish breakout.

45763281,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=399864,1749578823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/45763281.jpeg,Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN Limit Soars to Nearly 4MB in Core 30 Update,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-op_return-limit-soars-to-nearly-4mb-in-core-30-update/,"The Bitcoin Core development team has announced a major update in the upcoming October Core 30 release. The changes will increase the OP_RETURN data limit from 80 bytes to nearly 4 MB. Community Debate The proposal removes the long-standing default size limits on OP_RETURN, a transaction commonly used to embed non-financial data into the blockchain. Right now, Bitcoin Core only allows a small amount of data in OP_RETURN. The update would let Core relay much larger transactions by default. The idea has received both support and criticism on GitHub, with the debate centered on whether Bitcoin nodes should block non-monetary transactions or act as neutral relayers of any valid transaction. Those against it argue that removing the limit could invite spam and non-monetary data into Bitcoin blocks, which could occupy space intended for financial transactions. According to them, keeping the current limits protects Bitcoin’s economic value and keeps it efficient. They also say that removing settings like -datacarriersize would reduce node control. Comments from Seccour, chrisguida, and wizkid057 express concern that the change gives in to spammers and encourages misuse of Bitcoin. They all agree that the network should resist spam instead of making it easier. Supporters of the update believe that storing arbitrary data on Bitcoin is already happening and cannot be stopped. They say trying to block it leads to users resorting to worse methods, such as making private deals with miners. The group argues that OP_RETURN is the least harmful method. This is because it is small, cannot be spent, and does not add to the UTXO set. They say increasing the limit can guide data use to this cleaner method and avoid worse alternatives. Comments from murchandamus and eragmus support the decision, with one arguing that it would reduce node traffic and help prevent miner centralization. The other explained that it is a practical change that matches how the network is already used. A Push for Greater Decentralization Bitcoin Core has limited OP_RETURN to 80 bytes since 2014. However, developers announced in May that the cap would be removed in the next version. In a recent statement, they explained that the decision aligns with Core’s goal of reflecting economically relevant activity by ensuring that transactions likely to be mined are relayed. They added that blocking these transactions weakens decentralization, drives users to alternative channels, and ultimately fails to keep the data off the blockchain. Allowing them, they explained, preserves Bitcoin’s censorship resistance and ensures the network operates efficiently. “This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on,” the statement read.

For the year to date, Pump.fun has already sold an estimated $405M of SOL through exchanges. Pump.fun sent another tranche of SOL to Kraken following its latest sale of 156K SOL at the end of May. This time, the platform deposited 132,180 SOL, valued at $20.87M. Pump.fun continues to cash out roughly every two weeks or even more often while retaining its top spot as a fee producer . The recent deposits to Kraken have surpassed the whole of 2024 when Pump.fun cashed out an estimated $303M. On-chain data shows Pump.fun gained access to over 2.47M SOL, but chose to avoid staking, DeFi uses or other forms of passive income, instead seeking to cash out directly through Kraken. Just In: PumpFun has deposited 132,180 $SOL , worth $20.87M, into #Kraken . In 2025, they sent a total of 2,476,697 $SOL , valued at $404.64M. https://t.co/0XcZjkFZmN pic.twitter.com/ePQKWNfajj — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 10, 2025 The latest move solidifies Pump.fun’s reputation for extracting value from the Solana ecosystem while only partially compensating token creators and liquidity providers. The paradox of Pump.fun is that it managed to cash out $400M, while also seeking another $1B from potential token buyers in an eventual token creation event. Other wallets belonging to Pump.fun retain just over $100M in SOL, while another address contains an additional $68M. In total, Pump.fun has its reserves near an all-time high, for over $191M . Pump.fun still indirectly supports other Solana apps, paying fees to its top counterparties, including the Jupiter aggregator and router. The platform still remains the biggest attractor of users, as well as the main venue for launching new tokens. Pump.fun still retains most of its revenues, potentially breaking the earnings record of 2024 for realized gains. | Source: DeFi Llama One of the activity drivers was the expectation of an airdrop or some kind of recognition for the activity. Pump.fun managed to cash out what amounts to a sizeable ICO. Only in the past couple of months the platform shared its fees, paying out around $700K to liquidity providers and selected token creators. Pump.fun produces fewer cult tokens Despite this, only under 2% of Pump.fun traders make above $1,000, with most serving as exit liquidity. Pump.fun did create a handful of cult tokens, as its initial usage was to create cultural movements and shift away from VC-backed tokens. As of June 2025, cult tokens from Pump.fun are valued at around $4.27B, led by FARTCOIN. New cult tokens are coming less regularly, with HOUSE being the hottest asset created recently. It is still rare for Pump.fun tokens to make it big, with only a handful listed on major exchanges. The graduation rate of Pump.fun tokens are near historical lows, with only 0.81% of new memes moving to DEX trading and even fewer gaining significant valuations. Only one token is valued at over $1B, and only six retain a market cap above $100M, while previously reaching a $500M valuation was easy for even relatively new assets. The platform still launches around 30K tokens daily, with fewer social media trends. Instead, there are signs of increased bot sniping and rapid shifting between meme themes. There are also fears that the launch of a native Pump.fun token may take some of the liquidity from memes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Its energy-efficient consensus approach assures low power usage, making it one of only a few genuinely green networks accessible today. This promotes global sustainability without sacrificing performance. Governance is decentralised. The community makes all decisions on the site, and money is appropriately dispersed among contributors. Holders of the NEX token benefit from a new incentive model: 10% of all gas fees are split daily with users who store their tokens in non-custodial wallets. This transparent solution enables investors to generate passive revenue simply by owning and supporting the network. Nexchain: Expanding Network and Payment Support Nexchain is continually developing. It now includes support for Optimism and Arbitrum, two popular Layer 2 solutions. This increases access and transaction efficiency for users across numerous ecosystems. Payment choices have also increased. NEX may now be purchased with USDC or USDT on all supported blockchains. New networks include WETH on Polygon, Base, Optimism, and Arbitrum; WBTC on Polygon, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Arbitrum; and native OP and ARB coins. These enhancements make Nexchain one of the most adaptable crypto ICO presale ventures. Final Thoughts: Nexchain Among Top Crypto Presales for 2025. Nexchain is quietly emerging as one of the market's best crypto presales, due to its performance, usability, and accessibility. Its low entry fee and solid infrastructure provide it with a significant advantage over other cryptocurrency presale tokens.

By 2028, the minimum WLD price might drop to $ 1.11 while its maximum can reach $1.6 The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $7.18 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the world’s prediction. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $1.16 (-4.9%) Market Cap $1.73B Trading Volume (24-hour) $130.24M (-9.17%) Circulating Supply 1.55B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.5817, June 2, 2025 24-hour High $1.19 24-hour Low $1.11 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $0.827487 (-25.09%) Price Volatility 9.77% 50-Day SMA $1.13837 14-Day RSI 47.69 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD trades at $1.14 as bullish momentum builds Worldcoin is trading at $1.14 after rebounding from $1.08, showing strong buying interest near the support zone. The $1.18 level has emerged as critical resistance, and a breakout is likely to open the path toward $1.25. A double-bottom on the 4-hour chart confirms bullish structure, strengthening the short-term upside case. Worldcoin (WLD) is trading at $1.14 on June 10th, 2025, after a 5.65% increase in the last 24 hours. The token bounced from a daily low of $1.08 and tested a high of $1.18, which now serves as a critical resistance zone. The current price action reflects a rebound attempt as buyers regain short-term control. Worldcoin daily price chart: WLD shows bullish reversal from the $1.08 support zone The daily chart shows WLD beginning the session at around $1.083 before bouncing strongly at the $1.08 support level. This zone has held firm, and the price has trended upward since, now sitting around $1.14. The day’s high at $1.19 has formed the current resistance zone. A breakout above this could shift momentum significantly in favor of bulls. WLD/USDT Price Chart The pattern forming resembles a rounded base, hinting at continued accumulation. Buyers are showing persistence, especially with ascending lows supporting the structure. The RSI is climbing steadily without being overbought, and price action is hugging the upper range of recent candles. A daily close above $1.18 may open the way for $1.25. On the downside, if $1.08 fails, the next support lies near $1.05, a psychological level and potential trend reversal point. Worldcoin 4-hour chart: WLD bulls eye breakout above $1.2 after double-bottom formation On the 4-hour chart, WLD shows a clean bounce from $1.08 after testing the level twice, forming a double-bottom structure. This pattern strengthens the case for short-term bullish momentum. The price action has remained above the short-term moving average, and bullish candles have pushed it toward $1.14. WLD/USDT Price Chart The RSI is above 50 and rising, and the MACD is showing widening green histograms. The price is consolidating just under $1.18, a clear breakout level. If bulls maintain pressure and push above $1.18, WLD could rally to the $1.22–$1.25 zone. If rejected again, a drop to $1.10 is likely. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.955899 BUY SMA 5 $1.062159 BUY SMA 10 $1.120673 SELL SMA 21 $1.234797 SELL SMA 50 $1.13837 SELL SMA 100 $1.003506 BUY SMA 200 $1.400721 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.169778 SELL EMA 5 $1.107779 SELL EMA 10 $0.995366 BUY EMA 21 $0.918712 BUY EMA 50 $0.994544 BUY EMA 100 $1.271354 SELL EMA 200 $1.710382 SELL What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? If bullish momentum persists, Worldcoin (WLD) is likely to attempt a breakout above the $1.18 resistance level. A confirmed move above this zone could pave the way toward the $1.22–$1.25 range in the short term. However, if WLD faces rejection again at $1.18, a pullback to the $1.10 level may follow, where buyers could regroup. The $1.08 support remains crucial; any breakdown below it may shift the short-term trend back to bearish, with $1.05 as the next key support. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) remains a speculative asset, influenced heavily by market sentiment, technical levels, and broader crypto trends. The recent rebound from $1.08 and its 96.28% gain from April lows reflect growing interest, especially in short-term setups. However, WLD is still down over 90% from its all-time high. This highlights its high volatility and risk. Investors should monitor price action closely around the $1.18 resistance. A confirmed breakout could attract more momentum traders. As always, potential investors should evaluate Worldcoin’s utility, tokenomics, and regulatory factors before making long-term decisions. Due diligence and risk management are essential. Why is WLD Price up today Worldcoin’s (WLD) price is up today due to renewed bullish interest at the $1.08 support level. The token rebounded sharply after retesting this level, gaining 5.65% in 24 hours and reaching $1.14. Traders reacted positively to the strong bounce, interpreting it as a potential short-term reversal. The double-bottom structure on the 4-hour chart further confirmed bullish strength, attracting buyers looking for upside potential. Additionally, WLD’s recovery from April lows, with nearly 96% gains, has revived market attention. Short-term traders are now eyeing a breakout above $1.18 as the next trigger.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As ETH nears $2.8k, traders eye Future Pepe, a memecoin with viral hype and AI utility, rivaling PEPE and SHIB. As Ethereum approaches $2,800, traders are searching for the next big memecoin. Future Pepe (FPEPE) blends viral potential with real AI-driven utility. Here’s why it’s drawing comparisons to PEPE, SHIB , and WIF. You might also like: Could FloppyPepe be the next 1000x breakout with 60% bonus tokens on presale? The market is heating up Ethereum has surged over 8% on June 10, breaking major resistance levels and reviving memecoin momentum. Back in 2023, PEPE soared over 10,000% during a similar ETH rally. Now, eyes are shifting toward Future Pepe (FPEPE) , a next-generation meme token that combines cultural firepower with AI-driven tools for investors. With: 10,000+ active community members Deflationary tokenomics Built-in staking rewards It’s being called the next evolutionary leap in meme tokens. Why Ethereum’s rally sets the stage for memecoins Ethereum’s price action doesn’t just lift ETH, it ignites risk-on appetite, especially in high-reward sectors like memecoins. Here’s why: Liquidity Rotation: Gains in ETH often spill into smaller-cap coins. Lower Gas = More Trades: Cheaper fees mean more meme coin buys on-chain. Market Psychology: Bullish ETH vibes trigger broader retail participation. We’ve seen it before: PEPE soared in April 2023 during a 15% ETH rally. SHIB’s meteoric rise began when ETH first crossed $3,000. DOGE caught fire after ETH’s DeFi Summer rally. With Ethereum now surging again, all signals point toward a renewed meme season, and investors are hunting for the next PEPE-level breakout. Memecoins are evolving: From hype to utility The meme token space has matured. The next breakout projects will offer more than just branding; they’ll deliver actual infrastructure. Evolution Timeline: 2020–2021 (Hype Era) DOGE: All vibes, no utility SHIB: Big ideas, unclear execution 2022–2024 (Community Era) PEPE: Viral momentum + fair launch WIF: Solana’s meme movement star 2025 (Utility Era) Future Pepe is pioneering this new era: AI Anti-Rug Scanner – Detect scam contracts in real time 30% APY Staking – Instant passive income Deflationary Supply – Token burns on every transaction Audited & Transparent – Reviewed by SolidProof & Coinsult FPEPE isn’t just a meme. It’s infrastructure. Can FPEPE do 10x–100x? The case for explosive growth Let’s break down the opportunity: Market Cap Math PEPE hit a $1.5b cap. FPEPE will sit on listing day at $12m. A move to just 10% of PEPE = 12.5x upside. Timing Advantage The presale stage offers the lowest entry price. Stage-based pricing increases every few days. First-Mover Utility No other memecoin offers AI-powered scam protection at this level. FPEPE’s revenue model includes scanner licensing and platform fees. Conservative Estimates 5–10x post-launch within 60–90 days 20–50x if bull market conditions persist 100x scenario if viral breakout + utility adoption align Memecoins are always high-risk, high-reward. But those who spotted DOGE and PEPE early didn’t do it with hindsight, they did it with instinct and timing. FPEPE checks all the early indicators. How to get in early The Future Pepe presale is live now: Current price: $0.0096 Next stage jump: +20% in 48 hours Minimum: 0.1 ETH Secure tokens now. Conclusion Ethereum’s rally is more than just a chart breakout — it’s a signal. Meme season might be back, and the smart money is already rotating into high-upside, early-stage bets. With its blend of real AI tools, solid community backing, and meme-ready branding, Future Pepe isn’t trying to copy PEPE, it’s trying to be the next evolution.

A second wave of demand just before 11:00 UTC on June 10 drove ether through the $2,700 barrier to a 24-hour high of $2,783; by press time it was trading at $2,744.87, up 6.54 percent on 560,900 coins (US$1.51 billion) moved. Social sentiment has turned decidedly bullish. A popular trader on X said the move amounted to ether entering a true “beast mode” phase after brushing aside $1,500 and $2,200 barriers and forecast further upside toward $4,000 and beyond. In an X thread on June 3, Consensys founder Joseph Lubin portrayed Etheruem as a nonstop settlement layer that processed over $25 trillion in transactions last year and serves as the backbone for stablecoins, tokenized assets, native yield and DeFi. He added that a $425 million private placement into SharpLink Gaming (SBET) aims to expose traditional investors to those yield opportunities. Meanwhile, in a market note, QCP Capital pointed to the advancing GENIUS Act, renewed buzz around Circle’s IPO and increasing regulatory clarity for stablecoins as converging tailwinds that could drive outsized structural gains for Ether’s tokenization and settlement rails. On-chain fundamentals also bolster the bullish case: staked ether recently reached a record 34.65 million tokens — locking up roughly 28.7 percent of supply — and may tighten bids around current support near $2,720. Technical Analysis Highlights Ether staged two volume-backed breakouts: first above $2,600 on June 9 (436K ETH traded), then above $2,700 on June 10 (560.9K ETH). A clear series of higher lows and higher highs underpins a strong uptrend from $2,562 to $2,783. A high-volume supply zone now sits at $2,796, marking near-term resistance. A double-bottom formed between $2,720–$2,740 may support consolidation before the next leg higher.

According to a June 10 Bloomberg report , CEO Mark Zuckerberg is personally assembling a team of experts for a new division focused on AI research. At the same time, the company has made a $15 billion investment in Scale AI and recruited its CEO, Alexandr Wang. Meta’s “superintelligence group” will focus on outpacing companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft in the race toward artificial general intelligence. The goal is to develop machines capable of performing as well as humans on valuable tasks. Once Meta develops its models, the company plans to integrate them across its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. This also includes its Meta chatbot and its Ray-Ban smart glasses. Zuckerberg reportedly plans to hire 50 people for the new team.

Source: Cryptonews This 15% surge in just 24 hours has positioned HYPE close to challenging Cardano’s $25.11 billion market cap for a top-10 ranking, sparking intense speculation about whether the momentum can sustain such ambitious targets. HYPE is approaching the psychological barrier of $50, with Fibonacci targets projecting potential peaks at $51, $77, and even $103. Analysts are bullish on its upward momentum, but the big question is: will HYPE keep up with the hype?

Earlier in the year, price carved out a rounded double-bottom pattern during March, April, and May , forming a base that underpinned the subsequent rally. Source: TradingView As of the latest bar, HYPE is trading near $39–40, pushing above recent swing highs on above-average volume. Beneath the price action, the RSI has climbed into the upper 60s, nearing overbought territory. A bullish divergence was evident in April when the price made a similar low while the RSI printed a higher low, foreshadowing the current uptrend. More recently, there was a brief indication of bearish divergence at peak RSI readings, hinting at potential short-term consolidation rather than an abrupt reversal. In other words, momentum remains generally positive, but it warns against chasing new highs without regard for a pullback or pause. Given the current structure, a more sustainable path would see HYPE pausing or retesting the new support area, likely around the mid-$30s, before resuming its climb. If that support holds, the logical upside target lies near the next supply zone around $45, where prior highs may induce selling pressure. Should the price falter below the $26–28 support pivot, the bullish thesis would weaken, but as long as that level remains intact, the trend remains upward. Additionally, analysts point to a Fibonacci extension analysis that projects the next major target at $46.35 based on the 141.40% extension from December’s high of $35.51 to April’s low of $9.32. next fibonacci targets are for $HYPE are $51 | $77 | $103. pic.twitter.com/SYczItIkXB — HYPEconomist (@theHYPEconomist) June 10, 2025 More ambitious projections reach $51, $77, and potentially $103 if the current momentum sustains. However, technical analysis also suggests key support levels that must hold for the bullish thesis to remain intact. The $35 support is a key floor, and a break could potentially trigger a deeper correction toward $26. As it stands now, HYPE is approaching overbought levels; traders should monitor for potential profit-taking that could create temporary pullbacks before the next leg higher toward the ambitious $50+ targets that have captured the cryptocurrency community’s imagination. In summary, indicators and chart structure favor a continuation higher after a reasonable consolidation or retest, with $45 in sight as the next area of interest.

Indeed, the move will be massively bullish, considering that XRP has struggled to establish itself above the $2.30 resistance level despite. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Now, in a June 8 TradingView post , Persian Blockchain emphasized that the outcome of the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains one of the most significant catalysts for XRP’s future trajectory. With a court-imposed 60-day deadline approaching on June 16, speculation is growing that Ripple may secure a favorable ruling. Such an outcome could restore investor confidence and remove a long-standing obstacle to XRP’s upside potential. Notably, both parties are pushing for a settlement after an initial application was rejected due to procedural issues . On the macroeconomic front, the analyst pointed to a renewed expansion in global liquidity, as tracked by the M2 Global Liquidity Index. Rising liquidity has historically supported risk assets, particularly cryptocurrencies. XRP price levels to watch Technically, the trading expert noted that XRP appears well-positioned and is forming a bullish flag pattern, a continuation setup often preceding sharp upward moves. After months of consolidation within a downward-sloping channel, XRP looks ready to challenge key resistance levels. The analysis outlined several bullish Fibonacci extension targets, including $3.64, $4.47, $6.27, and a long-term target of $11.25, with the psychological $10 level firmly within range.

Investors should watch for a confirmed breakout followed by a retest, ideally bouncing from the accumulation zone, to validate the move. “A perfect storm of fundamentals and technical. A retest of the breakout area followed by bullish confirmation could signal the beginning of a larger move toward the $10 psychological level,” the analyst said. If XRP reaches the $10 mark, its market cap will surge to approximately $587 billion, potentially making it the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin ( BTC ), assuming Ethereum sees minimal growth over the same period.

The report reveals that the core infrastructure powering the app is managed by Viktor Vedeneev, a Russian network engineer with deep ties to companies linked to the FSB security agency and Russia’s defense sector. Vedeneev’s company controls thousands of Telegram IP addresses, key servers, and networking equipment. Court records obtained by journalists show that Vedeneev had exclusive access to Telegram’s infrastructure and was authorized to sign contracts on the company’s behalf. However, the investigation did not find any evidence that Vedeneev’s involvement resulted in data sharing or surveillance. While no direct evidence was found that Telegram data was shared with Russian authorities, two of Vedeneev’s other companies have serviced highly sensitive government institutions, including Russia’s intelligence agencies and a research center involved in planning the invasion of Ukraine. Telegram has not been accused of wrongdoing, but the report raises questions about whether third-party infrastructure relationships could create risks to user privacy. Telegram representatives told Newsweek that “as a global company, Telegram has contracts with dozens of different service providers around the world. However, none of these service providers have access to Telegram data or sensitive infrastructure.” They further went on to say that all Telegram servers belong to the company and are maintained by employees: “Unauthorized access is impossible. Throughout its entire history, Telegram never disclosed any private messages to a third party — and its encryption has never been breached.” You might also like: Brian Quintenz’s $3.4M crypto stash — will the Senate block his CFTC comeback? Security contradictions inside of Telegram Security researchers say these links expose a major contradiction between Telegram’s public image and its operational reality. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab, said the findings highlight a “dangerous disconnect” between user assumptions about Telegram’s security and the actual vulnerabilities in its infrastructure. Telegram founder Pavel Durov has long positioned the app as a safe haven for free expression , claiming the platform has “never disclosed a single byte of private messages.” However, experts point out that the app’s encryption design still allows for metadata exposure, including device identifiers and user IP addresses — data that could be exploited to track user activity. Telegram’s MTProto encryption protocol attaches an unencrypted identifier to every encrypted message, which can help observers monitor specific user devices and IP locations. This is particularly concerning in scenarios where governments or intelligence agencies have physical access to the network infrastructure. Despite claiming to have no infrastructure in Russia, leaked border records previously showed that Durov visited the country more than 50 times between 2015 and 2021, according to the report.

Notably, the SEC is said to be open to allowing staking as part of these products. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart commented that approval could come as early as July, though the final deadlines for SEC decisions, based on the 240-day review period, extend to October. Seyffart said the agency may now be prioritizing 19b-4 filings related to Solana and staking ETFs sooner than originally expected. Several asset managers are lining up to offer a Solana ETF, including VanEck, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, and 21Shares.

The SEC formally acknowledged Grayscale’s Solana ETF proposal in February, a significant shift given its past resistance to such filings. While the SEC delayed its decision on Grayscale’s Solana ETF in May, it stated it had not yet reached any conclusions. The delay was seen as procedural rather than a rejection. Market observers took that as a positive sign, particularly after CME launched SOL futures in February, mirroring steps taken ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals. CME’s launch of SOL futures has already led to the introduction of SOL futures ETFs, including two from Volatility Shares . Following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in May 2025, attention has now turned to other top digital assets like Solana. The very existence of futures markets often paves the way for spot ETF approval, as seen with BTC and ETH.

This amount is over $23 million according to the current market value. The accumulation in question stands out as a significant reserve that the company has not previously disclosed to the public. American Bitcoin launched in March, and Eric Trump serves as the company's chief strategy officer. “Our vision for American Bitcoin is to create the most investable BTC accumulation platform on the market,” Eric Trump said in a statement.

American Bitcoin said it considers its BTC reserves a “core strategic asset” and that it is being managed adaptively. The firm’s goal is to bolster its balance sheet strength and increase long-term shareholder value. The company’s accumulation strategy is not a specific BTC target, but instead plans to expand its assets by increasing capital according to market conditions.

The incident quickly escalated into “elevated error rates and latency” affecting both the ChatGPT interface and OpenAI’s API services, according to the company’s status page. As news of the ChatGPT outage spread, users flocked to the social media platform X to vent—and laugh—about their sudden productivity crisis. Me when Chat GPT is down: #ChatGPT #OpenAI pic.twitter.com/vXKXL6Ix03 — Sarcasm (@sarcastic_us) June 10, 2025 Memes and sarcastic posts flooded timelines, with many joking that they had “no idea how to think without their AI sidekick” or that “90% of their job had just vanished.” Developers joked about staring blankly at their screens without code suggestions. The collective meltdown showed just how deeply integrated AI has become in daily workflows—and how quickly humor becomes a coping mechanism when it disappears. Traders and Analysts Experience Research Delays Retail investors and crypto analysts frequently use ChatGPT to unpack complex whitepapers, interpret tokenomics, or cross-reference smart contract risks. For these users, even short outages mean slower due diligence and trading hesitations, especially during volatile market windows. Many Web3 projects integrate GPT-powered bots into Telegram, Discord, or their websites for user onboarding and community support. An outage can take these bots offline, disrupting real-time engagement and damaging the user experience. Founders and Builders Hit a Speed Bump From drafting grant applications to refining smart contract code, solo founders and lean Web3 teams increasingly depend on GPT-powered AI to stretch their limited bandwidth. A sudden unavailability can bottleneck tasks, delay deliverables, and impact internal productivity, particularly for early-stage teams with minimal staff. Despite the momentary disruption, the fundamental infrastructure of crypto remains unaffected. Blockchain networks, decentralized exchanges, and validator nodes continue operating normally. Market prices may see no major impact unless sentiment-driven speculation takes hold—a rare occurrence linked more to social media panic than to productivity tools. AI-generated memes and commentary—an increasingly central part of crypto culture and community building—also take a hit during outages. While not major, these moments of levity and virality contribute to community sentiment and engagement, particularly on platforms like X and Farcaster.

Amid ongoing market volatility and shifting sentiment, analysts like Cryptoinsightuk are closely watching for technical signals that could indicate the early stages of a long-awaited bullish reversal. XRP Hovering at Key Price Thresholds The XRP market is currently grappling with short-term resistance as bulls attempt to solidify their position above it. According to a recent X post by Cryptoinsightuk, XRP is “fighting to hold above minor resistance / flip it as support right now,” signaling an early but critical phase in a potential trend change. While the altcoin’s price action remains cautiously optimistic, its ability to sustain a daily close above $2.40 is seen as the first true indicator of upward momentum. Cryptoinsightuk notes that a breakout beyond the $2.60 level would more convincingly confirm a broader shift in market direction. Looking for closes above $2.40 for the first stages of a trend reversal. Then, realistically, $2.60+ to show a key change in direction,” the analyst explained, framing these price levels as milestones for any sustained bullish structure. $XRP fighting to hold above minor resistance / flip it as support right now.

XRP’s recent market behavior has been characterized by deep liquidity zones—areas where many traders have active stop-losses or pending orders—that remain unresolved. While liquidity can be left behind in a market move, deeper zones often act as magnets, pulling prices back to rebalance positions before any sustained trend can emerge. Cryptoinsightuk elaborated: “Liquidity can be left behind, and there is always some liquidity left, people who hold their positions. However, as I keep saying, with it being this deep, I am cautious.” This underscores the potential for unexpected volatility, even as the asset approaches technically significant levels. The presence of substantial liquidity pockets below the current market price may pose a threat to bullish momentum, particularly if market makers or large players seek to trigger those zones before allowing the price to move higher. This behavior is not uncommon in crypto markets and often precedes larger directional shifts, either upward or downward. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Context: Legal and Ecosystem Developments The technical outlook for XRP is also unfolding against the backdrop of significant legal and ecosystem developments. Ripple’s long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains unresolved, although there has been progress. The outcome of the case could have major implications for XRP’s regulatory clarity and institutional adoption, both of which are key to long-term price sustainability. Meanwhile, Ripple continues to expand its ecosystem with innovations like RLUSD, a U.S. dollar stablecoin launched on the XRP Ledger in December 2024. The stablecoin is already seeing adoption in DeFi applications and cross-border payment corridors, adding fundamental utility to the XRP Ledger that could influence future investor confidence. Technical Pressure Meets Strategic Patience XRP’s current battle with resistance levels around $2.40 is more than just a technical event—it’s a defining moment in the asset’s broader journey through legal, regulatory, and ecosystem transitions. As the crypto market remains poised for potential macro shifts and regulatory decisions, XRP investors would do well to balance short-term technical observations with long-term strategic considerations.

The project is reportedly called “The Blue Lion supercomputer,” will use Nvidia’s “Vera Rubin” chips, and is expected to become available to scientists by early 2027. Nvidia is deep in the waters of supercomputing The announcement was made at a supercomputing conference in Hamburg, Germany, and it comes after Nvidia’s announcement that the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in the United States also has plans to build a system using the chips next year. Much is expected, but Nvidia’s products have already proven themselves many times over. Jupiter, another supercomputer that uses its chips at the German national research institute Forschungszentrum Julich, is now officially Europe’s fastest system, while the company’s chips remain sought after globally. Supercomputer Jupiter at the 🇩🇪 research powerhouse Forschungszentrum Jülich is now Europe's fastest supercomputer & 4th fastest globally. At full capacity, Jupiter needs less than one week to train a large AI model, known as large language model (LLM) #ResearchInGermany pic.twitter.com/cvKgJ5TrPd — German Embassy London (@GermanEmbassy) June 10, 2025 The deal aligns with the desire of European institutions aiming to stay ahead of the U.S., especially where supercomputers used for scientific fields from biotechnology to climate research are concerned. Nvidia is a perfect partner to realize those dreams. Before it became recognized as an artificial intelligence semiconductor chip powerhouse, Nvidia was all about persuading scientists to use its chips to speed up complex computer problems, such as modeling climate change. Now, Nvidia is busy trying to persuade scientists to use artificial intelligence. Such AI systems can take the results of a few precise calculations and use them to make predictions that may not be as accurate as the fully calculated results, but still prove useful while taking far less time. On Tuesday, Nvidia unveiled what it tags its “Climate in a Bottle” AI model, and in a press briefing, Dion Harris, head of data center product marketing at Nvidia, said it would allow scientists to be able to input a few initial conditions such as sea surface temperatures and generate a forecast for 10 to 30 years in the future and see what the weather may be like at any kilometer or so of the earth’s surface. “Researchers will use combined approach of classic physics and AI to resolve turbulent atmospheric flows,” Harris said. “This technique will allow them to analyze thousands and thousands more scenarios in greater detail than ever before.” Nvidia holds the worlds of AI and supercomputing together Nvidia’s recent deals already prove that the company is at the heart of AI infrastructure and in the future, the company may become indispensable to the industry. Not too long ago, it was revealed that the company has partnered with the UK to create a new AI testing environment. This is crucial as Britain reportedly lacks the computing infrastructure to deliver the full potential of its leading artificial intelligence research base. “The UK is the largest AI ecosystem in the world without its own infrastructure,” Huang told an audience at London Tech Week alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer, citing the country’s top universities, startups and third-largest AI venture capital market. He praised Starmer’s plan to boost Britain’s domestic computing capabilities by 20 times and provide 1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) of investment. “The ability to build these AI supercomputers here in the UK will naturally attract more startups, it will naturally enable all of the rich ecosystem of researchers here,” he added, tagging Britain as “an incredible place to invest”. The FCA has partnered with Nvidia to provide access to advanced computing power and bespoke AI, a move it hopes will help firms in the early stages of exploring AI, offering access to technical expertise, better datasets, and regulatory support. Finance minister Rachel Reeves has also urged Britain’s regulators to get rid of any barriers to economic growth, describing it as an “absolute top priority” for the government. Already, the UK is lagging behind in the race for AI dominance, and if it is to catch up, people like Reeves believe the red tape has to be cut first.

These explosive numbers were not just a flashpoint in crypto fundraising – it signaled something deeper: the beginning of a broader alignment between the decentralized world of crypto and the structures of global finance, according to Santiment. Plasma’s public sale, hosted on Cobie-backed Sonar, was oversubscribed within minutes, which prompted organizers to double the cap from $250 million. The rush of capital showed that large investors are increasingly looking beyond meme coins, seeking serious infrastructure plays with long-term utility. Whales Dominate Plasma Sale Backed by major names like Tether, Bitfinex, and Peter Thiel, Plasma markets itself as a “stablechain,” designed specifically to support stablecoin transfers. While the sale didn’t distribute tokens outright, only future purchase options, it still generated intense demand, and participants were drawn to the prospect of earning yield while waiting. However, data from the sale revealed stark inequalities. The top 10 wallets contributed roughly 40% of the total funds, and a single whale deposited the maximum of $50 million. The average wallet size of $450,000 and a reported $100,000 gas fee spent by one user just to secure a spot reignited concerns over fairness, and echoed the ICO frenzy of 2017 and the gas wars of the 2021 NFT boom. Retail investors largely felt locked out, with many voicing frustration over high barriers to entry. Despite these drawbacks, the Plasma raise stands out as an indicator of progress, as per the crypto analytic platform. After a prolonged period dominated by speculation and joke tokens, the crypto market appears to be returning to fundamentals. Market Maturity The success of Sonar, which is being touted as a more structured, transparent launch platform, reflected a shift in investor appetite toward products that offer predictability, utility, and reduced risk. This evolution isn’t happening in isolation. The rise of stablecoin infrastructure like Plasma coincides with moves in traditional finance, such as the proposed GENIUS Act in the US and the public listing of USDC issuer Circle on the New York Stock Exchange. While the Plasma ICO had its flaws, as it was dominated by whales and inaccessible to smaller investors due to high fees, it still marked progress. The strong interest suggests that investors are shifting focus back to serious projects, which coincides with crypto’s broader rally and Bitcoin’s push toward new highs. “So taking a step back, the Plasma sale wasn’t just about one blockchain… it was actually part of a larger movement where crypto is starting to align with global financial systems.” The post High Fees, Big Wallets, but Real Momentum: The Plasma ICO Explained appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Circle|ICO|Stablecoins|Tether (USDT)|USDC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDC|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-10 19:49:28

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 703,900 followers on the social media platform X that SUI is suddenly presenting a major buying opportunity. He says that the recent $223 million hack of the Cetus Protocol, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui network, caused SUI’s value to decline, but ultimately gave bulls a chance to position themselves for the next leg up. “Remember last cycle how many times SOL was declared dead because it went down? Every single time the FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) was bought, and it came back stronger. I think the recent CETUS exploit gave an amazing opportunity for a dip to stack more SUI. CETUS is officially back with a recovery plan for affected pools. There’s also a plan in place for token compensation for affected users. If anything, the CETUS issue makes me more bullish showing how SUI governance was swift to act together to stop the protocol’s exploit from being any worse and allowing the hacker to get away with the funds. Feel free to cope from the sidelines, but I’m as bullish as I’ve been since I partnered with SUI on them having the opportunity to fill the gap in the monolithic L1 (layer-1) race. Run it back turbo.” Source: Kaleo/X Based on his chart, the trader appears to suggest that SUI print a new all-time high at around $7.50, more than double its current value, perhaps sometime in September of this year. The analyst also says that SUI may be getting ready to breakout of a bullish descending wedge pattern against Bitcoin ( BTC ). “SUI/BTC ratio also looks solid with a clean breakout retest. I see this breaking out and filling the launch wick soon.” Source: Kaleo/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.45.

Top Analysts Are Betting on This New Cryptocurrency Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/shiba-inu-news-today-is-shib-about-to-surprise-everyone-in-2025-top-analysts-are-betting-on-this-new-cryptocurrency-instead/,"In today’s crypto news, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is once again igniting debate across the market. SHIB was pretty inactive in the first quarter, but lately, it’s advanced to trade at $0.000013. Even though many think SHIB could recreate last cycle’s surge and rise in value, others disagree, citing few reasons to use the token. Some traders are choosing low-price competitors over meme coins since they believe they have better reasons to be used in the real world. One such coin rapidly gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin under $1, currently generating buzz for its DeFi infrastructure and high ROI forecasts. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when the presale started, MUTM will officially go live at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). Presale Picks Up Speed: Mutuum Finance Takes the Lead Mutuum Finance continues to gather momentum as Phase 4 of its presale sold out ahead of schedule. In Phase 5 currently, tokens are set at $0.03, giving investors a 16.67% return right off the bat once the price increases in the next round. The presale has already raised over $10.3 million and attracted more than 11,800 investors. With demand on the rise and sound fundamentals, most are hoping for even greater returns after launch, as MUTM makes a case for itself as among the top altcoins to invest in 2025. Innovative Buy-and-Distribute Model While other speculative tokens only change their values through internal or external shocks, Mutuum Finance uses the Buy-and-Distribute strategy. On a regular basis, the project buys MUTM tokens from the market and rewards stakers with these tokens, making the price healthily rise. Early Investors Reward Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for cheering the project in the beginning. Stablecoin Launch & Certik Audit Build Investor Trust A stablecoin supported by the US dollar is being developed by Mutuum Finance on Ethereum. Mutuum’s stablecoin is currently considered safe and reliable because it has proper collateral and is checked thoroughly by Certik along with the platform. The latest audits have revealed that Mutuum Finance favors transparency, solid security and a long-term future. Compared to unbacked algorithmic stablecoins, Mutuum’s stablecoin is built to withstand volatile market swings without depegs. The recently completed Certik strengthens Mutuum Finance’s focus on transparency, security, and long-term sustainability. Investors and traders are still talking about Shiba Inu (SHIB), yet it is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that smart money is focusing on this year. Because over $10.3 million has been raised and 11,800 investors signed up, the presale’s success in Phases 1 to 4 at $0.01, $0.015, $0.02, $0.025 and now at $0.03 in phase 5 means investors are confident in the market. Its Buy-and-Distribute feature, Certik audit, upcoming stablecoin launch and estimated great returns are among the reasons Mutuum Finance might rise on many charts in 2025. Don’t pass up the chance to get involved with this DeFi early on. Contribute to the presale now to join the upcoming changes in the cryptocurrency field.

Smart Investors Are Already Accumulating Ruvi AI (RUVI) While It’s Still Cheap,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-losing-hype-smart-investors-are-already-accumulating/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), once one of the most talked-about tokens in the cryptocurrency market, seems to be losing its edge. Amid shifting investor sentiment, many are turning their attention to Ruvi AI , an AI-powered blockchain project that is rapidly gaining traction. With its innovative approach, ongoing presale success, and strong growth potential, Ruvi AI is positioning itself as a more practical and rewarding choice for smart investors. Shiba Inu’s Fading Momentum Shiba Inu generated massive interest as a meme coin with community-driven hype. Early investors saw significant returns, but as the market matures, demand for tokens without clear utility seems to be waning. SHIB’s reliance on social media buzz and speculative trading has left investors questioning its long-term value, especially in a crowded market of similar assets. The hype-driven nature of tokens like Shiba Inu has created an opportunity for projects with real use cases to shine. This shift in focus is driving investors toward Ruvi AI, a token that’s built on innovation, practicality, and scalability. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success Shows Its Potential Ruvi AI has made an impressive entrance into the crypto world. During its presale, the project has raised over $1.6 million and sold more than 140 million tokens , underlining the growing confidence in its vision. Now in its Phase 2 presale , Ruvi AI is priced at $0.015 per token , offering an affordable entry point for investors who see its potential. What sets Ruvi AI apart is its structured valuation model . Post-presale, the token price is set to rise to $0.07 , giving current investors assured growth opportunities. Analysts predict even further appreciation, estimating a price of $1 per token post-listing . This structured approach to valuation reduces speculation and ensures a clear growth trajectory. Practical Applications Drive Ruvi AI’s Demand Unlike meme coins, Ruvi AI is rooted in solving real-world challenges. Its integration of blockchain and artificial intelligence is opening doors to disruptive advancements in key industries, including: Healthcare Ruvi AI modernizes healthcare by using AI to improve diagnostics, optimize patient management, and streamline hospital operations. These advancements address critical inefficiencies in the medical field. Logistics Supply chain inefficiencies are a common challenge for global businesses. Ruvi AI offers AI-driven solutions to optimize routes, reduce delays, and cut operational costs, creating significant value for logistics companies. Finance The finance sector benefits from Ruvi AI’s fraud detection tools and blockchain transparency. Securing transactions and improving trust makes Ruvi AI an attractive choice for financial institutions. This focus on useful and scalable applications makes Ruvi AI a cryptocurrency with clear long-term relevance. VIP Tiers Deliver Unparalleled ROI Opportunities Ruvi AI’s innovative VIP investment tier system rewards early adopters with generous token bonuses. Here’s how the system breaks down: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers allow investors to maximize their returns while providing transparent growth indicators, making Ruvi AI’s presale an appealing opportunity for those seeking high ROI. Why Smart Investors Are Backing Ruvi AI The waning hype around Shiba Inu reflects a broader market shift toward cryptocurrencies with practical utility and scalability . Ruvi AI is capitalizing on this trend by offering innovative solutions, structured pricing, and significant growth potential. Its combination of affordability, real-world applications, and strategic presale timing make it an attractive investment choice. For those who are ready to move beyond speculative tokens and focus on projects with tangible impact , Ruvi AI represents a rare early-stage opportunity. Don’t wait to act, as its presale won’t last forever. Savvy investors are already accumulating Ruvi AI while it’s still cheap, recognizing the immense value it brings to the table.

This achievement comes just 17 months after their launch in January 2024. These crypto funds have quickly grown into one of the most active ETF products in the world. Reportedly, it rivaled long-established giants like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and the Invesco Nasdaq-100 ETF. Bitcoin ETFs’ Early Growth Fueled by Market Momentum When Bitcoin ETFs first launched, interest was immediate and strong. In March 2024, they raked in $100 billion in total trading volume, which doubled when Bitcoin’s price hit nearly $74,000. However, this upward trading trend slowed, with Bitcoin’s price between $50,000 and $70,000. The ETFs continued to trade actively during this time, but without the same fast growth rate. Positive momentum returned to the market when Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2024. This event helped Bitcoin break past its previous highs, and the ETFs quickly passed the $500 billion mark in cumulative trading volume. Bitcoin ETF Market Outlook In 2025, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to gain strong momentum, reaching $750 billion in trading volume in February 2025. As of June 9, 2025, the trading volume is at $995.2 billion, very close to the $1 trillion milestone. Bitcoin’s price is also nearly its latest all-time high of $112,000. According the time of writing, the flagship crypto has been trading at $109,055, up by 1,21% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Impressively, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs are now among the biggest crypto funds in the world, with over $120 billion in assets. Most of this comes from top performer BlackRock’s IBIT , which holds $70 billion and handles 79% of the total trading volume. In contrast, Grayscale’s Bitcoin ETF, on the other hand, has lost $23 billion due to higher fees. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs have not seen the same level of success . Since launching in July 2024, it has raked in $83.4 billion in trading volume and holds $6.6 billion in assets. Ethereum spot ETFs’ net inflows are $3.4 billion, which is positive, but much smaller than Bitcoin ETFs. Investor Confidence Is Growing At first, many thought only asset managers would benefit from the Bitcoin ETF. However, Bitcoin ’s price rise, rising from $30,000 to over $110,000 since January 2024, shows that the whole market has gained. This growth has helped Bitcoin become a more trusted and mainstream investment, with institutional investors heavily investing in crypto investment funds and showing growing interest in Bitcoin.

HYPE is turning heads with massive daily trading volume, and PEPE shows classic signs of bullish momentum, yet questions remain about lasting value. This is where Web3 ai is beginning to shift the conversation. Its $WAI token has already raised over $7.4 million and is designed with specific use cases like AI-powered trading tools and decentralized governance. With a focus on practical features, Web3 ai introduces utility in a market often driven by hype. The spotlight is now on Web3 ai $WAI token utility. $WAI at $0.000422 Offers Access, Governance, & Utility The $WAI token from Web3 ai is not just gaining attention for its price. It is building momentum because of what it unlocks. With more than $7.4 million raised so far and stage 8 of the crypto presale pricing $WAI at $0.000422, early buyers are aiming for a possible 1,747% gain when it lists at $0.005242. But this token represents more than potential returns. It unlocks access and influence within the platform. Web3 ai’s roadmap outlines how $WAI will allow users to subscribe to tools such as curated crypto news feeds, ROI forecast engines, and more. As the project expands, holders will also vote on platform upgrades, fee models, and feature rollouts. Governance is not a loose promise, it is coded into the roadmap, giving token holders a role in shaping the future of the platform. The project also includes a deflationary structure where token burns are triggered by user activity and tool subscriptions. This means as more people use the platform, the token supply will shrink, potentially increasing its value. For those thinking long term, holding $WAI is more than just speculation. It is a bet on ownership, access, and utility in a growing AI-based crypto ecosystem. Compared to many popular crypto coins built on momentum alone, $WAI offers something more. It combines scarcity, utility, and governance power. Investors are not just buying a token, they are investing in a system they can help direct. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Forecast Hints at New Highs The Hyperliquid (HYPE) token is currently trading at around $34.76, after recently hitting a new all-time high of $39. Analysts and traders are watching it closely as it continues to show strong signs of growth. With over $1 billion in daily volume, HYPE has become one of the most active assets in the market. This consistent liquidity and trading activity are supporting bullish predictions. Many are now entertaining the idea of HYPE reaching $100 in the coming months. Positive indicators such as deep liquidity and efficient execution add to the project’s strength as a trading-focused network. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) price forecast remains positive as long as market participation continues. With growing trader interest, it has become one of the most watched popular crypto coins, especially for those chasing high-growth opportunities in a short window. PEPE’s Whale Activity Sparks Bullish Expectations PEPE is also back in the spotlight after two whales placed over $3 million in long positions using the Hyperliquid platform. This has raised expectations that a price breakout may be around the corner, giving the project a new round of attention. Technical charts show a double bottom pattern on PEPE’s weekly chart, a bullish sign that often comes before strong upward moves. Analysts are watching $0.000027 as the next resistance level, pointing to a possible run if volume increases. At the same time, PEPE is consolidating between $0.000014 and $0.000016. If the price pushes above this range with solid buying pressure, a breakout could follow. However, if momentum fades or whales begin to exit, the project may see renewed selling. Still, the current setup suggests that PEPE’s bullish momentum remains intact for now. To Wrap Up Momentum can be exciting, but without underlying value, it often fades. Hyperliquid (HYPE) and PEPE are certainly delivering strong moves, and both are considered popular crypto coins for traders who follow price action and volume. But long-term investors are looking deeper. Web3 ai’s $WAI token offers clear and usable benefits, from powering real AI tools to enabling community governance. It also features a built-in deflationary system that rewards actual platform use. These elements make it more than just another token. It represents a working product with long-term goals. In today’s market, chasing short-term hype might yield quick wins, but sustainable value is usually tied to real-world application. Web3 ai is not just riding the wave, it is quietly building an ecosystem that gives its community power, access, and long-term value.

Nazarov notes in a new YouTube video that the decentralized oracle network is arriving at a point where financial institutions have been reaching out for help with various projects. “At this point, I’ve been – between last year and this year so far – almost everywhere. Last year, we covered a lot of Asia, the Middle East, Australia, many of the top environments where cryptocurrencies and blockchains are getting adopted. This year, with the new stance on regulation in the US, we are very heavily covering all of the US institutions in addition to continuing to cover those in Asia and the Middle East. So I can’t mention exact names, because they want to wait to announce, they have all these processes with NDAs (non-disclosure agreements). It’s a very tightly controlled process, but I would say between last year and this year, we’re in various stages of conversations with probably all the top institutions in those geographies. I think that those top institutions basically want to use the solution that solves all their problems, is used by the other top-tier banks and players, has all the functionality they want, whether that’s identity, data connectivity, orchestration. And there’s really no system other than Chainlink that meets that high standard.” LINK is trading at $14.50 at time of writing.

BlockDAG: Rising Presale Giant Raised $293M BlockDAG’s presale success is turning heads in the crypto space. Over $293 million has been raised, and 22.1 billion BDAG coins have already been sold. While the current Stage 28 rate is $0.0262, buyers can still access a locked price of $0.0018 until June 13, which means a potential return of 2,520% versus the confirmed launch price of $0.05.

EVM compatibility lets developers easily link Ethereum dApps. With its live testnet and simple no-code app builder, it’s already usable for developers. What boosts BlockDAG even more is its huge user base. The X1 mobile app is actively used by over 1.5 million users daily. A recent viral X post has sparked buzz about big partnerships. Adding to the excitement, the GO LIVE reveal will confirm 20 centralised exchange launches. For those chasing the top cryptos to buy today, BlockDAG is clearly a frontrunner. 2. Aptos (APT): Facing Downside Risk Aptos is trading in the $4.63 to $4.70 range after a ~3.4% dip this month. Technical charts hint it might slide further to $3.50 by June 11 if market pressure holds. Support zones at $4.24 and $3.99 will be key to holding ground. While targets of $9.72 to $15.54 by year-end are in play, Aptos faces tough competition from up-and-coming Layer 1 chains. With BlockDAG gaining traction, Aptos may struggle to stay in focus. Some may still consider APT a good hold, but in the hunt for top cryptos to buy today, BlockDAG could be pulling ahead. 3. Arweave (AR): High Use, Slow Climb Arweave holds steady near $6.50, backed by fresh contracts and work with NGOs on environmental data. Its AO mainnet and token listings keep daily volume in the $21M to $27M range. Projections for short-term prices range from $6.43 to $6.67, with longer-term highs between $10.88 and $14.81. Despite its real-world use in decentralised storage, AR’s slower adoption and modest growth pace make it less appealing than faster-growing coins. Whether Arweave makes the list of top cryptos to buy today depends on your risk appetite. 4. Avalanche (AVAX): Boost from Web3 Gaming Avalanche has gained ground, jumping over $20 on the back of Web3 gaming like MapleStory Universe. It saw more than 1 million daily transactions twice in one week, with 5.8 million in weekly volume. Though AVAX is supported by strong demand and is trading above the $19.40 support, its RSI levels hint at possible short-term consolidation. Predictions place AVAX in the $20.8 to $21 zone. It remains strong in gaming, but its upward movement may be levelling off. That leaves space for rising names like BlockDAG to emerge among the top cryptos to buy today. To Sum Up! By mid-2025, the market is shifting from pure hype to coins showing clear growth. Aptos, Arweave, and Avalanche each serve their purposes well. But when it comes to the top cryptos to buy today , BlockDAG leads by example. With $293 million in funding, over 1.5 million mobile miners, EVM-ready tools, and a major GO LIVE reveal coming, it blends strength with future potential. The limited-time $0.0018 entry price offers a final window before exchange launches. With analysts eyeing a $1 price tag down the line, BlockDAG looks solid for both near-term and longer-term gains. If you’re scanning the market for crypto winners in 2025, BlockDAG isn’t just making noise, it’s setting the pace.

Over the past 24 hours, the price has climbed by 2.8%, with candlestick charts revealing a noticeable upward trajectory. Solana Stochastics And CCI Signal Short-Term Strength Earlier in the day, SOL briefly dipped to around $151 but managed to recover steadily, reaching a current price of $155.35. Grayhoood pointed out that this short-term strength is consistent with Solana’s 7-day performance, which shows a modest 1.4% increase. However, the longer-term outlook remains volatile, with SOL still down by 3.9% over the past year. Related Reading: Solana Picture Bigger Than $420: Analyst Predicts 140% Surge To New ATHs Grayhoood revealed that technical indicators are suggesting a cautiously optimistic outlook for SOL. As price action continues to show signs of recovery, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is likely positioned in a neutral zone, indicating the recent uptick. This positioning allows space for further gains, but also signals a potential shift into overbought territory if SOL’s price surges too rapidly. The Stochastic Oscillator and Commodity Channel Index (CCI) also point to short-term bullish momentum, especially with SOL breaking through the $154 resistance level. These indicators suggest that buyers are regaining control. However, Grayhoood cautioned that while momentum appears to be building, the recent price dip observed earlier in the day reveals that sellers are not entirely out of the picture. Recovery Gains Traction, But Yearly Losses Still Weigh In To further reinforce his claim, the analyst pointed to Solana’s moving averages, which currently present a mixed but insightful technical outlook. In the short term, the 7-day and 14-day moving averages hint at a hold or mild buying pressure. This aligns with SOL’s recent bounce from $151 to $155.35, signaling that momentum may be shifting in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Solana’s Old Hands Are Moving—Is Trouble Brewing? However, when viewed from a broader lens, long-term averages continue to reflect lingering weakness. The 30-day and yearly trends, which show declines of 9.3% and 3.9% respectively, suggest that the larger market remains cautious. These figures reveal that while the recent gains are encouraging, they have not fully reversed the bearish structure seen over the past months. Overall, the analyst believes that despite the volatility seen over the past few weeks, market sentiment is beginning to lean bullish in the short term. Solana’s recent performance, supported by its ability to reclaim key levels and maintain upward momentum, offers a more favorable outlook heading into the near future. If current trends persist and key resistances are successfully challenged, the path may open for a broader shift in sentiment.

The critics believe there’s a new section in the amended text they’re describing as a ‘Gensler-era provision.” ‘The Gensler-era provisions’ would eliminate exemptions for previously issued tokens, instead giving the U.S. SEC sweeping authority to determine whether each token qualifies as a security. Critics say the approach reintroduces uncertainty about what the bill is meant to resolve. CLARITY Act undergoes markup today 🚨NEW: Ahead of today’s CLARITY Act markup in @FinancialCmte and @HouseAgGOP , some industry players I’ve been speaking to are raising concerns over a new section in the amended text they’re describing as a “Gensler-era provision.” The change would eliminate exemptions for… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 10, 2025 Committee Chairman French Hill introduced the CLARITY Act of H.R. 3633 on May 30, which is currently continuing its markup of the Act at its June 10, 2025, Full Committee Markup hearing. The bill is expected to expand the CFTC’s authority over cryptocurrency markets by establishing a new regulated framework for digital commodities. Hill stated at today’s markup that the Committee held a thoughtful and constructive hearing on digital asset market structure legislation, the CLARITY Act. According to him, the crypto industry has been plagued by regulatory uncertainty, and the absence of clear rules has stifled innovation, discouraged entrepreneurs, and confused investors. “Digital assets and blockchain technology have the potential to fundamentally reshape how we interact with the internet. These innovations can unlock opportunity, empower individuals, and expand access to the financial system, but we need a regulatory framework in place to experience these benefits.” – French Hill , Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. In a notice released ahead of the hearing, Hill also introduced an amendment to the CLARITY Act that focuses on the treatment of certain non-controlling blockchain developers. According to the proposed amendment, certain blockchain developers or service providers would not be considered money transmitters or subject to their registration requirements. The Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act has been partly shadowed by calls for provisions to stop Trump from potentially using the legislation to his personal benefit. Representative Bryan Steil, who chairs the digital asset committee, said his Republican colleagues refused to acknowledge President Trump’s crypto corruption allegations, which he believes limit their efforts to pass the bill. Representative Maxine Waters, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, has not mentioned anything to suggest that she and many other Democrats will vote for the legislation if the time comes. Waters had organized a Minority Day hearing on Friday to address allegations of corruption through the U.S. President Donald Trump’s ties to the crypto industry. The California lawmaker acknowledged that no provision within the CLARITY Act addresses the crimes she laid out. Before Trump’s dinner to reward his memecoin holders on May 22, Waters unveiled a separate bill to block the president, vice president, members of Congress, and their families from engaging with digital assets. She also believes that the bill only legitimizes the alleged crimes by Trump. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres, who has previously advocated for legislation impacting the crypto industry, has suggested he will support the market structure bill. Tuesday’s markup hearing will include crucial discussion and vote for amendments to the bill before potentially sending the bill to the full chamber. Lawmakers are also expected to vote in the Senate soon on the GENIUS Act – a bill to regulate the payment of stablecoins. Vance advocates for the advancement of stablecoin legislation Vice President JD Vance, on May 28, called for eliminating regulatory barriers to the crypto sector, acknowledging the end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. He also highlighted the need to pass stablecoin legislation that fosters innovation while providing legal clarity. Vance also supported the comprehensive market structure bill to define the regulatory framework for other digital assets. He reaffirmed the administration’s commitment to advancing pro-crypto policies and urged the industry to continue pushing for legislative action. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal believes that the stablecoin legislation has made incredible progress because there’s bipartisan consensus that it’s in the U.S.’s interest to have sensible rules for stablecoins. Grewal also said the market structure bill is equally important for long-term stability and growth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Ethereum (ETH) could soon experience heightened price swings, according to new data from Kraken. Alexia Theodorou, Head of Derivatives at Kraken, said in a June 10 obtained by crypto.news that open interest on Ethereum contracts hit an all-time high, a sign that speculative activity is ramping up. “Open interest in ETH perpetuals on Kraken reached an all-time high of 30,000 ETH earlier this week, signaling a notable uptick in speculative activity around the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap,” Alexia Theodorou, Kraken. The likely catalyst for the rise in derivatives activity is growing institutional inflows into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds, Theodorou explained. However, it remains unclear which direction these flows may drive Ethereum in the near term. Rather than indicating conviction, the current positioning appears to reflect anticipation of volatility.

45766462,https://cryptonews.com/?p=369742,1749585728,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45766462.jpeg,BOJ June Meeting Could Trigger Major Moves in Stocks and Crypto – What to Watch,https://cryptonews.com/news/boj-june-meeting-stocks-crypto/,"The Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting, scheduled for June 16–17, is drawing intense global attention, and for good reason. As speculation builds, analysts say the central bank’s next move could spark a major shift across risk markets, from Japanese equities to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. BOJ Meeting: Arthur Hayes Predicts Bitcoin Boom if QE Returns Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of Maelstrom, believes the BOJ could soon shift back to quantitative easing (QE), a move that would inject liquidity into the economy and lift risk assets. “If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting, risk assets are going to fly,” Hayes posted on X on June 10. I don’t think ordinary Japanese plebes would agree. If the BOJ delays QT, and restarts selected QE at its June meeting risk assets are going to fly. LFG $BTC pic.twitter.com/ET08M6tWeS — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 10, 2025 QE, short for quantitative easing, refers to central bank bond purchases designed to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic activity. A shift in this direction could serve as a tailwind for crypto and stock markets, both of which are closely watching Japan’s policy decisions amid rising global volatility. According to a report from Bloomberg, the central bank is expected to slow the pace of its quantitative tightening (QT). Since last summer, the BOJ has been reducing its government bond purchases by ¥400 billion ($2.8 billion) per quarter. But that pace may soon be halved. “The pace of reduction is likely to be eased to around ¥200 billion per quarter,” said Eiji Maeda, a former BOJ executive director and current president of Chibagin Research Institute. “They won’t keep going with ¥400 billion.” Governor Kazuo Ueda’s board is also set to review the existing bond-buying program through 2026 and beyond. Maeda added that once monthly bond purchases reach around ¥2 trillion by early 2027, further reductions will likely pause. Although the BOJ is widely expected to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 0.5% next week, the broader market focus is now on how far and how fast it will scale back its bond purchases. Japan’s inflation has been above the 2% target for three straight years, the highest among G7 nations, fanning expectations that a shift toward more easing could still be on the table. Still, uncertainties around U.S. tariffs and a recent GDP contraction complicate the timing of further rate hikes. “The BOJ must be careful,” Maeda warned. “They shouldn’t rush for normalization when these thick, dark clouds are hanging over the economy.” Bitcoin’s Price Action and BoJ Policy Shift Could Set Stage for New Bull Cycle As investors brace for the BOJ’s June 16 meeting, market focus is intensifying on how policy changes could ripple across global assets, including crypto. The BOJ’s announcement last July to reduce government bond purchases by ¥400 billion per quarter marked a major step toward quantitative tightening. With an interim assessment now due, insiders suggest the central bank may consider a gentler path, cutting purchases by only ¥200 billion per quarter starting in April 2027. Such a shift could indicate a longer-term dovish tilt, potentially spurring capital flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Bitcoin has responded to Japan’s tightening moves before. For example, on May 22, just two days after Japan’s 30-year bond yield hit a record 3.185%, BTC surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. While currently trading at $109,152, the flagship crypto maintains bullish momentum and strong technical support above $75,000. Source: Cryptonews.com . Price action is now consolidating within a descending triangle, a setup known to precede explosive breakouts. With volume stable and RSI neutral, all eyes are on a potential breakout before July 1. Bitcoin’s recent volatility has left traders torn between optimism and caution, as shifting global capital flows collide with conflicting technical signals. #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/ZcWeyewRad — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 10, 2025 If BTC decisively breaches the $110,000 resistance, analysts expect fresh highs toward $115,000–$118,000, igniting the next phase of the bull run.

According to cryptocurrency analyst Master Ananda, the token could rally to $4.5 in the near term if current trends persist. Ananda, writing in a June 8 analysis published on TradingView , identified a higher low pattern formed on June 5, which he interprets as a strong signal that the consolidation phase is ending. He also referenced earlier price movements, citing April 7 as a short-term low and May 12 as the recent high. Between these two dates, XRP underwent a 24-day retracement, followed by nearly four weeks of sideways movement. This, according to Ananda, indicates a classic accumulation phase that typically precedes a breakout. His projection points to a direct climb toward $4.51, with the price expected to bypass resistance levels at $2.71 and $3.02. If the bullish trajectory holds, Ananda anticipates XRP could reach this target by early August. However, he also acknowledged that $4.5 could serve as a significant resistance point once tested. Short-Term Performance and Market Behavior XRP has shown signs of recovery from a sharp decline it experienced earlier this month, when prices briefly approached the $2.00 mark. Since then, the asset has bounced back considerably. At its strongest point during the recovery, XRP added approximately $6 billion to its market capitalization in a single day. The token has overcome the $2.30 resistance level and is currently trading at $2.31. Reclaiming this price zone could be key to testing further resistance at $2.50. Trading Activity and Institutional Developments Recent market data supports the view of renewed investor confidence. XRP’s 24-hour trading volume surged by nearly 50%, reaching $2.7 billion. This significant increase in trading activity may reflect growing retail and institutional interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional attention may also intensify following Nasdaq’s proposal on June 2 to include XRP in its flagship Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). Should the proposal be approved, the asset would be added to the portfolio of the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ). Such a move could introduce more institutional capital into the asset and further validate its position in the broader crypto market. Technical Overview The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 53.3, indicating neutral momentum with a slight upward bias. While this does not confirm a breakout, it supports the case for continued strength if buying pressure intensifies. Master Ananda’s analysis offers a bullish short-term outlook for XRP, forecasting a potential rise to $4.5 by early August. While this scenario depends on continued technical strength and favourable market conditions, institutional developments and growing trading volume could provide the necessary support for this move. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring key resistance levels in the coming weeks as XRP approaches critical price zones.

This streak started after its last dip below six figures on May 8, and not once since then has it closed under that level. The price pulled back from its May 22 all-time high of $112,000, dropping to $100,428 by Friday, but heavy weekend buying pushed it back to $105,000. By Monday, it had surged again to $110,000, with traders responding to renewed optimism around US-China trade discussions. The fact that it hasn’t broken below $100K for a full month has crypto traders calling it a key milestone—even if some still see it more as a psychological checkpoint than a technical win. Still, it’s a major line that held strong, and analysts are watching closely to see what’s next. Traders defend $100K on pullbacks Read Harvey, a technical analyst at Wolfe Research, told CNBC the move above $100K wasn’t just about hype. “What really stood out to us was price’s ability to hold that level on the back test, when it briefly fell to $100,000 on Thursday. It also happened to align perfectly with the 50-day moving average,” Read said. He added that he sees the current setup as a launchpad toward the previous high of $112,000. Read also expects Bitcoin to spend a bit more time consolidating around its current level before any breakout to new highs, saying a temporary pause is normal after such a run. While short-term traders are focused on charts and averages, others are looking at the bigger picture. Ben Kurland, CEO of crypto analytics platform DYOR, said this $100,000 level is no longer just about market emotion. “$100,000 isn’t just speculative froth now,” Ben said. “It’s a new floor being tested and held by institutional flows, ETF inflows , and a maturing investor base.” He added that the pattern of short-lived pumps followed by sharp retracements is starting to fade. Ben believes this consolidation is healthy and sets up Bitcoin for the next move. “If $100,000 is the new base,” he said, “then $120,000-$130,000 becomes the next logical zone—especially as macro conditions stabilize and sidelined capital seeks asymmetric upside.” Long-term holders sell, ETFs keep buying While institutions and funds continue to buy, some older holders are starting to cash in. Tyrone Ross, founder and president of advisory firm 401 Financial, said the 30-day stretch above $100K might not be a massive technical feat, but it still matters. “On-chain data shows long-term holders are selling,” Tyrone said. He explained that while demand from ETFs and companies remains strong, retail investors haven’t returned in full force yet. But if Bitcoin keeps holding these levels, he said, retail interest is likely to come back in waves. Tyrone pointed out that May 27 saw a big shift. At that point, when Bitcoin was around $109,000, spending by long-term holders—people who’ve held for at least six months—shot up to around 40,000 Bitcoin, according to CryptoQuant. That’s since dropped all the way down to about 6,000 as of Monday. Over the same stretch, overall 30-day demand has fallen too, from 228,000 Bitcoin down to 126,000. That slowdown might cool the pace of price growth in the short term, according to Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant. Still, Bitcoin keeps pushing. On Tuesday, it was trading at roughly $108,800, about 3% below its peak. Earlier that same day, it climbed to $110,500, its highest point since the May 22 record. With this current streak still intact, everyone’s watching to see if $100K becomes more than just a floor—whether it becomes the new normal. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A recent report by Bitget, a leading cryptocurrency exchange and Web3 company, has shed light on the alarming rise of AI-powered deepfake and Zoom-related crypto frauds. The report details how cybercriminals are leveraging cutting-edge tools and social engineering tactics to deceive users, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. As the crypto market continues to grow, understanding these threats is crucial for investors and regulators alike. The growing threat of crypto fraud Crypto fraud has been a persistent issue since the inception of digital currencies. The anonymity and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies make them an attractive target for scammers. Over the years, fraudsters have evolved from basic phishing emails to complex schemes involving ransomware, Ponzi schemes, and impersonation scams. According to Bitget’s 2025 Anti-Scam Research Report, global crypto scam losses reached a staggering $4.6 billion in 2024. This surge is largely attributed to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which have enabled scammers to create hyper-realistic deepfakes and orchestrate elaborate social engineering attacks. The report highlights how AI is reshaping the landscape of cybercrime. Deepfake technology, which uses AI to manipulate audio and video content, allows fraudsters to impersonate public figures, executives, and even trusted contacts with chilling accuracy. Meanwhile, platforms like Zoom, widely used for virtual meetings, have become a breeding ground for scams where criminals pose as legitimate business leaders to trick victims into transferring funds or disclosing sensitive information. Deepfake scams: a new frontier in cybercrime One of the most disturbing revelations from the Bitget report is the proliferation of deepfake scams. These scams involve the creation of fabricated videos or audio clips that mimic real individuals, often used to gain trust and manipulate victims. For instance, fraudsters have been known to impersonate CEOs or financial advisors in video calls, convincing employees or investors to wire large sums of money to fraudulent accounts. The report cites instances where deepfake technology was used to replicate the voice and appearance of high-profile figures, leading to significant financial losses. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, authorities across Asia dismantled 87 deepfake scam rings, underscoring the scale of the problem. As AI tools become more accessible, the potential for such scams to proliferate is alarming. This projection aligns with earlier findings from Bitget’s 2024 Deepfake Report, which emphasized the urgent need for user education and advanced security protocols to combat these threats. Zoom scams: exploiting trust in virtual spaces Another critical focus of the Bitget report is the rise of Zoom-based scams, where fraudsters exploit the trust associated with virtual meeting platforms. These scams often rely on meticulous social engineering, where attackers gather personal information about their targets through social media or data breaches. Armed with this information, they craft convincing narratives to pressure victims into making hasty decisions. The Bitget report notes that such scams are particularly effective in corporate environments, where employees may feel obligated to comply with urgent requests from supposed superiors. This exploitation of trust and authority makes Zoom scams a potent threat in the crypto space, where large transactions are often conducted digitally. Implications for the crypto industry The implications of these findings are far-reaching for both individual investors and the broader cryptocurrency industry. The $4.6 billion in losses reported for 2024 represents not just financial damage but also a significant erosion of trust in digital assets. As scams become more sophisticated, new investors may hesitate to enter the market, stunting the growth of an industry that thrives on accessibility and innovation. Furthermore, the use of AI in fraud raises ethical questions about the development and regulation of such technologies.

According to the analysis, the Bitcoin balance on cryptocurrency exchanges has decreased by 3.77 million BTC since February 2020. This means that approximately $219 billion worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from exchanges. Although this major movement may seem like a sell-off at first glance, according to Alphractal, the opposite is true: This rise is a strong indicator of growing confidence and maturity in the market. Alphractal noted that investors have no intention of selling their Bitcoin by moving it to personal wallets, but rather see the digital asset as a long-term store of value. According to analysts, this indicates that the “HODL” strategy is gaining strength. Related News: BREAKING: Rumors of Solana Spot ETF Approval Emerge, Could Stir Up the Market - Price Reacts With Bitcoin being pulled off exchanges, selling pressure is thought to have significantly decreased, creating a supply squeeze that could make it easier for prices to move upwards in the event of a potential demand increase. Alphractal sees this as a “very bullish signal.” As a result, Alphractal says that the 3.77 million BTC outflow from exchanges is not a sign of panic, but rather a strong belief in the future of Bitcoin. This development shows that Bitcoin is increasingly being adopted as “digital gold” by more and more people. *This is not investment advice.

Global losses to crypto scams surged to $4.6 billion in 2024. The report was co-authored by leading crypto exchange Bitget, blockchain security firm SlowMist, and analytics provider Elliptic. AI-Powered Crypto Scams Surge to $4.6 Billion in 2024 In its report, Bitget revealed that scams in the crypto space are becoming more sophisticated, using AI-generated deepfakes to deceive victims across the globe. The report stated that in just the first quarter of 2025, at least 87 AI-driven scam rings were dismantled. Bitget unveils the 2025 Anti-Scam Report, in collaboration with blockchain security leaders @SlowMist_Team and @elliptic . From phishing rings to fake staking dApps, the report exposes real onchain threats, and how Bitget combats them through our Anti-Scam Hub and $500M… pic.twitter.com/7ou5skz4ai — Bitget (@bitgetglobal) June 10, 2025 These groups were found using synthetic videos, fake Zoom calls, Trojan-laced job offers, and deepfake impersonations of trusted figures in the crypto industry to deceive users and steal millions. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen emphasized the threat posed by these AI-driven attacks. “The biggest threat to crypto today isn’t volatility—it’s deception,” she said. “AI has made scams faster, cheaper, and harder to detect. At Bitget, we believe fighting back requires both technological rigor and ecosystem-wide collaboration.” To combat this growing threat, Bitget has launched “Anti-Scam Month,” a global awareness campaign to educate users and improve industry security standards. As part of this initiative, the company has rolled out an Anti-Scam Hub and enhanced detection systems. It also maintains a $500 million Protection Fund to help cover losses from fraud. The report identifies three major scam tactics: deepfake impersonations, social engineering, and Ponzi schemes disguised as DeFi or NFT projects. It also reveals how criminals use cross-chain bridges and obfuscation tools to launder stolen funds, making it harder for authorities to trace and recover assets. SlowMist and Elliptic contributed forensic insights to the report, analyzing how professional scam rings exploit platforms like Telegram and X (formerly Twitter) to bait victims. Lisa, the Security Operations Lead at SlowMist, said that the tactics evolve, but the underlying psychology remains constant. “Users must be informed, skeptical, and security-minded at all times,” she warned. Yu Xian, CEO of SlowMist, pointed out a new scam method involving fake Zoom software. Victims are tricked into downloading what appears to be a legitimate video call app. Once installed, it gives attackers control of the victim’s computer. “These attackers are very convincing,” he said. “The videos shown during calls are deepfakes, and they look frighteningly real.” “Criminals are scaling their operations with AI. So we are also scaling our tools to fight back. Our collaboration with Bitget reflects the urgency of this threat,” Elliptic’s Lead Crypto Threat Researcher, Arda Akartuna, added. The report ends with a call for vigilance. For users, that means verifying links, avoiding suspicious downloads, and staying informed. For companies, it means stronger defenses, regular security training, and fostering a “verify before you trust” mindset. Source: Anti-Scam Report 2025 As AI-powered scams become harder to detect, the crypto industry faces a new frontier of risk, one where seeing and hearing no longer means believing. AI and Social Media Scams Cost Victims Nearly $10 Billion in 2024 Following the surge in AI-driven deepfake scams, crypto fraud losses in 2024 reached at least $9.9 billion, according to Chainalysis . While this marks a 29% decline from the $14 billion stolen in 2021, experts warn the true figure could top $12 billion as investigations continue. One alarming trend is the 210% jump in deposits linked to “ pig butchering” scams , a tactic where scammers build trust over time before draining victims’ funds. Despite more victims falling prey, the average amount lost per person dropped by 55%, suggesting scammers are targeting larger groups with smaller amounts. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) points to social media platforms like Facebook, X, Telegram, and WhatsApp as key channels scammers exploit , often using AI-generated content and emotional manipulation tactics such as FOMO and romance scams. @NASAA identifies crypto and social media scams as major threats in 2025, with scammers using AI and emotional tactics to deceive investors. #CryptoScams #SocialMedia #AI https://t.co/T4A9oSXJ4m — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 7, 2025 Nearly 40% of regulators predict AI will become the main tool for crypto fraud, with deepfakes expected to rise sharply.

These events have injected momentum into the market, reinforcing expectations of a strong altseason in 2025.

According to insiders, the SEC intends to provide feedback on the updated S-1 filings within the next 30 days, keeping the market hopeful for a July green light.

The gaming retailer revealed it had acquired 4,710 Bitcoins between May 3 and June 10, a move that aligns with its growing pivot toward digital assets. Despite a 17% drop in net sales compared to last year, GameStop significantly reduced its operating loss to $10.8 million. A $35.5 million impairment from restructuring impacted results, yet the company posted a surprising net income of $44.8 million, up from a $32.3 million loss last year. After adjustments, the net income ballooned to $83.1 million, further underscoring the company’s improved financial footing and strategic shifts. GameStop’s cash and liquid asset holdings have grown to $6.4 billion, a sharp rise from just $1 billion a year earlier, giving it ample room for further crypto-related investments. The company also finalised the sale of its Canadian operations on May 4, signalling a broader international restructuring aimed at sharpening focus. Crypto market sentiment has turned bullish across the board Notably, these developments come at a time when market sentiment is rapidly shifting from cautious to bullish, largely driven by institutional confidence and regulatory engagement. The majority of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA,) are in the green as the markets await the Fed meeting later this month . And now with the Solana ETF discussions gaining momentum and GameStop reinforcing its crypto playbook, investors are paying closer attention to what could be the beginning of altseason 2025. As the regulatory picture clears and capital inflows accelerate, the crypto market is setting the stage for what many believe could be its next major rally.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.25%, or 105.11 points whille the S&P 500 gained 0.55%. The Nasdaq index outperformed with a 0.63% gain and is now approximately 285 points away from reclaiming the 20,000 leve. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described U.S. – China trade negotiations as going “really, really well,” suggesting a resolution may be close. Export controls remain central to discussions. U.S. officials are seeking Beijing’s release of rare earth materials, while China is pressing for eased access to American semiconductors. Still, the mood was cautious on Wall Street, where investors are watching closely for signs of a breakthrough. Chinese markets, meanwhile, showed renewed volatility, with a sudden dip in equities early Tuesday reflecting investor nerves. Markets have been sensitive to signals from the talks. Despite optimism from officials, President Trump warned Monday that “China’s not easy,” tempering expectations.

The improvement was linked to easing tariff concerns and anticipation around Trump’s tax-and-spending bill, though some firms remained wary about the broader outlook. The World Bank, however, lowered its U.S. growth forecast to 1.4% for 2025, citing ongoing trade uncertainty. Elsewhere, Blackstone announced plans to invest up to $500 billion in Europe over the next decade, citing expectations of accelerating growth in the region.

Up 0.9% more than 1% in the last 24 hours, bitcoin was trading just above $110,000 shortly after the close of U.S. stock markets Tuesday. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — has risen 3.3% in the same period of time, mostly thanks to ether ETH, solana SOL, chainlink LINK all gaining 5%-7%. The standout performances, however, were put on by uniswap UNI and aave AAVE, which soared a whooping 24% and 13%, respectively. The move was prompted by optimistic comments on the topic of DeFi by Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins on Monday. Things have remained relatively calm on the equities front, with most crypto stocks flat on the day. A notable exception is Semler Scientific (SMLR), a firm that aims to follow Strategy’s (MSTR) playbook and vacuum up as much bitcoin as possible. Shares fell another 10% today, with the stock now trading for less than the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet . Despite the day’s gains, positioning across crypto markets still reflects a largely defensive tone. ""Funding rates and other leverage proxies point toward a steadily cautious sentiment in the market,” Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33 Research, pointed out in a Tuesday report. ""The broad risk appetite is remarkably weak, given that BTC is trading close to former all-time highs."" Binance’s BTC perpetual swaps posted negative funding rates on multiple days last week, with the average annualized funding rate now sitting at just 1.3% — a level typically associated with local market bottoms rather than tops, Lunde noted. ""Bitcoin does not usually peak in environments with negative funding rates,"" he wrote, adding that past instances of such positioning have more often preceded rallies than corrections. Flows into leveraged bitcoin ETFs paint a similar picture. The ProShares 2x Bitcoin ETF (BITX) currently holds exposure equivalent to 52,435 BTC — well below its December 2023 peak of 76,755 BTC — and inflows remain muted. This defensive positioning, according to Lunde, leaves room for a potential ""healthy rally"" in BTC to develop. Still, not all market watchers are convinced that the current price action marks the start of a sustainable breakout. ""Is this a true breakout that will continue? In my view, probably not,"" said Kirill Kretov, senior automation expert at CoinPanel. ""More likely, it’s part of the same volatility cycle where we see a rally now, followed by a sharp drop triggered by a negative announcement or some other narrative shift."" According to Kretov, the current environment favors experienced traders who can navigate volatility-driven market structure. Technically, he sees BTC's next key support levels at $105,000 and $100,000 — zones that could be tested if selling pressure returns.",Markets|Bitcoin|Uniswap|Aave|Semler scientific|Market Wrap|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-10 20:59:16

Saylor’s company Strategy now holds nearly 570,000 BTC worth almost $60B, a journey highlighted in a recent Financial Times documentary. Apple is gradually opening up to crypto, now allowing external crypto payment links in iOS apps and supporting stablecoin payments via Apple Pay and Mesh.

This upward momentum has put bulls firmly in control, igniting optimism among investors as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap tests critical thresholds. The recent rally has brought Ethereum close to a pivotal juncture, where breaking through higher levels could confirm sustained bullish momentum and potentially signal the start of a broader uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Structure Tightens – Tower Top Pattern In Play? Top analyst Daan recently shared an insightful analysis, highlighting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. This consolidation zone has proven to be a battleground, with the price repeatedly testing its boundaries. Notably, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has acted as both support and resistance in recent weeks. The price has also swept both the highs and lows within this range, suggesting a period of indecision that could precede a significant move. For bulls to maintain their dominance, clearing this resistance will be crucial. Failure to do so might invite renewed selling pressure, keeping the market on edge as traders watch for the next catalyst. Ethereum Clears Range Highs But Needs Confirmation Ethereum stands at a decisive level following a robust push into resistance, marking a critical moment for the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. After a notable surge, the price has tested key thresholds, drawing sharp attention from market participants. Sentiment remains deeply divided, with some analysts anticipating a breakout to higher prices, fueled by the recent momentum, while others predict an imminent correction as overextension risks loom. This uncertainty is compounded by global tensions and macroeconomic instability, which continue to drive volatility across financial markets, keeping traders on edge. Daan’s recent analysis provides a detailed perspective, noting that Ethereum remains rangebound between approximately $2,475 and $2,735. Within this zone, the price has swept both the highs and lows, reflecting a period of consolidation. Significantly, Ethereum has now retested the range high of $2,735 for the fourth time, a level that has repeatedly served as a psychological and technical barrier. According to Daan, this prolonged range play suggests that a breakout—either upward or downward—is on the horizon, likely triggering a substantial move. However, he cautions that until such a breakout occurs, it’s prudent to avoid overcommitting to either bullish or bearish positions. The analyst points out that over the past few weeks, traders have repeatedly bet on breakouts in both directions, only to face choppy conditions that often result in losses. This pattern of indecision has left many investors “chopped up,” as premature bets fail to materialize. With global economic uncertainties adding pressure, Ethereum’s next move hinges on whether bulls can decisively clear the $2,735 resistance or if bears will capitalize on a potential reversal. Until clarity emerges, the market remains a battleground of competing forces. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Momentum Builds – Analyst Has $3K In Sight For June Price Action Details: Key Levels To Clear Ethereum is trading at $2,690.46 on the 1-day chart, following a period of consolidation after a sharp decline. After finding support near $1,750 in April, ETH formed a tentative ascending triangle pattern, with recent price action testing key moving averages. The 50-day SMA ($2,310.51) and 100-day SMA ($2,077.91) have been breached upward, while the 200-day SMA ($2,657.01) remains a critical resistance, aligning with the current price zone. This move suggests short-term resilience, setting the stage for a potential test of the $2,750 resistance, a level retested four times since early 2025. A decisive daily close above $2,750, supported by rising volume, could pave the way for a push toward $3,000. The chart reveals rising lows since April, indicating accumulation and renewed buyer interest, particularly around the $2,500-$2,600 range. Increasing volume during recent upticks adds credibility to the breakout attempt, reducing the likelihood of a false move. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? If ETH holds above $2,500, the trend leans bullish. However, a rejection at $2,750 might drive the price back to the $2,250-$2,400 support zone. The market remains rangebound between $2,475 and $2,735, per analyst Daan’s insights, with a breakout likely to trigger a significant move. All eyes are on whether ETH can clear $2,750 to confirm upward momentum.

Ruvi AI , the blockchain-backed AI project, is predicted to deliver a staggering 13100% return on investment (ROI) . With its groundbreaking technology, structured presale approach, and real-world applications, Ruvi AI is attracting attention as the next big thing. But how does it stack up against Avalanche (AVAX), a leading blockchain network known for its speed, scalability, and intelligent technology? A 13100% ROI Prediction for Ruvi AI Market experts are bullish on Ruvi AI’s potential, with predictions of a $1 valuation post-listing . For context, Ruvi AI is currently in Phase 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at an affordable $0.015 per token . This means early investors are looking at an astonishing ROI of 13100% , assuming prices climb to the $1 mark after listing. Unlike speculative hype-driven tokens, Ruvi AI focuses on a structured presale model that builds confidence. After the presale concludes, the token price is set to rise to $0.07 , offering a predictable growth trajectory. To date, the project has raised over $1.6 million and sold more than 140 million tokens , solidifying investor trust. Such transparent scalability raises the question for AVAX holders and would-be investors alike: can Avalanche, which has already matured significantly in the market, deliver similar returns? The Avalanche (AVAX) Comparison Avalanche is renowned for its high-speed transaction capability , with its eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model and interoperability features. These characteristics have made it a favorite among developers seeking efficient decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and NFT platforms. However, as with most tokens in later growth periods, Avalanche’s returns are expected to be slower and steadier compared to newer projects like Ruvi AI. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is still in its growth phase , making it a high-reward option for early adopters. While both Avalanche and Ruvi AI offer technological innovation, Ruvi AI’s emphasis on solving industry-specific challenges gives it an edge in creating real-world demand. Driving Growth Through Real-World Applications Ruvi AI differentiates itself with its focus on practical solutions across crucial industries. Here’s why its technology matters: Healthcare By leveraging AI, Ruvi AI helps improve medical diagnostics, optimize patient management, and enhance the efficiency of healthcare operations. These efforts modernize the industry while reducing inefficiencies. Logistics Supply chain management is a global trillion-dollar sector ripe for improvement. Ruvi AI uses AI-driven tools to optimize operations, reduce delivery delays, and lower costs for businesses worldwide. Finance Ruvi AI transforms financial systems with blockchain-based transparency and advanced fraud detection. Its AI applications improve user security and foster trust in digital financial transactions. By focusing on industries with massive growth potential, Ruvi AI ensures long-term scalability, putting it on a solid trajectory to meet its ambitious ROI targets. VIP Investment Tiers Maximize Investor Gains One remarkable aspect of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP investment tier system , which rewards early participants with significant bonuses. Here’s a breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . Such transparent and rewarding systems demonstrate Ruvi AI’s commitment to its investors, making it easy for backers to calculate their potential returns. Can Ruvi AI Deliver Higher Returns Than Avalanche? While Avalanche undoubtedly remains one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain space, its maturity limits its short-term ROI compared to the explosive potential of early-stage projects like Ruvi AI. Ruvi AI’s transparent presale model, low entry price, strategic partnerships, and practical industry applications make it a serious contender for high-return investments. For those looking to replicate the success of early Avalanche or Solana investors, Ruvi AI represents a rare opportunity . With predictions of 13100% ROI and industries eager to adopt AI-driven blockchain solutions, the future for Ruvi AI looks highly promising.

His remarks follow widespread speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) may consider using the XRP Ledger as the underlying infrastructure for its proposed digital euro, though no official decision has been announced. In a statement shared on social media, Cardone asserted that XRP would align with oppressive regimes if necessary for survival. He also criticized ECB President Christine Lagarde, accusing her of wanting to impose stricter societal controls through central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives. Cardone further equated XRP to a financial “crisis,” likening its potential role in monetary policy to a second wave of COVID-19. According to him, continued support for XRP amounts to endorsing the political and financial agendas of central authorities in Europe. XRP will take any path they need to survive including coordinating with the most oppressive people on planet Earth, one of them pictured below, Ms Cringe, who will do whatever is needed to turn Europe into a Prison Continent, so there is martial law everywhere and they can scam… https://t.co/ZfXFhWQoiD — Gary Cardone (@GaryCardone) June 9, 2025 These comments have led to a new wave of debate within the crypto community. At the heart of the disagreement is the perceived contradiction between decentralization, a foundational principle of cryptocurrency, and cooperation with governments or centralized institutions. Some crypto proponents, including Cardone, argue that CBDCs are tools for surveillance and control, directly conflicting with crypto’s ethos of financial freedom and privacy. Crypto Community Pushes Back Cardone’s assertions were met with responses from members of the XRP community, many of whom described his comments as misleading and inaccurate. Crypto analyst Robert Doyle, also known as Crypto Sensei, emphasized that the ECB has not publicly disclosed which technology it will use if it proceeds with launching a digital euro. Doyle clarified that while Ripple has engaged in discussions with central banks around the world, including pilot projects in countries like Georgia and Palau, no formal agreement has been made with the ECB regarding XRPL. Adding to the rebuttal, prominent XRP advocate Moon Lambo responded to Cardone’s statements by accusing him of spreading misinformation. He pointed to the official ECB website, which currently states that no final decision has been made on either the implementation or the technical infrastructure of a potential digital euro. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Moon Lambo, Cardone’s perspective is shaped more by personal bias than by verified information. He criticized Cardone for undermining trust by promoting unconfirmed narratives as fact. Legal expert Bill Morgan also weighed in, questioning the logic behind the claim that XRPL, a decentralized and open-source blockchain, could serve the interests of oppressive governments. He argued that the very nature of XRPL contradicts the idea that it could be controlled or co-opted by central authorities. No Confirmation Yet on ECB’s Digital Euro Technology Although rumors about the ECB adopting XRPL continue to circulate online, there is no definitive proof to support these claims. The European Central Bank has confirmed that preparations for a digital euro are underway, but remains undecided on whether the currency will launch or what platform it will run on. The final decision will be influenced by various factors, including input from the European Parliament and member states. While some within the crypto space view potential partnerships between blockchain networks and central banks as a sign of mainstream validation, others remain concerned that such relationships could dilute the original purpose of decentralized finance. The controversy surrounding XRP’s rumored role in CBDC development highlights this ongoing ideological divide.

The findings point to a wider shift in how major institutions, small businesses, and investors view the future of money, one increasingly driven by stablecoins and digital assets. 81% of Crypto-Aware SMBs Want Stablecoins, $27.6T Moved in 2024 Alone The report , based on surveys of Fortune 500 executives and small and medium-sized business (SMB) decision-makers, indicates growing interest in blockchain adoption and stablecoin use. Coinbase says 2024 marked a turning point, with on-chain initiatives moving from experimental to strategic. “Nearly one in five Fortune 500 executives now consider on-chain initiatives a key part of their company’s strategy,” the report noted, a figure that reflects a 47% increase compared to the previous year. JUST IN: 60% of Fortune 500 companies are working on blockchain projects, Coinbase reports. — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 10, 2025 Stablecoins have emerged as the centerpiece of this shift. Over 81% of crypto-aware SMBs expressed interest in using stablecoins to address key financial pain points, such as high transaction fees and cross-border payment delays. Among Fortune 500 companies, interest in stablecoins has tripled since 2024. The momentum is being fueled by real-world usage. Coinbase reported that stablecoin transfer volumes hit all-time highs in the past year, with $719 billion moved in December 2024 and $717.1 billion in April 2025. Over the full year, stablecoins facilitated $27.6 trillion in transfer volume, surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined by over 7%. “The future of money is here, and stablecoins are powering that transformation,” the report stated, emphasizing their role in remittances, payroll, and financial inclusion. More than one-third of SMBs are already using crypto, and 46% of those who aren’t say they plan to start within the next three years. In total, 82% believe crypto can help solve at least one of their business’s financial challenges. Institutional interest is also climbing. Coinbase found that over 80% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto exposure this year. Globally, the number of stablecoin holders now exceeds 161 million, with stablecoin supply growing 54% year-over-year. Despite the enthusiasm, the report said that clear regulation is the final hurdle. Ninety percent of Fortune 500 executives surveyed said the U.S. needs consistent, nationwide crypto rules to unlock the full potential of blockchain innovation. “There’s an emerging patchwork of legislation,” Coinbase wrote, referencing efforts like the proposed GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight. “But it is past time for a regulatory unlock that will strengthen broader crypto adoption.” Coinbase collaborated with The Block Pro Research and third-party survey firms to produce the report, which also analyzed Web3 adoption trends among Fortune 100 companies from 2020 to 2025. As crypto adoption accelerates across the corporate and financial sectors, stablecoins appear to be leading the charge. Their rapid growth and integration into business processes point to what may be the early stages of a broader digital financial transformation. Small Businesses Embrace Crypto as Washington Moves Toward Regulatory Clarity While Fortune 500 giants lead the charge, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are quickly catching up in blockchain adoption. For many, the appeal lies in solving real financial pain points. Around 80% of crypto-using SMBs cite improved invoicing and accounts receivable processes as key benefits. Stablecoins are especially popular, offering faster payments and lower transaction costs. But like their larger counterparts, SMBs want clearer rules. Industry leaders say regulatory uncertainty still slows adoption, even as interest grows. Recent moves in Washington could change that. On May 19, the U.S. Senate advanced the bipartisan GENIUS Act , targeting stablecoin regulation, with a 66-32 vote . The Senate advanced the GENIUS Act with a 66-32 bipartisan vote on Monday, marking a big step toward establishing federal regulation for stablecoins and digital currency oversight. #GENIUSAct #Stablecoins https://t.co/JmoPuWjKdf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA), a bipartisan bill that would prevent blockchain developers from being classified as money transmitters. These developments, combined with indications from President Donald Trump in favor of pro-crypto policy, suggest momentum is building for a clearer U.S. regulatory framework, one that could unlock broader adoption not just for big tech but for every business in between.

Bitcoin could appear on 25% of S&P 500 balance sheets by 2030, according to analysts, while publicly-traded companies currently hold approximately 285,000 BTC worth $17.1 billion. This institutional embrace signals a broader acceptance of digital assets as legitimate treasury holdings. Against this backdrop of growing mainstream adoption, three distinct cryptocurrencies are capturing attention: Qubetics ($TICS), positioned as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, promises to unite leading blockchains in an unprecedented technological breakthrough. The cryptocurrency market is witnessing remarkable developments across multiple fronts, with established players like Cardano and Chainlink making significant strides alongside emerging projects. Cardano’s return to Binance US demonstrates crypto’s resilience despite regulatory challenges, while Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol recently enabled seamless transactions in a pilot involving Hong Kong’s digital dollar and an Australian stablecoin. These developments underscore the maturation of blockchain technology and its real-world applications. However, for those seeking the best crypto presale to join in June 2025, Qubetics presents a compelling opportunity with its innovative approach to blockchain integration and its final presale phase offering immediate value propositions. Revolutionary Web3 Integration: How Qubetics Transforms Blockchain Accessibility Qubetics stands apart from traditional blockchain projects by addressing the fundamental challenge of blockchain fragmentation. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics unites leading blockchains through its comprehensive ecosystem, making blockchain technology accessible to businesses and individuals who previously found it too complex or expensive to implement. The platform’s flagship application, QubeQode IDE, revolutionizes blockchain development by providing a visual development environment with drag-and-drop components. This innovative approach allows businesses to incorporate blockchain functionalities without requiring extensive technical expertise. Small restaurants can now create loyalty programs using smart contracts, while local healthcare providers can implement secure patient data systems through form-based configurations. The IDE’s code snippet library enables complex blockchain integrations that would traditionally require months of development time. Real estate agencies benefit tremendously from Qubetics’ capabilities, utilizing the platform to create transparent property transaction systems where buyers and sellers can track every step of the purchasing process. Educational institutions leverage the technology to issue tamper-proof digital certificates, while e-commerce businesses implement decentralized payment systems that reduce transaction fees and processing times. This best crypto presale to join in June 2025 offers practical solutions that extend far beyond theoretical blockchain applications, providing tangible value to diverse industries seeking digital transformation. The Best Crypto Presale to Join in June 2025 Enters Final Stage 37 The Qubetics presale has reached its final stage, presenting what many analysts consider the best crypto presale to join in June 2025 . Currently in Stage 37, the final phase offers $TICS tokens at $0.3370 each, with only 10 million tokens remaining at this fixed price. The presale has achieved remarkable success, raising over $17.9 million from more than 27,800 token holders, with over 515 million $TICS tokens already sold. Following a strategic tokenomics overhaul, Qubetics reduced its total supply from over 4 billion tokens to just 1.36 billion, creating immediate scarcity and enhancing long-term value potential. The protocol increased its public sale allocation to 38.55%, putting more tokens directly into community hands and establishing a decentralized, user-governed ecosystem. This Qubetics presale represents the final opportunity to acquire tokens before listing at $0.40, offering participants an instant 20% return on investment. The investment mathematics are compelling for early adopters. A $5,000 investment at the current price of $0.3370 would secure approximately 14,837 $TICS tokens. At the listing price of $0.40, this investment would immediately be worth $5,935, representing a $935 profit. However, analysts project more substantial returns as the project gains traction. If $TICS reaches $5 per token, the same $5,000 investment would grow to $74,185. Should the token achieve the projected $10 target, the investment would yield $148,370, representing a 2,867% return. This best crypto presale opportunity combines immediate listing gains with significant long-term growth potential, making it particularly attractive for participants seeking both short-term and extended investment horizons. Cardano’s Strategic Return: Market Positioning and Exchange Relationships Cardano’s return to Binance US marks a significant milestone, demonstrating the cryptocurrency’s resilience and strategic positioning despite ongoing regulatory challenges. This development represents more than a simple exchange listing; it signals restored confidence in ADA’s long-term viability and regulatory compliance standards. The return to one of America’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges enhances Cardano’s accessibility to retail participants and institutional buyers seeking exposure to proof-of-stake blockchain technology. The timing of Cardano’s Binance US return coincides with broader market recovery patterns and increased institutional interest in alternative blockchain platforms. ADA’s unique proof-of-stake consensus mechanism and academic research foundation continue to attract developers and enterprises seeking sustainable blockchain solutions. The exchange relationship restoration provides Cardano with enhanced liquidity and trading volume, potentially supporting price stability and growth momentum. Cardano’s ecosystem continues expanding through strategic partnerships and technical developments, with the platform’s focus on scientific methodology and peer-reviewed research maintaining its competitive edge. The project’s emphasis on sustainability and energy efficiency aligns with growing environmental concerns surrounding blockchain technology, positioning ADA as a responsible alternative to energy-intensive mining-based cryptocurrencies. Chainlink’s Cross-Border Innovation: Facilitating Global Financial Infrastructure Chainlink recently powered a groundbreaking cross-border CBDC-stablecoin pilot between Hong Kong and Australia, utilizing its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol to enable seamless transactions between Hong Kong’s digital dollar (e-HKD) and an Australian stablecoin. This pilot program, part of Phase 2 of the e-HKD+ Pilot Program initiated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, demonstrates Chainlink’s critical role in emerging financial infrastructure. The successful pilot involved major financial institutions and technology companies, including Visa, Fidelity, and China AMC, showcasing Chainlink’s ability to facilitate complex cross-border transactions between different digital currencies. LINK token trading volume surged 40% on major exchanges within 24 hours of the news, reflecting market confidence in Chainlink’s technological capabilities and strategic positioning in the evolving CBDC landscape. This development positions Chainlink as essential infrastructure for the future of digital finance, particularly as central banks worldwide explore CBDC implementations. The protocol’s ability to connect different blockchain networks and facilitate secure, reliable data exchange makes it indispensable for cross-border financial operations. Industry experts predict this pilot could accelerate CBDC adoption across Asia-Pacific markets, with Chainlink serving as the backbone for interoperability between different national digital currencies. Strategic Investment Analysis: Evaluating Long-Term Potential and Market Positioning The cryptocurrency market presents diverse investment opportunities, each with distinct risk-reward profiles and growth trajectories. Cardano’s return to major exchange platforms demonstrates resilience and regulatory compliance, while its proof-of-stake architecture and scientific approach provide solid fundamentals for long-term growth. The project’s focus on sustainability and academic rigor appeals to environmentally conscious participants and institutions seeking responsible blockchain alternatives. Chainlink’s oracle network continues proving its value through real-world applications, particularly in cross-border financial infrastructure and CBDC development. The protocol’s essential role in connecting blockchain networks with external data sources positions it as critical infrastructure for the expanding digital economy. Recent trading volume increases and institutional partnerships suggest growing recognition of Chainlink’s strategic importance. However, for participants seeking maximum growth potential, the best crypto presale to join in June 2025 remains Qubetics, offering immediate listing gains combined with revolutionary Web3 aggregation technology. The project’s approach to blockchain integration addresses real market needs while providing accessible tools for businesses and developers. With limited tokens remaining and strong presale performance, early adopters can join this best crypto presale before the opportunity closes permanently. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Frequently Asked Questions About the Best Crypto Presale to Join in June 2025 What makes Qubetics the best crypto presale opportunity in June 2025? Qubetics offers the best crypto presale to join in June 2025 due to its final stage pricing, immediate 20% listing gains, and revolutionary Web3 aggregation technology. The project addresses real blockchain accessibility challenges while providing substantial investment returns. How does Qubetics compare to established cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Chainlink? While Cardano focuses on proof-of-stake sustainability and Chainlink provides oracle services, Qubetics uniquely aggregates multiple blockchains into a single platform. This comprehensive approach offers broader utility and market appeal than single-purpose blockchain solutions. What are the investment risks associated with cryptocurrency presales? Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent volatility risks, regulatory uncertainties, and technology adoption challenges. However, Qubetics’ advanced development stage, strong presale performance, and practical applications reduce typical early-stage project risks significantly.

This new tool lets investors make money daily from their tokenized investments. Tokenized investments are digital versions of real investments, like bonds, government securities, or funds. With Intraday Yield, investors can now earn income every second instead of waiting until the end of the day. This gives them more chances to grow their money faster and smarter. Intraday Yield Redefines Investment Returns Intraday Yield is a new technology that rewards investors based on how long they hold their tokenized investment. Unlike traditional systems that pay out returns at the end of the day or month, Intraday Yield pays investors in real time, even if users hold the asset for an hour. The system calculates and sends the yield every second, including on weekends and holidays. This is possible thanks to the Benji Platform, which uses blockchain technology to keep things clear and correct. This new feature is useful for big investors like hedge funds and companies, as it is designed to let them move money fast and still earn from short-term investments. Franklin Templeton Fueling The Benji Platform Franklin Templeton shared that it has made the Benji technology platform even better by adding new features. This upgrade is set to make investing easier and more flexible. Now, investors can send digital tokens to each other using approved wallets on supported blockchains. This makes things safer and easier. They can also buy and sell tokens using stablecoins. Investors can now keep their Benji tokens in approved wallets. This gives them more control while keeping them safe and following the rules. Traditional Firms Lead with Blockchain Franklin Templeton started using blockchain in 2021. Since then, it has l aunched several blockchain-based funds in Singapore and Luxembourg. It also created a crypto index ETF and a tokenized U.S. money market fund on the Solana blockchain. As of April 2025, the company manages over $1.53 trillion and is leading the way in mixing blockchain with traditional finance. Franklin Templeton’s latest move is part of a bigger trend in the financial industry. Traditional firms increasingly adopt blockchain technology to modernize how assets are managed, traded, and settled. This shows that blockchain is no longer just for startups; it is becoming a big part of modern finance. Investment firms like BlackRock have also launched tokenized funds to meet growing investor demand and keep up with the fast-changing finance world.

The bank’s cryptocurrency division SG-FORGE disclosed today’s planned launch, noting that trading will start in July. According to SG-FORGE , the new stablecoin will be launched on Ethereum and Solana blockchain networks, while the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) will serve as custodian of its reserves. With this move, Societe-Generale becomes the first bank to issue a USD-pegged stablecoin, a sector dominated by crypto-native firms such as Tether and Circle. However, USDCV is the second stablecoin from SG-FORGE since it launched the Euro CoinVertible (EURCV) in 2023. The bank noted that SG-FORGE will now propose the stablecoins to its customers for currency conversions and enable 24/7 transactions in USD and Euros. It said: “USD CoinVertible and EUR CoinVertible are designed to support a wide range of client activities, including crypto trading and cross-border payments, on-chain settlement, foreign exchange transactions, and collateral and cash management.” Interestingly, the bank stated that its stablecoins would be available on crypto exchanges and to institutional investors. However, they are not available to US residents. The unavailability to US residents is interesting, given that the two stablecoins are compliant with the European Union (EU) Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) standards for Electronic Money Tokens (EMT). SG-FORGE is also licensed as an Electronic Money Institution (EMI). Despite not offering the USDCV in the US, the bank believes the product would still be seen in a stablecoin market dominated by USD-pegged tokens. SG-FORGE CEO Marc Stenger said: “After the release of a MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoin (EURCV), the launch of a US Dollar version (USDCV) was the obvious next step for Societe Generale–FORGE as market adoption of stablecoins is growing exponentially. The stablecoin market remains largely US Dollar denominated.” BNY Mellon also highlighted its role in providing infrastructure for the SG-FORGE stablecoins, noting its history and expertise with traditional and digital assets. SG-FORGE looks to stake claim in a saturated market Meanwhile, SG-FORGE launching a USD stablecoin means it is entering a sector where many firms have struggled to gain market share. Tether and Circle account for more than 80% of the total $250 billion stablecoin supply with their respective USDT and USDC tokens. While many other firms have also launched USD-pegged tokens, none have been able to wrestle market share from the two. Even Binance BUSD, which had over $20 billion in supply at its peak, has now faded into irrelevance due to regulatory action. Given the performance of the SG-FORGE Euro-pegged stablecoin, it is unlikely that its USDCV will gain much traction in the crowded market. EURVC was launched in 2023 and, according to Defillama, has only around $33 million in market cap with a $29 million circulating supply. However, the Euro-pegged stablecoin represents a small part of the sector, with Circle EURC having less than $200 million in circulating supply, even though USDC has more than $60 billion. Additionally, SG-Force has positioned its USDCV as a MiCA-compliant stablecoin for institutions and retail investors. This could help its adoption in the European market, even though it might still compete with Circle USDC. More Banks may issue their stablecoins While Societe-General might be the first bank to issue USD-pegged stablecoins, it is unlikely to be the last. According to reports, major US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, are considering issuing a joint stablecoin. Wall Street Journal , which published the report, noted that discussions are still in the early stages with the potential partners waiting for the outcome of the legislative efforts to regulate stablecoins. The GENIUS Act, which will regulate stablecoin, is set to face a vote in the Senate on June 11. Although the proposed legislation has over 100 amendments being debated, the Bill is expected to pass. Circle CRCL’s massive rally as it went public is evidence of positive sentiments around the stablecoin sector as the market awaits regulatory clarity. Interestingly, other financial institutions are also working on stablecoins. These include Deutsche Bank, Japanese banking giant SMBC, and asset manager Fidelity.

This comes after weeks of sluggish price action, with ADA still down 0.5% in the past week and 12.5% in the past month—suggesting that the market may have oversold the altcoin. However, today’s bounce could mark a key turning point, as ADA appears to have found its floor and is now gaining momentum for a stronger recovery phase. With Cardano’s robust fundamentals as a leading layer-one blockchain, the long-term Cardano price prediction is looking increasingly bullish. Cardano Price Prediction: Q3 Dip Could Be Final Buy Opportunity Before a 10x Surge As bad as things have been for Cardano, its one-day chart shows that it hit a bottom a few days ago, and that it appears to have begun a strong rebound. Of note is its relative strength index (purple), which bottomed at 30 late last week and has now risen to 50, a sign of increased buying pressure.

In other words, Cardano had reached the point where it was selling at such a discount that buyers began piling in again, and it still remains in an oversold position even now. In fact, it remains 77.5% below its ATH of $3.09, which it set back in September 2021. It therefore has lots of catching up to do, and with the wider market also waking up again after several months of stagnation, it could rise towards $1 by the end of July.

This signals Cardano’s difficulties in attracting a wider base of investors, with its platform still having a TVL of only $330 million . However, developers are planning a series of privacy and scalability updates for the platform over the course of the summer and autumn, collected under the ‘Midnight’ banner. JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""if Midnight is successful, it's the single biggest economic event in the history of Cardano."" pic.twitter.com/wJw0SKD2Kg — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) June 9, 2025 Assuming that Midnight facilitates the kind of adoption that some have predicted , it could be very positive for the Cardano price, which could hit $3 in Q4. Bigger Rallies May Come from Newer Altcoins If Cardano is a little too frustrating for some traders, they may prefer to diversify into newer altcoins, which in the right conditions can outpace the market. Picking the most promising new alts is tricky, however, but one way of gauging potential is to look for the most successful presales, since these can indicate momentum. And the coin with the biggest presale of the past few months is Solaxy (SOLX), a layer-two project that has now raised an incredible $46.4 million in its ICO. Solaxy is expanding faster than the universe! 46M Raised! pic.twitter.com/RM3lsZeMha — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 9, 2025 Its sale will end in only six days, so traders will have to hurry if they want to join the thousands of investors who’ve betted big on Solaxy’s future. And the reason why Solaxy has inspired so much faith is that it’s planning to launch a layer-two network for Solana, providing Solana users with lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. It will also provide instant bridging, its own DEX for trading, and also a launchpad, so that developers can launch their own tokens. Such features are all part of its plan to become a key part of the Solana ecosystem, with a particular focus on meme tokens and DeFi. As its native token, SOLX will be necessary to pay for its transaction fees, so demand for the token could be huge. Latecomers can join its sale at the Solaxy website , where the token is selling at its final presale price of $0.00175.

One analyst shared four reasons why DOGE could be poised to deliver strong gains in the next few days amid the confluence of multiple bullish signals. Trader KJThaLibra shared his thesis for DOGE on the TradingView website this week. To support his bullish Dogecoin price prediction, he first cited a bullish divergence in the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI). This means that, even though the price has made lower lows, this momentum oscillator has made a higher low. Moreover, the RSI has hit oversold and the price is about to tag its trend line resistance for a fourth time after coming out of this extremely bearish territory. Finally, the price action made a higher low, marking the potential end of the downtrend. These four reasons combined support a bullish DOGE price forecast with a preliminary price target of $0.40 for the meme coin. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE Could Hit $0.26 First After Bouncing Off Key Support Looking at the daily chart, the price hit a key support and bounced off the $0.168 level five days ago and has gone up in three out of the past five days. Now that the token has broken the $0.185 resistance, this level could act as support after a bullish move to the $0.21, which looks like the next plausible target for DOGE. Meanwhile, a bullish breakout could propel the meme coin to $0.26 first before aiming for KJThaLibra’s mid-term target of $0.40. Momentum indicators support a bullish Dogecoin price prediction as the RSI moved above the 14-day moving average while the MACD seems poised to cross above the signal line in the daily chart – also a buy signal. A golden cross between the 9-day and 21-day EMA could provide confirmation of the beginning of a short-term uptrend. In the context of an overall market recovery, this implies that DOGE could make a higher high soon and confirms this trader’s view. As meme coins make a strong comeback, the best crypto presales like SUBBD could deliver huge gains to early buyers who take advantage of the token’s discounted price. SUBBD Will Soon Launch Its Top-Notch Decentralized Content Distribution Platform SUBBD (SUBBD) is introducing a new content distribution platform that relies on the power of blockchain technology and decentralization to offer a better environment for creators. The project has already attracted more than 2,500 influencers with a combined following of more than 250 million fans who will contribute to making the platform attractive and popular in a short period. The $SUBBD token gives creators a say on the project’s roadmap, including how content is moderated. This will help avoid unfair bans and other restrictive policies that have affected creators’ income for years within centralized platforms. Meanwhile, fans will benefit from using $SUBBD to pay for platform fees in the form of subscription discounts, custom requests, and early access to features. To buy $SUBBD at its discounted presale price ahead of its exchange listings, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

Ethereum, Solana, and Chainlink are leading altcoins poised for significant growth. Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin are attracting retail interest but require cautious trading. The cryptocurrency markets are now at a major stage, with altcoins preparing for significant growth. As Bitcoin (BTC) nears its all-time high, altcoins are expected to experience increased volatility, with smaller pullbacks and larger upward movements. This movement follows the departure of many investors from their positions, potentially setting the stage for a strong altcoin rally.

SHIB HOLDERS HIT NEW ATH! 1,511,101 wallets now hold $SHIB — that’s 0.011% of global population. The army is growing. The mission is alive. pic.twitter.com/DNI9LhgpCt — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 9, 2025 An 11% gain over the past five days marks a strong rebound from the recent drop below $0.000012, reopening the meme coin’s case for the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Retail investors appear to be filling the gap left by a mass whale exodus. Whale transaction volume—trades over $100,000—has plunged 91.5% over the past four days, down to just 2 trillion SHIB. While engagement is growing, the shift from whales to retail holders exposes a vulnerability: SHIB is now largely in weaker hands, increasing the risk of short-term swings. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Can the Reversal Stick? The bounce from $0.000012 affirms the lower support of the wide consolidation channel that has kept SHIB range-bound between $0.00001 and $0.0000176 since February. SHIB / USDT 1-day chart, consolidation channel. Source: TradingView, Binance. This move sets the stage for a potential 35% climb to retest the range’s upper resistance. Momentum indicators support the upside case: the MACD line is nearing a golden cross above the signal line—a bear flag, and the formation that preceded the last retest of the channel high. That said, the RSI has stalled at 46 in bearish territory. While sell pressure is easing, bulls still lack the conviction to flip the daily chart bullish. Still, a higher low has formed, suggesting growing bullish pressure and the early structure of a trend reversal as accumulation rises to higher support levels. Traders should watch for a clean break above $0.000013—aligned with the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement—for confirmation of a fresh uptrend. Failure to break out could see SHIB return to retest the channel’s lower support near $0.00001. At such a pivotal position, $1 remains a distant target. There are Bigger Opportunity to Be Had than SHIB – Here’s How When it comes to large meme coins like SHIB, timing is everything. Those who entered late from the January market high may be left holding the bag as exit liquidity. Meanwhile, newer meme coins making the rounds like Moonpig are posting 7x gains in a single month. That’s where Snorter ($SNORT) steps in. Its purpose-built Telegram trading bot is engineered to spot early momentum, helping investors get in before the crowd— where the real gains are made. While trading bots are not a new concept, Snorter has been designed specifically for sniping with limit orders, MEV-resistant token swaps, copy trading, and even rug-pull protection. Other trading bots vs Snorter bot. The project is off to a strong start— $SNORT has already raised over $600,000 in its first two weeks of presale , likely driven by its high 483% APY on staking to rewards early investors.

The project recently borrowed $7.5 million in USDT from the Aave V3 platform. According to X account Onchain Lens, citing data from Nansen, the project deposited $52 million worth of Ether, wrapped Bitcoin, and Lido Staked Ether on the protocol before taking the loan. While it is unclear what the project plans to do with the borrowed funds, it has already moved it to a Bitgo wallet, leading to speculations that it is depositing the funds to withdraw USD1. USD1 is the stablecoin issued by WLF, and Bitgo is the custodian of the stablecoin. Meanwhile, the recent transactions mark WLF’s biggest DeFi move since it launched last year. While it previously deposited around 5 million USDC on Aave, it has mostly focused on buying tokens, including Ether, Bitcoin, and several altcoins, for its treasury . Nevertheless, WLF’s decision to use the Aave protocol is unsurprising, given that the project deployed an instance of Aave v3 as its DeFi platform in 2024. It has also acquired AAVE tokens for its treasury. Interestingly, WLF is not the only crypto project using Aave for DeFi transactions. A few weeks ago, the Ethereum Foundation borrowed $2 million worth of GHO stablecoins on Aave while depositing ETH to the platform. Aave TVL now above $40 billion (Source: Token Terminal) The increased activity on Aave has translated into milestones for the protocol in the past few days. It recently reached a new all-time high in total value locked (TVL) with $40 billion, while total borrows also reached a new peak above $16 billion. WLFI USD1 supplies $2 billion in market cap, but growth slowed Meanwhile, the recent transactions by WLF appear to be part of its efforts to boost the adoption of its USD1 stablecoin. The stablecoin, launched only a few weeks ago, is already one of the fastest-growing circulating supplies at around $2.18 billion, according to Defillama . The massive volume growth is due mostly to a $2 billion investment by sovereign wealth fund MGX into Binance, which was conducted using USD1. Beyond that massive surge, supply has grown much slower, with less than a $60 million increase over the last 30 days. However, the project has also been making efforts to boost adoption through various means, including the decision to airdrop around $4 million USD1 to holders of WLFI tokens. This is part of its broader one-month campaign to boost the adoption of the BNB Smart Chain. So far, BSC’s DeFi protocols, such as DWF Liquid Markets, Pancake Swap, ListaDAO, Venus Protocol, and Aster DEX, have all integrated the stablecoin into their platform, while exchanges such as MEXC are also offering 100% APR to stake USD1. Trump’s family involvement driving WLF performance Beyond its USD1 moves, WLF has also announced plans to acquire TRUMP memecoin for its treasury. The Trump Organization executive vice president, Eric Trump, announced the move, which WLF confirmed. Interestingly, the project is also planning to launch a wallet. Donald Trump Jr. disclosed this while debunking recent claims of a Trump crypto wallet by Magic Eden. According to Trump Jr., the Trump Organization does not authorize the wallet to be promoted by Magic Eden because WLF is working on an official wallet. With WLF dabbling in many crypto products and seeing sizable traction, many believe its success is only due to its affiliation with President Trump. Although Trump and his family are not directly involved in the operation of WLF, their influence as ambassadors appears to be the driving force behind it. Unsurprisingly, this has meant increased criticisms of the family crypto affiliations by political opponents and even some members of the crypto community who believe the president’s pro-crypto moves have significantly benefited his private interests.

The mid-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of about $8.24 billion, recorded a 400 percent surge in its daily average traded volume to about $1.16 billion at the time of this writing. As a result of the sudden UNI price surge today, around $3 million was liquidated from leveraged traders, with short traders consisting of over $2.4 million. Uniswap Benefits from DeFi Renaissance As Coinpedia reported at the beginning of this week, the DeFi altcoins will likely lead in anticipated altseason following regulatory clarity in the United States. During the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable on Monday, Chairman Paul Atkins highlighted that the agency is committed to issuing clear crypto regulations to enable seamless adoption of DeFi protocols in the near future. The announcement favored Uniswap, a top-tier DEX on the Ethereum (ETH) network. Furthermore, the U.S. SEC recently closed its investigation against Uniswap, following a settlement between the DEC and the CFTC. What Next for UNI Price? In the weekly timeframe, the UNI price has been consolidating since April 2024 after a successful bullish breakout from the 2022 bear market. In the past few weeks, the UNI price has successfully rebounded from the lower border of horizontal consolidation. Moreover, the weekly MACD line has crossed the signal line amid rising bullish histograms. In the four-hour timeframe, the UNI price successfully broke out of an inverse head and shoulders (H&S) pattern. With the four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) having surged above the 70 percent level, UNI price is well positioned to rally towards the next target range between $15.2 and $18.6.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|UNI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 21:55:07

Many still view SOL as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for 2025. Thanks to its high-speed blockchain, low fees, and expanding DeFi ecosystem, Solana consistently ranks among the top cryptocurrencies driving innovation. However, with market sentiment favoring early-stage opportunities, investors are also eyeing lesser-known but high-potential asset Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency priced under $1 that’s being billed by some as the next big crypto to explode. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 11,800 buyers are out there along with a total raise of $10.3 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is sold at launch for $0.06. As traders weigh what crypto to buy now, the battle between proven altcoins and up-and-coming tokens intensifies. Solana (SOL) Holds Firm at $151 Amid Bullish Momentum SOL is being traded at $151.33 today which is an increase of 0.027% over its previous price. Even though things have changed a bit, SOL’s strength in the market comes from its fast blockchain and more use seen in DeFi. If progress in the network and market is made some crypto enthusiasts think SOL could reach $400. Investors are also taking notice of newer altcoins including Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to their promising performance in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Strong Traction The Presale Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance is attracting investors since many believe in the strong model for the long term, different from the rapidly passing fads popular in meme coins. Due to its usefulness and expansion, Mutuum Finance is being noticed more in DeFi. So far, 11,800 people have invested over $10.3 million which makes Mutuum Finance worth watching in 2025. Anyone considering an early investment could check Phase 5 tokens which are being offered today for about $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Incentives Helpful new features and outstanding rewards are being given to the Mutuum Finance community. The top 50 MUTM holders are shown on the leaderboard and they are set to receive bonus tokens as a reward. 10 individuals from the project’s community also have a chance to win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as there is a $100,000 giveaway too. A New Generation of Decentralized Lending Platform The strength of Mutuum Finance comes from using several lending styles, making it easy for users to have more control. People involved in P2C lending place their stablecoins in pools supervised by smart contracts. Lenders and borrowers can agree on the terms which is not always possible with other lending platforms such as central banks. DeFi gives users autonomy over their financial decisions, as well as control over their money which match the key principles of DeFi. Even though many believe Solana (SOL) could be worth $1,000 by the end of 2025, excitement among crypto investors is shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The impressive fundraising, a supportive investor community and a special dual lending system have helped place Mutuum among the most discussed startups in the crypto field. At the moment, $0.03, investors can count on earning a 100% ROI when the token is launched. Take advantage of the opportunity and participate in the Mutuum Finance presale to be included in the newest DeFI developments.

In a recent analysis, a crypto market expert shared key insights on the best time to buy altcoins, offering strategic guidance for traders looking to position themselves ahead of the next potential market rally. When To Position For The Altcoin Season As the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory, the speculation about an impending altcoin season remains a recurring theme across crypto communities. However, a Bitcoin Dominance chart shared by ‘Stockmoney Lizards,’ a pseudonymous crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), challenges the narrative that an altcoin season is imminent. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Drawing on personal experience and market cycles, Stockmoney Lizards explains that the repeated cries of “altcoin season is here” are often premature and misleading. The analyst revealed that the true altcoin season, the period where even the lowest-quality coins tend to skyrocket, is often the final phase of the crypto bull run. It begins when Bitcoin Dominance breaks below the 60% support level, signaling a market-wide shift into altcoins. Notably, the analyst has shed light on how and when to position ahead of the altcoin season. Instead of buying altcoins based on hype or assumptions of immediate gains, Stockmoney Lizards suggests a more disciplined strategy: accumulate only at extreme oversold levels. This is typically when the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour or daily time frame drops below 25-30, reflecting capitulation. According to the market expert, these moments offer the best entry points for short-term rebounds, where altcoins deliver explosive moves of about 50% to 200%. The analyst further highlights that the primary objective is to take profits and rotate them back into Bitcoin. This approach not only maximizes gains but also minimizes exposure to prolonged drawdowns that usually follow the euphoric phase of the market cycle. Bitcoin Dominance Influence On AltSeason According to Stockmoney Lizards, the current behaviour of BTC.D, trading firmly between a well-defined channel, indicates that the market is still in the early to mid-phase of a bull run. Typically, this phase is dominated by Bitcoin, not altcoins, and history shows that institutional capital prefers to build positions in the flagship cryptocurrency before moving to riskier lower-cap assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price At $200,000 And Ethereum At $10,000? Analyst Says Altcoin Season Is Coming Notably, Bitcoin’s rising dominance in the market is not seen by the analyst as a bearish signal for altcoins in the long term. Instead, it is perceived as a healthy sign of a maturing bull market. He disclosed that the real altcoin season doesn’t begin until BTC.D decisively breaks down from its channel and drops to historical lows. Until then, Bitcoin’s strength reflects institutional accumulation and market confidence. Stockmoney Lizards reveals that retail investors often misinterpret this as a signal to chase altcoins, only to be caught holding bags as BTC continues to outperform. The analyst concludes that the altcoin season breakout will eventually come, but only those who position smartly by letting Bitcoin lead and waiting for alts to reach oversold extremes will be best prepared to capitalize on the market rally.

Despite BTC’s notable upward movement in the past few days, short-term investors are exhibiting a weakening sentiment toward the flagship asset. A Bearish Behavior From Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Given the renewed market uptrend, Bitcoin has regained a positive trend and surged back above key resistance levels like the $109,000 price level. During this period, Darkfost, an on-chain expert and verified author, outlined a waning activity from short-term BTC holders or retail investors. According to the on-chain expert, it appears that the most recent BTC drop, in which the flagship asset fell below the $80,000 mark, severely unsettled short-term holders. This worrying behavior among these investors is observed in a shift in the STH Net Position Change metric into negative territory. The shift in STH’s net position into a bearish zone reflects an increasing wave of selling pressure from younger investors, in contrast to the tenacity of the long-term holder cohort. Short-term holders’ activity often influences BTC’s performance in the near term; this significant move might portend trouble ahead for the digital asset. Darkfost revealed in the X post that the net position change among short-term holders has sustained a bearish trend over the past month. Looking at the chart, this trend has been in negative territory even though Bitcoin’s price has remained strong above the $100,000 mark. Data from the author shows that the metric is drawing closer to levels comparable to those observed during the previous correction after a total of -833,000 BTC were shifted. Since the change, it seems short-term holders have become considerably more sensitive to changes in the market. As for the recent drop in BTC’s price around the $100,000 level , Darkfost stated it was sufficient to cause fresh anxiety among this group of investors. Considering the trend, the expert claims it is imperative to keep a tight eye on these holders’ behavior in the near future to gauge BTC’s potential next trajectory. Fading Retail Holders Buying Pressure Bitcoin may have rallied strongly, but short-term holders have been responding negatively to the uptrend with a persistent sell-off. On-chain analyst Boris revealed that while these investors offload their coins, long-term holders or seasoned investors are accumulating, indicating a potential inflection in Bitcoin’s structure. For 30 days, retail addresses have viewed BTC’s renewed price increase as a chance to sell. Within the 30 days of consistent distribution by this group, one day in particular stands out the most with over 592,000 BTC in net outflows. Such actions convey a general anticipation of lower price movement as well as pessimism toward the surge. Given that short-term holders are selling and long-term holders are buying, this implies that the ongoing rally is not just speculative, but structurally supported by strong hands.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Boris|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTC STH Net Position Change Metric|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|Long-Term Bitcoin Holders|Short-term Bitcoin Holders,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-10 22:00:41

In a new press release, the DOJ says the international crime ring operated by misleading victims to invest in false digital asset scams. The DOJ says Joseph Wong, Yicheng Zhang, Jose Somarriba, Shengsheng He and Jingliang Su were part of an international criminal network that tricked American victims into believing they were investing in digital assets, but instead funneled money through US shell companies, international bank accounts and crypto wallets. Through texts, phone calls, social media and dating apps, the perpetrators contacted victims and gained their trust. They would then convince victims to invest in fraudulent crypto projects, telling the victims all the while that their investments were increasing in value. Instead of investing their capital, however, the men transferred $36.9 million in victim funds to a single account at Deltec Bank in the Bahamas under the name of “Axis Digital Limited.” The funds were then funneled to USDT wallets controlled by individuals in Cambodia. Aside from the five men pleading guilty, eight other co-conspirators have also confessed, so far.

The stablecoin is expected to begin trading in early July. SG-FORGE’s USD CoinVertible The development marks the firm’s latest push to merge traditional finance with decentralized infrastructure. The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will serve as the reserve custodian, according to the official press release . This new product follows the April 2023 launch of the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), SG-FORGE’s euro-backed stablecoin. Together, the two tokens aim to offer 24/7 fiat-to-stablecoin conversion, with support for use cases such as crypto trading, cross-border payments, on-chain settlement, foreign exchange, and collateral management. SG-FORGE stated that the tokens are built with compliance at their core – both are classified as Electronic-Money Tokens (EMTs) under the European Union’s MiCA regulatory framework. The firm itself is licensed as an Electronic Money Institution by France’s ACPR. USDCV and EURCV will be available to institutional, corporate, and retail clients through exchanges, brokers, and payment platforms, with liquidity supplied by multiple market makers. However, people in the United States will not be able to use these products. USD Stablecoin Launch “Obvious Next Step” By roping in BNY Mellon, which happens to be a major player in global custody services, SG-FORGE aims to reassure market participants about asset backing and transparency, while also appealing to institutions seeking regulatory clarity in the space. Commenting on the development, Jean-Marc Stenger, Chief Executive Officer of SG-FORGE, said that the launch of a US Dollar version (USDCV) was the “obvious next step” for the company after the release of a MiCA-compliant EUR stablecoin (EURCV), amidst an increasing market adoption of stablecoins. The exec went on to add, “The stablecoin market remains largely US dollar-denominated. This new currency will enable our clients, either institutions, corporates, or retail investors, to leverage the benefits of an institutional-grade stablecoin.” The post Societe Generale’s Crypto Arm Unveils USD-Pegged Stablecoin on Ethereum and Solana appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|European Union|MiCA|Stablecoins,EN,0,0,ETH|FIAT|MARKET|SOL|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-10 22:05:07
