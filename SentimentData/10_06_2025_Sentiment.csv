Bitcoin pulled back nearly 4 percent within hours, dragging other assets lower. Yet by Thursday, a rebound in stablecoin liquidity began stabilizing markets, sparking renewed interest in top cryptos for massive growth. The improved volume in major pairs highlighted shifting sentiment toward selective buying rather than blanket selling. In this market, Qubetics gained particular attention because of its soaring presale. At the same time, Aave triggered the launch of its Umbrella security protocol, which introduced an auto‑deficit coverage mechanism and boosted staking yields, particularly for stablecoins, enhancing appeal among top cryptos for massive growth. This led to a 6 percent uptick in AAVE’s daily trading price, signaling renewed confidence in its underlying DeFi utility. Cardano also retained a key support level between $0.58 and $0.61 aligned with its 0.786 Fibonacci retracement. Analysts spotlighted Cardano among the top cryptos for massive growth as stability returned to its chart pattern. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is garnering community momentum in its 37th presale stage. Qubetics: Decentralized VPN Brings Real‑World Utility Amid Presale Surge Qubetics ($TICS) aims to solve VPN Centralization issues by delivering a decentralized network with privacy, reliability, and superior speeds. With the 37th presale stage underway, only 10 million $TICS tokens remain at $0.3370. That scarcity, combined with a slashed total supply of 1.36 billion and a 38.55 percent public allocation, positions it uniquely among top cryptos for massive growth. The Qubetics presale has entered its 37th stage. Over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 27,700 holders, raising upwards of $17.8 million so far. During this stage, $TICS tokens are available for purchase at $0.3370. Analysts project potential prices of $10–15 after the mainnet launch. Early crypto presale participants might enjoy a 20 percent return from a $0.40 listing price. A hypothetical $ 15,000 allocation today could yield significant ROI if analyst forecasts materialize. The decentralized VPN offers advantages for businesses, professionals, and consumers: Privacy Maintenance: Elimination of centralized logs safeguards user data. Professional Accessibility: Secure remote access for distributed workforces. Enterprise Resilience: Redundant node connectivity reduces service disruptions. Consumer Ease: Streamlined, user‑managed encryption in a no‑log system. Qubetics positions itself to fill gaps left by traditional VPN providers. It promises an ecosystem where community governance and scarcity amplify value. It’s an emerging standout among top cryptos for massive growth. Investment Scenario: Calculated Entry with High-Return Potential Qubetics offers a compelling investment narrative for strategic crypto buyers: Stage 37 Entry (Price: $0.3370) If a buyer commits $1,000, they receive approximately 2,966 TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this translates to a 20% instant paper profit of $1,186. Mid-Term Projection Should Qubetics reach the projected mid-range valuation of $5 per token, that same $1,000 investment could grow to $14,830, marking a 1,383% return. Long-Term Upside If Qubetics meets bullish projections of $10–$15, the same tokens could be worth between $29,660 and $44,490, yielding a potential ROI of up to 4,349%. Such upside potential and growing demand for decentralized privacy infrastructure make Qubetics stand out among 2025’s emerging crypto opportunities. Aave (AAVE): Umbrella Protocol Elevates DeFi Confidence Aave strengthened its position in decentralized finance with the deployment of the Umbrella security layer. Integrating auto‑deficit coverage and a revamped staking interface, the feature allocates staked aTokens and GHO toward protocol deficits—shielding stakeholders from systemic risk. Asset TVL reached $36.8 million, with ETH comprising $17.5 million. USDC and USDT yielded 11.0 percent and 10.9 percent respectively, while ETH/WETH earned 6.05 percent, and GHO returned 5.47 percent. AAVE’s price climbed 1.99 percent to $258.14, with a market cap of $3.91 billion. Although trading volume dipped 54 percent to $215.8 million, the narrative around improved security and yield layers positions Aave among top cryptos for massive growth. The protocol’s innovation enhances confidence among liquidity providers and supports long‑term DeFi adoption. As decentralized finance continues expanding into traditional finance models, Aave’s Umbrella rollout could serve as a template for risk‑aware yield strategies. An improved UI with live metrics—total value locked, yield breakdown by asset, and staking utility—enhances transparency. These attributes reinforce Aave’s standing as a mature protocol among top cryptos for massive growth and contribute to its ongoing institutional appeal. Cardano (ADA): Fibonacci Bounce Sets Sights on Recovery Path Cardano has consolidated just above the critical $0.58–$0.61 support zone, precisely aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement—a technical indicator often marking strong reversal points. With current trading at $0.6759, 24‑hour volume near $481 million, and market cap at $23.89 billion, ADA appears strategically positioned among top cryptos for massive growth. Recent technical analysis signals a potential breakout, targeting $1.0463 as the initial resistance level. Extended targets at $1.2145 and $1.3984 lie along Fibonacci extension zones. Continuation depends on staying above the defined support; a breakdown below $0.58 could invalidate the pattern, shifting sentiment bearish. Cardano’s ecosystem continues to expand through interoperability initiatives, academic research collaborations, and regulatory‑compliant smart contract deployment. Benchmarking against top cryptos for massive growth, ADA offers a risk‑aware yet innovation‑centric platform. Its stability around Fibonacci levels combined with real utility in DeFi, NFTs, and governance positions it as a balanced play amid turbulent conditions. Conclusion: Timing, Terrain, and Tactical Edge These three protocols represent distinctive investment profiles under the banner of top cryptos for massive growth . Qubetics capitalizes on unmet needs in online privacy. Aave solidifies its position as a next‑generation DeFi platform with built‑in safeguards. Cardano blends long‑term platform development with short‑term technical breakout potential. Given the current volatility in the crypto world, those seeking exposure to emerging and mainstream trails can monitor Qubetics’ closing presale window, track Aave’s staking yields and usage metrics, and observe Cardano’s momentum around Fibonacci triggers.

The flagship coin rallied over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to reach a local high of about $110,260, less than 2 percent from its all-time high, on Monday, June 9 during the late North American session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), followed in tandem. As a result, the total crypto Open Interest (OI) surged over 6 percent to hover about $154.8 billion at the time of this writing. Additionally, more than $403 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, led by Bitcoin’s $197 million. Major Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Rally Today Favorable Regulatory Environment As Coinpedia reported , the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Atkins, has reiterated the importance of self-custody of crypto assets and clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi protocols. The favoring regulatory frameworks in the United States will have a ripple effect in other countries, thus enabling further crypto adoption by institutional investors. High Demand from Institutional Investors The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline in the past few years, catalyzed by the high demand from institutional investors. Strategy Inc . has led dozens of companies in implementing a Bitcoin treasury management plan. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to relentlessly accumulate, thus recording the fastest ETF growth to $70 billion in modern history. Macroeconomic Outlook BTC price has continued to grow in the recent past in tandem with the rising global liquidity.

Lee won the election with a comfortable margin earlier this month. He has since begun assembling his cabinet after making a series of pro-business crypto and stablecoin -related manifesto pledges. Kim Nam-guk: Key Ally to Take up Gov’t Position TV Chosun reported that Kim, a long-time Lee ally, is the nominee for the post of Presidential Secretary for Digital Communication. The South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-guk speaking outside a courthouse earlier this year. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) However, Kim will first have to overcome a sizable legal hurdle, as the Coin Gate controversy rumbles on. Prosecutors originally hoped to try Kim on suspicion of insider trading. The lawmaker was believed to have sold cryptoassets while serving on a National Assembly committee that dealt with crypto-related policy. However, the prosecution later decided to charge Kim with “obstructing officials in the course of their duties.” Prosecutors wanted Kim to serve a six-month jail term if found guilty. A Korean court has indefinitely postponed President Lee Jae-myung’s retrial on election law violation charges, citing the constitutional immunity granted to a sitting president. https://t.co/77zc8O6I1Y — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 9, 2025 Legal Challenges Remain Officials alleged that Kim had made “false declarations” about his cryptoassets to the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee when submitting mandatory disclosure documents. Kim was found not guilty of the charges at a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court in early February this year . The District Court judge, Justice Jeong Woo-yong, said at the time that the prosecution’s case featured “no evidence” that Kim had committed a crime. But the Prosecution Service thinks it has a strong enough case to try again. The case will be heard at the Southern District Court’s Appellate Division next month. The first hearing will take place on July 17. Kim Returning to Court in July Prosecutors continue to insist that Kim failed to correctly declare approximately 9.9 billion won ($7.3 million) worth of crypto in the period 2021-2022. With the ruling Democratic Party of Korea set to push for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act to postpone any criminal trials involving sitting presidents until they leave office, President Lee Jae-myung will likely be unaffected during his term by the ongoing criminal… — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 9, 2025 However, Kim and his legal team argued that, while declaration laws have since changed (largely as a result of the Coin Gate controversy), at the time, he did nothing wrong. Kim briefly left the Democratic Party shortly after the scandal broke. But he returned to the party under Lee’s leadership. Multiple domestic media outlets, including Hankook Ilbo , have reported that Kim is part of a core seven-member group of Democratic Party allies. The group has “supported the President since 2017,” the newspaper wrote. Their association dates back to the time when Lee made his first bid for the South Korean presidency.

Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH’s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground — if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum’s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row — a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH “still looks pre-tower top,” suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400–$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum’s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle — a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages — including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700–$2,800 region.

The New Data Is Shocking,https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-volatility-decade-low-price-rally/,"Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dropped to its lowest level since 2015, near the 10th percentile. BTC formed an ascending channel pattern, suggesting bullish continuation with a 46% upside potential. The 50-week EMA at $85,136 acts as dynamic support, maintaining the long-term bullish structure. Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to its lowest level in nearly a decade, a sign of a major structural shift in the market’s behavior. According to new data visualized by Ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility sits near the 10th percentile, meaning current market fluctuations are calmer than 90% of all weekly periods since 2015, suggesting Bitcoin is maturing into a more stable asset even as it continues its strong upward trend. This dramatic decline in volatility, which comes despite a sharp rally in May and the asset reaching new all-time highs, marks a significant change in Bitcoin’s risk profile and could make it far more attractive to a new class of institutional investors.

Despite this, the pace of investments appears to be slowing, as investors grow cautious and await clearer guidance from the US Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the broader direction of monetary policy. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin recorded $56.5 million in outflows for a second week, reflecting investor caution amid policy uncertainty. Short-Bitcoin products similarly saw $4.1 million in outflows, which represented their second consecutive week of declining interest. Ethereum continued to lead digital asset investments this week with $296.4 million in inflows, marking its seventh consecutive positive week and totaling $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 10.5% of total assets under management. This is the strongest streak of inflows since the US election in November, which indicated growing optimism among investors. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $6.6 million in outflows for the third week running. Altcoins remained mostly flat during the same period, with the exception of Sui and Chainlink, which brought in modest inflows of $1.1 million and $0.2 million. Meanwhile, XRP faced outflows of $4 million, while Solana and Cardano saw $2.1 million and $0.4 million in outflows, respectively. The United States topped weekly inflows with $175 million over the past week, while Germany followed with $47.8 million. Switzerland, Canada, and Australia contributed $15.7 million, $9.8 million, and $6.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Brazil recorded $9.2 million in outflows. Hong Kong saw $14.6 million withdrawn, ending its recent inflow surge. Sweden also reported weekly outflows totaling $7.7 million.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 548,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is attempting to move into a “price discovery uptrend.” Price discovery often refers to a process when the price of an asset moves to uncharted territory, forcing buyers and sellers to seek agreement on value. Says Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap: Bitcoin is currently in a transitional phase. Price is trying to successfully post-breakout retest its ReAccumulation Range to transition into Price Discovery Uptrend 2. A volatile retest/deviation here could occur.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital says that BTC closing above $104,400 on the week could be the key signal that it has successfully retested the demand zone and is gearing up for higher prices. “The retest continues to be successful. Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” Zooming in on the daily chart, the trader says that BTC needs to close above its immediate resistance and flip it into support to fully confirm a bullish continuation of the trend. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support… Daily Closing & retesting ~$106,600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,528.

The price jump also triggered a wave of short liquidations as the rally gained momentum. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently traded at around $110,286 , marking a 3.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now up nearly 5% over the last seven days, rebounding from a dip below $101,000 on June 5—a pullback that capped a broader decline dating back to late May. With BTC now nearing its all-time high of $111,814 set in May, market watchers are taking note. “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. “If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” Other major altcoins also rose. Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market cap, gained 4.5% to more than $2,679, and Solana (SOL) added more than 3% to hover close to $160. Even meme coins, which have struggled in recent weeks, showed signs of recovery. Dogecoin jumped 4.5%, and Shiba Inu added 2.5%. Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb The market’s uplift coincides with renewed talks between Washington and Beijing over longstanding trade tariffs—discussions that have soothed broader investor nerves. Investors seem optimistic about the potential for resolving trade disputes between the US and one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, will lead their respective delegations in negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Equities responded modestly, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edging slightly on the day. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price surge is increased crypto-related IPOs . Last week, stablecoin giant Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange and saw its shares pop over 168%, jumping from $31 to $69 within the first day of trading. Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, also filed for an IPO According to David Siemer, CEO of crypto asset management company Wave Digital Assets, while the IPO bump is likely short-term excitement, the long-term institutional positioning leads us to be bullish about Bitcoin’s continued performance in 2025. Bitcoin shorts crushed as $323M liquidated in a day In the past 24 hours, close to $323 million of crypto short positions have been liquidated, CoinGlass data shows. Most of the damage was in Bitcoin, which saw around $196 million worth of liquidations. The liquidations come amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and renewed trade tensions, which have rattled investor confidence. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows in five of the last seven trading sessions, reflecting the cautious sentiment. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed a streak of positive momentum, notching 15 consecutive days of inflows. 10X Research wrote in a report released Monday morning that Bitcoin is testing a breakout level, and the market setup appears significantly different from what most investors anticipated just weeks ago. According to the report, negative funding rates, a pattern of market bottoms, and a surprising surge in spot demand combine to create a high-conviction signal.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $323 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, rebounded from the lower border of a consolidation level of around $2,480. As a result, the ETH price has been retesting a crucial local resistance level around $2,681, whereby the Ether price was rejected four times in the past four weeks. Major Reasons Ethereum Price Will Rally Higher This Week Strong Institutional Adoption and ETF Flows According to market data analysis from CoinShares, Ethereum’s investment product dominated last week’s cash inflow with about $296 million. Notably, Ether’s investment product outpaced Bitcoin’s, which recorded a net cash outflow of about $56.5 million last week. As Coinpedia had reported , BlackRock’s ETHA has recorded significant cash inflows in the past two weeks, suggesting a strong demand from institutional clients. Altseason Sentiment Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards a new local high this week fueled by the rising narrative of altseason 2025. With Bitcoin dominance signaling an imminent market reversal, more crypto investors are betting on a major altcoin rally in the near future. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC pair is heavily oversold in the weekly timeframe, amid the recent market reversal. Regulatory Clarity Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Chair Paul Atkins highlighted that American crypto investors have the right to self-custody of crypto assets. Additionally, Chair Atkins highlighted that a new and clear set of DeFi regulations are needed to foster the development of the nascent blockchain technology. With Ethereum harboring the largest DeFi space, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $124 billion, the altcoin is well positioned to rally further in the near future.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 00:28:46

In the 30-second ad shared by Politico , a narrator warns that Democrats Zohran Mamdani, Scott Stringer and Brad Lander would make life costlier by blocking short-term rentals. The ad shows a New York Post headline about Mamdani’s proposed tax increase, alongside a message that these candidates reject “common-sense solutions” to lower living costs. It began airing on Monday across streaming, digital, and social platforms. The ad was made by a group called Affordable New York, which supports Andrew Cuomo. By showing what his rivals believe, the ad makes Cuomo look like a moderate choice. The Hotel and Gaming Trades Council has backed Cuomo, and their super PAC will put $1 million into his mayoral campaign. An Airbnb spokesperson said the group could invest another $1 million before the June 24 Democratic primary. But Bhav Tibrewal, the political director for the hotel union, criticized the move. He noted that Cuomo had clashed with unregulated rentals as governor and vowed to protect tenants and workers if elected mayor. Airbnb pushes for single-family rental exemptions amid union opposition Airbnb has urged the City Council to exempt one- and two-family homes from strict short-term rental rules, a proposal the hotel union strongly opposes. Under state law, renting a home for fewer than 30 days when the host is away is illegal. Since 2022, the city has required hosts to register, which has cut many unlawful listings. Last November, Council Member Farah Louis, backed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, introduced a bill to allow Airbnb in one- and two-family houses. After talks with the hotel union and amid “significant legal concerns,” the council quietly removed key sections of the measure in February, Louis said. Those changes halted the most controversial parts of the plan. Adams, who is also running for mayor, has not been targeted by Airbnb’s ads. The company appears to focus its criticism on candidates openly opposing its proposed exemptions for small homeowners. Stringer, who once managed the city’s finances and has often criticized Airbnb, also doesn’t want the short-term rental rules relaxed. All three say that letting Airbnb grow would make housing harder to find and push rents up. “Affordable New York was set up to back everyday New Yorkers who depend on short-term hosting for income,” said super PAC spokesperson Michael Blaustein. “These candidates keep spreading a misleading story that hosts are causing the housing crisis, despite data showing otherwise. Their rhetoric shields special interests instead of helping New Yorkers.” Lander’s campaign spokesperson, Dora Pekec, added, “While Andrew Cuomo is funded by huge corporations trying to buy their way into City Hall, Brad Lander is a man of the people and can’t be bought.” In his own statement, Stringer noted, “This isn’t the first time Airbnb has spent money to defeat me in my fight for affordable housing. I hope they used my good side in their picture.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 00:46:00

Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continues to gain traction as one of the top cryptocurrencies, fueled by surging DeFi adoption and strong developer activity. But what’s catching fire with retail traders is a new cryptocurrency priced at just $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , quickly earning a reputation as the next big crypto thanks to its low market cap, fast-growing community, and projected 50x upside. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,700 investors. More than $10.2 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. For those asking what crypto to invest in, the current momentum signals it’s time to pay close attention. XRP Consolidates While Solana Eyes New Highs Amid Market Optimism XRP is currently valued at about $2.13 as it continues to show signs of consolidation for around six months. Various analysts forecast that the stable trend of XRP around $2.00 may lead to a major breakout if XRP shatters the key $2.50 resistance level. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is currently at $146.39 and seems to be rising. Some technical indicators predict a potentially strong upward movement for XRP in the range of $180–$195 this year and there are forecasts that it may rise over $400 by the end of 2025, as more users and upgrades appear. Although XRP and SOL are attractive to investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also being noticed for the potential rewards it could generate in the quickly developing crypto market. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $10.2 million and accumulated 11,700 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik-Audited With Upcoming Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a $100,000 giveaway distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. XRP holds firm, SOL shows strength, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the one catching fire. Priced at just $0.03 with a 100% ROI expected at launch and over $10.2M raised, MUTM is a top altcoin to watch now.

Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements in a manner that’s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. “Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,” notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. “Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,” explains the analytics firm. “A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration.” Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?

That left it scrambling to prevent the loss of $223 million of its investors’ funds. Unfortunately, the team’s best efforts couldn’t stop the attacker from making away with $60M of those funds. Consequently, the DEX paused its operations momentarily to audit the incident, Fast forward to 6th June, and the firm teased about relaunching its activities two days later, boldly proclaiming, “This isn’t just about recovery or bouncing back — it’s about resilience, rebuilding, and an unwavering long-term commitment to the entire Sui ecosystem. “ This announcement tore the Cetus community right through the middle, indicating that it would take plenty of effort and goodwill from all the parties to stitch it together. While the decision to relaunch its CLMM pools service is commendable, the DEX has a long way to go in regaining its users’ trust Cetus mounts full-scale recovery after $162M attack Throughout the May 22nd debacle, the Cetus team pulled all stops to contain the situation. Together with its Sui blockchain counterparts, it managed to pause the transfer of $162M of the stolen funds. It then initiated moves to protect itself from further attacks, including identifying and patching the vulnerability that exposed it to hackers. It also rallied its community to work with Sui validators to free the assets they had quarantined after the attack. At the same time, it secured a $30M line of credit from the latter’s foundation to boost its recovery. Next, it resets all the affected pool data to its original settings while aligning it with prevailing market conditions. Additionally, it rebalanced its assets in preparation for pool refills and drew up a compensation contract for the affected. These efforts and many pledges of future enhancements did little to erase the mistrust some held on the DEX’s restart. Investors continue to express misgivings about Cetus’s relaunch Even as Cetus embarks on the audacious relaunch, it can’t play deaf to the concerns part of its community holds regarding the exercise. One such fear is that the token may turn inflationary, as some of its members suggested. Lady Cardano, for instance, was skeptical about the relaunch, suggesting that the DEX would inject 76 million new $CETUS tokens (a 5% supply increase) into circulation. The member concluded that the recipients could sell their allocations, potentially reducing the token’s value. Many members also complained that they’d lost significant portions of their investments. For example, Nikolai (@Nikolai7035) decried losing 30% of his position and swore never to return to that dump (Cetus again). His counterpart Stas (@staasbtc) reiterated this point, asking the protocol if it was using them to cover for the 30% of the liquidity lost in the hacking. It didn’t help that others could not access liquidity pools or remove their funds. If true, this latest failure indicates that technical or organizational hurdles continue to plague trust in the weapon system’s performance. As resentment over Cetus’s slow recovery of full service mounted, some investors like Wesley_ (Redwhite2626) began to call the project a scam . Reservations of such a kind reveal a lack of trust and resentment toward the team and their project. How can Cetus regain its users’s trust? If Cetus had imagined having a smooth restart after the hack, then it had another thing coming. That’s because winning over a community plagued with discontentment and mistrust is exacting. It will require more than PR stunts to pacify people who strongly feel the exchange let them down by failing to provide their investments with the protections they trusted it with. So, with time, tact, and sustained effort the protocol may still cultivate its community’s trust to the pre-hack day levels. However, it must be forthright with its users to achieve that feat. That entails coming clean on the claims that its issuance of 70M+ $CETUS tokens will erode the crypto asset’s value. It should enlighten its users on why making such a huge allocation was necessary and commit to buybacks and token burns to prop up the asset’s value. Secondly, the team should move fast to quell its users’ other concerns: they might have lost some of their funds forever. That calls for a full and timely restoration of the protocol to its pre-hack state, including a full restitution of investor positions and liquidity pools. This move will bolster users’ confidence in the project’s recovery efforts/sustainability. Again, the DEX should double down on allaying its investors’ qualms about its long-term security. Some quarters have questioned the robustness of its systems’ overhaul, given the pace of its relaunch. In this instance, a public and detailed update of the process will go a long way in easing those uncertainties. Add to the platform’s improved operability post-restart, and it’ll inspire more confidence in its offerings. Cetus’s resurgence is about more than just recovering lost funds or lost market share; it is about demonstrating that DeFi can move past its pain points. If it can use the disaster of recent weeks as a spark for reform, it may actually end up stronger, providing, over time, a more secure and stable foundation for the future. Yet, for that to occur, it will need to move beyond this moment of crisis and make security, transparency, and user trust paramount above all else. The DeFi community is watching and waiting for now but knows the next chapter is up to them to write.

The vote, which needs backing from 60 senators , paves the way for the bipartisan legislation to be passed quickly in the coming days. This came after revisions last month that attracted the support of crypto-friendly Democratic senators like Angela Alsobrooks and Mark Warner. John Thune focuses on adding competition in credit card processing with the bill The stablecoin bill is crucial as it would create rules for dollar-pegged tokens used to make payments. It is worth noting that the stablecoins must be backed by reserves kept in short-term investments, such as those overseen by federal debt or state regulators. As the Senate gets ready to vote on a stablecoin bill with support from Trump, debates have been sparked concerning the bill. Progressive Democrats have voiced concerns that the bill lacks safeguards to prevent stablecoins from endangering the financial system or being exploited by criminals. They also argue it overlooks the issue of Donald Trump profiting from his own cryptocurrency ventures. However, Thune’s move to cut off debate on the bill virtually aims that the legislation will contain language pressed by retailers and their allies in the Senate to force competition into Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. in credit card processing. To support this claim, the proposal, backed by Republican Senator Roger Marshall and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, would require major banks to let merchants choose from multiple credit card networks. This includes alternatives to Visa and Mastercard. The aim is to boost competition and reduce transaction fees for merchants. On the other hand, Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott has indicated that his committee might look at the credit card rules as separate legislation instead of including them in the stablecoin bill. This did not stop Marshall from focusing on achieving his goal. On Monday, June 9, Marshall mentioned that he was planning his next move and wanted to schedule a vote on the legislation sometime soon. A Senate aide said late Monday that talks are continuing on the bill and that senators could still offer floor amendments. The stablecoin bill faces criticism as worries grow among individuals A stablecoin linked to the Trump family has seen its market value soar past $2 billion since its announcement in March, but it has also faced criticism. However, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a key Banking Committee moderate, said he would back the measure. He also mentioned that worries about the Trump family’s business activities should not prevent progress on broader stablecoin legislation. Warner described the legislation as “not perfect but far better than what we currently have.” On the other hand, the progressive faction of the party, led by Elizabeth Warren, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, strongly opposed it. During an early vote, Warren and Senator Gillibrand had a heated exchange on the Senate floor. Warren shared a new analysis from her staff criticizing the bill for not including any bans on Trump and his family benefiting from cryptocurrencies regulated by his administration. The analysis also pointed out loopholes that could let criminals and terrorists misuse stablecoins for transactions outside traditional banks. Warren cautioned that passing this bill means they can expect more anonymous buyers—big companies and foreign governments—to use the president’s stablecoin as a secret bank account free from government oversight and as a way to pay off the president personally. She added that for criminals, it was a two-for-one deal. Bankers also worry that stablecoins might take away bank deposits and make it harder for small businesses and farmers to get loans. These groups often depend on banks for credit. So far, bankers have tried — mostly without success — to prevent big companies, like tech firms or retailers, from creating their own tokens.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading below $110,000, changing hands at $109.7K , as Asia continues its trading week. The move challenges a prevailing market narrative of summer stagnation, coming on the heels of a note from QCP Capital that emphasized suppressed volatility and a lack of immediate catalysts. A recent Telegram note from QCP pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as summer approaches. A clean break below $100K or above $110K, they wrote, would be needed to “reawaken broader market interest.” Even so, QCP warned that recent macro developments had failed to spark directional conviction. “Even as US equities rallied and gold sold off in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, BTC remained conspicuously unmoved, caught in the cross-currents without a clear macro anchor,” the note said. “Without a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging. Perpetual open interest is softening, and spot BTC ETF inflows have started to taper.” That context makes the current move all the more surprising. Over the weekend, Bitcoin surged 3.26% from $105,393 to $108,801, with hourly volume spiking to 2.5x the 24-hour average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. BTC broke decisively above $106,500, establishing new support at $107,600, and continued upward into Monday’s session, reaching $110,169. The breakout coincides with a tense macro backdrop: US-China trade talks in London and a $22 billion U.S. Treasury bond auction later this week have injected uncertainty into global markets. While these events could drive fresh volatility, QCP cautioned that recent headlines have mostly led to “knee-jerk reactions” that quickly fade. The question now is whether BTC’s move above $110K has true staying power, or whether the rally is running ahead of the fundamentals. A 'Massive Shift' in Institutional Staking May Drive ETH's Next Rally Ethereum’s critics have long highlighted centralization risks, but that narrative is fading as institutional adoption accelerates, infrastructure matures, and recent protocol upgrades directly address past limitations. “Market participants will pay for decentralization because it's in their economic interest from a security and principal protection standpoint,” Mara Schmiedt, CEO of institutional Ethereum staking platform Alluvial, told CoinDesk. “If you look at [decentralization metrics] all of these things have massively improved over the last couple of years."" There's currently $492 million worth of ETH staked by Liquid Collective – a protocol co-founded by Alluvial to facilitate institutional staking While this figure may appear modest compared to Ethereum’s total staked volume of around $93 billion, what's interesting is that it originates predominantly from institutional investors. ""We’re really on the cusp of a truly massive shift for Ethereum, driven by regulatory momentum and the ability to unlock the advantages of secure staking,"" she noted. Central to Ethereum’s institutional readiness is the recent Pectra upgrade, a significant development Schmiedt describes as both ""massive"" and ""underappreciated."" ""I think Pectra has been a massive upgrade. I actually think it’s been underappreciated, just in terms of the tremendous amount of change it introduces into the staking mechanics,"" Schmiedt said. Additionally, Execution Layer triggerable withdrawals—a key component of Pectra—provide institutional participants, including ETF issuers, a crucial compatibility upgrade. This feature enables partial validator exits directly from Ethereum’s execution layer, aligning with institutional operational requirements such as T+1 redemption timelines. ""EL triggerable withdrawals create a much more effective path to exit for large-scale market participants,"" Schmiedt added. Ultimately, Schmiedt said, ""I think we'll see that a lot more [ETH] in institutional portfolios going forward.” News Roundup Trump Media May Be the Cheapest Bitcoin Play Among Public Stocks, NYDIG Says Trump Media (DJT) may be one of the cheapest ways to get bitcoin exposure in public markets, according to a new report from NYDIG, CoinDesk recently reported. As a growing number of companies adopt MicroStrategy’s strategy of stacking BTC on their balance sheets, analysts are rethinking how to value these so-called bitcoin treasury firms. While the commonly used modified net asset value (mNAV) metric suggests that investors are paying a premium for BTC exposure, NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro argues mNAV alone is “woefully deficient.” Instead, he points to the equity premium to NAV, which factors in debt, cash, and enterprise value, as a more accurate gauge. By that measure, Trump Media and Semler Scientific (SMLR) rank as the most undervalued of eight companies analyzed, trading at equity premiums of -16% and -10% respectively, despite both showing mNAVs above 1.1. In other words, their shares are worth less than the value of the bitcoin they hold. That’s in stark contrast to MicroStrategy (MSTR), which rose nearly 5% Monday as bitcoin crossed $110,000, while DJT and SMLR remained mostly flat—making them potentially overlooked vehicles for BTC exposure. Circle Stock Nearly Quadruples Post-IPO as Bitwise and ProShares File Competing ETFs Two major ETF issuers, Bitwise and ProShares, filed proposals on June 6 to launch exchange-traded funds tied to Circle (CRCL), whose stock has nearly quadrupled since its IPO late last week, CoinDesk previously reported. ProShares is aiming for a leveraged product that delivers 2x the daily performance of CRCL. At the same time, Bitwise plans a covered call fund that generates income by selling options against held shares, two very different ways to capitalize on the stock’s explosive rise. CRCL surged another 9% Monday in volatile trading, continuing to draw interest from both traditional finance and crypto investors. The proposed ETFs have an effective date of August 20, pending SEC approval. If approved, they would further blur the lines between crypto and conventional finance, giving investors new tools to play one of the hottest post-IPO names of the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $109,795 after a 3.26% breakout fueled by institutional buying, elevated volume, and macro uncertainty from US-China trade talks and an upcoming $22B Treasury auction. ETH: Ethereum rebounded 4.46% from a low of $2,480 to close at $2,581, with strong buying volume confirming support at $2,580 and setting up a potential breakout above $2,590. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,314.45, edging up 0.08% as investors watch US-China trade talks in London and a subdued dollar keeps prices attractive. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.51%, as investors awaited updates from ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed slightly higher Monday, boosted by Amazon and Alphabet, as investors monitored U.S.-China trade talks.

The move pushed the firm’s average purchase price to $70,086, after buying at levels above $100,000 in recent weeks.

Weekly Bitcoin Purchases Continue Strategy’s drip-feed gameplan has become routine. The firm bought just under 2,000 BTC over the last two weeks, but split those into smaller chunks. That steady rhythm helps avoid big bumps in the market. It also keeps the firm in the headlines on a weekly basis. Traders watch closely. When the company buys, prices tend to move up. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRDhttps://t.co/blyWfRskjE — Strategy (@Strategy) June 9, 2025 Rather than issue new MSTR shares, Strategy tapped its STRK and STRF stocks. The latest filings show $62.7 million in STRK and $43.3 million in STRF went into Bitcoin purchases. No new common shares were registered this round. That keeps Strategy at about 0.02 BTC per MSTR share—10 times more Bitcoin per share than any other name in the sector. Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase filing with the SEC. Impact On Market Supply Corporate treasuries now hold roughly 3.4 million BTC. That stash includes what miners and governments no longer sell. It leaves less coin on the open market. Over-the-counter desks have seen their inventories drop from 236,000 BTC a month ago to just 123,500 BTC today. Even Coinbase Prime, one of the main outlets for big players, shows only 63,535 BTC available. Corporate Trends And Outlook Strategy’s moves still cast a long shadow. Only 26 other public companies have more than 1,000 BTC, and just seven hold over 10,000 BTC. On-chain data points to nearly 2,000 whale wallets that top those numbers. In the past week alone, five additional firms bought BTC, using their purchases to grab attention on social media. In all, 124 public companies have now listed Bitcoin on their balance sheets or signaled plans to buy.

The crypto space in 2025 is filled with hype, but very few projects are actually showing results. Whitepapers and fancy roadmaps aren’t enough anymore. People want visible progress, strong partnerships, and real-world use. That’s where a new set of crypto top gainers stands out. This article highlights four names, BlockDAG, AVAX, DOT, and NEAR, that are cutting through the noise. These projects are not just talking, they’re building, scaling, and showing up in places that matter. If you’re looking for projects that back bold ideas with action, keep reading. These are the ones worth watching in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: From Startup Roots to Global Reach BlockDAG is stepping onto the global stage with serious momentum. It’s rumoured to sign a potential deal with NBA, following its highly successful ongoing partnership with Inter Milan. BlockDAG isn’t chasing attention; it’s building a brand that delivers. With over $291 million raised in presale, more than 22.1 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, it has become one of the top crypto gainers for a reason. Currently in Batch 28, BlockDAG (BDAG) is priced at $0.0262. However, a limited-time offer brings that down to $0.0018, frozen until June 13th. This isn’t just a discount; it’s a clear opportunity to be part of something that’s gaining real traction. From strong numbers to bold visibility moves, BlockDAG is not just growing, it’s standing out. Among the top crypto gainers, it’s proving that strategic execution can turn a rising name into a major player. 2. AVAX: Powering Multi‑Chain Solutions Avalanche (AVAX) has built a reputation on fast, low‑fee transactions, and in 2025, it’s proving itself. This is the coin that’s all about real usage. From enterprise tools to NFT platforms and DeFi, AVAX is more than theory, it’s active. Plus, its subnets let developers create custom chains without slowing the main network. No flashy headlines here. Just steady work behind the scenes. Developers appreciate its infrastructure, and adopters value the reliability. As one of the top rated cryptos, AVAX offers a stable base for scalable apps. It’s quietly powerful, a top pick among the crypto top gainers for any serious builder. 3. DOT: Linking Blockchains with Solid Tech Polkadot (DOT) might not grab headlines with splashy deals, but its crucial technical work makes it one of the crypto top gainers. As a layer‑zero protocol, DOT links blockchains into a seamless network. This interoperability is essential for multi‑chain strategies. In 2025, parachain auctions and developer tools are gaining traction. DOT is back in the spotlight among tech‑focused audiences. It might not be glitzy, but engineering‑first clarity gives DOT its strength. For anyone building infrastructure‑driven projects, DOT is a key pick. 4. NEAR: Developer-Ready and AI-Driven NEAR Protocol brings developer ease and AI ambition. With quick transaction finality and smooth onboarding, it’s simple to create smart contracts. Already, NFAR has attracted developer attention. In 2025, NEAR is focusing on decentralized AI tools, partnering with machine‑learning startups. This clear direction makes NEAR one of the crypto top gainers that is future‑ready. While still growing, its community‑first approach and practical utilities stand out. It may not dominate headlines, but in tech circles, NEAR’s AI focus and developer ease are earning respect, another reason it’s among the top cryptos today. Which One Should You Pick? To be called a top-rated crypto in 2025, a project needs more than strong tech, it needs execution, visibility, and momentum. BlockDAG delivers all three: over $291 million raised, 2,520 % ROI delivered, 22.1 billion coins sold, and an NBA teaser after Inter Milan. It’s foreign to hype and built for impact, making it one of the standout crypto top gainers. At $0.0262 in batch 28, and a locked presale price of $0.0018 until June 13th, it gives clarity and opportunity. While AVAX shines on infrastructure and DOT powers interoperability, and NEAR leads in dev‑and‑AI usability, BlockDAG grabs the spotlight. When it comes to scale, story, and vision, it’s still the crypto top gainers leader of 2025.

Qubetics is capturing attention with its sale nearing its end and its decentralized VPN (dVPN) service. Stellar secures validation through inclusion in Nasdaq’s reconstituted crypto index, signaling mounting institutional trust. Bitcoin faces warnings of a potential “summer trap” flagged by a respected analyst. This analysis dives into each project’s fundamentals, real-world data, token trends, and risk frameworks for the top crypto coins to buy now . Qubetics and the Rise of Decentralized VPNs: Web3’s Backbone for Online Privacy Qubetics introduces a compelling utility: a decentralized VPN (dVPN) integrated directly into its blockchain ecosystem. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers vulnerable to data collection, Qubetics decentralizes the entire operation. Through a peer-to-peer architecture, users can share bandwidth, earn tokens, and navigate the internet without intermediaries. There is no central server to censor or fail, and no corporate entity to log user activity. The dVPN in Qubetics relies on blockchain-based transparency, incentivization, and encryption. Tokenized incentives, through the $TICS token, reward users who contribute bandwidth. This tokenomic model fuels a self-sustaining ecosystem, giving participants both utility and financial gain. The protocol also implements multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption. These features ensure a user’s IP address and traffic are not traceable by any single node operator. Qubetics sees its dVPN as a gateway to broader Web3 services. As users move into decentralized finance, NFTs, and decentralized storage, a secure and private network layer becomes essential. The dVPN ensures that activity across Qubetics’ ecosystem is protected, fostering a truly autonomous, censorship-resistant environment. Qubetics Presale: Scarcity Meets Demand in Final Phase Qubetics has entered its final crypto presale phase, and the numbers reflect surging demand. Over $17.8 million has been raised to date. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, distributed among over 27,700 holders. The current price sits at $0.3370, with fewer than 10 million tokens remaining. A 20% price surge is expected at listing, with the projected debut price set at $0.40. Recent changes to tokenomics are fueling further momentum. The total token supply has been drastically reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, significantly tightening future circulation. Additionally, the public allocation has increased to 38.55%, giving the community greater governance over future development. Analysts now point to scarcity, robust utility, and decentralization as core reasons for potential price appreciation post-launch. Growth Potential: A $2,000 Growth Scenario in Qubetics If a buyer purchases $TICS tokens at the current presale price of $0.3370, a $2,000 investment yields approximately 5,936 tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.40, this translates to $2,374, offering a return of 18.7%. If the token climbs to $1 after listing, the initial offering would be worth $5,936. At $5, it becomes $29,680. Should the token hit $10 after the mainnet launch, the portfolio would swell to $59,360. If it reaches $15, the initial $2,000 investment grows into $89,040—a staggering 4,349% return. While these figures are projections, they’re based on constrained supply, crypto presale momentum, and growing utility among the top crypto coins to buy now. Bitcoin: The Market Giant Enters a Cautionary Phase Bitcoin’s trajectory is always a topic of global debate. Currently, leading analysts have flagged concerns about a “summer trap” in the BTC market. This term refers to misleading bullish activity that lures investors, only to reverse into sharp corrections. Such traps have historically preceded volatile downturns. Investor sentiment has grown cautious following warnings from industry figures. Regulatory developments are adding further layers of complexity. The recent approval of a NASDAQ Crypto Index featuring Bitcoin alongside altcoins like Solana and XRP has stirred optimism. However, macroeconomic uncertainty persists. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s next policy moves and inflation data could cause further shifts in BTC pricing. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset for institutional investors and retail users alike. With its capped supply of 21 million coins and increasing mainstream exposure, it retains its appeal as a long-term hedge and one of the top crypto coins to buy now. But near-term volatility could increase, particularly as summer months bring lighter trading volumes and heightened emotional trading. Stellar’s Institutional Leap: Joining the Nasdaq Crypto Index Stellar (XLM) has seen a resurgence in market cap and relevance, largely due to its recent inclusion in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF. Now ranked 16th by market cap, Stellar is valued higher than Bitcoin Cash, a key competitor in the payments and remittance space. Inclusion in an index governed by Nasdaq is a signal of institutional confidence. It exposes Stellar to ETF-linked investments and brings its underlying protocol under a new level of scrutiny and validation. This change came during a reconstitution that also added Solana and other top-tier tokens to the benchmark. Such an endorsement can bring liquidity inflows and increased media coverage. Stellar continues to focus on its core mission of enabling cross-border payments and bridging fiat-crypto integration. Unlike Bitcoin, it offers fast settlement times and low transaction costs. Its partnerships with global financial institutions position it as a serious contender in the remittance market. Conclusion: Innovation, Adoption, and Timing Define the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Qubetics, Stellar, and Bitcoin each reflect a different side of the crypto market. Qubetics offers innovation through decentralized infrastructure, providing tools that underpin Web3’s ideals. Stellar presents institutional alignment and scalable financial utility. Bitcoin, the first and largest, commands attention through legacy and macroeconomic relevance, albeit with volatility risk in the short term. Understanding each coin’s role in the current market climate enables better decision-making. These are not just speculative assets; they represent different bets on the future of decentralized technology, financial access, and digital privacy. For those navigating the market today, these three tokens are more than trending tickers—they’re signals of where blockchain innovation is headed. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. What makes Qubetics dVPN different from traditional VPNs? Qubetics dVPN operates without a central server, using peer-to-peer architecture and blockchain rewards to ensure privacy, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. 2. How many tokens are left in Qubetics’ presale? Fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remain at the fixed price of $0.3370. This is the final presale stage before listing. 3. What is the risk of a “summer trap” in Bitcoin markets? A summer trap involves misleading bullish movements that reverse, potentially leading to steep losses. This has been flagged by analysts recently. 4. Why is Stellar’s inclusion in Nasdaq’s crypto index significant? It signals institutional approval, which may drive liquidity and increase Stellar’s visibility in the ETF investment landscape. 5. Can Qubetics’ $TICS token realistically reach $15 post-mainnet? While projections are optimistic, the reduced supply, growing ecosystem, and final-stage crypto presale dynamics lend credibility to long-term appreciation scenarios.

At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has jumped to $3.43 trillion, showing a healthy 4.22% rise in the past 24 hours. Investor sentiment has also turned positive. The Fear & Greed Index now reads 64, firmly in ‘Greed’ territory — a clear sign that traders are feeling confident about the market’s direction. So, what’s fueling this rally? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin Leads the Charge The star of the show is Bitcoin, which finally broke out of a consolidation range it had been stuck in since May 23rd. Currently trading above $109,500, Bitcoin’s breakout is being closely watched by analysts. This move was expected because of a bullish weekly candle formation called a three-inside-up pattern around the $100,000 mark. Historically, this kind of setup often leads to an 8-10% pump within a week or two. If momentum continues, some analysts believe Bitcoin could soon touch $115,000 — or even higher. Global Factors Also at Play Apart from technical signals, positive news on the macro front is also helping the rally. Reports show that trade talks between the United States and China have resumed, easing global market tensions. This, combined with growing institutional interest, has boosted investor confidence. Altcoins Follow Suit Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins are also climbing. Ethereum is up over 8% this week, now trading at $2,699, while Solana and Dogecoin have surged 5% and 6.6% respectively. Interestingly, Sui (SUI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have posted impressive double-digit gains. The Altcoin Season Index, however, remains at 30 out of 100, meaning that while altcoins are rallying, a full-fledged alt season hasn’t arrived yet.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 02:16:03

This move is in line with a broader recovery in the crypto market, with Bitcoin climbing steadily and Ethereum leading the pack with an 8% surge. As Ethereum moves higher, many smaller altcoins like XRP are following the trend. XRP also continues to display a bullish divergence, a signal where the price makes lower lows, but indicators like the RSI show higher lows. This often hints at a possible price bounce. XRP Finds Support, Eyes New Targets Looking at the daily charts, XRP recently bounced off a key support zone between $2.00 and $2.10. This area has proven strong in the past, with prices rebounding from here several times. If the price falls below $2.00, analysts warn that it could drop toward $1.92-$1.95, and possibly as low as $1.80. But for now, the bullish momentum is holding. Bullish Pattern Taking Shape A positive sign for XRP is the formation of a double bottom pattern — also known as a W pattern — on the charts. This pattern often signals a potential upward breakout. If this pattern plays out fully, the next price target would be around $2.44. However, before reaching that level, XRP could face some resistance near $2.35, an area that previously acted as both support and resistance. Long-Term Outlook: Could $5 Be Next? XRP appears to be in the middle of a fifth wave to the upside. This wave started in April after a market correction and could possibly push prices above $5.00 in the coming months, provided current support levels hold. If XRP stays above the April lows and maintains its upward structure, analysts believe the bullish trend could continue. However, a break below those key support areas might delay the rally, meaning that the market is still working through a correction phase.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 02:51:11

Although DOGE is still a cultural emblem with great community support, its expansion mostly depends on sentiment and market cycles. By means of combining artificial intelligence with blockchain architecture, Lightchain AI presents a utility-oriented alternative. Also, Lightchain AI, priced at $0.007 during its presale and already generating $18.3 million, is becoming rather popular among long-term value seekers and the issue now is whether this DeFi-driven token will outperform returns motivated by memes going forward. Can Meme Power Still Provide Significant Returns for Dogecoin? The rise of Dogecoin in 2021 demonstrated how strong meme culture is in influencing bitcoin values and at the time of writing, DOGE is roughly trading at $0.1848 on June 7, 2025 with about 2.54% value increase over the past 24 hours. Recent developments like the addition of Dogecoin to distributed finance (DeFi) systems have been adding to its utility outside its meme past. Apart from this, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust marks the growing institutional curiosity in it. Nonetheless, the coin has to cope with issues including significant price swings and little technological difference from other rivals. Though the main driver of DOGE has been meme rage, future performance of the meme may be mostly dependent on more general use and technological development rather than being only meme-oriented. Before considering Dogecoin as their next investment, traders should, nevertheless, be especially alert and do thorough investigation. Lightchain AI Gains Ground as DeFi Investors Eye Stronger Fundamentals As DeFi investors give stronger basics top priority over hype, Lightchain AI is becoming more and more relevant. Its system is set up for efficiency; artificial intelligence chores are split up, handled by contributor nodes, and checked with cryptographic proof before integration guarantees flawless operations. Low latency made possible by this makes the platform perfect for real-time artificial intelligence uses. By providing developers tools to create intelligent, distributed applications driven by the AIVM, Lightchain AI also promotes strong dApp development. Supported by strong tokenomics , 40% of LCAI tokens go toward presale, 28.5% to staking incentives, and the rest go toward liquidity, marketing, Treasury, team shares. These principles make Lightchain AI a unique for long-term value that draws intelligent investors in the changing DeFi scene. Bet Now on Lightchain AI for Future Serious Long-Term Development Possibilities Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to open countless opportunities across sectors including finance, healthcare, and more, Lightchain AI is guiding long-term success in the DeFi space. Emphasizing utility and practical applications, this project is not merely riding the wave but rather is helping to shape the future. Supported by strong principles and an innovative vision, Lightchain AI has great potential to provide investors outstanding returns. Looking beyond the hype, this project stands out as a wise decision as DeFi keeps expanding and attracting the attention of institutional players. Ignite the transient buzz of meme coins such as Dogecoin. For those hoping to leverage the future of DeFi, Lightchain AI presents a sustainable, forward-looking investment choice.

The price is now consolidating and might aim for an upward move above the $2.320 resistance. XRP price started a decent upward move above the $2.220 zone. The price is now trading above $2.250 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $2.320 resistance zone. XRP Price Aims Fresh Increase XRP price formed a base and started a fresh increase from the $2.050 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move above the $2.120 and $2.20 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $2.25 level. Finally, the price tested the $2.320 resistance. A high was formed at $2.3294 and the price is now consolidating gains above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high. The price is now trading above $2.220 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.270 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.350 level. The next resistance is $2.40. A clear move above the $2.40 resistance might send the price toward the $2.420 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.480 resistance or even $2.50 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.550. Are Dips Supported? If XRP fails to clear the $2.320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.2750 level. The next major support is near the $2.250 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.2250 swing low to the $2.3294 high.

This week’s Bitcoin price prediction leans bullish, following a sharp recovery from the previous week’s dip below $100,400, triggered by the Trump-Musk spat, and a strong bounce fueled by U.S. jobs data and renewed risk appetite. Investors are now watching U.S.–China trade talks in London, a key geopolitical event that may impact risk markets. So far, Bitcoin has remained resilient above $109,000, signaling investor confidence. What’s keeping Bitcoin steady? Apart from macro support, institutional participation is growing fast: Over 80 publicly traded companies (e.g., MicroStrategy, GameStop) now hold BTC The U.S. government owns nearly 200,000 BTC, according to blockchain data Gemini’s IPO filing points to sustained investor interest in crypto firms Together, these factors add legitimacy and long-term demand strength, bolstering bullish Bitcoin price predictions. Bitcoin Faces Key Resistance at $111.8K On the technical side, the Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish as BTC approaches the upper trendline of its ascending channel, testing resistance near $111,848. A breakout here would confirm the bullish continuation setup and target higher resistance levels at $115,103 and $118,358. The daily RSI is holding at 61, signaling positive momentum but leaving room before overbought conditions emerge. Also worth noting: the June 7 bullish engulfing candle, which often marks a return to trend after a retracement. Bitcoin price prediction: short-term trade idea Entry: Confirmed daily close above $111,848 Stop-loss: Below $107,616 Target 1: $115,103 Target 2: $118,358 Watch for: RSI divergence or rejection at $111.8K This bullish setup remains valid as long as BTC stays above the lower channel trendline near $107,000. Crackdowns and M&A Signal Maturing Market Beyond price, structural developments are helping shape Bitcoin’s evolving reputation. In Australia, authorities have just charged four money laundering rings involving $123 million in cryptocurrency, showing that even illicit crypto activity can be traced, which boosts trust in blockchain transparency. $NCPL buys Mixie, a blockchain-native platform building infrastructure and tools for Web3 games, creator media, and decentralized community engagement. pic.twitter.com/gRzkZzSyi2 — Joey Rattlesnake (@tallahassee_m) June 9, 2025 Meanwhile, Netcapital (NCPL) acquired the crypto-native platform Mixie, marking a significant step in crypto mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The fintech firm said the deal enhances its Web3 capabilities, reflecting broader institutional interest. This follows a 2025 trend of consolidation led by players like Coinbase and Ripple. These headlines support the broader Bitcoin price prediction narrative: strong demand, growing corporate adoption, and tightening legal clarity are laying the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next leg up. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $821K—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is taking off as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2, combining speed, scalability, and meme culture. Built to fix Bitcoin’s most significant flaws—slow transactions and high fees—it leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC ecosystem. With over $821,823 already raised, early adopters are betting big on its blend of tech innovation and meme appeal. Core Features That Set It Apart What makes Bitcoin Hyper different? It’s the only Bitcoin-based Layer 2 that combines the speed of SVM with the security of BTC’s base layer. The Canonical Bridge allows seamless BTC transfers, while low-cost gas fees and high-speed execution empower dApps, meme coins, payments, and more. Audited by Consult, it’s built for speed, trust, and scale. Staking Rewards and Utility $HYPER isn’t just a token; it powers the ecosystem. Users can stake it for high APY rewards post-launch, use it for gas fees, and access premium decentralized applications (dApps). Plus, active holders can earn bonuses via governance and early adoption initiatives. That’s real utility in a meme-capable package. Presale Now Live—Don’t Miss the Price Jump The public presale is now live, with 1 $HYPER priced at $0.011825. Over 90% of the funding goal has already been raised.

With strong presale results and innovative tech, Ruvi AI is one of the hottest new projects in crypto. Tron’s loyal investor base, who support decentralized content, are now looking at Ruvi AI’s potential in blockchain and AI, making RUVI a top pick for 2025. Tron (TRX): A Foundation in Decentralization Since 2017, Tron (TRX) has been the backbone of decentralized content sharing. With its cutting edge blockchain architecture, Tron allows creators to share content directly with users, eliminating intermediaries. This empowers creators and reduces fees and increases scalability, Tron can process up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). Tron expanded its reach through strategic acquisitions, including the popular BitTorrent platform, solidifying its position in the peer to peer sharing economy. But competition in the blockchain space has increased and some investors are looking for new projects that combine blockchain with other technologies.

The recovery comes after last week’s dip toward $100,000 levels, which had been triggered by market-wide volatility and profit-taking. While BTC remains approximately 4.2% below its all-time high of $111,000 reached last month, the weekly trend still reflects a 3.3% increase, suggesting buyers are gradually regaining confidence. This market behavior is mirrored in a set of on-chain indicators recently analyzed by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Defend Key Moving Averages – Bullish Signal Or Temporary Relief? Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Reflect Accumulation Behavior In Taha’s analysis titled “On-Chain Data Hints at Bitcoin’s Next Leg Higher,” Taha examined several metrics that point to a potential continuation of the rally. These include the Binance Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, UTXO age bands, and the Long-Term Holder (LTH) realized cap. All three suggest that market participants are actively accumulating and that underlying sentiment is shifting toward renewed bullishness. One of the primary indicators Taha focused on is Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell Ratio, which has recently climbed to 1.1. This metric evaluates the volume of aggressive market buys versus market sells on the Binance exchange. A ratio above 1 typically implies that more participants are willing to pay the market price to buy than to sell, indicating stronger buyer conviction. According to Taha, such shifts historically precede continued price increases when supported by volume. Another key metric showing strength is the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta over the last 90 days. This indicator tracks the net difference between buying and selling pressure and is now halfway to its historical peak at 0.02. Taha explains that this suggests a market not yet overheated, with room for further accumulation. Combined with recent breakout behavior above the 1D–1W UTXO band, representing recently transacted coins, this hints that many new holders are currently in profit and choosing to hold rather than sell. LTH Conviction and Stablecoin Inflows Reinforce Bullish Case Taha also noted the Long-Term Holder (LTH) Realized Cap has now surpassed $56 billion, reflecting strong hands holding a larger share of Bitcoin supply. These coins have not moved in over 155 days and are considered to represent investors with higher conviction. The increase in this metric implies that fewer coins are being sold into the market, a signal that many investors are expecting higher valuations in the coming weeks or months.

Historically, such inflows to spot exchanges, as opposed to derivatives platforms, often suggest readiness to deploy capital for direct asset purchases. Notably, all of these indicators can be seen as a leading signal of potential volatility or buying pressure. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin’s short-term price activity may benefit from continued accumulation and institutional positioning.

Alibaba’s Qwen and Tencent’s Yuanbao also disabled image recognition functionalities during exam hours . In addition to the measures taken by private AI companies, Chinese authorities also implemented a set of methods to prevent cheating attempts. These include biometric verifications, signal jamming, strict filtering of digital devices, and video surveillance to detect abnormal behavior during exams. Data released by the Chinese Ministry of Education (MoE) also confirmed the number of candidates for this year’s Gaokao is roughly 13.35M, ~70K fewer than last year. The Gaokao consists of three compulsory subjects, including Chinese, Math, and English, with exam questions set by the MoE. AI chatbots refuse to answer questions during exam hours 6月8日，接连有网友投稿称，国内的诸多AI在高考期间都暂停了服务，有学生让AI解读代码，遭到AI以“高考”为由拒绝解读。 pic.twitter.com/J24Fy5n9v0 — 李老师不是你老师 (@whyyoutouzhele) June 8, 2025 Qwen and Doubao still offered photo recognition as of Monday but refused to answer when asked questions about a photo of a test paper. Qwen responded that the service was temporarily frozen during exam hours from June 7 to 10, while Doubao said the picture uploaded was “not in compliance with rules.” The Doubao and DeepSeek applications also displayed automated messages announcing the temporary restriction of services, explaining that it was only during the examination tests. Yuanbao and Kimi suspended photo-recognition services during the hours when the multi-day exams took place across the country. The chatbots responded, “To ensure the fairness of the college entrance examinations, this function cannot be used during the test period.” However, none of the AI firms gave an official statement about suspending AI chatbots during the exam period. University students reportedly spread the information on the Chinese social media platform Weibo when they could not access the AI chatbots’ services to study during those exam hours. In addition to suspending AI tools to curb exam irregularities, school administrations in several regions in China announced that they would use AI to watch for “abnormal behaviors,” such as whispers or repeated glances between students during exams. East China’s Jiangxi Province will deploy an AI-powered, real-time surveillance system for all 567,100 candidates. The system will utilize deep learning algorithms to monitor irregular behavior by both examinees and exam invigilators in real time. Actions such as starting early, turning one’s head, passing items, or leaving mid-exam will be flagged and recorded. Exam room footage will be reviewed after the exam, and any violations or misconduct will be dealt with strictly per relevant regulations. Ding calls for fairness as the Education Ministry issues AI guidelines China’s Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang this week called for a “safe gaokao,” stressing the importance of a campaign against cheating. Last month, the Education Ministry also released a set of regulations stating that while schools should start cultivating AI talent at a young age, students should not use AI-generated content as answers to tests. The 2025 edition of the guideline aimed to standardize the ethical and appropriate use of generative AI while addressing privacy risks, academic integrity, and overreliance on technology. A senior Education Ministry committee official said the restrictions were meant to ensure age-appropriate use of AI and prevent younger students from becoming overly dependent on the technology. Primary school students were prohibited from independently using AI tools that generated open-ended content, while educators must ensure that AI can complement but not replace human-led teaching. Middle school students were allowed to explore the logical structure of AI-generated content. In contrast, high school students could engage in inquiry-based learning that involved understanding AI’s technical principles. The guideline also asked educational authorities to formulate localized AI management policies, establish data protection rules, launch ethical review mechanisms, and create dynamic “whitelists” of approved AI tools . Teachers were required to ensure that AI played only a supplementary role in education. The ministry said it will increase investment in AI education infrastructure and gradually establish AI education bases in primary and secondary schools. It also plans to offer more training programs for teachers to improve their understanding and use of AI tools. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Cardano (ADA) holders are taking notice and industry experts are predicting explosive returns on investment (ROI) for early backers by 2025. But what’s behind the hype? And how does Ruvi AI differ from Cardano, one of the biggest blockchain platforms in the crypto space? Whether you’re an experienced investor or just looking for new opportunities, this shift from ADA to RUVI is worth understanding. From their tech to growth potential, there’s a lot to unpack. Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain OG Cardano is a well known name in the crypto space and has built a reputation as one of the most reliable and sustainable blockchain platforms. Their Ouroboros proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol made them a green alternative to energy hungry proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin. But no project is immune to market competition. Diversification is always top of mind for forward thinking investors and now Ruvi AI is emerging as a great opportunity for those looking to maximize returns and get in on the next big blockchain wave. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain + AI Ruvi AI is no ordinary cryptocurrency. It’s a leap forward, blockchain + AI. This decentralized superapp isn’t just for trading or holding, it’s designed to solve real world problems for businesses and individuals. Ruvi AI allows users to create AI driven content in almost any format imaginable, text, audio, video, image creation. This benefits industries like marketing, content production and workflow optimization by providing tools that are efficient, secure and adaptive. At the heart of Ruvi AI’s ecosystem is the $RUVI token which powers the platform and has real utility. It enables seamless transactions, provides token holders with staking rewards and governance rights within the community. Unlike speculative ventures Ruvi AI has real world use cases that make it a future proof project capable of industry disruption. When you combine blockchain’s security with AI’s limitless possibilities you get a technology that’s not only innovative but practical. Ruvi AI’s Presale is a Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is best measured by its presale success. Phase 1 launched at $0.010 and sold out in 2 weeks. Phase 2 increased by 50% to $0.015 and those who joined early got rewarded. Presale has already attracted over 1,400 investors and raised $1.5 million. Ruvi AI is on the move. But that’s not all. Ruvi AI has already listed on an exchange and partnered with a major trading platform to expand its reach. More announcements coming soon. Ruvi AI is building for long term and keeping the momentum going. For those looking for the next big project in the crypto space Ruvi AI is not to be missed. What Do the Numbers Say About RUVI? For investors Ruvi AI’s presale is not just an entry point into a new project, it’s an opportunity for massive capital growth. Here’s a breakdown of the potential returns across 3 investment tiers: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI (Cost = $750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $4,900 (553% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI (Cost = $1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Potential Returns : At $0.07 Listing Price: $11,200 (647% ROI). At $1 Post-Launch Price: $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI (Cost = $7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Potential Returns At $0.07 Listing Price: $7,500 (833% ROI) At $1 Post-Launch Price: $75,000 (13,233% ROI) Why Cardano (ADA) Holders Are Switching to RUVI The migration of Cardano holders to Ruvi AI can be attributed to: Technological Advancement Ruvi AI’s blockchain + AI is a leap forward that Cardano doesn’t offer, so those looking for advanced solutions are switching. Clear Signs of Growth Strong presale, early listings and growing community all point to a well structured and scalable project. Real World Utility Unlike tokens that rely on speculation Ruvi AI solves real world problems with practical applications so investors can bet on it. Massive Upside With analysts predicting explosive ROI and low entry price, early adoption could be huge.

45746682,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=25383,1749527546,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,BIP177 và cuộc tranh cãi về cái tên Bitcoin?,https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/bip177-va-cuoc-tranh-cai-ve-cai-ten-bitcoin/,"Cuộc tranh luận lâu năm về việc đặt tên gọi Bitcoin cho số đơn vị sau dấu thập phân phần nào phản ánh mâu thuẫn giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng của Bitcoin trong đời sống. Một đề xuất nổi bật là loại bỏ dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” (số nhiều) làm đơn vị nhỏ nhất thay vì satoshi. Dù satoshi đã trở nên phổ biến, một số người cho rằng “bit” – bằng 100 satoshi – sẽ thân thiện hơn với người dùng đại chúng, đặc biệt khi giá Bitcoin tăng cao. Gần đây, BIP 177 – do John Carvalho (CEO Synonym) đề xuất – đã làm nóng cuộc tranh luận. BIP 177 muốn bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và dùng “bitcoin” làm đơn vị hiển thị mặc định. Tuy nhiên, giống như các nâng cấp trước đó như SegWit hay Taproot, sự thay đổi này đòi hỏi thời gian dài thảo luận, thử nghiệm và sự đồng thuận từ cộng đồng. Thành công của BIP 177 phụ thuộc không chỉ vào chất lượng kỹ thuật mà còn vào mức độ sẵn sàng thay đổi của cộng đồng Bitcoin. Sau 16 năm, tại sao vẫn tranh luận về tên đơn vị nhỏ nhất của BTC? Bitcoin, với tư cách là tài sản kỹ thuật số, có thể chia nhỏ thành những đơn vị cực kỳ bé để hỗ trợ nhiều loại hoạt động kinh tế, từ các giao dịch giá trị cao đến các microtransaction. Đơn vị nổi tiếng nhất chính là “satoshi,” đại diện cho 1/100.000.000 của một bitcoin. Thuật ngữ “satoshi” lần đầu tiên được đề xuất trên diễn đàn Bitcointalk.org năm 2010 bởi một người dùng có nickname Ribuck, người cũng gợi ý tên gọi “austrian” để tôn vinh Trường phái Kinh tế Áo. Theo thời gian, cộng đồng đã chọn “satoshi” làm đơn vị nguyên tử của Bitcoin, vừa để vinh danh người sáng lập bí ẩn Satoshi Nakamoto, vừa tạo ra một ngôn ngữ văn hóa ngắn gọn như “stacking sats.” Tuy nhiên, một đơn vị khác – “bit,” tương đương với 100 satoshis hoặc 1/1.000.000 của một bitcoin – cũng từng được đề xuất vì tính trực quan hơn. Một số giọng nói nổi bật như Adam Back đã ủng hộ việc hồi sinh “bits,” lý luận rằng nếu giá Bitcoin đạt mức 1 triệu đô la, thì 1 bit sẽ bằng 1 đô la, giúp việc chuyển đổi dễ dàng hơn. Như vậy, cuộc tranh luận giữa “sats” và “bits” không chỉ là vấn đề kỹ thuật mà còn là câu chuyện giữa truyền thống và thiết kế thân thiện với người dùng. Hiện tại, Bitcoin có nhiều đơn vị khác nhau: BTC, mBTC (millibitcoin), µBTC (microbitcoin hoặc “bits”), và satoshis. Điều này có thể gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người không chuyên về công nghệ. Một bitcoin (1 BTC) bằng 1.000 mBTC, 1.000.000 bits, hoặc 100.000.000 satoshis. Sự đa dạng này tạo ra độ phức tạp không cần thiết, đặc biệt khi người dùng phải đối mặt với các con số nhỏ như 0.000043 BTC hoặc 4300 satoshis. Theo BIP 177, một bitcoin đầy đủ – tức 100 triệu satoshis – có thể được gọi là “Mega Bitcoin.” Việc loại bỏ dấu thập phân và chuẩn hóa đơn vị thành “bitcoins” sẽ giúp giảm bớt cảm giác xa lạ và kỹ thuật hóa, mang lại cảm giác gần gũi hơn với người dùng phổ thông. BIP 177 , do CEO Synonym John Carvalho đề xuất, nhằm mục đích thay đổi cách hiểu thông thường về đơn vị Bitcoin bằng cách sử dụng đơn vị nhỏ nhất (đơn vị nguyên tố) làm tiêu chuẩn hiển thị. Thay vì biểu diễn giá trị Bitcoin dưới dạng thập phân (ví dụ: 0.00004321 BTC), BIP 177 khuyến nghị loại bỏ hoàn toàn dấu thập phân và gọi mỗi đơn vị cơ bản là “1 bitcoin.” Với mô hình này, điều từng được gọi là “1 satoshi” (1/100.000.000 BTC) giờ đây sẽ đơn giản là “1 bitcoin.” Các nhà ủng hộ cho rằng hệ thập phân là di sản UI lỗi thời gây nhầm lẫn, đặc biệt với những người mới tham gia. Mặc dù BIP 177 không thay đổi quy tắc đồng thuận hay dữ liệu trên chuỗi, nhưng nó yêu cầu một sự thay đổi đồng bộ trong giao diện ví và sàn giao dịch, đồng thời đối mặt với thách thức văn hóa khi phải thay thế thuật ngữ “sats” đã ăn sâu bén rễ. Bitkit Wallet là ví đầu tiên áp dụng BIP 177 Bitkit Wallet, phát triển bởi Synonym – một công ty “chị em” của Bitfinex – là ví tự quản lý tập trung vào trải nghiệm người dùng thân thiện, giúp mọi người dễ dàng gia nhập hệ sinh thái Bitcoin. Bitkit tích hợp nhiều tính năng tiên tiến như nút Lightning tích hợp sẵn, thanh toán qua định danh phi tập trung (DIDs), và sao lưu mượt mà qua đám mây mã hóa. Điều khiến Bitkit nổi bật là việc áp dụng sớm và nhiệt tình tiêu chuẩn BIP 177. Thay vì sử dụng BTC hoặc các phân số phức tạp như mBTC, ví Bitkit hiển thị giá trị theo “bitcoins,” giúp người dùng dễ hiểu hơn. Ví dụ, thay vì hiển thị “0.000043 BTC,” Bitkit sẽ hiển thị “43 bitcoins.” Điều này biến Bitcoin từ một loại tiền tệ kỹ thuật khó hiểu thành một phương tiện trao đổi quen thuộc, giống như cách chúng ta sử dụng xu hoặc satoshi. Liệu BIP 177 có nhận được sự ủng hộ đủ lớn để tồn tại lâu dài? Hiện chưa rõ BIP 177 có được cộng đồng chấp nhận rộng rãi hay không, dù đã có một số công ty như Square của Jack Dorsey bắt đầu áp dụng. Các ví và sàn lớn vẫn ưu tiên BTC hay satoshi, cho thấy xu hướng bảo thủ trong cộng đồng Bitcoin. Nhìn lại lịch sử, những thay đổi dù có lợi rõ ràng về mặt kỹ thuật như SegWit ( BIP 141 ) hay Taproot ( BIP 341 ) cũng phải mất vài năm mới được chấp nhận. SegWit chẳng hạn, được đề xuất từ 2015 nhưng đến tận 2017 mới được kích hoạt, sau hàng loạt tranh luận và một cuộc nội chiến trong cộng đồng, gồm cả UASF và các cuộc chạy đua giữa thợ đào. Quá trình thay đổi tiêu chuẩn đã định hình luôn khó khăn, đặc biệt khi liên quan đến giao diện người dùng. Nhiều người dùng và lập trình viên không muốn thay đổi thói quen, dù đề xuất có lợi về mặt trải nghiệm. Thiếu sự phối hợp từ các bên lớn như ví, nền tảng thanh toán, giáo dục – BIP 177 có nguy cơ chỉ dừng lại ở ý tưởng tốt nhưng không được triển khai. Trong hệ sinh thái Bitcoin, BIP là những đề xuất cải tiến – từ giao thức đến giao diện. Một số BIP cần đồng thuận toàn mạng (ví dụ SegWit hay Taproot), còn BIP 177 thuộc dạng tự nguyện áp dụng. Nhưng kể cả vậy, mọi thay đổi có ý nghĩa đều phải vượt qua cộng đồng phân mảnh, thận trọng và hoài nghi. Vấn đề nằm ở cách vận hành của cộng đồng Bitcoin: phi tập trung, cẩn trọng và không ai có quyền ra lệnh thay đổi. BIP 177 là thay đổi không cần đồng thuận toàn mạng, nhưng vẫn phải dựa vào sự tự nguyện của các nhà phát triển và dịch vụ. Khi 1 satoshi dần tiệm cận giá trị 1 đô, cách hiển thị trực quan hơn như BIP 177 (dùng “bit”) có thể giúp giao dịch hàng ngày dễ hiểu hơn. Hiện tại, một số dự án như Spiral , Square , Workit và Cashu đang trong quá trình triển khai BIP 177 ở các mức độ khác nhau. Trong một hệ thống mà mặc định là “không thay đổi”, ngay cả một cải tiến nhỏ như BIP 177 cũng phải đối mặt với rào cản cao để được công nhận chính thức. Tóm Lại Là: Cuộc tranh luận về tên gọi đơn vị Bitcoin phản ánh sự cân bằng giữa truyền thống và tính tiện dụng. Dù “satoshi” đã trở thành biểu tượng văn hóa, “bit” hay “bitcoins” có thể mở ra cánh cửa cho việc áp dụng rộng rãi hơn. Với sự dẫn đầu của các dự án như Bitkit Wallet và tiềm năng từ các công ty lớn như Square, BIP 177 có cơ hội tạo ra một bước ngoặt trong cách chúng ta nhìn nhận và sử dụng Bitcoin. Trong thế giới Bitcoin, mọi thay đổi dù nhỏ cũng cần thời gian, kiểm chứng và sự đồng thuận rộng rãi. Liệu BIP 177 có trở thành chuẩn mực hay chỉ là một ý tưởng thú vị? Hãy cùng chờ xem!

Ruvi AI (RUVI) Might Have the Edge Over Avalanche (AVAX),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-token-are-analysts-betting-on-for-the-2025-bull-run-ruvi-ai-ruvi-might-have-the-edge-over-avalanche-avax/,"With the 2025 bull run on the horizon, investors are looking for tokens that will deliver. Analysts are zeroing in on Ruvi AI (RUVI) as a strong contender to outshine Avalanche (AVAX). While both tokens have their own opportunities, Ruvi AI’s growth trajectory and innovative approach might just give it the edge. Avalanche (AVAX): The Standard for Scalability and dApps Avalanche has built its reputation as a blockchain that solves some of the industry’s biggest problems. It’s known for its scalability and can process over 4,500 transactions per second thanks to its unique consensus protocol. This has made Avalanche the go-to for dApp developers across finance, gaming and more. Over the years Avalanche has established itself in the crypto space with a thriving DeFi ecosystem and partnerships with big organizations. But some analysts think AVAX’s growth is slowing as the market looks for the next big disruptor. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Ruvi AI is making waves with its blockchain-AI hybrid. The platform is a decentralized superapp where users can generate AI-driven text, audio, video and image content. This makes Ruvi AI the perfect disruptor for industries that rely on creative automation, marketing and workflow optimization. The $RUVI token is the lifeblood of the ecosystem, powering transactions, offering staking rewards and governance rights to holders. By delivering real-world utility in a decentralized framework, Ruvi AI is setting itself up as a leader in next-gen crypto projects. Ruvi AI’s Presale is Booming Ruvi AI’s presale is hot. Phase 1 sold out in just two weeks at $0.010 per token. Phase 2 is now live at $0.015. That’s a 50% increase in value for early backers and more proof of concept. Over 1,400 have already joined the Ruvi AI community.Key highlights include Ruvi AI’s first exchange listing and a partnership with a major trading platform which has increased liquidity and accessibility. More to come as the project is getting attention from across the crypto space. Ruvi AI has raised $1.6 million so far. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI For investors looking to maximize returns Ruvi AI’s presale has tiered VIP options with bonuses. Below are three scenarios based on the presale token price of $0.015, the $0.07 listing price and a projected $1 post-listing value: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI). Why RUVI? Ruvi AI stands out in the crypto space for several reasons: Innovative Technology : Blockchain + AI = solving real world problems and new opportunities Results : Phase 1 sold out fast, Phase 2 growing fast. Investors are confident Transparency and Governance : Decentralized governance = community involvement and long term Strategic Growth : Exchange listings, partnerships and more, building for long term Conclusion Avalanche (AVAX) is a well known name in crypto but Ruvi AI’s blockchain + AI makes it a 2025 bull run disruptor. Analysts are expecting big growth, Ruvi AI might be the edge you’re looking for. Presale won’t last forever. For investors looking for innovation and returns, now is the time to get in.

Since 2022, it has formed through real-world use cases, not speculation, as Pioneers exchanged goods and services using PiCoin in a closed-loop economy. It reflects a community-agreed value rather than market prices listed on centralized exchanges. Crypto advocates, including @gfc199 and others, argue that this bottom-up value model is what kept the project alive during years of development. The Numbers Behind the Concern According to the analyst, most Pioneers hold fewer than 300 PiCoin. With exchange prices hovering around just $0.63, this means their holdings are valued at less than $200, far from the life-changing potential many had envisioned. The fear now is that if the Core Team remains silent on GCV or continues to delay its recognition, Pioneers may lose faith entirely. This could trigger a mass sell-off and further disconnect from the network. A Call to Action Before It’s Too Late The upcoming Pi Day 2 celebration could serve as a key inflection point for Pi cryptocurrency. Scheduled for June 28, this event, also known as Tau Day, is expected to reignite discussion around the project and may include major announcements from the Pi Core Team. According to the crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin , the Pi market is consolidating ahead of Pi Day 2, with a potential recovery expected as unlocks slow and investor confidence builds. Interestingly, recognizing GCV isn’t about bending to pressure; it’s about honoring the years of effort poured into the project by its most loyal supporters.

With important legal updates and market developments, many are keeping a close eye on where XRP could head next. Price predictions are making the rounds, and some are turning heads. A user on X (formerly Twitter) says that a $10,000 XRP isn’t impossible, and those dismissing the idea might be overlooking the bigger picture. According to the post, this isn’t just hype. It’s about the numbers, market dynamics, and global financial flows coming together. Dollar’s Decline and XRP’s Rising Role Since 1971, the dollar has lost 96% of its value. With national debt crossing $34 trillion and over $1 trillion spent on interest payments every year, the situation is becoming unsustainable. If the Federal Reserve continues printing more money, the dollar’s value could fall even further, leading to shifts in how assets like gold, cryptocurrencies, and real estate are priced. The Real World Asset (RWA) market could reach $16-30 trillion by 2030, given that big players, such as BlackRock and JPMorgan, are already in. These assets require speed, compliance, and cross-network support, and here’s where XRP enters. XRP: Built to Scale The user said that XRP’s infrastructure is already built for institutions. Supporting this statement, the user gave examples and said that RippleNet connects 300+ banks, ODL is active across 6 continents, RLUSD is a regulated stablecoin, and Ripple Custody secures digital assets. If XRP handles just a slice of global FX, tokenized assets, and debt markets, even at modest transaction speed, it could skyrocket. Its limited supply and high demand could send the price soaring. Is It Just A Wild Prediction? For XRP to reach $10,000, its total value would need to be around $530 trillion, which is not realistic. So, unless XRP powers nearly all global finance, that price is highly unlikely anytime soon. Short Term Price Targets XRP is currently trading at $2.30, up 2.7% in the past 24 hours.

The charges come after an 18-month investigation led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) through the Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce (CACT), in collaboration with Queensland Police, Australian Border Force, AUSTRAC, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, and the Australian Taxation Office. Money Laundering Organisation Dismantled According to the official press release of the Australian Taxation Office, the multi-agency probe culminated last week in 14 search warrants executed across Brisbane and the Gold Coast, targeting a scheme alleged to have funneled criminal proceeds through a complex web of businesses, bank accounts, and crypto exchanges. At the centre of the case is a Gold Coast-based security company, whose director, a 48-year-old Maudsland man, and general manager, a 35-year-old woman, have been charged with dealing with the proceeds of crime worth almost $6.5 million. The business allegedly blended legitimate cash transport operations with illicit funds sourced from organised crime groups, which were collected from secret dead-drop locations nationwide and flown into Queensland disguised as domestic cargo. The laundered money was then allegedly transferred into crypto assets or paid out via shell companies, including a promotions business and a classic car dealership. Crypto Wallets, Luxury Assets, Forged Documents Seized A 32-year-old Brisbane man from Heathwood, said to be a major client of the operation, is accused of laundering $6.167 million over 15 months and was charged with multiple offences, including failing to provide access to a secured mobile phone. Authorities allege he controlled the promotions company used to obscure the movement of funds while naming his wife as a straw director. Another Brisbane man, 58, from West End, allegedly received $4.15 million through a classic car business and routed it into the network using multiple bank accounts to conceal the source of the money. He faces four charges, including money laundering, uttering a forged document, and dealing with identification information for an indictable offence. In total, authorities have restrained about millions in assets suspected of being criminal proceeds, including 17 properties, vehicles, and bank accounts across Queensland and New South Wales. During the raids, investigators seized encrypted devices, business records, $30,000 in cash, and crypto wallets containing approximately $110,370 in digital assets. In a statement, AFP Detective Superintendent Adrian Telfer said, “We allege this organisation intentionally concealed and disguised the source, value and nature of their illicit money, and distanced themselves from the funds to try to avoid getting caught by authorities. This plot was elaborate and calculated, and it demonstrates the lengths criminals will go to make money.” The post Four Charged in $123M Queensland Crypto Laundering Scheme, AFP Says appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Australia,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-10 04:15:01

Andrew Small, a former economic crime investigator with the police, will lead the charge as crypto ownership becomes increasingly common in insolvency proceedings. His appointment reflects a sharp rise in the number and value of crypto-related cases over the past five years. In 2024–25, the agency identified over £520,000 (about $660,000) worth of crypto assets across 59 insolvency cases, up from just £1,436 (around $1,820) in 14 cases in 2019–20. Insolvencies with crypto as asset up 420% in 5 years Over £500,000 crypto in insolvency cases last year Ex-police investigator appointed to trace digital assets in criminal cases Insolvency Service hires first crypto expert to help recover funds from bankruptcy cases — Insolvency Service (@insolvencygovuk) June 9, 2025 Rising Crypto Ownership Forces UK to Bolster Asset Recovery Capabilities The move follows growing concerns about hidden or difficult-to-trace wealth in insolvency and enforcement work. With more than 7m UK adults now holding some form of cryptocurrency , according to the Financial Conduct Authority, digital assets are becoming a key part of the personal finance landscape. As a result, they are also showing up more frequently in bankruptcy and fraud investigations. Small will operate within the Insolvency Service’s Investigation and Enforcement Services team, focusing primarily on criminal cases. He is expected to provide frontline investigators with technical guidance on how digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and NFTs are stored, traded, and concealed. “There has been a rapid rise in crypto ownership in the UK, and alongside that, we’ve seen a similar rise in cryptoasset ownership in bankruptcy cases,” said Small. “My role will help the agency by providing specialist knowledge about the types of cryptoassets available and the associated technology used to buy, sell and store them.” New Crypto Role Aims to Close Gaps in UK Asset Recovery Framework The appointment is expected to have a significant impact on crypto seizures, particularly Bitcoin. As the agency strengthens its ability to detect and recover digital assets, individuals and companies facing insolvency or criminal investigations will find it increasingly difficult to hide wealth in cryptocurrencies. For those attempting to use crypto as a shield, the risks of detection and seizure are now markedly higher. Officials say the new role is a critical part of returning more value to creditors. The agency’s expanding mandate includes tracing assets, as well as recovering them on behalf of creditors. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, said the growing complexity of asset holdings made it essential to bring in experts. “Andrew brings a wealth of knowledge to this role,” he noted, adding that his background would strengthen the agency’s ability to deal with crypto-heavy cases. The appointment signals a more aggressive and informed approach to digital asset enforcement in the UK, at a time when regulators and courts globally are grappling with the challenges of decentralized finance.

The deal, split evenly between the two entities, comes after Circle’s highly anticipated public listing on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5. Circle’s stock surged on debut, opening at $69, more than double its $31 IPO price , before closing the day at $83. At one point, shares touched a high of $123.49, giving the company a fully diluted valuation of $32.1b. Circle IPO Marks The Biggest Fintech Listing Since Coinbase’s 2021 Debut The listing was the largest for a fintech firm since Coinbase went public in 2021 and is widely viewed as a signal that the IPO market, long subdued by macro volatility, may be regaining momentum. NYSE President Lynn Martin called Circle’s debut a bellwether, both for crypto-related firms and for the broader IPO pipeline. Notice Regarding the Investment in Circle Internet Group, Inc. https://t.co/CQRlogvFo0 — 北尾吉孝 (@yoshitaka_kitao) June 9, 2025 Against this backdrop of investor enthusiasm, SBI secured one of the largest institutional allocations in the offering. The Tokyo-based group framed the purchase as part of its long-running strategy to lead in digital finance. Institutional Interest Builds As BlackRock And SBI Back Circle’s IPO SBI Holdings, led by Yoshitaka Kitao, has a long track record of crypto-focused partnerships. In 2016, it invested in Ripple Labs and remains the firm’s largest external shareholder. Over the years, the group has also backed blockchain firms such as R3 and Securitize, and formed joint ventures to bring blockchain-based remittance and securities solutions to Japan. Circle represents a new channel for SBI to advance digital dollar infrastructure across Asia. In Nov. 2023, the two firms signed a business alliance. The goal was to promote USDC circulation and develop new use cases in Japan. By March 2025, SBI VC Trade became the first exchange in Japan to offer USDC to the public. Now, the two sides are setting up a joint venture, Circle SBI Japan KK. This venture aims to fast-track integration with Japan’s financial system. Circle, for its part, has been positioning USDC as a stable and regulated medium for international payments. With SBI’s latest investment and its ongoing partnership, Circle gains deeper access to the Japanese market at a time when stablecoins are gaining mainstream traction. The move comes just weeks after BlackRock disclosed plans to purchase around 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, showing growing institutional appetite for exposure to dollar-backed digital currencies.

45750227,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=127938,1749532391,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here is Shiba Inu Price in 5 Years if Shibarium Burns 10T SHIB Per Month,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/10/here-is-shiba-inu-price-in-5-years-if-shibarium-burns-10t-shib-per-month/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-shiba-inu-price-in-5-years-if-shibarium-burns-10t-shib-per-month,"SHIB price could soar tremendously if Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain Shibarium burns around 10 trillion tokens monthly over the next five years. Since its mainnet launch in August 2023, Shibarium has served as a major engine for burning Shiba Inu tokens. The L2 blockchain initiates this burn by converting a portion of its transaction fees, initially collected in BONE, into SHIB and then sending them to the official dead wallet. At its initial launch, the Shiba Inu ecosystem team manually conducted Shibarium-powered SHIB burns. This resulted in the incineration of over 50 billion SHIB tokens. However, the process gained full automation in August 2024, with the blockchain burning an additional 1 billion tokens. Although Shibarium’s overall burns represent a tiny fraction of SHIB’s overall supply of 589.5 trillion tokens, many believe that as the network sees broader adoption, its burn rate will accelerate substantially. SHIB’s Price If Shibarium Burns 10T Tokens Monthly for 5 Years Based on this growing optimism, we estimated the value of one SHIB token if Shibarium burns 10 trillion tokens every month for the next five years. For context, if Shibarium burns 10 trillion tokens every month for five years, it would destroy approximately 600 trillion tokens in total. With Shiba Inu’s overall supply standing at 589.5 trillion, this would theoretically burn the entire supply, which is unrealistic. However, if Shibarium successfully burns 500 trillion tokens over the next five years, Shiba Inu would be left with a supply of 89.5 trillion SHIB afterward.A supply reduction of that magnitude would significantly impact SHIB’s price, irrespective of whether Shiba Inu’s market cap remains unchanged or grows exponentially. Notably, Shiba Inu boasts a market cap of $7.37 billion, with a token currently trading at $0.00001251. If Shibarium burns 500 trillion SHIB, reducing the supply to 89.5 trillion, and Shiba Inu’s market cap stays at $7.37 billion, each SHIB would be worth about $0.00008234.This estimated price is still below Shiba Inu’s all-time high of $0.00008845, which was reached in October 2021. Nonetheless, it represents a surge of 558.19% from the current price of $0.00001251. $0.00008 Price Forecast For SHIBRecall that multiple entities projected that SHIB would revisit the $0.00008 region in May 2024. While Changelly predicted that SHIB would reach a maximum target of $0.00008740 by May 2024, CoinCodex set a price target of $0.00008284 in the same month. However, these predictions did not materialize, with Changelly and CoinCodex extending their timelines for SHIB’s potential surge to the $0.00008 territory. Currently, Changelly believes that SHIB will hit the target by February 2029. CoinCodex speculates that SHIB will revisit the $0.00008 mark after 2050, over 25 years from now. Meanwhile, most Shiba Inu community members believe that SHIB will surpass the $0.00008 mark this year, specifically during the peak of this cycle’s bull run. These proponents do not think a hefty burn is necessary to drive SHIB’s price to this target. Despite this optimism, caution is necessary as these commentaries are purely speculative. Other Possible Scenarios However, if Shiba Inu’s market cap soars tremendously following the Shibarium-powered 500 trillion token burn, the price could spike beyond the above-estimated target. For instance, if the market cap doubles to $14.74 billion and supply drops to 89.5 trillion, SHIB’s price could rise to $0.0001646. Moreover, a fivefold increase in market cap would raise the price to $0.000411. Similarly, a tenfold increase in Shiba Inu’s price following the burn would drive the price to $0.0008234.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 05:13:11

The analyst highlighted this arc in one of his recent analyses amid XRP's ongoing recovery effort, with the asset eventually reclaiming $2.3. Recall that analyst The Great Mattsby had previously insisted that until XRP breaks above $3.3, its price action features nothing exciting.Now, EGRAG has identified what could open the pathway for this excitement. Data from his monthly chart indicates that the Guardian Arch, one of three important curves on the monthly timeframe, is a critical element in XRP's current price movements.The Guardian Arch Has Dictated XRP Bull Top Since 2014Among these three curves, the lowest has served as a formidable support for the asset since 2017. Meanwhile, the Guardian Arch, being the middle curve, has acted as a resistance level. Interestingly, when this resistance is broken, it leads to higher prices.Notably, the Guardian Arch has served this purpose since 2014. For instance, when XRP soared to $0.02803 in December 2014, the Guardian Arch acted as resistance at this top. With the asset unable to breach the Arch, this marked the top for that cycle.Also, amid the 2017/2018 explosive run, the Guardian Arch acted as resistance for XRP when the asset reached a peak of $0.3988 in May 2017. This led to a pullback and consolidation. However, after six months, XRP recovered, eventually breaching the Guardian Arch to reach a new all-time high of $3.8 in January 2018. The XRP Guardian Arch | EGRAG Crypto XRP revisited the Arch in April 2021, when it soared to a high of $1.96. Following the resistance at this level, XRP pulled back and consolidated. However, it failed to revisit the Arch, possibly due to legal pressure from the SEC lawsuit. As a result, the $1.96 level marked XRP's top for the 2021 bull run.XRP Eyes $20 to $27 Upon Guardian Arch BreakoutNow, the resistance at the Guardian Arch has played out again. This time, XRP met the Arch at the $3.4 price peak in January 2025. As expected, this has led to a pullback and consolidation like in previous cycles. Interestingly, EGRAG believes XRP will follow the 2017/2018 price action and not the 2021 movement.If he's correct, XRP still has another uptrend left in the current bull run. According to EGRAG, the measured move sets a target of $20 for when XRP breaches the Guardian Arch. Nonetheless, his chart highlights the possibility of a higher upsurge to $27, a price level he has consistently advocated for .Meanwhile, EGRAG is also looking ahead. He suggests the next phase could be harsh for XRP, possibly leading to a massive price plunge. According to him, the downtrend could resemble the 2021 drop, leading to an 86% decline. Notably, if XRP claimed the $27 level this bull run, then such a drop would lead to the support at $3, aligning with the Guardian Arch.While he expects XRP to reach double-digit targets such as $20 or $27, the market analyst advised investors not to try to time the market. Instead, he suggested taking profit at strategic levels instead of relying on a single target.

Atkins criticized applying “century-old regulatory frameworks” to DeFi and blockchain innovation, noting that current securities rules were designed for traditional intermediaries and issuers, not self-executing software systems. “The prior administration discouraged Americans from participating in blockchains by asserting through lawsuits, speeches, regulation, and threatened regulatory action that participants and staking-as-a-service providers may be engaged in securities transactions.” Key points from Chairman Paul Atkins’ remarks today at “DeFi and the American Spirit,” SEC’s Crypto Task Force Roundtable on Decentralized Finance – a — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) June 9, 2025 Green Light for Ethereum DeFi Atkins also clarified that voluntary participation in a proof-of-work or proof-of-stake network as a miner, validator, or staking-as-a-service provider “is not within the scope of the federal securities laws.” He was also in favor of “affording greater flexibility” to market participants to self-custody crypto assets, and said “publishing staking code or wallet software isn’t brokerage activity.” Moving forward, the SEC chair directed staff to explore guidance for registrants transacting with blockchain systems and consider rule amendments to accommodate on-chain financial systems. He also proposed an “innovation exemption” framework for expedited market entry of compliant on-chain products and services. “An innovation exemption could help fulfill President Trump’s vision to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” by encouraging developers, entrepreneurs, and other firms that are willing to comply with certain conditions to innovate with on-chain technologies in the United States.” It was a “huge day for Ethereum,” said former developer Eric Conner, who added, if this becomes policy, the US becomes the crypto capital of the world: “Ethereum gets regulatory clarity for staking, self-custody, and open-source infra” Ethereum is the industry standard for DeFi with an on-chain value of $68 billion, giving the network a commanding market share of 55%, more than all of the other chains combined, according to DeFiLlama. 1/ Huge day for Ethereum & DeFi.

Users retain full control of their assets while collecting these returns, a core principle of the protocol’s DeFi-first design. The initiative is part of Sky’s larger post-MakerDAO ( MKR ) “Endgame” rebranding , which includes a total overhaul of governance, rewards, and utility in addition to a new name.

At the same time, analysts suggest that actively managed ETFs focused on meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe may be on the horizon, reflecting growing interest in retail-driven digital assets. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest-Growing ETF in History as Assets Surpass $70 Billion According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, the speed of IBIT’s ascent is unprecedented. “IBIT just blew through $70 billion and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days,” Balchunas wrote in a June 9 post on X.

Launched in 2004, GLD was one of the most influential commodity-based ETFs of its time and became a benchmark for alternative assets in traditional financial markets. IBIT has now surpassed that legacy in record time, underscoring the accelerating institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a legitimate and investable asset class.

While the initial greenlighting of multiple products ushered in fierce competition, it quickly became clear that BlackRock’s offering was capturing the lion’s share of investor demand. As of this week, IBIT manages over $70 billion in assets, more than double the AUM of its nearest competitor—Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETF—which currently sits at around $31 billion. That significant gap highlights BlackRock’s dominance in the space, driven by brand trust, distribution capabilities, and favorable market conditions for Bitcoin. The fund has also shown consistent investor appetite, recently enjoying an unbroken 34-day streak of net inflows. This performance not only signals sustained interest in Bitcoin but also affirms BlackRock’s execution in bringing a product to market that aligns with the long-term interests of both retail and institutional investors. IBIT’s explosive growth has mirrored Bitcoin’s resurgence in 2025, as the world’s leading cryptocurrency has seen a surge in demand following the fourth Bitcoin halving and continued concerns over fiat currency devaluation. The entry of a financial titan like BlackRock into the crypto arena has provided an additional layer of legitimacy to the digital asset sector, encouraging more traditional investors to gain exposure through regulated channels. Many analysts see IBIT’s trajectory as part of a broader structural shift in financial markets, where Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable component in diversified investment portfolios. The fund’s success may also accelerate similar offerings for other digital assets, potentially opening the door for Ethereum spot ETFs, or even niche products tied to Solana, Avalanche, or other blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, the performance of IBIT is likely to be cited in future lobbying efforts aimed at pushing for clearer crypto regulations. Its success serves as empirical evidence that well-structured, transparent digital asset investment vehicles can thrive within the US financial system. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite its meteoric rise, IBIT—and by extension, Bitcoin ETFs —still face regulatory and market-related headwinds. US regulators remain cautious about potential market manipulation, custody solutions, and systemic risks. Moreover, Bitcoin’s price volatility means that while inflows may be steady now, they could reverse sharply in the event of a significant downturn in crypto prices. Still, the success of IBIT is a powerful signal that investor demand for digital asset exposure is not a passing trend, but a long-term evolution in capital allocation. With BlackRock at the helm and an established distribution network spanning financial advisors, wealth managers, and institutional desks, IBIT appears well-positioned to continue its dominance. As Bitcoin continues to assert its role as a macro asset in the eyes of institutional investors, the precedent set by IBIT may serve as a roadmap for the next generation of digital financial products. Actively Managed Meme Coin ETFs May Be Closer Than You Think, Says Bloomberg Analyst In related news, according to Balchunas, there is a “really good chance” that a meme coin ETF will be launched in the near future—potentially as soon as 2026. In a June 7 post on X, Balchunas laid out his forecast, saying the market should first expect a series of actively managed crypto ETFs, which will likely be followed by one that specifically targets the volatile and fast-moving world of meme coins. Unlike traditional ETFs, which passively track a single asset or a fixed index, an actively managed meme coin ETF would take a dynamic approach. Such a fund would be curated and frequently rebalanced by a portfolio manager who makes real-time decisions about which tokens to buy, hold, or sell based on their performance and potential upside. This approach resonates with the fast-paced nature of the meme coin market, where trends and sentiment shift rapidly, and the next “hot” token can rise—or collapse—overnight. A team behind the Russia-themed Vladcoin meme coin advocated for exactly this structure, noting in a post that an ideal fund would ”hold the promising ones and sell off the weaker ones.” Retail-Driven Market With Growing Capitalization Meme coins have seen an explosion in popularity in 2025, largely fueled by a new wave of retail investors attracted by their viral potential, social media buzz, and extreme short-term gains. Tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Trump ( TRUMP ) have become household names in the crypto community—despite their often thin technical use cases. At its peak earlier this year, the total market capitalization of meme coins surged past $60 billion, riding on speculative fervor and political memes. While the market has cooled since the January highs, the sector’s influence remains significant, especially among younger, digitally native traders. Meme coin market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Still, any path toward an active meme coin ETF must first navigate regulatory approval—an area where the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically dragged its feet. Balchunas noted that most tokens must first be excluded from the 1933 Securities Act to be eligible for inclusion in an active ETF, making the regulatory structure a key bottleneck. Nevertheless, momentum is building. Several firms—including Grayscale, Bitwise, and 21Shares—have filed for spot Dogecoin ETFs in 2025. Smaller issuers like Osprey Funds and Rex Shares have submitted even bolder filings, aiming to list ETFs tracking TRUMP, BONK, and other politically or culturally charged tokens. “The Dogecoin ETF filing will tell us a lot,” said Balchunas, suggesting that DOGE may become the litmus test for broader meme coin ETF acceptance. While he previously estimated a 75% chance of SEC approval for a Dogecoin ETF this year, that optimism has waned. On blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket, odds for such approval have dropped to 44% as of June. Boom, Bust, and the Next Wave The meme coin market has experienced dramatic whiplash in recent months. Following an epic bull run that peaked in January, many top tokens have seen their prices collapse by more than 70%. Dogecoin is down approximately 75% from its highs, while Shiba Inu has lost 85%. TRUMP, once boosted by claims of future acquisition by the Trump family-linked World Liberty Financial, is now down 86% from its all-time high. The sector’s volatility presents both risk and opportunity, precisely the kind of environment where an active fund could outperform. Rather than passively holding declining assets, an actively managed ETF could theoretically pivot quickly between outperformers and underperformers, preserving capital during downturns and riding momentum during rallies. More than 70 crypto ETF applications are still awaiting a decision from the SEC this year, according to Bloomberg data. While most of the attention has been on Bitcoin and Ethereum-based products, the potential emergence of meme coin ETFs adds an unpredictable but fascinating new layer to the evolving crypto investment landscape. For now, the idea of a meme coin ETF still feels slightly surreal—a far cry from the days when Bitcoin itself was dismissed as a “fraud” by mainstream finance. But if history is any guide, today’s internet joke could be tomorrow’s Wall Street product. And if market sentiment, social momentum, and ETF industry trends continue on their current trajectory, a memecoin ETF—especially an actively managed one—may soon become reality.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-10 05:30:00

This marks the seventh consecutive week of positive flows, bringing the total to $11 billion during this period. Despite the headline inflows, investor sentiment appeared more cautious than in previous weeks. CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill noted that uncertainty around the US Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates has introduced hesitation among crypto investors . With no clear signal yet on whether the Fed will pivot or hold rates steady, some capital remains sidelined, waiting for stronger macroeconomic cues. Ethereum Dominates Inflows While Bitcoin Sees Outflows Ethereum emerged as the week’s top performer in terms of fund flows , attracting $296.4 million in new investments. That brings its seven-week inflow total to approximately $1.5 billion, representing around 10.5% of total assets under management (AUM) across Ethereum-linked investment products. CoinShares described this as the most sustained period of inflows into Ethereum since the 2020 US election, suggesting a resurgence in investor confidence in the asset. In contrast, Bitcoin saw net outflows for the second week in a row, losing $56.5 million. The outflows were mirrored in short-Bitcoin products, which also recorded a second consecutive week of redemptions. This aligns with the broader theme of caution in the market, particularly with Bitcoin facing difficulty holding above the $105,000 level in recent sessions. The outflows may reflect traders rotating out of Bitcoin in favor of Ethereum or simply reducing overall exposure due to macro concerns .

Other notable contributors included Germany ($47.8 million), Switzerland ($15.7 million), Canada ($9.8 million), and Australia ($6.5 million). On the flip side, Brazil and Hong Kong registered outflows of $9.2 million and $14.6 million, respectively. The Hong Kong data is particularly notable, marking an end to the recent streak of record inflows driven by its newly launched spot crypto ETFs. Activity in the altcoin segment remained relatively muted. Sui logged a modest $1.1 million in inflows, while XRP continued its downward trend with $6.6 million in outflows, its third consecutive week in the red. While these movements are relatively small in dollar terms, they continue to reflect a general lack of conviction in altcoin markets during this consolidation phase.

Founder Charles Hoskinson has introduced the Cardinal Protocol, the network’s first DeFi solution powered by Bitcoin. For the first time, Bitcoin can now be used on Cardano for lending, staking, and more, without the need for third-party custodians. The news has sparked market excitement, pushing ADA’s 24-hour trading volume to $500 million. Currently trading at $0.669, Cardano is also gaining momentum after its inclusion in the Nasdaq crypto index, signaling growing institutional interest. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Bitcoin Enters Cardano’s DeFi Arena Developed by InputOutput HK, Cardinal allows users to put their Bitcoin to work through lending, borrowing, farming, or staking on the Cardano blockchain. This is made possible using “wrapped UTXO” technology, which can be burned at any time to redeem the original Bitcoin or Ordinals. For the first time, Bitcoin holders have a way to tap into DeFi on Cardano without trusting centralized platforms. Safe, Cross-Chain, and Fully Transparent Instead of custodians, Cardinal uses a secure MuSig2 multi-signature system, making Bitcoin transactions safe, transparent, and decentralized. It also supports cross-chain compatibility with networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. Cardinal uses BitVMX for off-chain verification, while Cardano smart contracts handle the on-chain logic. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : 4 U.S. Economic Reports This Week That Could Make or Break Bitcoin , Users can now interact with popular DeFi platforms like MinswapDEX, SundaeSwap, and Fluid Tokens to lend, farm, and trade Bitcoin-backed assets.

More Features on the Way Cardano’s CTO Romain Pellerin believes this is a huge step forward, but says there’s more to be done. Future upgrades may include wallet support, zero-knowledge proofs, and deeper liquidity. This launch bridges the world’s biggest cryptocurrency with Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem — bringing Robert Kiyosaki’s belief that Bitcoin is “the people’s money” even closer to reality. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Officials from both nations met in London on Monday to discuss rare earth shipments and the potential easing of export restrictions, with further negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Gold prices fell below $3,310 per ounce on Tuesday, as optimism over easing US-China trade tensions dampened safe-haven demand. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.78% to above 38,200 while the broader Topix Index gained 0.2% to 2,791 on Tuesday, with Japanese shares extending a winning streak to a third straight day. The Japanese yen weakened to around 145 per dollar on Tuesday, reaching a near two-week low. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda told the parliament on Tuesday that the central bank stands ready to raise interest rates again if they ""have enough confidence that underlying inflation nears 2% or moves around 2%."" China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.61% to around 3,403 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.2% to 10,230 on Tuesday, with mainland stocks struggling for clear direction as the Sino-US trade negotiations in London enter a second day, and the offshore yuan remained steady to around 7.18 per dollar on Tuesday, as investors awaited further progress over the US-China trade negotiations. The discussions, focused on easing tensions over shipments of technology and rare earth elements, are set to continue on Tuesday morning. These critical materials play a vital role in industries such as aerospace, semiconductors, and defense, and disruptions in their supply threaten global economic stability. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.25% to 24,222 in early trade on Tuesday. However, the concerns over intensifying competition among China’s top EV makers, as a long-running emissions compliance dispute between BYD and Great Wall Motor escalated, with Geely joining in to criticize BYD’s aggressive price cuts. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.04% were largely flat in morning trade on Tuesday, with the BSE Sensex hovering around 82,472 after rising for the fourth consecutive session. Investor caution also stemmed from the upcoming release of May consumer price data, expected later this week. Markets anticipate that India’s inflation rate could ease to 3%, the lowest since April 2019. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.86% to 8,551 on Tuesday, hovering near four-month highs. The Australian dollar held its gains around $0.651 on Tuesday. In Australia, consumer sentiment rose for the fourth time this year, with the Westpac-Melbourne Institute Consumer Sentiment Index increasing by 0.5% month-over-month to 92.6 in June. Meanwhile, business confidence improved, with the NAB Business Confidence Index rising to 2 in May from -1 in the previous month. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended mostly higher as high-stakes trade talks between the US and China began in London. Markets are also closely watching upcoming CPI and PPI reports later this week. Earnings results from GameStop and J.M. Smucker Co. are also on the docket. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Tuesday as markets awaited developments from trade talks between the US and China taking place in London: Dow +0.23% ; S&P 500 +0.34% ; Nasdaq +0.46% .

This proves strong demand for its AI products like ChatGPT and business tools such as its API. The biggest source of revenue is ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, which the company expects will generate around $8 billion by the end of 2025. The tech firm’s business tools show higher adoption rates from enterprises because they now serve 3 million paying companies, up from 2 million in February. API access makes up about a third of the company’s total ARR because it allows outside developers to use the firm’s language models in their own apps. Microsoft’s earnings could be even higher because the $10 billion figure does not include revenue from its licensing deals or large one-time contracts with other companies that bring large sums but don’t recur regularly. Many people now rely on AI for tasks like writing, learning, coding, and organizing information, as OpenAI reports that about 500 million users are active weekly. Additionally, between 800 million and 1 billion people are using ChatGPT globally as of mid-2025. OpenAI is introducing new pricing models or premium features to monetize its massive base of free users in 2026. This will allow it to grow more than tenfold in just four years and achieve its goal of $125 billion in annual revenue by 2029. These new strategies will give the company a stronger path toward long-term growth and profitability and add an extra $25 billion annually in revenue. The firm is setting the pace for what AI companies can achieve when their tools become essential to everyday users and global enterprises, as proven by its fast rise in revenue, users, and business adoption. OpenAI’s rising value brings big spending and major losses OpenAI is now the world’s second most valuable private tech company, valued at $300 billion, just behind Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Despite strong investor confidence, the company faces pressure to maintain its rapid growth. While revenue is soaring, its operating costs are climbing even faster. Before considering new spending commitments in 2025, the company reported a loss of around $5 billion in 2024. The firm has been pouring money into hiring the best AI researchers and acquiring top design and coding startups. Moreover, it has been building and maintaining powerful computing systems needed to train its large language models. Compute costs likely comprised the largest share of the company’s entire budget because OpenAI spent around $5 billion on its infrastructure in 2024 alone. This includes high-end chips like NVIDIA GPUs, massive cloud servers, and custom infrastructure for running AI models. Industry insiders describe the company’s aggressive spending as a dangerously high burn rate (how fast it spends its available cash). They suggest it needs more funding because it could run out of money in the next 12 to 18 months. Despite leading in AI innovation and product adoption, OpenAI hasn’t built a business model that can support this scale without external funding. To solve this, OpenAI started one of the largest funding rounds ever for a private tech company led by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank. It raised $40 billion in March 2025. The funding showed that investors have enormous expectations for what OpenAI might become in five to ten because it valued the company at $300 billion (30 times higher than its annual revenue of $10 billion). Investors are betting that OpenAI will eventually dominate the consumer and enterprise AI markets and possibly expand into hardware, robotics, and other AI-powered tools. Despite investor optimism, the tech firm still has several years of expected losses ahead, as it admitted that it doesn’t expect to be profitable until 2029. The company admits that it must continue to spend heavily on research, infrastructure, and new product development. It must also deal with legal and regulatory issues, such as copyright lawsuits like the one filed by the New York Times and questions about how it collects and uses training data. Competition in the AI industry also puts more pressure on OpenAI to keep investing aggressively because companies like Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and Meta are attracting big enterprise clients and raising billions of dollars with their advanced AI models.

During the fifth meeting of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force roundtable titled DeFi and the American Spirit, Atkins outlined plans for a new “innovation exemption” that would provide conditional relief from certain regulatory requirements. While broader regulatory changes remain under development, the exemptions would provide a temporary structure to support the safe deployment of onchain services. Atkins said the exemptions would be designed to support firms that are willing to meet specified conditions while developing blockchain-based systems. These measures, he noted, would allow for responsible innovation within the boundaries of investor protection and market integrity. He also revealed that SEC staff have been directed to evaluate whether additional guidance or rule changes may be needed to help registrants interact with self-executing software systems in compliance with securities laws. “These on-chain self-executing software systems have proven to be resilient in the face of crises,” he said, contrasting them with centralized platforms that have failed under recent stress. “Many on-chain systems continued to operate as designed pursuant to open-source code.” You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Atkins emphasised that most securities regulations were built around traditional intermediaries such as broker-dealers and exchanges. “The drafters of these rules and regulations likely did not contemplate that self-executing software code might displace such issuers and intermediaries,” he noted, calling for regulatory flexibility to accommodate these new models. Atkins, appointed earlier this year as part of President Trump’s push to establish the U.S. as a global leader in crypto innovation, has called for a “rational regulatory framework” that balances innovation with investor protection. In contrast to his predecessor’s approach , Atkins is steering the SEC toward inclusive policymaking that recognises the operational differences between traditional financial intermediaries and decentralised systems. Since taking office, he has repeatedly stressed the need for structured, participatory rulemaking that reflects the unique characteristics of blockchain systems and crypto assets. The SEC’s Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first policy report in the coming months. The report will contribute to a regulatory foundation that Atkins says is urgently needed to support the growth of onchain technologies and provide long-awaited clarity for market participants.

As the most economically developed Slavic nation, Slovenia has consistently grown since adopting the Euro in 2007. Its openness to innovation has been a key driver of success in the industrial sector, making it a favored destination for crypto enthusiasts. Many believe Slovenia is poised to become a powerful fintech hub in Europe. But does its current crypto regulatory framework support such aspirations? Let’s explore Slovenia’s crypto regulations and see if they can propel the country to the forefront of the cryptocurrency landscape. My expectation is positive. What’s yours? Before answering, let’s delve deeper. 1. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: An Overview Slovenia is renowned for its pro-innovation stance, providing a supportive environment for emerging technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Under the Act on Payments Services and Systems, cryptocurrencies are classified as virtual assets rather than financial or monetary instruments. Regulation of the crypto sector in Slovenia is decentralized. Various authorities manage different aspects of the ecosystem. For instance, the Bank of Slovenia and the Securities Market Agency oversee cryptocurrency transactions to ensure compliance with financial laws, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Anti-Terrorist Financing regulations. The Slovenian Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (ZPPDFT-2) incorporates the EU’s 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5MLD) and aligns with the latest FATF recommendations. All virtual currency service providers must register with the Office of the Republic of Slovenia. 2. Crypto Regulations in Slovenia: What’s New? Several notable developments in Slovenia’s crypto sector occurred this year: July 25, 2024 : Slovenia issued a €30 million sovereign digital on-chain bond, the first of its kind in the EU, with a 3.65% return, maturing on November 25, 2024. July 1, 2024 : NiceHash announced Slovenia’s first Bitcoin -focused conference, NiceHashX, scheduled for November 8–9 in Maribor. Thank you @CoinEdition for sharing and spreading the news! Come and join us at our NiceHashX conference in Maribor Slovenia in November! https://t.co/AM5XNvOVgI — NiceHashX (@NiceHash_X) July 1, 2024 3. Crypto Taxation Framework in Slovenia Explained Slovenia’s crypto taxation framework provides clear guidelines for both individuals and corporations. According to the Financial Administration of Slovenia, the tax treatment depends on the trader’s status and the nature of the transaction. Individuals : Income earned from cryptocurrencies through employment or ongoing business activities is subject to personal income tax. However, capital gains from trading or market fluctuations are exempt from taxation. Corporations : Capital gains from cryptocurrency activities are subject to a corporate income tax of 19%. The Value-Added Tax (VAT) generally applies at a rate of 22%, although cryptocurrency transactions considered means of payment are exempt from VAT. Companies are not allowed to restrict payment methods to cryptocurrencies alone. Tokens issued during ICOs must follow standard accounting rules and the Law on Corporation Tax. 4. Crypto Mining in Slovenia: What You Should Know Crypto mining is unrestricted in Slovenia, but income from mining is considered business income and is therefore taxable. This includes rewards from validating transactions and any additional income from mining operations. Both individuals and legal entities must comply with Slovenian tax regulations. 5. Timeline of the Evolution of Crypto Regulations in Slovenia Here is a timeline highlighting the evolution of crypto regulations in Slovenia: 2023 : The EU adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), establishing a uniform regulatory framework for crypto-assets, their issuers, and service providers across the EU 2017 : The Financial Administration of Slovenia provided more detailed guidelines on cryptocurrency taxation, based on factors such as the trader’s status and the type of transaction. 2013 : The Slovenian Financial Administration issued guidelines stating that income from cryptocurrency transactions should be taxed. Endnote Slovenia’s approach to the crypto sector is commendable, reflecting its optimistic view of the future of cryptocurrencies. The country’s balanced regulatory framework supports crypto innovation while protecting user rights and preventing illegal activities. Recent developments show Slovenia’s commitment to continually improving its regulatory environment. Slovenia’s crypto regulation framework sets a positive example for other nations navigating the evolving crypto landscape. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-is-2-4-weeks-away-from-its-final-run-up-heres-what-it-means/,"Market Analyst Mr. Xoom has drawn parallels between XRP’s current price structure and its behavior during the 2017 market cycle. In his tweet, he suggested that XRP is approaching the final phase of a significant upward move. Accompanying his tweet is a chart from TradingView that compares two distinct consolidation periods in XRP’s history, offering a technical basis for a forecasted breakout. According to the chart and commentary, XRP consolidated for 210 days before its explosive move in late 2017, a period that preceded its historic surge to all-time highs. In the current cycle, XRP has already consolidated for approximately 190 days following a sharp price rise earlier in 2025, which saw it exceed $2.00 for the first time in years. I believe by the end of August/ start of September, XRP should have made its final move up & ended its run. NFA but Don’t be left behind being a bag holder with just a screenshot. Take profits. https://t.co/pXj4lU5eZJ — xoom (@Mr_Xoom) June 7, 2025 Consolidation Periods Mirror Past Cycle Xoom notes that, if XRP continues to mirror the 2017 pattern, the next move could begin within the next 2 to 4 weeks. This would place the anticipated start of the breakout around late June to early July. He projects that the final move could peak by the end of August or the beginning of September, concluding what he believes may be XRP’s “final run up” of this cycle. The chart highlights the consolidation zones in both 2017 and 2025 using orange boxes, with annotations indicating the duration of each phase. In 2017, the breakout that followed the 210-day consolidation led XRP to its all-time high of nearly $3.40. The present cycle, while still unfolding, shows similar technical behavior, with price action maintaining higher lows within a tight range, a characteristic often associated with accumulation phases.

The move triggered a surge in local crypto-linked stocks. KakaoPay Corp . climbed as much as 18% on Tuesday, its biggest jump in over a year, amid growing investor optimism that the government will back a won-based stablecoin initiative. The Digital Asset Basic Act, proposed by the ruling party, would allow local companies to issue stablecoins provided they meet a minimum capital requirement of 500 million won ($367,000) and guarantee redemptions through adequate reserves. The proposed legislation is designed to improve transparency and increase competition in the digital asset sector, according to party officials . The bill also calls for a Presidential Digital Asset Committee to oversee industry policy and introduces entry rules requiring approval, registration, and reporting to the Financial Services Commission. South Korea’s President Follows Through on Crypto Promises The proposal comes just a week after Lee, a progressive politician known for his pro-crypto stance, won the presidential election . His administration is moving swiftly to implement campaign pledges aimed at modernizing South Korea’s regulatory framework for digital assets. Still, the initiative faces pushback from the Bank of Korea, which has expressed concerns about non-bank entities issuing stablecoins. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has argued that such assets could undermine monetary policy, and insists the central bank should lead any effort involving a won-pegged digital currency. Under the proposed law, all asset-linked tokens, including stablecoins, would require approval from the Financial Services Commission, South Korea’s top financial regulator.

Under the guise of crypto startup Evita, he served as a financial intermediary to sanctioned Russian entities through illicit transactions, FBI New York Assistant Director in Charge Raia, noted. “Gugnin’s alleged scheme manipulated our nation’s financial infrastructure to benefit our nation’s adversaries.” Furthermore, his clients included sanctioned Russian financial institutions, such as Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and the state-owned energy company Rosatom. Between June 2023 and January 2025, Gugnin used Evita to process over 80 invoices, digitally erasing the identities of Russian recipients. The accused purportedly routed funds using USDT and USDC stablecoins. A WSJ article published last September, profiled Gugnin as one of the high-net-worth renters in Manhattan, paying $19,000 per month for an apartment. Gugnin Knew He Was Breaking the Law Per the DOJ, the accused was aware that he was breaking the law through various web searches, including queries like “how to know if there is an investigation against you” and “money laundering penalties US.” He also reportedly visited pages like “am I being investigated?” and “what are the best ways to find out if you’re being investigated.” Gugnin was arrested on Monday and if convicted, he would face a jail term of up to 30 years on the bank fraud counts; 20 years for the wire fraud, money laundering; 10 years for failure to implement an effective AML program and 5 years for conspiracy to defraud the US financial system.

Meanwhile, Congress is advancing key crypto legislation—the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act—while debating protections for blockchain developers. In the UK, the Insolvency Service appointed its first crypto intelligence officer to recover hidden digital assets after the recognition of crypto’s role in bankruptcy and crime. SEC Explores Rule Changes The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is exploring a new “innovation exemption” that could pave the way for a much more flexible regulatory environment for on-chain products and services. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who previously worked as a crypto lobbyist, revealed the initiative during a Monday roundtable that was hosted by the agency’s Crypto Task Force, titled DeFi and the American Spirit. (Source: SEC ) Atkins said he instructed SEC staff to consider a framework that would offer conditional exemption relief, giving qualifying firms temporary relief from certain regulatory requirements. The aim is to accelerate the development and market entry of blockchain-based technologies while the SEC works on potential amendments to its existing regulations. Atkins positioned this move as a step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump’s vision of establishing the US as the global hub for cryptocurrency innovation. He explained that the proposed exemptions will be available to developers and firms that are willing to comply with specific conditions, thereby encouraging compliant innovation in the country. Atkins also shared that many of the SEC’s current rules were not designed to address decentralized financial systems powered by self-executing code, which suggests that regulatory updates are necessary to accommodate these novel approaches. Additionally, Atkins asked staff to assess whether broader amendments to the SEC’s regulatory structure could better support on-chain financial infrastructure. He acknowledged that the foundational assumptions behind most securities regulations do not easily translate to decentralized systems where software may replace traditional actors. This announcement was made amid a shift in tone at the SEC since former Chair Gary Gensler stepped down in January. Under Gensler’s leadership, the agency was frequently criticized for regulating the crypto industry through enforcement actions rather than through transparent rulemaking. In contrast, the current SEC leadership, including acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Chair Atkins, launched a Crypto Task Force with the stated goal of creating a practical and responsive crypto framework. Atkins told the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services on June 3 that the SEC intends to use the “notice and comment” process to refine its approach. He also revealed that the Crypto Task Force is expected to release its first report in the coming months. Blockchain Bills Gain Momentum in Congress Meanwhile, US lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee are preparing for a crucial markup hearing on Tuesday to consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, which is also known as the CLARITY Act. The goal of the bill is to define a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency market, and it could undergo amendments to include new protections for blockchain developers. Committee chair French Hill introduced an amendment focused on the treatment of “non-controlling blockchain developers,” and proposed that such individuals or service providers not be classified as money transmitters, thereby exempting them from related registration requirements. This amendment seems to draw from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, a separate piece of legislation that was introduced in May by Representative Tom Emmer and a bipartisan group of lawmakers. The proposal to integrate the two bills gained support from several crypto advocacy organizations, including the Blockchain Association, which urged lawmakers to unify the legislative efforts to provide clearer guidance for the crypto industry. The markup hearing on Tuesday will serve as a platform for committee members to discuss and vote on amendments to the CLARITY Act, and could potentially pave the way for the bill to be sent to the full House for consideration. Meanwhile, in the Senate, legislators are expected to vote on the GENIUS Act, which seeks to regulate payment stablecoins. Senate Majority Leader John Thune wants to finalize the stablecoin bill within the week. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal praised the bipartisan progress on stablecoin regulation and believes in the importance of a market structure bill for long-term industry stability. He thinks that while rules for stablecoins are essential, the broader regulatory clarity offered by the CLARITY Act is equally vital. Despite this progress, the path forward for the CLARITY Act is still uncertain. Representative Maxine Waters, ranking member of the committee, expressed strong opposition by criticizing the bill for failing to address alleged corruption linked to President Donald Trump’s connections to the crypto industry. Waters hosted a Minority Day hearing on Friday, arguing that the legislation would only serve to legitimize misconduct rather than prevent it. Nevertheless, there are signs of bipartisan support. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democrat and co-sponsor of both the CLARITY Act and the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, appears to want to push the legislation forward. UK Insolvency Service Targets Hidden Crypto In the UK, the Insolvency Service took a major step toward tackling the rising involvement of cryptocurrency in bankruptcy and criminal cases by appointing its first crypto intelligence specialist. Andrew Small, a former police investigator with experience in economic crime, will now lead efforts to trace and recover digital assets that have gone unaccounted for in insolvency proceedings. This move comes in response to a staggering 420% increase in crypto-related insolvency cases in the UK over the past five years. The total estimated value of crypto assets in such cases rose from just over £1,400 to more than £523,000. Small’s role will involve using his expertise to identify and track various types of digital assets, from mainstream cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to meme coins like Dogecoin and even non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The Insolvency Service is responsible for recovering funds to repay creditors in bankruptcy and liquidation scenarios, and said Small’s appointment will improve outcomes by providing investigators with the technical knowledge that is required to navigate the complex crypto landscape. Neil Freebury, head of intelligence at the Insolvency Service, believes that Small’s addition to the team will enhance collaboration and help in cases involving crypto ownership. As digital asset ownership becomes more prevalent, Small said that crypto is now “very much a recoverable asset” in insolvency cases. Andrew Small A recent study by the Financial Conduct Authority revealed that 12% of UK adults owned crypto in 2024, up from just 4% in 2021. The average value held by these individuals was approximately £1,842. In parallel with the Insolvency Service’s ramped-up efforts, UK authorities are also tightening regulations on the crypto industry.

According to a June 9 post on X by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the iShares Bitcoin Trust crossed the $70 billion mark in just 341 days, five times faster than the previous record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 pic.twitter.com/5VeGT9twpQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 9, 2025 IBIT now manages $71.9 billion in assets and holds 661,457 Bitcoin ( BTC ), making BlackRock the world’s largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, ahead of Binance and Strategy. The ETF is currently trading at $61.77 per share and has recorded $201 million in inflows so far in June, following a record $5.9 billion in May inflows. The fund started trading on the Nasdaq on Jan. 11, 2024, a day after spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved by U.S. regulators. IBIT’s first day of trading saw a volume of over $1 billion, indicating strong interest from institutional and retail investors.

He also noted that IBIT has outpaced even the world’s largest gold fund in inflows this year, with $6.96 billion net since January, ranking sixth among all ETFs. The fund’s rapid growth has led some analysts to speculate that BlackRock could eventually overtake Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is estimated to hold around 1.1 million BTC. Balchunas previously projected this could happen by the end of next summer. Adding to its momentum, on June 4, Russia’s MOEX exchange launched futures for IBIT, though these remain limited to accredited investors. IBIT’s rise coincides with the growing interest in crypto ETFs and institutional exposure to Bitcoin, solidifying its position as the industry leader in the rapidly changing digital assets landscape.

Markets in Tokyo, Seoul, and Sydney all gained ground. At the same time, oil prices pumped as the dollar steadied. On Monday, a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met Chinese officials under Vice Premier He Lifeng. The talks are aimed at resolving disputes over tariffs and market access that have weighed on global growth. President Trump told reporters in London that the talks “were going well” and that he was “only getting good reports” from his team. Trading in Asia was broadly positive Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 climbed 1% to 38,473.97, and South Korea’s Kospi added 0.9% to 2,881.40. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng edged up 0.2% to 24,242.03, while Shanghai’s Composite index rose 0.1% to 3,403.51. Taiwan’s Taiex led gains in the region with a 2% jump. Meanwhile, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.7%, finishing at 8,578.50. U.S. stocks edged higher on Monday The S&P 500 inched up 0.1% to 6,005.88, leaving it 2.3% below its all-time high set in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 1 point to 42,761.76, effectively flat for the day. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.3%, reaching 19,591.24. Hopes that President Donald Trump might roll back some tariffs if new trade deals are struck have helped the S&P 500 recover after a roughly 20% drop from its peak two months ago. The index is now above levels seen after Trump’s surprise announcement of broad tariffs in April, a move he termed “Liberation Day.” Some of the largest share movements on Monday came after takeover news. Qualcomm shares jumped 4.1% when the chipmaker said it would buy Alphawave Semi for $2.4 billion. Electric vehicle maker Tesla also rallied, recovering from a sharp drop late last week. Shares climbed 4.6% following a day of mixed trading, after Tesla slid when CEO Elon Musk’s rapport with President Trump appeared to sour. Oil prices ticked up while the dollar steadied A successful deal between Washington and Beijing could lift the global growth outlook and spur demand for commodities. Oil prices ticked up on Tuesday as traders awaited the outcome of the talks, which could ease trade worries and boost fuel consumption. By 03:30 GMT, Brent crude futures were trading at $67.32 a barrel, up 28 cents or 0.4%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate stood at $65.52, up 23 cents or 0.4%. On Monday, Brent had briefly reached $67.19, its highest since April 28. The U.S. dollar firmed slightly, with the euro slipping 0.17% to $1.14 and sterling at $1.3543. The dollar index, which tracks the currency against six rivals, rose 0.2% to 99.189, remaining near the six-week low hit last week. It is down 8.7% so far this year as investors fret over the impact of trade barriers on U.S. growth. At the same time, the Australian dollar held steady at $0.652, often seen as a gauge of risk appetite, while the New Zealand dollar eased slightly to $0.60425 but stayed close to the seven-month peak reached last week.

But could the success have negative implications for Bitcoin? A recent report from crypto market analyst 10x Research suggests Circle’s initial public offering (IPO) may not be as bullish for the broader crypto market as it appears. Instead, it might be a cautionary tale for Bitcoin (BTC) . The sentiment stems from historical parallels.

The shares went on to surge as high as $429 during intraday trading, before closing at $328.28. The milestone, however, marked a local top for the market.

This joint statement, which includes important organizations such as DeFi Education Fund, Coin Center, Solana Foundation's policy arm Solana Institute, Digital Chamber, Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Bitcoin Policy Institute and Paradigm, is considered a critical step in the industry. The BRCA aims not to regulate software developers and infrastructure providers that do not store customer assets in the same way traditional financial institutions do, the statement said. The regulation was first introduced by GOP Majority Representative Tom Emmer and later became a bipartisan proposal with the support of Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres. Related News: Bitcoin Bulls Push Toward Record High - $108,000 Breached - Analyst Shares What to Expect Next “It is critical that we do not treat open source developers like traditional financial institutions. BRCA draws that line clearly and protects innovation,” one policy leader told Terrett. The joint statement made following the inclusion of BRCA in the final version of the bill included the following statements: “We welcome the inclusion of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA) in the newly proposed version of the CLARITY Act. This is a meaningful step toward protecting peer-to-peer technology developers who do not control customer funds. The updated bill takes a balanced approach, building on FinCEN’s 2019 guidance that developers and infrastructure providers should not be regulated as money transmitters when they do not control customer funds.” *This is not investment advice.

Investors are anticipating a massive rally, and they are buying MUTM tokens in droves. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi project has gained massive attention from the crypto world due to its innovative design. Built for long-term gains, this project could change the face of DeFi forever, according to market analysts. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized non-custodial lender protocol that allows users to join as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders on the protocol supply capital into audited smart contracts and receive interest on those deposits. The interest they receive is dynamically set by market forces based on a pool’s utilization rate. When borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate starts to climb, and interest rates start rising. This encourages borrowers to pay back their outstanding loans, while also incentivizing more lenders to join. As a result, the utilization rate goes down, bringing the interest. The system is designed to be self-regulating, allowing for optimal capital utilization. Safeguards on the protocol To ensure that lenders and borrowers operate in a safe and thriving environment, the protocol has created various safeguards. One of them is ensuring there is reliable price data to ensure that users get fair market pricing for their assets. For fair pricing, Mutuum Finance will rely on the Chainlink price data oracles. Additionally, it plans to integrate a backup oracle for price data. It could also implement aggregate price data oracles for redundancy when it comes to real-time price discovery. Another source of price data will be time-weighted price averaging, where there is sufficient on-chain data. Token vetting To protect the solvency and long-term health of the ecosystem, new tokens will have to meet certain standards. For instance, new tokens that require a complex integration process may increase gas fees for other platform users. In such a case, the benefits to the community will be carefully weighed against the potential gas fee increases. Another important metric will be the price volatility and liquidity of an asset. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will not add assets that have extremely low liquidity and excessive price volatility. Such assets can destabilize the entire protocol through price manipulation. The team will also check tokens for centralization. For instance, if a token is centrally issued or has a single custodian, that creates a single source of vulnerability. Such a coin can be easily shut down by its creators or other agencies, increasing the chances of insolvency of the protocol. Before listing a token, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will weigh the benefits to the community versus the challenges created by the possibility of intervention by a single entity. For all tokens added on the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will conduct dynamic adjustments based on real-time monitoring. That will ensure that a token’s parameters accurately reflect its current liquidity, volatility, and user adoption. Supporting the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) native token The MUTM token, the native token of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem, will be crucial to the long-term success of the ecosystem. As such, the team continues to take measures to ensure its widespread adoption within the crypto world. One of these measures is a CertiK audit, which the team recently announced. In the audit, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received a Token Scan Score of 80. The results of the audit have been crucial to the viral spread of the ongoing presale, where over $10.3 million has been raised to date. Another important step towards mass adoption came when the team got a listing on the CoinMarketCap crypto price aggregation platform. The platform, which has over 300 million monthly visitors, will be crucial in this plan. It will provide visibility for the token, which could lead to an increased level of adoption. To promote the long-term success and adoption of MUTM tokens, the team plans to create a buy-back and distribution program when the tokens go live. They will use protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens off the open market and distribute them to stakers. That will apply positive price pressure on the tokens, which will boost demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale Mutuum Finance has enjoyed massive success in the ongoing presale, where it has raised over $10.3 million. So far, over 11,800 unique buyers have taken part in the presale, which is in phase 5. In the current phase of the presale, tokens are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. The token price is set to increase by 16.67% in phase 6. Since launching around a week ago, over 28% of the phase tokens have been sold. This is a testament to the fast pace of the ongoing presale. If you are looking for an exciting DeFi project with a native token that is expected to experience sustained upward price pressure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the project to join. With a low price of $0.03 per token in the current phase, you stand to make substantial gains when it goes live.

Digital asset platform Uphold is exploring a potential IPO in the U.S. or a strategic sale, CEO Simon McLoughlin told The Block. The company’s board has engaged investment bank FT Partners to evaluate its options, including a listing on the Nasdaq or a possible merger or acquisition with a financial or payments firm. “We’re currently being courted by a number of banks, brokers, financial institutions and payment firms,” McLoughlin told the Block. According to McLoughlin, an IPO could support Uphold’s longer-term acquisition strategy, positioning the company to potentially expand via mergers. Though McLoughlin declined to disclose a target valuation, a person familiar with the matter said Uphold is seeking a figure above $1.5 billion. The company’s exploration of a public listing comes amid significant revenue growth. McLoughlin revealed that Uphold’s annual revenue jumped from $80 million in 2022 to an expected $300 million in 2025, driven by both retail expansion and enterprise partnerships, including work with a German bank. It also comes shortly after Circle, another major U.S.-based crypto firm, completed a successful IPO that saw its shares surge over 300% in the first week of trading.

Gugnin, who lived in Manhattan, was arrested on Monday, taken to court the same day, and ordered to stay locked up until trial. The 22-count indictment claims Gugnin ran the operation through two companies he controlled — Evita Investments and Evita Pay — while hiding the source, flow, and purpose of the funds. Prosecutors say between June 2023 and January 2025, he funneled payments for clients tied to banned entities using a mix of U.S. banks and crypto exchanges, mostly moving the money through Tether, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar. Gugnin lied to banks, erased Russian links, and used shell accounts Justice officials allege Gugnin’s clients included institutions under U.S. sanctions, such as Sberbank, VTB Bank, Sovcombank, Tinkoff, and Rosatom, Russia’s state-run nuclear energy firm. These are not random wallets—they’re tied to the Kremlin’s financial and tech backbone. Prosecutors say Gugnin helped them get around restrictions by faking compliance documents, lying to banks, and hiding ties to Russia. They accuse him of using shell companies and doctored records to make payments look clean. He allegedly rewrote over 80 invoices, digitally removing any trace of the Russian entities involved. The goal was simple: get the money past U.S. systems without anyone catching on. U.S. officials say Gugnin also helped them buy restricted American technology. One example given is a server covered by anti-terrorism export laws, which landed in the hands of a Russian client thanks to his operation. Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen stated, “The defendant is charged with turning a cryptocurrency company into a covert pipeline for dirty money, moving over half a billion dollars through the U.S. financial system to aid sanctioned Russian banks and help Russian end-users acquire sensitive U.S. technology.” Gugnin apparently knew he was in deep. The feds say he searched online for phrases like “how to know if there is an investigation against you” and “money laundering penalties US” before his arrest, showing he expected federal heat. And he wasn’t just moving cash. Officials say he kept up direct ties with Russia’s intelligence service and with Iranian officials. Neither country sends people back to the U.S. when wanted. Despite being at the center of a half-billion-dollar laundering case, Gugnin was living large in New York. In fall 2024, the Wall Street Journal featured him in a story about rich renters. He was paying $19,000 a month for a luxury Manhattan apartment. The Justice Department made clear: if Gugnin is convicted of bank fraud alone, he could get 30 years in prison. But if the court finds him guilty on all 22 charges, his total sentence could be stacked into a prison term longer than a full human life. He has not entered a plea yet and is being held without bond as he waits for his next court date. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

BlackRock’s ETH Trust saw 23 straight days of inflows, signaling strong institutional demand. ETH price surged to a 12-day high but faces resistance at $2,700 amid signs of momentum exhaustion. Ethereum staking has reached a new milestone, as the total amount of ETH locked on the Beacon Chain climbed to an all-time high of 34.65 million on Sunday. The move coincides with ETH reclaiming a 12-day high of $2,700, sparking renewed interest in the network’s fundamentals. According to Beaconcha.in , staking levels had hovered above 33 million ETH for much of the past year but began to rise again in early June. BlackRock’s ETH Trust Sees 23-Day Inflow Streak The uptick comes amid growing institutional interest. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has now recorded 23 consecutive trading days without an outflow, signaling sustained demand. Meanwhile, the prospect of spot Ether ETFs incorporating staking components is gaining traction. ICYMI: Over $20 billion worth of ETH is staked via @LidoFinance . pic.twitter.com/ZKKq8FKJYZ — Token Terminal (@tokenterminal) June 9, 2025 A recent filing from REX Shares suggests that ETF products tied to staked ETH could enter the market within weeks, depending on regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Data from Dune Analytics and Ultrasound.Money corroborates the surge, with figures between 34.7 and 34.8 million ETH staked, amounting to nearly 29% of the total circulating supply. Higher staking levels are typically viewed as a signal of long-term conviction. Rather than selling, holders are opting to lock in yield, tightening liquid supply and potentially setting the stage for upward price pressure. Ethereum Hits Highest Level Since May ETH has gained over 8% in the past 24 hours, hitting its highest level since late May. As of now, Ethereum is trading at $2,673 after retreating slightly from an intraday high of $2,707. The short-term trend remains bullish, though momentum is showing early signs of exhaustion across key indicators. On the 2-hour chart, ETH tested resistance near $2,700 for the fourth time this month, failing to break above convincingly. The RSI is hovering near overbought levels (69), suggesting buyers may be running out of steam. MACD remains bullish but is flattening, which could hint at a near-term slowdown. Zooming into the 30-minute timeframe, ETH touched the upper Bollinger Band at $2,742 before pulling back. RSI briefly crossed 72, signaling short-term overheating. However, bullish MACD crossover remains intact, and price is holding above the mid-band near $2,673, offering a key support level. On the 1-minute chart, a sharper pullback was observed, with RSI dropping below 30, indicating a brief oversold condition. MACD also flipped bearish, reflecting short-term profit-taking after the recent surge. In summary, ETH’s bullish structure remains intact, but traders should monitor the $2,700 resistance and $2,660 support. A breakout above $2,707 could trigger the next leg higher, while failure to hold above $2,660 may invite deeper consolidation. With ETH staking at record levels and institutional inflows holding firm, attention now turns to whether the current rally can sustain — or if further catalysts are needed to break past resistance and retest higher ground.

In a new report in the San Francisco Chronicle, Tamim Ghulam Haidar, the former Wells Fargo Union City branch operations associate manager, is accused of putting less money into the bank’s ATMs than he reported and pocketing the difference for his own use. Haidar allegedly deposited the ill-gotten gains he is accused of “knowingly and intentionally” embezzling into his own bank accounts or those he controlled and used the funds to cover losses that “he incurred while trading in the foreign currency markets,” according to legal documents filed in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California. Haidar allegedly committed the crimes from February 2021 to October 2022. Prosecutors accuse Haidar of sometimes using other bank employees’ credentials to deposit cash in the ATM to “conceal the fact he was inputting false and inflated dollar amounts.” Haidar is charged with embezzlement by a bank employee and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He faces up to 30 years in federal prison. Prosecutors are also seeking to force Haidar to forfeit the money he allegedly stole.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,193.95 and a minimum price of $2,794.71. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $5,190.17 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

BNB/USDT shows domination between buyers The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 52.68 in the past 24 hours.

Binance Coin price analysis gives out a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has deteriorated to $660.9 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.81 percent of its value today. Technical indicators give out a bullish signal, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance and the price moved toward $660.9. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.81 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into June, BNB is trading approximately $666.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 07:15:00

Ethereum’s price has increased recently, particularly between June 9 and June 10, surging from around $2,400 to over $2,700. This uptick marks a significant rally for the cryptocurrency, continuing its bullish momentum after a brief dip.While Ethereum has experienced considerable volatility in recent months, Peter Brandt, a veteran technical analyst, believes the asset is now setting the stage for a potential breakout.A Potential Breakout in the MakingBrandt highlighted a potential turning point for Ethereum in a post on X. The accompanying chart highlighted how ETH has transitioned from a descending channel to a symmetrical triangle formation. According to Brandt’s analysis, Ethereum has been moving within a descending channel since December 2024, when its price peaked above $4,000. Throughout this period, price movements remained capped within the channel’s boundaries, with resistance at the upper end and support at the lower end. Notably, Ethereum's price tested key levels, including $3,700 in January and $1,390 in April.However, after breaking out of this channel in mid-April, Ethereum's price began to form the symmetrical triangle pattern, which typically signals consolidation before a breakout. In this pattern, Ethereum's price has been capped on both ends. On the downside, support has been tested multiple times, most recently on June 6 at $2,392. Meanwhile, resistance near the $2,700 mark has held firm several times since May.Moving Averages and Market SentimentEthereum’s 18-period moving average is trending upwards, signaling potential short-term bullish momentum. The moving average is currently acting as dynamic support, which may indicate an ongoing upward trend in the market. This aligns with the recent rally and provides further evidence that Ethereum may be gaining strength.On the other hand, the ADX (Average Directional Index) currently sits at 22.72, suggesting that the current trend remains weak. The ADX reading below 25 typically indicates a market consolidating rather than in a strong directional move. If Ethereum's price falls below the $2,150 support level, it could signal a bearish breakdown, potentially leading to further declines toward the long-term support below the $1,390 mark. However, Peter Brandt suggests that Ethereum may be on the verge of a breakout, remarking, ""Every dog has its day — woof woof ETH.” This suggests now could be Ethereum’s time to shine after vastly underperforming Bitcoin.On the upside, resistance is positioned just below the $4,000 mark. Should Ethereum continue its rally, it could surge by approximately 48.7%, moving from its current price of $2,689 to the $4,000 resistance level.Inflows Into Ethereum: A Strong Market SignalMeanwhile, the digital asset market has seen strong inflows, with Ethereum leading the pack. According to CoinShares data , digital asset investment products experienced $224 million in inflows last week, continuing a seven-week streak of positive growth. Notably, Ethereum accounted for the largest share of these inflows, with $296.4 million entering the market. This marks the seventh consecutive week of inflows for Ethereum, pushing the total to $1.5 billion over this period.In contrast, Bitcoin has seen outflows, with $56.5 million leaving the market. This shift in investor sentiment suggests that Ethereum is attracting more attention, further supporting the belief that the cryptocurrency could be positioning itself for a breakout.",Market|Ethereum Price Prediction|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-10 07:15:37

The warning came after a strange post appeared on his profile, claiming the country had made Bitcoin legal tender and was creating a $5 million Bitcoin reserve fund. The message, written in English, had a Spanish-language image attached that falsely appeared to be an official government notice. The government told the public to ignore anything coming from the account until further notice. Officials said they noticed “irregular activity” that showed signs of “unauthorized entry.” That same morning, the cybersecurity team in Paraguay began working with X’s security department to figure out who got in and how. Officials connect hack to wider crypto scam wave in Latin America According to Reuters , the timing of the breach tracks with a growing wave of crypto scams on social media. These types of frauds usually show up in the form of sponsored posts or fake official messages pushing people to invest. The hacker behind Peña’s account followed that same playbook. The story echoes what happened in Argentina earlier this year, when President Javier Milei promoted a token named Libra on his social media that collapsed almost immediately. That scandal blew up in his face and triggered public backlash, especially after critics accused him of helping to pump a worthless coin. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele actually did make Bitcoin legal in his country back in 2021 and launched tokenized bonds shortly after. But what happened in Paraguay this week wasn’t real policy—it was a digital trap planted by someone exploiting Peña’s account. This isn’t Paraguay’s first brush with hackers. In May, the communications ministry tracked at least 18 attacks on over a dozen public agencies, including the civil aviation regulator and justice ministry. Those hacks targeted email systems, cloud platforms, and login credentials, and no official link to Peña’s breach has been confirmed. As of now, Peña hasn’t made any public statements, and the fake post has been deleted. No arrests or leads have been announced.

According to Simon McLoughlin, the company has hired FT Partners , a top investment banking firm in the fintech sector, to explore strategic options. This move suggests that Uphold is actively evaluating pathways to scale its operations and market presence. Uphold Confirms IPO Talks and Buyer Interest In a recent interview , Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin confirmed that the firm has engaged FT Partners to assess its strategic future. One key direction being explored is a potential public listing. McLoughlin also noted that several leading financial players — including banks, brokers, and payment companies — have expressed interest in acquiring Uphold. However, he declined to comment on the company’s current valuation. Market speculation places it around $1.5 billion . IPO Timing Follows Circle’s Market Boom The timing of Uphold’s potential IPO comes shortly after Circle — a well-known peer-to-peer payments company — went public. Since its debut, Circle’s stock price has jumped from $31 to $115 , showcasing a massive 300% surge . This success appears to have reignited IPO enthusiasm across the crypto fintech space. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Just Made Bitcoin DeFi Possible on Cardano , From $80M to $300M: Uphold’s Strong Revenue Growth Uphold has been on a steady growth trajectory.

The company is also actively promoting XRP-related products , including a US debit card with XRP rewards and yield farming options through the Flare Network . One of its most notable recent collaborations is with a German bank , signaling its growing influence in both US and European markets. Nasdaq Listing Could Drive Acquisitions According to McLoughlin, a Nasdaq listing could provide Uphold with the financial muscle to acquire other companies in what he described as a consolidating crypto market. The strategy signals Uphold’s intent to expand its footprint through aggressive yet strategic moves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This crypto project is not just built on hype or inspired by the meme industry, Neo Pepe was built to be decentralized and a token going against the traditional financial systems and their market controls. As financial markets become more regulated, Neo Pepe offers a better option that is designed for transparency, community governance, and decentralization. As the market continues to anticipate new projects, Neo Pepe is positioned as another entry into the market but with more transformative potential that investors can relate to due to its focus on freedom and financial independence. Experts Can’t Be -More- Excited For This Presale Crypto experts are anticipating the strong narrative backing Neo Pepe’s economic mechanism. Investors see the project as an opportunity, with its token possessing the ability to resist centralized financial controls with profit-oriented features. Its scheduled token unlock ensures that the market circulation is balanced, reducing the risks associated with the launch of new tokens. In addition, its auto-liquidity mechanism assures investors that the value of the token can be sustained, making it the best choice of presale in 2025 for investors. Another attractive feature is the ability of the project to carry its community along in decisions through voting and governance. This allows quick adaptation that is in line with the project’s laid down guidelines in terms of its investors and community choices, a big difference from traditional digital assets. Encouraging Tokenomics at Foundation Neo Pepe’s tokenomics sets it apart in the crypto industry. The tokenomics was set up to accommodate its presale, which will take place in 16 phases, moving the price of the token from $0.05 to $0.16. The project is also aiming for fundraising to hit its target of $50 million. This approach was designed to ensure that the growth of the token is structured, helping it sustain its growth. Allocation Percentage (%) Purpose Presale 45% Community-driven token launch Marketing 25% Promotion, Partnerships, Outreach Development 10% Project Growth, Upgrades, Security Liquidity 10% Exchange Liquidity & Initiatives Ecosystem 5% Community Incentives & Initiatives Giveaways 5% Rewards, Events, Engagement After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. In addition, the token distribution shows that the project is following its purpose, allocating 45% of its supply to the presale, 25% to marketing, 10% to its platform development, another 10% to liquidity, and 5% each to ecosystem development and giveaways. This allocation move will ensure growth and support for its community and the development of its platform. Competitor Coins Run for Cover Allows token holders to make decisions through its governance framework, especially on listings and developments. Sets itself apart from tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by putting its community first and pushing decentralized governance. Stands out among presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), which lacks tools to carry its community along. Positioned as an asset with high potential due to its development model and direction. Avoids centralization risks faced by platforms like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) by allowing community contribution. Seamless Token Acquisition Steps Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Check your transaction details and confirm the transaction details. Safely store your tokens inside your wallet. Potential No Other Coin Can Replicate Neo Pepe is not just looking to be a participant in the crypto space, it wants to lead it. Using its tokenomics and community governance, Neo Pepe ensures its members are updated with the happenings, making it a market leader in the crypto market. Compared to traditional cryptocurrencies, the project’s presale structure and liquidity features position it at the front of the growing crypto market. Neo Pepe’s approach to unlocking its token and liquidity maintenance is different from the volatility experienced by some presales, providing investors with a stable investment, making it one of the best presales in the current market. Investors looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto market need to start looking into Neo Pepe ($NEOP), not because of its present appeal but for its promise of combining decentralization and investor empowerment. Crypto investors looking for early crypto projects to invest in are looking at Neo Pepe, with most of them confident in its role as a big player in the market in the coming years. With its presale stages defined and its governance model in place, Neo Pepe presents a blend of opportunity, community, and development for investors looking for them, presenting itself as the next digital asset to look forward to in the market.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 07:19:00

Ethereum Community Conference (ETHCC) will welcome more than 6,400 attendees, 390 speakers, and 64 sponsors and will include 580 side events. Confirmed notable names include Vitalik Buterin, Stani Kulechov, Charles Guillemet, Robinhood’s crypto team, and many more. Additionally, the Mayor of Cannes, David Lisnard, will do a keynote on why France should be adopting blockchain. As the event approaches, Cryptonews sat down for a chat about what to expect with Bettina Boon Falleur, Head Organiser of EthCC, and Jerome de Tychey, President of Ethereum France and co-founder of EthCC. How has EthCC evolved since its inception? Jerome de Tychey: It’s been incredible to see how far EthCC has come. What started as a small community meetup has grown into the largest Ethereum-focused event in Europe. Last year alone, we welcomed over 6,400 attendees and more than 350 speakers—an enormous leap from just a few hundred in the early days. Say hello to more EthCC[8] speakers!

The content has evolved alongside the ecosystem, with dedicated tracks now spanning zero-knowledge proofs , Layer 2s , public goods, crypto policy, and more. We’ve also launched programs like EthVC to connect builders with investors, and expanded support services such as childcare and quiet workspaces to make the event more accessible and inclusive. Two things have not changed, however: we still personally select every speaker to maintain the quality of content, and yes, that means turning down well-funded applicants if they don’t meet the bar. And we continue to believe deeply in the power of in-person gatherings to spark collaboration and move the space forward. CN: What themes or initiatives will we see at EthCC[8] that reflect how the Ethereum ecosystem itself is evolving? Bettina Boon: Each year, the themes at EthCC evolve in step with the Ethereum ecosystem itself. In 2025, we’re excited to introduce new tracks and initiatives that reflect where the space is headed. We’re seeing growing engagement from fintech players as integration with Ethereum deepens, so expect more voices from that world on stage this year as well as dedicated programming at the intersection of AI and blockchain, as these two technologies begin to converge in real-world applications. And with adoption top of mind, we’re launching a new track focused on product and marketing, two critical areas for translating great technology into tools that people actually use. CN: How are you balancing EthCC’s growth with staying true to Ethereum’s core values? JdT: As EthCC grows, we’re deeply committed to maintaining the openness and community-driven spirit that defines Ethereum. [As mentioned,] every speaker application is evaluated on the merit of the topic, not the brand name or prominence of the individual. Our goal is to create a platform where diverse voices from across the ecosystem, whether they’re working on core infrastructure, public goods, privacy, or new financial models, can be heard. Growth doesn’t mean centralization; it means widening the tent while staying rooted in Ethereum’s values of inclusivity, innovation, and decentralization.

BB: Events like EthCC[8] play a crucial role in fostering meaningful dialogue between regulators and the Ethereum community. Europe has taken a global lead with frameworks like MiCA, and each year we host more regulatory voices to explore how policy can evolve alongside technology. CN: Why do so many regulators choose to attend this specific conference? BB: Last year marked our largest presence of regulators yet, and we expect even more this year. What sets EthCC apart is that it’s a developer-first, technical conference that gives policymakers a rare opportunity to engage directly with the builders shaping the infrastructure they’re looking to regulate. We believe that the only way to create effective, future-ready regulation is through hands-on understanding. EthCC provides that bridge. CN: Cannes will host the conference for the first time this year. Is there a specific reason for choosing Cannes, especially given the size of the conference? JdT: Cannes offers the ideal setting for EthCC’s next chapter. The Palais des Festivals gives us the space and infrastructure to welcome a growing audience, while the city itself, ranked the best event city in 2024, hosts over 240 conferences annually, proving its strength as a global hub for innovation.

Take a look and familiarise yourself with all of the amazing things this area has to offer: https://t.co/fPz9VflUBY — EthCC – Ethereum Community Conference (@EthCC) June 8, 2025 It’s also a highly walkable and secure city, with over 1,000 surveillance cameras and strong coordination between local authorities and event organizers to ensure safety. CN: Mayor Lisnard will do a keynote as well. Does this indicate general support from the city? JdT: The support from the local government has been remarkable. Cannes’ mayor is actively pro-crypto, and the city has embraced digital assets, with over 30% of shops now accepting crypto payments. Choosing Cannes is more than just a logistical upgrade. It’s also symbolic. Hosting EthCC[8] at the same iconic venue as the Lions, MIPIM, and MIPCOM signals that Ethereum, 10 years on, has earned its place on the world stage. CN: Lastly, what about the community itself – how is it changing? We hear there is a significant addition coming to EthCC. BB: On the community front, we’re also welcoming the next generation, quite literally. As the ecosystem matures, so do its builders, and we’re proud to offer a nursery and childcare options to support parents attending the conference.

UK to collect specific crypto user and transaction data starting next year The UK government will require crypto companies operating in the country to collect user and transaction information from 1 January 2026. The HM Revenue & Customs announced last week that the UK government’s data collection plan will follow the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF). The HMRC also said crypto firms may start collecting information earlier to be ready when the new rules come into force. For individual users, the required data will include the user’s name, date of birth, home address, country of residence, National Insurance number or Unique Taxpayer Reference (for UK residents), and the tax identification number (TIN) along with the country where it was issued (for non-UK residents). For entity users, companies must collect the legal business name, main business address, registration number (for UK firms), and the TIN and issuing country (for non-UK firms). In some cases, platforms must also gather details of the company’s controlling persons. Firms must also report sender and recipient names, addresses, tax IDs & full trade details (token type, quantity, GBP value, & timestamp). Failure to provide accurate, complete, or verified reports could result in penalties of up to £300 per user.

But as the initial hype surrounding Dogecoin fizzles out, investors are beginning to shift their focus toward tokens with real-world utility. Enter Ruvi AI , a blockchain-based project that combines artificial intelligence with the power of utility, making it a top contender for smart money investors. With over $1.6 million raised , more than 140 million tokens sold , and its price currently at just $0.015 per token in Phase 2 of its presale, Ruvi AI is emerging as a practical, scalable, and utility-driven alternative to Dogecoin. Dogecoin’s Hype vs. Ruvi AI’s Utility Dogecoin became a phenomenon, largely fueled by its meme-based identity and high-profile endorsements. While it has remained popular, Dogecoin lacks the critical factor that turns cryptocurrency from an asset into a solution: utility . Its value is heavily reliant on social media trends and speculative trading, making it volatile and less appealing to long-term, ROI-focused investors. Ruvi AI, in contrast, is built with a purpose. By leveraging artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, it is designed to solve real-world problems across key industries such as healthcare , logistics , and finance . Its focus on tangible applications makes Ruvi AI a more compelling choice for those seeking sustainable growth and meaningful impact. Presale Performance Shows Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale success is a testament to growing investor confidence. With over $1.6 million raised and 140 million tokens sold , it has already captured significant interest ahead of its public listing. Currently priced at a modest $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI offers an accessible entry point for investors. Unlike Dogecoin’s hype-driven value, Ruvi AI’s $0.07 valuation post-presale is a pre-determined feature, providing clarity and transparency. Additionally, analysts predict the token could reach $1 after listing , delivering substantial returns for early participants. Real-World Applications Propel Ruvi AI’s Growth Ruvi AI’s utility lies in its ability to address pressing challenges across major industries: Healthcare : By integrating AI, Ruvi AI aims to revolutionize patient care, improving diagnostics and streamlining operations. Logistics : From optimizing supply chain processes to reducing costs, Ruvi AI’s blockchain technology improves operational efficiency. Finance : With tools for fraud detection and highly secure transactions, Ruvi AI offers innovative solutions for the financial industry. These applications showcase Ruvi AI’s scalability and long-term potential, traits that are crucial for investors looking beyond short-term gains. The WEEX Partnership Boosts Credibility Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange marks an important milestone in its roadmap. This collaboration enhances the project’s accessibility, making it easier for a global audience to invest and trade. For investors, such strategic alliances are proof of Ruvi AI’s credibility and serious approach to building a sustainable future in the crypto market. VIP Investment Tiers Deliver Exceptional ROI Ruvi AI’s VIP investment tiers offer attractive bonuses, rewarding early adopters with significant returns. Here’s how these tiers look: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These structured tiers reflect a transparent and reliable path for investors aiming to maximize their ROI. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out for Investors Dogecoin may have ridden the wave of hype, but Ruvi AI is proving why utility is key to long-term success. With its strong presale performance, real-world applications, and strategic partnerships, Ruvi AI is becoming the smart money’s pick for those seeking high returns. Its focus on solving real problems, combined with its scalability, positions it as a standout investment for the future. For those looking to move beyond hype-driven tokens and into a project with lasting value, now may be the perfect time to join Ruvi AI’s promising journey.

However, projections from several crypto analytics platforms suggest that its future value could be significantly higher, depending on the token’s long-term trajectory. Current market data and predictions for 2040 and 2050 indicate that SHIB could see moderate gains or astronomical growth. Such forecasts remain speculative and depend on numerous evolving factors, though. At Shib’s current price, a $1,000 investment would purchase approximately 78,369,905 SHIB tokens. Recent market developments, including a brief but sharp drop in SHIB’s price below $0.000012, were attributed to heightened volatility caused by a dispute between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. However, the broader crypto market recovered quickly, and SHIB regained value, hovering around the $0.00001276 mark. This quick rebound has renewed interest in SHIB’s long-term potential . Investors are increasingly interested in projections for the coming decades, particularly for 2040 and 2050, to evaluate what a low-cost investment today could be worth in the distant future. Projected Value of $1,000 in SHIB by 2040 Two key sources — Changelly and Telegaon — have published different sets of price forecasts for SHIB by 2040. According to Changelly , SHIB may reach a minimum of $0.020 and a maximum of $0.023 by 2040. If those targets are met, the current $1,000 investment could be worth between $1,567,000 and $1,802,280, assuming the token supply remains constant and the holder retains the original 78.36 million tokens. Telegaon provides a more optimistic outlook, projecting that SHIB could start the year 2040 at $0.054 and climb as high as $0.089. Under this scenario, the value of a $1,000 investment would surge to between $4.23 million and $6.97 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 2050 Price Estimates For 2050, Changelly estimates a potential trading range of $0.029 to $0.033. If those targets are achieved, the same $1,000 investment in SHIB would be valued at between $2.27 million and $2.58 million. Telegaon, however, sets a far more ambitious target. Their analysts believe SHIB could be worth between $0.62 and $1.06 in 2050. At those price points, the original 78.36 million SHIB tokens could yield a portfolio value between $48.59 million and $83.07 million. Is It Realistic? These projections vary significantly, raising the question about feasibility. For instance, reaching Telegaon’s maximum target of $1.06 would require an unprecedented 8,307,110% increase in price. Additionally, this would result in a market capitalization of $624.87 trillion, far exceeding the total market cap of all global assets combined, assuming SHIB’s supply stays around 589.5 trillion tokens. Given these figures, it is important to approach these forecasts with caution. While some growth is possible, achieving such extreme targets is statistically unlikely. As with any speculative asset, investors should consider the risks and avoid relying on long-term projections as the basis for financial decisions.

During a June 10 press conference , lawmaker Min Byeong-deok announced the bill’s submission, calling it a foundational step toward comprehensive regulation of digital assets, including stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and related service providers. Min said the legislation was designed to enhance transparency and investor protection while positioning South Korea as a global leader in the digital economy. The Digital Asset Basic Act builds on the existing Virtual Asset Investor Protection Act, which came into effect in July 2024. While the previous legislation focused primarily on safeguarding investors, the new proposal outlines a broader framework that defines digital assets, establishes new licensing and approval systems, and mandates oversight mechanisms under the Financial Services Commission. A key feature of the bill is the licensing requirement for issuers of Korean won-backed stablecoins. Notably, issuers must maintain a minimum capital of ₩500 million (approximately $367,890) and obtain approval from the Financial Services Commission. You might also like: Meet the new South Korea president Lee Jae-myung, what is his stance on crypto? Additionally, they must implement safeguards such as bankruptcy remoteness and reserve management to ensure user redemption rights even if the stablecoin issuer becomes insolvent. Furthermore, the regulations lay the groundwork for regulating all digital asset issuances and trading activities. It includes provisions to establish a Digital Asset Committee under the President’s office to coordinate national digital asset policy. Meanwhile, a separate entity dubbed the Digital Asset Industry Association would be tasked with monitoring market practices and evaluating the eligibility of tokens for exchange listings through dedicated subcommittees. To address market misconduct, the bill grants the Financial Services Commission investigative authority and empowers it to impose penalties for unfair trading activities. It also introduces approval, registration, and reporting requirements for companies operating in the digital asset sector. The introduction of the Digital Asset Basic Act comes just days after President Lee Jae-myung’s inauguration on June 4. Lee, who won the presidency with over 49% of the vote, had campaigned on a platform that included strong support for digital asset adoption and regulatory clarity. His campaign proposals included legalizing spot crypto ETFs, expanding institutional access to digital assets, and enabling the nation’s pension fund to allocate capital into crypto markets. Min Byeong-deok, who led the party’s digital asset committee during Lee’s campaign, has advocated for broader crypto regulation but has placed particular emphasis on the urgency of launching a domestic stablecoin framework to counter U.S. dollar-backed tokens like USDC and USDT.

The fund is intended to include the INJ token and allow staking and generating passive income. Canary Capital registered a Delaware company in advance of applying for an Injective (INJ) ETF. The entity has been filed under the number 10221067, under the name ‘Canary staked INJ ETF.’ The Injective team also announced the possibility for an ETF filing in the near future. BREAKING: CANARY STAKED $INJ ETF REGISTERED IN DELAWARE 🚨 — Injective 🥷 (@injective) June 9, 2025 The creation of a trust in Delaware precedes additional filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, starting the discussion and waiting period until the ETF is approved. The fund will initially be tailored to US-based investors. INJ is also among the tokens known as ‘Made in USA’, based on the team’s main location and US-based fundraising. INJ is already gaining mainstream exposure from the European markets, where 21Shares launched an ETP. The product also offers proceeds from staking. ETPs are sometimes easier to launch, though funds still attempt to build full ETFs for greater exposure and higher liquidity. Altcoin ETFs are still relatively few, as most of the buyers accumulate BTC or ETH. Canary Capital has been known for attempting a long list of ETFs for older, well-established altcoins, which may shine if given new attention. The investment fund has proposed ETFs for TRON, Litecoin, Hedera, Sui, Axelar, and even Pengu. The investment company aims for expansion, where most of the new ETF filings focus on Solana and XRP. Injective may bring traditional finance to DeFi The attempt to create an ETF based on Injective will potentially invite mainstream investments into the DeFi space. Injective has been one of the most active chains, claiming to be built specifically for scalable decentralized finance. In the past few months, Injective increased its daily active users, up to 48K daily. Injective’s user base expanded in the last two months, as DeFi regained the interest of investors. | Source: Token Terminal The chain still pays out incentives to its validators, while generating around $40K in daily fees. Currently, Injective has negative daily earnings of over $1M, mostly due to incentives. However, INJ is not inflationary, and has a total supply of 100M tokens, with around 97M in circulation. The attention for a wider selection of crypto assets suggests this cycle has not abandoned altcoins and tokens, but may continue to boost liquidity. Currently, Injective locks in $28.86M in total value, lagging behind other L1s. The platform is just building up its DeFi liquidity, tapping increased demand for lending and DEX swaps. Following the news of a potential ETF, INJ tokens expanded by 4.7% up to $13.56. INJ has rallied up to $40, and is considered undervalued compared to other L1 tokens. INJ open interest is near its higher range for the past three months, recovering to $68M. The overall consensus is that INJ lags due to the slow altcoin season, but may hold the potential for a higher price range and wider adoption. INJ tokens are 100% unlocked, expecting no shocks of increased circulation. Staking also takes INJ off the market. INJ is listed on Binance, though most of its volumes are currently on DigiFinex.

The move comes after a brief rejection near the $2.3278 mark, which has emerged as a near-term resistance zone. While the broader market has stabilized, XRP price volatility is beginning to pick up again as bulls and bears battle near key short-term trendlines. What’s Happening With XRP’s Price? XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The XRP price action has recently formed a tightening range following a breakout from a lower consolidation wedge. On the 30-minute chart, XRP has bounced off the Ichimoku cloud base at $2.2894, showing early signs of defending this structural support. The cloud is beginning to flatten, signaling a potential pause in momentum, while the Tenkan-Sen and Kijun-Sen lines remain tightly compressed — a setup often preceding a breakout move. Stochastic RSI is deep in the oversold zone at 4.84/1.91, indicating a potential bullish reversal if price holds above the cloud.

Phase 6 is now live at $6 per token, and the next major step is a centralized exchange listing projected at $20 — a 233% increase for current participants. What stands out isn’t the jump alone. It’s the framework supporting it. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t launching on paper. It’s backed by active audits, functioning mechanics, and a sharply defined 21 million token cap. That’s what’s drawing capital — not influencers, not empty ads, but protocol-level logic. What Powers This Demand? Every strong presale has a reason it doesn’t need to push marketing gimmicks. For Bitcoin Solaris, that reason is structural. The token isn’t diluted by staking inflation or burdened with team-controlled emissions. Only 4.2 million BTC-S have been designated for presale across all phases: there is no secret allocation, and no dev wallet minting event waiting down the line. The blockchain itself operates on a hybrid architecture: a base consensus layer combining Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity, paired with a high-throughput Solaris Layer running Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. Together, this system clears over 10,000 transactions per second with a finality time of two seconds — all while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. Audited. Verified. Positioned. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have completed independent audits of the protocol and mobile infrastructure. Smart contracts, consensus logic, and application data have been tested for both security and performance compliance. Cyberscope Audit PDF Freshcoins Audit PDF KYC Verification This level of pre-launch transparency isn’t typical — and it’s exactly why capital is flowing. The protocol doesn’t rely on trust. It shows its work. Analyst Attention Is Already Here Ben Crypto , a known figure in crypto forecasting, recently spotlighted Bitcoin Solaris in a full analysis, citing its scarcity mechanics and audit-backed infrastructure as reasons the token could easily cross $100 within 24 months. That analysis is based on a functioning ecosystem with working code, a defined user base, and a presale designed to reward early participants — not trap them in vesting cliffs or delayed unlocks. $6 Entry Is Still Open Bitcoin Solaris is still in Phase 6 of its presale. BTC-S tokens are available at $6 for a limited window before the project moves to centralized listing and public exposure. With benchmarks set for $20 upon launch, the entry spread is what’s driving urgency. Investors aren’t waiting on marketing events or big promises. They’re entering a network where functionality is live, and the multiplier is locked in by math — not guesswork.

Bitcoin Has Seen A Spike In Exchange Inflows Recently In a new post on X, the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has talked about the latest trend in the Exchange Netflow for Bitcoin. The Exchange Netflow is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the net amount of the asset that’s moving into or out of the wallets associated with all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchange inflows outweigh the exchange outflows. As one of the main reasons why investors would deposit their coins to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish impact on the asset’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin & Ethereum Diverge—ETF Flows Just Flipped The Narrative On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark suggests the holders are taking out a net number of tokens from exchanges. Such a trend can be a sign that the investors are accumulating, which can naturally prove to be bullish for the cryptocurrency. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow since the start of the month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has recently mostly been contained in the negative territory, but the latest value (yesterday’s) has been positive. In total, the investors have deposited a net $262.75 million of the asset to the exchange-connected wallets with this inflow spike. According to the analytics firm, this marks the first day of significant deposits since May 27th. As mentioned before, exchange inflows are something that can turn out to be bearish for the coin’s value. So far, however, the opposite has happened for Bitcoin, as its price has soared instead. This could indicate that even if there are some large holders looking to sell with these deposits, enough demand has surfaced at the same time that BTC has not only been able to ride out this wave of potential selling pressure, but actually add to its recovery.

Generally, large liquidations end up providing fuel to the price move that caused them, so in this case, it’s possible the short squeeze may have provided support to the Bitcoin rally. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,900, up over 3% in the last seven days.

The crypto market overall is holding a solid $3.38 trillion valuation. But as investors gear up for the next big Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, many are starting to temper their expectations, especially when it comes to interest rate cuts. No FED Rate Cuts—At Least Not Yet For months, traders expected the Fed to begin cutting rates by summer. But recent job data changed the mood. Hiring remains strong, and inflation is still running above the Fed’s comfort level. That gives the central bank little reason to ease up on its current policy. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows a 99.9% chance the Fed will keep rates steady in June, with just a 0.1% chance of a 25 basis point cut. Looking to July, the odds of a rate cut sit at just 14.5%. Back in May, those chances were much higher, showing how much sentiment has shifted in just a few weeks. Trump, ECB Push for Cuts—but Fed Holds Its Ground The pressure is building on the Fed. The European Central Bank just cut its interest rates by 25 basis points. And Donald Trump is calling for a much more aggressive 100 bps rate cut in the U.S., saying it would be “rocket fuel” for the economy. He’s also criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell and hinted that Kevin Warsh could replace him. Still, the Fed remains cautious. Officials are watching how tariffs and inflation will affect the economy before making any big moves. So for now, it looks like interest rates will stay between 425–450 basis points for the foreseeable future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , How Crypto Is Reacting Crypto markets are in a bit of a mixed mood. Bitcoin and Gold are showing strength, and some traders are shifting out of the U.S. dollar into riskier assets like crypto. According to Sergei Gorev from Youhodler , this trend is helping keep Bitcoin’s price elevated. But not all signs are bullish. Gorev also points out that Bitcoin’s chart is showing a potential “Head and Shoulders” pattern, which, if it plays out, could pull prices down to around $92,000. With the FOMC meeting coming up and inflation data on the way, the crypto market is walking a fine line between optimism and caution. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The announcement was made by Cardano ( ADA ) founder Charles Hoskinson on June 9 via X. Developed by Input Output, the research and development team behind Cardano, Cardinal allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders to access DeFi services such as lending, staking, and borrowing without using traditional custodians or centralized bridges. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 Cardinal functions by wrapping Bitcoin, particularly its unspent transaction outputs. UTXOs are bits of Bitcoin that have been left over from transactions and are used to represent ownership. They are converted into wrapped tokens by the protocol, which maintains a 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. Users can redeem their wrapped BTC at any time through a secure, fraud-resistant process. What makes Cardinal different from typical wrapped Bitcoin solutions is its trust-minimized structure. Instead of depending on a central custodian or federated system, Cardinal uses MuSig2, a cryptographic system that allows multiple parties to sign transactions together. This ensures that the original Bitcoin stays locked on its native chain and that the system functions securely, even if only one participant is honest. You might also like: Brave Wallet expands support with Cardano integration Another key feature is Cardinal’s approach to rehypothecation. In traditional finance and some crypto systems, rehypothecation allows custodians to reuse user assets, often without full transparency. Cardinal avoids this by allowing users complete control over their assets while preserving the original Bitcoin. In addition, the protocol makes use of BitVMX, an off-chain execution system that maintains decentralization while enabling complex Bitcoin operations. This configuration facilitates safe, easy asset transfers between the two networks when paired with Cardano smart contracts and Bitcoin’s built-in scripting capabilities. The project was showcased during a live demo at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where IO performed a bridgeless BTC-to-Cardano transfer using BitVMX. The event marked a major step in Cardano’s efforts to become a platform for Bitcoin-native applications. Despite recent progress, Cardano’s DeFi total value locked has declined, from peak of $415 million in May to around $334 million by June 10, as per DefiLlama data . The team hopes Cardinal will help bring in new liquidity by offering Bitcoin holders more ways to use their assets within a DeFi environment, without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Lee, a progressive leader who narrowly defeated his conservative opponent in last week’s presidential election, had made stablecoin regulation one of his biggest talking points in his campaign. He argues that allowing regulated issuance of asset-backed digital tokens will boost transparency, expand the domestic crypto sector, and place South Korea ahead of several countries in matters of digital finance. The legislation was submitted to parliament on Tuesday, with provisions that could see South Korean firms issue stablecoins if they meet a minimum equity capital requirement of 500 million won, equivalent to about $367,876. These issuers would also be required to carry sufficient reserves to guarantee refunds and security of customer funds. Post-election South Korea: Crypto regulatory clarity South Korea is recognized as one of the most active crypto markets globally. Upbit, the top exchange in the Asian nation by trading volume, has a daily average of $1.5 billion trades. Of an estimated 18 million South Koreans, roughly one-third of the population, are digital asset traders. Daily volumes on local exchanges often exceed those on the nation’s major stock indexes, the Kospi and Kosdaq. Just as in the US, where Congress is set to vote on its own stablecoin bill this week, South Korea’s proposed legislation mandates that all asset-linked digital currencies, including stablecoins, must receive approval from the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the country’s top financial regulator. According to Bank of Korea data cited by Yonhap News, transactions involving major stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, and USDS on five domestic exchanges totaled 57 trillion won in the first quarter alone . Despite the enthusiasm surrounding stablecoins, Lee’s initiative is facing institutional pushback, specifically from the country’s central bank. Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong believes stablecoins issued by nonbank entities will have monetary implications for South Korea’s monetary policies. “These instruments, if allowed outside regulated institutions, could serve as vehicles for capital regulation arbitrage,” Rhee told reporters in a press conference in May. The governor wants BOK to take responsibility for any won-pegged stablecoin, insisting that Korea should not take capital flow risks “lightly.” “Financial stability concerns demand that we consider capital controls more thoroughly before allowing non-bank entities into the payments sector. This concern is shared by other Asian economies as well,” he concluded. Financial markets respond to legislation proposal After news of Lee’s stablecoin proposal was published on several outlets, shares of financial services firm KakaoPay Corp. surged as much as 18% on Tuesday, its highest daily gain since January 2024. The period also boded well for the broader KOSPI index, which closed at 2,882, a gain of 26 points, or 0.92%, from the previous session. Over the past four weeks, the index is up 10.53%. However, not all observers are convinced that the policy shift will translate into tangible corporate gains. In a client note, JPMorgan analysts Stanley Yang and Jihyun Cho were far less confident about the rally in Kakao-affiliated stocks. “ The rally in Kakao-related shares is fundamentally unjustifiable, as any concrete benefit from Lee’s stablecoin policy remains uncertain ,” they wrote. Fears from the collapse of TerraUSD, a South Korean-created algorithmic stablecoin that failed in 2022, are also still clouding the chances of crypto firms to succeed in the country. The implosion erased $40 billion in value and is a painful memory for many South Korean investors. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin could reach $1 million within a decade as trust in fiat declines. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the influential book Rich Dad Poor Dad , has issued a stark warning about rising unrest in the United States, drawing connections between violent incidents and deeper economic turmoil. In a recent post on X , Kiyosaki declared, “Civil War has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence… I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot violent summer.” The statement comes amid growing political division and economic instability. Kiyosaki Links U.S. Unrest to ‘Fourth Turning’ Crisis Cycle Kiyosaki tied the unrest to what historians William Strauss and Neil Howe have described as the “fourth turning,” a cyclical period of crisis that reshapes the fabric of society. Previous fourth turnings, according to the theory, include the Great Depression and World War II, the Civil War, and the American Revolution. Kiyosaki suggests that the current upheaval will be driven by public backlash against central banking practices, especially the sustained printing of money and inflationary policies. He argues that these policies erode public wealth, framing them as a form of institutional theft. “The issue is our bankers are stealing the wealth of the people via fake money, counterfeit money the central bankers print,” he wrote. He added that this era is ending, and that people should turn to alternative stores of value. As a solution, Kiyosaki is urging individuals to protect their financial futures by investing in hard assets. “Sound money, gold, silver, and Bitcoin take away the power from the corrupt bankers,” he noted. He describes gold and silver as “God’s money” and Bitcoin as “people’s money.” CIVIL WAR has begun. ICE raids in Los Angeles erupt into mass violence. BIG QUESTION: Will it spread? MY ANSWER: I believe we and the world are in for a long, hot, violent summer. This turmoil is described in the FOURTH TURNING by Strauss and Howe, who posit that society… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 9, 2025 Kiyosaki’s latest comments reinforce his long-standing belief that traditional financial systems are broken. Amid warnings of prolonged violence and social disruption, he advocates for individual financial sovereignty, calling on followers to “become your own bank” and stop saving “fake money.” Kiyosaki Sees $1M Bitcoin by Next Decade A longtime advocate of hard assets, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as a modern hedge against inflation and a tool for preserving wealth over time. In his latest prediction , Kiyosaki said he “strongly believes” the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year. Over the next decade, he sees BTC at $1 million, gold at $30,000 per ounce, and silver at $3,000. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Likewise, crypto analyst Scott Melker has said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure.

The upward trend reflects growing investor confidence in digital assets, particularly among publicly traded firms seeking to leverage Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset. Leading the day’s movement was Nasdaq’s recent entrant, Circle Internet Group (CRCL), which jumped 7% and rose another 2.2% in after-hours trading, closing at $117.79. Major crypto miners followed suit. Core Scientific Inc. (CORZ) rose 4.27%, with a slight 0.87% bump after market close. Competitors CleanSpark Inc. (CLSK) and MARA Holdings Inc. (MARA) each climbed over 3%, with both stocks ticking up another 1% in after-hours activity. Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT) also added 2.74% during the day, followed by a 1.2% increase after-hours. These gains coincided with Bitcoin’s own 4% surge to $110,150, edging closer to its record high of $112,000 set on May 22. Market sentiment appeared to improve amid reports of U.S.–China trade discussions held in the UK. Mixed Results for Trading Platforms’ Stocks Not all crypto-related stocks enjoyed Monday’s rally. Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) was among the few laggards, falling nearly 2% to $73.40 after being left out of the S&P 500 index during its latest rebalancing. The omission came as a disappointment to investors who had speculated on Robinhood’s inclusion, a move that often brings a boost in share price due to increased institutional interest. In contrast, rival trading platform eToro Group Ltd. (ETOR), which recently went public , surged 10.5% and climbed another 2.4% after hours to $77.79. American crypto exchange giant Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) posted a modest 2% gain to $256.63, reflecting steady investor support amid the broader market uptrend. Bitcoin Holdings Fuel Investor Confidence Several public firms continue to embrace Bitcoin as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR), already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, gained 4.71% and added over 1% in after-hours trading to reach $396.61. Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (BMNR) became the latest firm to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, announcing the purchase of 100 BTC following an $18 million share offering. Despite the news, BMNR fell 8.7% before slightly rebounding by 5.2% after hours to $7.25. Energy tech company KULR Technology Group Inc. (KULR) also made headlines after announcing it had purchased another $13 million in Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to 920 BTC at an average price of $98,760 per coin. Its stocks responded positively, climbing 4.2% on the day.

Attorney Bill Morgan took to social media and criticised VanEck for playing both sides. Morgan brought to attention VanEck’s inconsistency as they pushed for fairness in ETFs, but chose to remain silent for XRP when it was in a similar situation. Don’t recall you complaining about SEC favoritism when Ripple was sued over XRP sales and Ethereum received a free pass. https://t.co/h8CJ2qk9Yt — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 9, 2025 For the unversed, asset managers like VanEck, Canary Capital, and 21Shares signed a joint letter to the SEC Chair Paul Atkins, urging a fair and consistent process for approving crypto ETFs. Bill Morgan Slams VanEck’s Silence on XRP Case They requested the SEC to adopt a fair “first-to-file, first-to-approve” rule for crypto ETFs explaining that favoritism damages innovation in the ETF market. This came after long delays and growing uncertainty around spot ETF approvals. But Morgan slammed VanEck for staying silent during the Ripple lawsuit. Morgan wrote on X, “Don’t recall you complaining about SEC favoritism when Ripple was sued over XRP sales and Ethereum received a free pass.” XRP faced legal actions, while Ethereum walked away clean when it was called a non-security by SEC official William Hinman in a 2018 speech. Key Court Deadline Could Trigger Major Moves This has raised concerns over conflicts of interest at the SEC. Critics like John Deaton have also questioned how credible Hinman’s speech actually was and whether the SEC is being fair and transparent with its crypto rules. These comments come as the crypto community anxiously awaits for updates on a likely settlement between the Ripple vs SEC. A key deadline for the SEC to report to the Appeals Court is coming up on June 16. XRP Holding $2.29, Can Bulls Push Toward ATH? XRP is up 2.7% in the last 24 hours, and is currently trading at $2.29. The next move will now depend on updates from the Ripple case and spot ETF news. A breakout above $2.35 could push XRP to $2.50, then $2.65, and possibly $3 or even its all-time high of $3.55. But if it drops below the 50-day EMA, bears could drag it down to $1.93.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 08:19:01
