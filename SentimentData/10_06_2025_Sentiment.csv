Bitcoin pulled back nearly 4 percent within hours, dragging other assets lower. Yet by Thursday, a rebound in stablecoin liquidity began stabilizing markets, sparking renewed interest in top cryptos for massive growth. The improved volume in major pairs highlighted shifting sentiment toward selective buying rather than blanket selling. In this market, Qubetics gained particular attention because of its soaring presale. At the same time, Aave triggered the launch of its Umbrella security protocol, which introduced an auto‑deficit coverage mechanism and boosted staking yields, particularly for stablecoins, enhancing appeal among top cryptos for massive growth. This led to a 6 percent uptick in AAVE’s daily trading price, signaling renewed confidence in its underlying DeFi utility. Cardano also retained a key support level between $0.58 and $0.61 aligned with its 0.786 Fibonacci retracement. Analysts spotlighted Cardano among the top cryptos for massive growth as stability returned to its chart pattern. Meanwhile, Qubetics ($TICS) is garnering community momentum in its 37th presale stage. Qubetics: Decentralized VPN Brings Real‑World Utility Amid Presale Surge Qubetics ($TICS) aims to solve VPN Centralization issues by delivering a decentralized network with privacy, reliability, and superior speeds. With the 37th presale stage underway, only 10 million $TICS tokens remain at $0.3370. That scarcity, combined with a slashed total supply of 1.36 billion and a 38.55 percent public allocation, positions it uniquely among top cryptos for massive growth. The Qubetics presale has entered its 37th stage. Over 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 27,700 holders, raising upwards of $17.8 million so far. During this stage, $TICS tokens are available for purchase at $0.3370. Analysts project potential prices of $10–15 after the mainnet launch. Early crypto presale participants might enjoy a 20 percent return from a $0.40 listing price. A hypothetical $ 15,000 allocation today could yield significant ROI if analyst forecasts materialize. The decentralized VPN offers advantages for businesses, professionals, and consumers: Privacy Maintenance: Elimination of centralized logs safeguards user data. Professional Accessibility: Secure remote access for distributed workforces. Enterprise Resilience: Redundant node connectivity reduces service disruptions. Consumer Ease: Streamlined, user‑managed encryption in a no‑log system. Qubetics positions itself to fill gaps left by traditional VPN providers. It promises an ecosystem where community governance and scarcity amplify value. It’s an emerging standout among top cryptos for massive growth. Investment Scenario: Calculated Entry with High-Return Potential Qubetics offers a compelling investment narrative for strategic crypto buyers: Stage 37 Entry (Price: $0.3370) If a buyer commits $1,000, they receive approximately 2,966 TICS tokens. Upon listing at $0.40, this translates to a 20% instant paper profit of $1,186. Mid-Term Projection Should Qubetics reach the projected mid-range valuation of $5 per token, that same $1,000 investment could grow to $14,830, marking a 1,383% return. Long-Term Upside If Qubetics meets bullish projections of $10–$15, the same tokens could be worth between $29,660 and $44,490, yielding a potential ROI of up to 4,349%. Such upside potential and growing demand for decentralized privacy infrastructure make Qubetics stand out among 2025’s emerging crypto opportunities. Aave (AAVE): Umbrella Protocol Elevates DeFi Confidence Aave strengthened its position in decentralized finance with the deployment of the Umbrella security layer. Integrating auto‑deficit coverage and a revamped staking interface, the feature allocates staked aTokens and GHO toward protocol deficits—shielding stakeholders from systemic risk. Asset TVL reached $36.8 million, with ETH comprising $17.5 million. USDC and USDT yielded 11.0 percent and 10.9 percent respectively, while ETH/WETH earned 6.05 percent, and GHO returned 5.47 percent. AAVE’s price climbed 1.99 percent to $258.14, with a market cap of $3.91 billion. Although trading volume dipped 54 percent to $215.8 million, the narrative around improved security and yield layers positions Aave among top cryptos for massive growth. The protocol’s innovation enhances confidence among liquidity providers and supports long‑term DeFi adoption. As decentralized finance continues expanding into traditional finance models, Aave’s Umbrella rollout could serve as a template for risk‑aware yield strategies. An improved UI with live metrics—total value locked, yield breakdown by asset, and staking utility—enhances transparency. These attributes reinforce Aave’s standing as a mature protocol among top cryptos for massive growth and contribute to its ongoing institutional appeal. Cardano (ADA): Fibonacci Bounce Sets Sights on Recovery Path Cardano has consolidated just above the critical $0.58–$0.61 support zone, precisely aligned with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement—a technical indicator often marking strong reversal points. With current trading at $0.6759, 24‑hour volume near $481 million, and market cap at $23.89 billion, ADA appears strategically positioned among top cryptos for massive growth. Recent technical analysis signals a potential breakout, targeting $1.0463 as the initial resistance level. Extended targets at $1.2145 and $1.3984 lie along Fibonacci extension zones. Continuation depends on staying above the defined support; a breakdown below $0.58 could invalidate the pattern, shifting sentiment bearish. Cardano’s ecosystem continues to expand through interoperability initiatives, academic research collaborations, and regulatory‑compliant smart contract deployment. Benchmarking against top cryptos for massive growth, ADA offers a risk‑aware yet innovation‑centric platform. Its stability around Fibonacci levels combined with real utility in DeFi, NFTs, and governance positions it as a balanced play amid turbulent conditions. Conclusion: Timing, Terrain, and Tactical Edge These three protocols represent distinctive investment profiles under the banner of top cryptos for massive growth . Qubetics capitalizes on unmet needs in online privacy. Aave solidifies its position as a next‑generation DeFi platform with built‑in safeguards. Cardano blends long‑term platform development with short‑term technical breakout potential. Given the current volatility in the crypto world, those seeking exposure to emerging and mainstream trails can monitor Qubetics’ closing presale window, track Aave’s staking yields and usage metrics, and observe Cardano’s momentum around Fibonacci triggers.

The flagship coin rallied over 4 percent in the last 24 hours to reach a local high of about $110,260, less than 2 percent from its all-time high, on Monday, June 9 during the late North American session. The wider altcoin market, led by Ethereum (ETH), followed in tandem. As a result, the total crypto Open Interest (OI) surged over 6 percent to hover about $154.8 billion at the time of this writing. Additionally, more than $403 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, led by Bitcoin’s $197 million. Major Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Rally Today Favorable Regulatory Environment As Coinpedia reported , the Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paul Atkins, has reiterated the importance of self-custody of crypto assets and clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi protocols. The favoring regulatory frameworks in the United States will have a ripple effect in other countries, thus enabling further crypto adoption by institutional investors. High Demand from Institutional Investors The overall supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline in the past few years, catalyzed by the high demand from institutional investors. Strategy Inc . has led dozens of companies in implementing a Bitcoin treasury management plan. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have continued to relentlessly accumulate, thus recording the fastest ETF growth to $70 billion in modern history. Macroeconomic Outlook BTC price has continued to grow in the recent past in tandem with the rising global liquidity.

Lee won the election with a comfortable margin earlier this month. He has since begun assembling his cabinet after making a series of pro-business crypto and stablecoin -related manifesto pledges. Kim Nam-guk: Key Ally to Take up Gov’t Position TV Chosun reported that Kim, a long-time Lee ally, is the nominee for the post of Presidential Secretary for Digital Communication. The South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-guk speaking outside a courthouse earlier this year. (Source: KBS News/Screenshot) However, Kim will first have to overcome a sizable legal hurdle, as the Coin Gate controversy rumbles on. Prosecutors originally hoped to try Kim on suspicion of insider trading. The lawmaker was believed to have sold cryptoassets while serving on a National Assembly committee that dealt with crypto-related policy. However, the prosecution later decided to charge Kim with “obstructing officials in the course of their duties.” Prosecutors wanted Kim to serve a six-month jail term if found guilty. A Korean court has indefinitely postponed President Lee Jae-myung’s retrial on election law violation charges, citing the constitutional immunity granted to a sitting president. https://t.co/77zc8O6I1Y — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 9, 2025 Legal Challenges Remain Officials alleged that Kim had made “false declarations” about his cryptoassets to the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee when submitting mandatory disclosure documents. Kim was found not guilty of the charges at a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court in early February this year . The District Court judge, Justice Jeong Woo-yong, said at the time that the prosecution’s case featured “no evidence” that Kim had committed a crime. But the Prosecution Service thinks it has a strong enough case to try again. The case will be heard at the Southern District Court’s Appellate Division next month. The first hearing will take place on July 17. Kim Returning to Court in July Prosecutors continue to insist that Kim failed to correctly declare approximately 9.9 billion won ($7.3 million) worth of crypto in the period 2021-2022. With the ruling Democratic Party of Korea set to push for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act to postpone any criminal trials involving sitting presidents until they leave office, President Lee Jae-myung will likely be unaffected during his term by the ongoing criminal… — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) June 9, 2025 However, Kim and his legal team argued that, while declaration laws have since changed (largely as a result of the Coin Gate controversy), at the time, he did nothing wrong. Kim briefly left the Democratic Party shortly after the scandal broke. But he returned to the party under Lee’s leadership. Multiple domestic media outlets, including Hankook Ilbo , have reported that Kim is part of a core seven-member group of Democratic Party allies. The group has “supported the President since 2017,” the newspaper wrote. Their association dates back to the time when Lee made his first bid for the South Korean presidency.

Despite recent volatility across the crypto market, ETH’s ability to defend this level has kept hopes alive for a potential recovery. Analysts are closely watching Ethereum’s next move, as the asset still trades well below its yearly highs, offering room for upside if momentum returns. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Below $2,800 – Bulls Need This Level To Trigger Next Leg Up Since the start of the year, Ethereum has faced steep declines and inconsistent follow-through on bullish setups. However, many believe ETH is now positioned to recover lost ground — if bulls can reclaim the $2,800 resistance and flip it into support. A breakout above that level would likely open the door for a broader altcoin rally. Top analyst Big Cheds weighed in on the current structure, noting that Ethereum’s weekly chart printed its fourth small-bodied candle in a row — a classic sign of indecision. According to Cheds, ETH “still looks pre-tower top,” suggesting a potential trend shift may be forming. Ethereum Holds Ground As Bulls Face Critical Resistance Ethereum has managed to hold strong above key support levels despite several weeks of market-wide pullback and volatility. Trading above the $2,400–$2,500 zone, ETH has shown resilience while many altcoins have lost momentum. This range has become a critical battleground, with bulls now needing a clean breakout above the $2,800 mark to confirm a return to a bullish phase and potentially kick off the next leg higher. But while the technical structure remains intact for now, macroeconomic headwinds are building. US Treasury yields continue to rise as markets brace for prolonged high interest rates, signaling tighter financial conditions ahead. Combined with ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and sluggish global growth expectations, these factors continue to weigh heavily on risk assets, including crypto. Adding to the cautious tone, top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Ethereum’s weakening weekly momentum. According to Cheds, ETH is heading for its fourth consecutive small-bodied weekly candle — a signal of indecision that typically precedes major moves. He notes that the current setup looks pre-tower top, a classic bearish formation that often marks exhaustion at the top of a trend before a sharp reversal. This puts Ethereum at a critical juncture. A decisive breakout above $2,800 would invalidate the bearish scenario and strengthen the case for recovery toward the $3,000–$3,200 range. On the other hand, continued weakness and a failure to gain traction could trigger renewed selling pressure, especially if macro conditions worsen. As Ethereum trades within a tightening range, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whether bulls can flip resistance or bears regain control will likely determine the direction for ETH and the broader altcoin market heading into Q3.

ETH Reclaims Short-Term Support But Faces Overhead Pressure Ethereum is trading at $2,539 on the 4-hour chart, showing a modest rebound of +1.86% on the day. After briefly dipping below its 200 SMA ($2,511), ETH has reclaimed this key level and is now pushing toward the cluster of shorter-term moving averages — including the 34 EMA ($2,528), 50 SMA ($2,543), and 100 SMA ($2,565). This area represents immediate resistance, and how ETH reacts here will likely determine the next short-term trend. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a wide consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800. The recent price action suggests ongoing indecision, with lower highs forming and strong support holding near the 200 SMA. Volume remains relatively muted, indicating a lack of strong directional conviction. Related Reading: Solana Key Indicator Flashes Buy Signal On Daily Chart – Rally Ahead? For bulls, reclaiming and holding above the 100 SMA is crucial for breaking out of the current range and targeting the $2,700–$2,800 region.

The New Data Is Shocking,https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-volatility-decade-low-price-rally/,"Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dropped to its lowest level since 2015, near the 10th percentile. BTC formed an ascending channel pattern, suggesting bullish continuation with a 46% upside potential. The 50-week EMA at $85,136 acts as dynamic support, maintaining the long-term bullish structure. Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped to its lowest level in nearly a decade, a sign of a major structural shift in the market’s behavior. According to new data visualized by Ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility sits near the 10th percentile, meaning current market fluctuations are calmer than 90% of all weekly periods since 2015, suggesting Bitcoin is maturing into a more stable asset even as it continues its strong upward trend. This dramatic decline in volatility, which comes despite a sharp rally in May and the asset reaching new all-time highs, marks a significant change in Bitcoin’s risk profile and could make it far more attractive to a new class of institutional investors.

Despite this, the pace of investments appears to be slowing, as investors grow cautious and await clearer guidance from the US Federal Reserve regarding inflation and the broader direction of monetary policy. According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, Bitcoin recorded $56.5 million in outflows for a second week, reflecting investor caution amid policy uncertainty. Short-Bitcoin products similarly saw $4.1 million in outflows, which represented their second consecutive week of declining interest. Ethereum continued to lead digital asset investments this week with $296.4 million in inflows, marking its seventh consecutive positive week and totaling $1.5 billion, which is equivalent to 10.5% of total assets under management. This is the strongest streak of inflows since the US election in November, which indicated growing optimism among investors. On the other hand, multi-asset investment products recorded $6.6 million in outflows for the third week running. Altcoins remained mostly flat during the same period, with the exception of Sui and Chainlink, which brought in modest inflows of $1.1 million and $0.2 million. Meanwhile, XRP faced outflows of $4 million, while Solana and Cardano saw $2.1 million and $0.4 million in outflows, respectively. The United States topped weekly inflows with $175 million over the past week, while Germany followed with $47.8 million. Switzerland, Canada, and Australia contributed $15.7 million, $9.8 million, and $6.5 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Brazil recorded $9.2 million in outflows. Hong Kong saw $14.6 million withdrawn, ending its recent inflow surge. Sweden also reported weekly outflows totaling $7.7 million.

The pseudonymous analyst tells his 548,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is attempting to move into a “price discovery uptrend.” Price discovery often refers to a process when the price of an asset moves to uncharted territory, forcing buyers and sellers to seek agreement on value. Says Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin Price Discovery Roadmap: Bitcoin is currently in a transitional phase. Price is trying to successfully post-breakout retest its ReAccumulation Range to transition into Price Discovery Uptrend 2. A volatile retest/deviation here could occur.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt Capital says that BTC closing above $104,400 on the week could be the key signal that it has successfully retested the demand zone and is gearing up for higher prices. “The retest continues to be successful. Can Bitcoin successfully confirm this retest with a Weekly Close above $104400 for what would be a 4th week in a row?” Zooming in on the daily chart, the trader says that BTC needs to close above its immediate resistance and flip it into support to fully confirm a bullish continuation of the trend. “On the Daily timeframe, Bitcoin is showcasing signs of breaking its two-week Downtrend (light blue) while also turning it into support… Daily Closing & retesting ~$106,600 (black) would be even better to enable trend continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,528.

The price jump also triggered a wave of short liquidations as the rally gained momentum. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently traded at around $110,286 , marking a 3.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin is now up nearly 5% over the last seven days, rebounding from a dip below $101,000 on June 5—a pullback that capped a broader decline dating back to late May. With BTC now nearing its all-time high of $111,814 set in May, market watchers are taking note. “Bitcoin breaking above $110,000 for the first time in two weeks signals renewed bullish momentum after a period of consolidation,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto investment firm BitBull Capital. “If BTC can hold this level, it may set the stage for a fresh push toward the $120,000 range.” Other major altcoins also rose. Ethereum (ETH), the second cryptocurrency by market cap, gained 4.5% to more than $2,679, and Solana (SOL) added more than 3% to hover close to $160. Even meme coins, which have struggled in recent weeks, showed signs of recovery. Dogecoin jumped 4.5%, and Shiba Inu added 2.5%. Crypto IPO boom and trade talks fuel Bitcoin’s climb The market’s uplift coincides with renewed talks between Washington and Beijing over longstanding trade tariffs—discussions that have soothed broader investor nerves. Investors seem optimistic about the potential for resolving trade disputes between the US and one of its largest trading partners. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China’s vice premier for economic policy, He Lifeng, will lead their respective delegations in negotiations expected to continue on Tuesday. Equities responded modestly, with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edging slightly on the day. Another factor contributing to Bitcoin’s price surge is increased crypto-related IPOs . Last week, stablecoin giant Circle went public on the New York Stock Exchange and saw its shares pop over 168%, jumping from $31 to $69 within the first day of trading. Gemini, a crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, also filed for an IPO According to David Siemer, CEO of crypto asset management company Wave Digital Assets, while the IPO bump is likely short-term excitement, the long-term institutional positioning leads us to be bullish about Bitcoin’s continued performance in 2025. Bitcoin shorts crushed as $323M liquidated in a day In the past 24 hours, close to $323 million of crypto short positions have been liquidated, CoinGlass data shows. Most of the damage was in Bitcoin, which saw around $196 million worth of liquidations. The liquidations come amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and renewed trade tensions, which have rattled investor confidence. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows in five of the last seven trading sessions, reflecting the cautious sentiment. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed a streak of positive momentum, notching 15 consecutive days of inflows. 10X Research wrote in a report released Monday morning that Bitcoin is testing a breakout level, and the market setup appears significantly different from what most investors anticipated just weeks ago. According to the report, negative funding rates, a pattern of market bottoms, and a surprising surge in spot demand combine to create a high-conviction signal.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $323 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $19 billion, rebounded from the lower border of a consolidation level of around $2,480. As a result, the ETH price has been retesting a crucial local resistance level around $2,681, whereby the Ether price was rejected four times in the past four weeks. Major Reasons Ethereum Price Will Rally Higher This Week Strong Institutional Adoption and ETF Flows According to market data analysis from CoinShares, Ethereum’s investment product dominated last week’s cash inflow with about $296 million. Notably, Ether’s investment product outpaced Bitcoin’s, which recorded a net cash outflow of about $56.5 million last week. As Coinpedia had reported , BlackRock’s ETHA has recorded significant cash inflows in the past two weeks, suggesting a strong demand from institutional clients. Altseason Sentiment Ethereum price is well positioned to rally towards a new local high this week fueled by the rising narrative of altseason 2025. With Bitcoin dominance signaling an imminent market reversal, more crypto investors are betting on a major altcoin rally in the near future. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC pair is heavily oversold in the weekly timeframe, amid the recent market reversal. Regulatory Clarity Earlier on Monday, the U.S. Chair Paul Atkins highlighted that American crypto investors have the right to self-custody of crypto assets. Additionally, Chair Atkins highlighted that a new and clear set of DeFi regulations are needed to foster the development of the nascent blockchain technology. With Ethereum harboring the largest DeFi space, with a total value locked (TVL) of about $63 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $124 billion, the altcoin is well positioned to rally further in the near future.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 00:28:46

In the 30-second ad shared by Politico , a narrator warns that Democrats Zohran Mamdani, Scott Stringer and Brad Lander would make life costlier by blocking short-term rentals. The ad shows a New York Post headline about Mamdani’s proposed tax increase, alongside a message that these candidates reject “common-sense solutions” to lower living costs. It began airing on Monday across streaming, digital, and social platforms. The ad was made by a group called Affordable New York, which supports Andrew Cuomo. By showing what his rivals believe, the ad makes Cuomo look like a moderate choice. The Hotel and Gaming Trades Council has backed Cuomo, and their super PAC will put $1 million into his mayoral campaign. An Airbnb spokesperson said the group could invest another $1 million before the June 24 Democratic primary. But Bhav Tibrewal, the political director for the hotel union, criticized the move. He noted that Cuomo had clashed with unregulated rentals as governor and vowed to protect tenants and workers if elected mayor. Airbnb pushes for single-family rental exemptions amid union opposition Airbnb has urged the City Council to exempt one- and two-family homes from strict short-term rental rules, a proposal the hotel union strongly opposes. Under state law, renting a home for fewer than 30 days when the host is away is illegal. Since 2022, the city has required hosts to register, which has cut many unlawful listings. Last November, Council Member Farah Louis, backed by Speaker Adrienne Adams, introduced a bill to allow Airbnb in one- and two-family houses. After talks with the hotel union and amid “significant legal concerns,” the council quietly removed key sections of the measure in February, Louis said. Those changes halted the most controversial parts of the plan. Adams, who is also running for mayor, has not been targeted by Airbnb’s ads. The company appears to focus its criticism on candidates openly opposing its proposed exemptions for small homeowners. Stringer, who once managed the city’s finances and has often criticized Airbnb, also doesn’t want the short-term rental rules relaxed. All three say that letting Airbnb grow would make housing harder to find and push rents up. “Affordable New York was set up to back everyday New Yorkers who depend on short-term hosting for income,” said super PAC spokesperson Michael Blaustein. “These candidates keep spreading a misleading story that hosts are causing the housing crisis, despite data showing otherwise. Their rhetoric shields special interests instead of helping New Yorkers.” Lander’s campaign spokesperson, Dora Pekec, added, “While Andrew Cuomo is funded by huge corporations trying to buy their way into City Hall, Brad Lander is a man of the people and can’t be bought.” In his own statement, Stringer noted, “This isn’t the first time Airbnb has spent money to defeat me in my fight for affordable housing. I hope they used my good side in their picture.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Tech,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-10 00:46:00

Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continues to gain traction as one of the top cryptocurrencies, fueled by surging DeFi adoption and strong developer activity. But what’s catching fire with retail traders is a new cryptocurrency priced at just $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , quickly earning a reputation as the next big crypto thanks to its low market cap, fast-growing community, and projected 50x upside. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 11,700 investors. More than $10.2 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 100% profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. For those asking what crypto to invest in, the current momentum signals it’s time to pay close attention. XRP Consolidates While Solana Eyes New Highs Amid Market Optimism XRP is currently valued at about $2.13 as it continues to show signs of consolidation for around six months. Various analysts forecast that the stable trend of XRP around $2.00 may lead to a major breakout if XRP shatters the key $2.50 resistance level. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) is currently at $146.39 and seems to be rising. Some technical indicators predict a potentially strong upward movement for XRP in the range of $180–$195 this year and there are forecasts that it may rise over $400 by the end of 2025, as more users and upgrades appear. Although XRP and SOL are attractive to investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also being noticed for the potential rewards it could generate in the quickly developing crypto market. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $10.2 million and accumulated 11,700 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 during the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. Certik-Audited With Upcoming Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance strives to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its initial investor community. To award early investors MUTM platform provides ten lucky winners a $100,000 giveaway distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. XRP holds firm, SOL shows strength, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the one catching fire. Priced at just $0.03 with a 100% ROI expected at launch and over $10.2M raised, MUTM is a top altcoin to watch now.

Bitcoin Has Ended A Streak Of Positive ETF Flows In a new thread on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the total balance of the US spot ETFs has changed for Bitcoin and Ethereum recently. The spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that provide an alternate means of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements in a manner that’s familiar to traditional investors. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1 Billion Flush As Musk-Trump Feud Shakes Bitcoin These ETFs are a relatively new presence in the sector, but they have gained sufficient popularity to become a key part of the market. Investors who previously avoided digital assets due to the perceived complexity of wallets and exchanges can now invest through ETFs, which trade on traditional exchanges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the spot ETFs for Bitcoin back in January 2024. They got approval for Ethereum half a year later, in July 2024. First, here is how the balance held by the spot ETFs has changed for Ethereum since their inauguration: As displayed in the above graph, the total balance of the Ethereum spot ETFs has been on the rise recently. In fact, the cryptocurrency has now seen four straight weeks of net inflows. In all, 97,800 ETH have entered into the wallets associated with these ETFs during this green netflow streak. Though despite the continuous inflows, their total holdings are yet to hit the 3.81 million ETH peak from February, as they currently sit at 3.77 million ETH, about 41,000 tokens lower. “Accumulation is steady, but room remains for further upside,” notes Glassnode. Bitcoin has also seen growth in its spot ETF holdings recently, but unlike Ethereum, the number one digital asset saw the metric surpass its high from February last month. That said, while the Bitcoin spot ETFs were enjoying inflows until very recently, the trend has changed during the past week as net outflows have occurred instead. This has been the first negative week in eight for the BTC ETFs. “Total holdings are now 1.20M BTC, down ~11.5K BTC from the late-May peak,” explains the analytics firm. “A pause in demand after a strong run-up – watch for signs of re-acceleration.” Related Reading: Bitcoin RSI Dips Below 30—Is A New All-Time High Next?

That left it scrambling to prevent the loss of $223 million of its investors’ funds. Unfortunately, the team’s best efforts couldn’t stop the attacker from making away with $60M of those funds. Consequently, the DEX paused its operations momentarily to audit the incident, Fast forward to 6th June, and the firm teased about relaunching its activities two days later, boldly proclaiming, “This isn’t just about recovery or bouncing back — it’s about resilience, rebuilding, and an unwavering long-term commitment to the entire Sui ecosystem. “ This announcement tore the Cetus community right through the middle, indicating that it would take plenty of effort and goodwill from all the parties to stitch it together. While the decision to relaunch its CLMM pools service is commendable, the DEX has a long way to go in regaining its users’ trust Cetus mounts full-scale recovery after $162M attack Throughout the May 22nd debacle, the Cetus team pulled all stops to contain the situation. Together with its Sui blockchain counterparts, it managed to pause the transfer of $162M of the stolen funds. It then initiated moves to protect itself from further attacks, including identifying and patching the vulnerability that exposed it to hackers. It also rallied its community to work with Sui validators to free the assets they had quarantined after the attack. At the same time, it secured a $30M line of credit from the latter’s foundation to boost its recovery. Next, it resets all the affected pool data to its original settings while aligning it with prevailing market conditions. Additionally, it rebalanced its assets in preparation for pool refills and drew up a compensation contract for the affected. These efforts and many pledges of future enhancements did little to erase the mistrust some held on the DEX’s restart. Investors continue to express misgivings about Cetus’s relaunch Even as Cetus embarks on the audacious relaunch, it can’t play deaf to the concerns part of its community holds regarding the exercise. One such fear is that the token may turn inflationary, as some of its members suggested. Lady Cardano, for instance, was skeptical about the relaunch, suggesting that the DEX would inject 76 million new $CETUS tokens (a 5% supply increase) into circulation. The member concluded that the recipients could sell their allocations, potentially reducing the token’s value. Many members also complained that they’d lost significant portions of their investments. For example, Nikolai (@Nikolai7035) decried losing 30% of his position and swore never to return to that dump (Cetus again). His counterpart Stas (@staasbtc) reiterated this point, asking the protocol if it was using them to cover for the 30% of the liquidity lost in the hacking. It didn’t help that others could not access liquidity pools or remove their funds. If true, this latest failure indicates that technical or organizational hurdles continue to plague trust in the weapon system’s performance. As resentment over Cetus’s slow recovery of full service mounted, some investors like Wesley_ (Redwhite2626) began to call the project a scam . Reservations of such a kind reveal a lack of trust and resentment toward the team and their project. How can Cetus regain its users’s trust? If Cetus had imagined having a smooth restart after the hack, then it had another thing coming. That’s because winning over a community plagued with discontentment and mistrust is exacting. It will require more than PR stunts to pacify people who strongly feel the exchange let them down by failing to provide their investments with the protections they trusted it with. So, with time, tact, and sustained effort the protocol may still cultivate its community’s trust to the pre-hack day levels. However, it must be forthright with its users to achieve that feat. That entails coming clean on the claims that its issuance of 70M+ $CETUS tokens will erode the crypto asset’s value. It should enlighten its users on why making such a huge allocation was necessary and commit to buybacks and token burns to prop up the asset’s value. Secondly, the team should move fast to quell its users’ other concerns: they might have lost some of their funds forever. That calls for a full and timely restoration of the protocol to its pre-hack state, including a full restitution of investor positions and liquidity pools. This move will bolster users’ confidence in the project’s recovery efforts/sustainability. Again, the DEX should double down on allaying its investors’ qualms about its long-term security. Some quarters have questioned the robustness of its systems’ overhaul, given the pace of its relaunch. In this instance, a public and detailed update of the process will go a long way in easing those uncertainties. Add to the platform’s improved operability post-restart, and it’ll inspire more confidence in its offerings. Cetus’s resurgence is about more than just recovering lost funds or lost market share; it is about demonstrating that DeFi can move past its pain points. If it can use the disaster of recent weeks as a spark for reform, it may actually end up stronger, providing, over time, a more secure and stable foundation for the future. Yet, for that to occur, it will need to move beyond this moment of crisis and make security, transparency, and user trust paramount above all else. The DeFi community is watching and waiting for now but knows the next chapter is up to them to write.

The vote, which needs backing from 60 senators , paves the way for the bipartisan legislation to be passed quickly in the coming days. This came after revisions last month that attracted the support of crypto-friendly Democratic senators like Angela Alsobrooks and Mark Warner. John Thune focuses on adding competition in credit card processing with the bill The stablecoin bill is crucial as it would create rules for dollar-pegged tokens used to make payments. It is worth noting that the stablecoins must be backed by reserves kept in short-term investments, such as those overseen by federal debt or state regulators. As the Senate gets ready to vote on a stablecoin bill with support from Trump, debates have been sparked concerning the bill. Progressive Democrats have voiced concerns that the bill lacks safeguards to prevent stablecoins from endangering the financial system or being exploited by criminals. They also argue it overlooks the issue of Donald Trump profiting from his own cryptocurrency ventures. However, Thune’s move to cut off debate on the bill virtually aims that the legislation will contain language pressed by retailers and their allies in the Senate to force competition into Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. in credit card processing. To support this claim, the proposal, backed by Republican Senator Roger Marshall and Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, would require major banks to let merchants choose from multiple credit card networks. This includes alternatives to Visa and Mastercard. The aim is to boost competition and reduce transaction fees for merchants. On the other hand, Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott has indicated that his committee might look at the credit card rules as separate legislation instead of including them in the stablecoin bill. This did not stop Marshall from focusing on achieving his goal. On Monday, June 9, Marshall mentioned that he was planning his next move and wanted to schedule a vote on the legislation sometime soon. A Senate aide said late Monday that talks are continuing on the bill and that senators could still offer floor amendments. The stablecoin bill faces criticism as worries grow among individuals A stablecoin linked to the Trump family has seen its market value soar past $2 billion since its announcement in March, but it has also faced criticism. However, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a key Banking Committee moderate, said he would back the measure. He also mentioned that worries about the Trump family’s business activities should not prevent progress on broader stablecoin legislation. Warner described the legislation as “not perfect but far better than what we currently have.” On the other hand, the progressive faction of the party, led by Elizabeth Warren, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, strongly opposed it. During an early vote, Warren and Senator Gillibrand had a heated exchange on the Senate floor. Warren shared a new analysis from her staff criticizing the bill for not including any bans on Trump and his family benefiting from cryptocurrencies regulated by his administration. The analysis also pointed out loopholes that could let criminals and terrorists misuse stablecoins for transactions outside traditional banks. Warren cautioned that passing this bill means they can expect more anonymous buyers—big companies and foreign governments—to use the president’s stablecoin as a secret bank account free from government oversight and as a way to pay off the president personally. She added that for criminals, it was a two-for-one deal. Bankers also worry that stablecoins might take away bank deposits and make it harder for small businesses and farmers to get loans. These groups often depend on banks for credit. So far, bankers have tried — mostly without success — to prevent big companies, like tech firms or retailers, from creating their own tokens.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading below $110,000, changing hands at $109.7K , as Asia continues its trading week. The move challenges a prevailing market narrative of summer stagnation, coming on the heels of a note from QCP Capital that emphasized suppressed volatility and a lack of immediate catalysts. A recent Telegram note from QCP pointed to one-year lows in implied volatility and a pattern of subdued price action, noting that BTC had been “stuck in a tight range” as summer approaches. A clean break below $100K or above $110K, they wrote, would be needed to “reawaken broader market interest.” Even so, QCP warned that recent macro developments had failed to spark directional conviction. “Even as US equities rallied and gold sold off in the wake of Friday’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, BTC remained conspicuously unmoved, caught in the cross-currents without a clear macro anchor,” the note said. “Without a compelling narrative to spark the next leg higher, signs of fatigue are emerging. Perpetual open interest is softening, and spot BTC ETF inflows have started to taper.” That context makes the current move all the more surprising. Over the weekend, Bitcoin surged 3.26% from $105,393 to $108,801, with hourly volume spiking to 2.5x the 24-hour average, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. BTC broke decisively above $106,500, establishing new support at $107,600, and continued upward into Monday’s session, reaching $110,169. The breakout coincides with a tense macro backdrop: US-China trade talks in London and a $22 billion U.S. Treasury bond auction later this week have injected uncertainty into global markets. While these events could drive fresh volatility, QCP cautioned that recent headlines have mostly led to “knee-jerk reactions” that quickly fade. The question now is whether BTC’s move above $110K has true staying power, or whether the rally is running ahead of the fundamentals. A 'Massive Shift' in Institutional Staking May Drive ETH's Next Rally Ethereum’s critics have long highlighted centralization risks, but that narrative is fading as institutional adoption accelerates, infrastructure matures, and recent protocol upgrades directly address past limitations. “Market participants will pay for decentralization because it's in their economic interest from a security and principal protection standpoint,” Mara Schmiedt, CEO of institutional Ethereum staking platform Alluvial, told CoinDesk. “If you look at [decentralization metrics] all of these things have massively improved over the last couple of years."" There's currently $492 million worth of ETH staked by Liquid Collective – a protocol co-founded by Alluvial to facilitate institutional staking While this figure may appear modest compared to Ethereum’s total staked volume of around $93 billion, what's interesting is that it originates predominantly from institutional investors. ""We’re really on the cusp of a truly massive shift for Ethereum, driven by regulatory momentum and the ability to unlock the advantages of secure staking,"" she noted. Central to Ethereum’s institutional readiness is the recent Pectra upgrade, a significant development Schmiedt describes as both ""massive"" and ""underappreciated."" ""I think Pectra has been a massive upgrade. I actually think it’s been underappreciated, just in terms of the tremendous amount of change it introduces into the staking mechanics,"" Schmiedt said. Additionally, Execution Layer triggerable withdrawals—a key component of Pectra—provide institutional participants, including ETF issuers, a crucial compatibility upgrade. This feature enables partial validator exits directly from Ethereum’s execution layer, aligning with institutional operational requirements such as T+1 redemption timelines. ""EL triggerable withdrawals create a much more effective path to exit for large-scale market participants,"" Schmiedt added. Ultimately, Schmiedt said, ""I think we'll see that a lot more [ETH] in institutional portfolios going forward.” News Roundup Trump Media May Be the Cheapest Bitcoin Play Among Public Stocks, NYDIG Says Trump Media (DJT) may be one of the cheapest ways to get bitcoin exposure in public markets, according to a new report from NYDIG, CoinDesk recently reported. As a growing number of companies adopt MicroStrategy’s strategy of stacking BTC on their balance sheets, analysts are rethinking how to value these so-called bitcoin treasury firms. While the commonly used modified net asset value (mNAV) metric suggests that investors are paying a premium for BTC exposure, NYDIG’s Greg Cipolaro argues mNAV alone is “woefully deficient.” Instead, he points to the equity premium to NAV, which factors in debt, cash, and enterprise value, as a more accurate gauge. By that measure, Trump Media and Semler Scientific (SMLR) rank as the most undervalued of eight companies analyzed, trading at equity premiums of -16% and -10% respectively, despite both showing mNAVs above 1.1. In other words, their shares are worth less than the value of the bitcoin they hold. That’s in stark contrast to MicroStrategy (MSTR), which rose nearly 5% Monday as bitcoin crossed $110,000, while DJT and SMLR remained mostly flat—making them potentially overlooked vehicles for BTC exposure. Circle Stock Nearly Quadruples Post-IPO as Bitwise and ProShares File Competing ETFs Two major ETF issuers, Bitwise and ProShares, filed proposals on June 6 to launch exchange-traded funds tied to Circle (CRCL), whose stock has nearly quadrupled since its IPO late last week, CoinDesk previously reported. ProShares is aiming for a leveraged product that delivers 2x the daily performance of CRCL. At the same time, Bitwise plans a covered call fund that generates income by selling options against held shares, two very different ways to capitalize on the stock’s explosive rise. CRCL surged another 9% Monday in volatile trading, continuing to draw interest from both traditional finance and crypto investors. The proposed ETFs have an effective date of August 20, pending SEC approval. If approved, they would further blur the lines between crypto and conventional finance, giving investors new tools to play one of the hottest post-IPO names of the year. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $109,795 after a 3.26% breakout fueled by institutional buying, elevated volume, and macro uncertainty from US-China trade talks and an upcoming $22B Treasury auction. ETH: Ethereum rebounded 4.46% from a low of $2,480 to close at $2,581, with strong buying volume confirming support at $2,580 and setting up a potential breakout above $2,590. Gold: Gold is trading at $3,314.45, edging up 0.08% as investors watch US-China trade talks in London and a subdued dollar keeps prices attractive. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Tuesday, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 up 0.51%, as investors awaited updates from ongoing U.S.-China trade talks. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed slightly higher Monday, boosted by Amazon and Alphabet, as investors monitored U.S.-China trade talks.

The move pushed the firm’s average purchase price to $70,086, after buying at levels above $100,000 in recent weeks.

Weekly Bitcoin Purchases Continue Strategy’s drip-feed gameplan has become routine. The firm bought just under 2,000 BTC over the last two weeks, but split those into smaller chunks. That steady rhythm helps avoid big bumps in the market. It also keeps the firm in the headlines on a weekly basis. Traders watch closely. When the company buys, prices tend to move up. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRDhttps://t.co/blyWfRskjE — Strategy (@Strategy) June 9, 2025 Rather than issue new MSTR shares, Strategy tapped its STRK and STRF stocks. The latest filings show $62.7 million in STRK and $43.3 million in STRF went into Bitcoin purchases. No new common shares were registered this round. That keeps Strategy at about 0.02 BTC per MSTR share—10 times more Bitcoin per share than any other name in the sector. Strategy's latest Bitcoin purchase filing with the SEC. Impact On Market Supply Corporate treasuries now hold roughly 3.4 million BTC. That stash includes what miners and governments no longer sell. It leaves less coin on the open market. Over-the-counter desks have seen their inventories drop from 236,000 BTC a month ago to just 123,500 BTC today. Even Coinbase Prime, one of the main outlets for big players, shows only 63,535 BTC available. Corporate Trends And Outlook Strategy’s moves still cast a long shadow. Only 26 other public companies have more than 1,000 BTC, and just seven hold over 10,000 BTC. On-chain data points to nearly 2,000 whale wallets that top those numbers. In the past week alone, five additional firms bought BTC, using their purchases to grab attention on social media. In all, 124 public companies have now listed Bitcoin on their balance sheets or signaled plans to buy.

The crypto space in 2025 is filled with hype, but very few projects are actually showing results. Whitepapers and fancy roadmaps aren’t enough anymore. People want visible progress, strong partnerships, and real-world use. That’s where a new set of crypto top gainers stands out. This article highlights four names, BlockDAG, AVAX, DOT, and NEAR, that are cutting through the noise. These projects are not just talking, they’re building, scaling, and showing up in places that matter. If you’re looking for projects that back bold ideas with action, keep reading. These are the ones worth watching in 2025. 1. BlockDAG: From Startup Roots to Global Reach BlockDAG is stepping onto the global stage with serious momentum. It’s rumoured to sign a potential deal with NBA, following its highly successful ongoing partnership with Inter Milan. BlockDAG isn’t chasing attention; it’s building a brand that delivers. With over $291 million raised in presale, more than 22.1 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, it has become one of the top crypto gainers for a reason. Currently in Batch 28, BlockDAG (BDAG) is priced at $0.0262. However, a limited-time offer brings that down to $0.0018, frozen until June 13th. This isn’t just a discount; it’s a clear opportunity to be part of something that’s gaining real traction. From strong numbers to bold visibility moves, BlockDAG is not just growing, it’s standing out. Among the top crypto gainers, it’s proving that strategic execution can turn a rising name into a major player. 2. AVAX: Powering Multi‑Chain Solutions Avalanche (AVAX) has built a reputation on fast, low‑fee transactions, and in 2025, it’s proving itself. This is the coin that’s all about real usage. From enterprise tools to NFT platforms and DeFi, AVAX is more than theory, it’s active. Plus, its subnets let developers create custom chains without slowing the main network. No flashy headlines here. Just steady work behind the scenes. Developers appreciate its infrastructure, and adopters value the reliability. As one of the top rated cryptos, AVAX offers a stable base for scalable apps. It’s quietly powerful, a top pick among the crypto top gainers for any serious builder. 3. DOT: Linking Blockchains with Solid Tech Polkadot (DOT) might not grab headlines with splashy deals, but its crucial technical work makes it one of the crypto top gainers. As a layer‑zero protocol, DOT links blockchains into a seamless network. This interoperability is essential for multi‑chain strategies. In 2025, parachain auctions and developer tools are gaining traction. DOT is back in the spotlight among tech‑focused audiences. It might not be glitzy, but engineering‑first clarity gives DOT its strength. For anyone building infrastructure‑driven projects, DOT is a key pick. 4. NEAR: Developer-Ready and AI-Driven NEAR Protocol brings developer ease and AI ambition. With quick transaction finality and smooth onboarding, it’s simple to create smart contracts. Already, NFAR has attracted developer attention. In 2025, NEAR is focusing on decentralized AI tools, partnering with machine‑learning startups. This clear direction makes NEAR one of the crypto top gainers that is future‑ready. While still growing, its community‑first approach and practical utilities stand out. It may not dominate headlines, but in tech circles, NEAR’s AI focus and developer ease are earning respect, another reason it’s among the top cryptos today. Which One Should You Pick? To be called a top-rated crypto in 2025, a project needs more than strong tech, it needs execution, visibility, and momentum. BlockDAG delivers all three: over $291 million raised, 2,520 % ROI delivered, 22.1 billion coins sold, and an NBA teaser after Inter Milan. It’s foreign to hype and built for impact, making it one of the standout crypto top gainers. At $0.0262 in batch 28, and a locked presale price of $0.0018 until June 13th, it gives clarity and opportunity. While AVAX shines on infrastructure and DOT powers interoperability, and NEAR leads in dev‑and‑AI usability, BlockDAG grabs the spotlight. When it comes to scale, story, and vision, it’s still the crypto top gainers leader of 2025.

Qubetics is capturing attention with its sale nearing its end and its decentralized VPN (dVPN) service. Stellar secures validation through inclusion in Nasdaq’s reconstituted crypto index, signaling mounting institutional trust. Bitcoin faces warnings of a potential “summer trap” flagged by a respected analyst. This analysis dives into each project’s fundamentals, real-world data, token trends, and risk frameworks for the top crypto coins to buy now . Qubetics and the Rise of Decentralized VPNs: Web3’s Backbone for Online Privacy Qubetics introduces a compelling utility: a decentralized VPN (dVPN) integrated directly into its blockchain ecosystem. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers vulnerable to data collection, Qubetics decentralizes the entire operation. Through a peer-to-peer architecture, users can share bandwidth, earn tokens, and navigate the internet without intermediaries. There is no central server to censor or fail, and no corporate entity to log user activity. The dVPN in Qubetics relies on blockchain-based transparency, incentivization, and encryption. Tokenized incentives, through the $TICS token, reward users who contribute bandwidth. This tokenomic model fuels a self-sustaining ecosystem, giving participants both utility and financial gain. The protocol also implements multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption. These features ensure a user’s IP address and traffic are not traceable by any single node operator. Qubetics sees its dVPN as a gateway to broader Web3 services. As users move into decentralized finance, NFTs, and decentralized storage, a secure and private network layer becomes essential. The dVPN ensures that activity across Qubetics’ ecosystem is protected, fostering a truly autonomous, censorship-resistant environment. Qubetics Presale: Scarcity Meets Demand in Final Phase Qubetics has entered its final crypto presale phase, and the numbers reflect surging demand. Over $17.8 million has been raised to date. More than 515 million $TICS tokens have been sold, distributed among over 27,700 holders. The current price sits at $0.3370, with fewer than 10 million tokens remaining. A 20% price surge is expected at listing, with the projected debut price set at $0.40. Recent changes to tokenomics are fueling further momentum. The total token supply has been drastically reduced from over 4 billion to just 1.36 billion, significantly tightening future circulation. Additionally, the public allocation has increased to 38.55%, giving the community greater governance over future development. Analysts now point to scarcity, robust utility, and decentralization as core reasons for potential price appreciation post-launch. Growth Potential: A $2,000 Growth Scenario in Qubetics If a buyer purchases $TICS tokens at the current presale price of $0.3370, a $2,000 investment yields approximately 5,936 tokens. At the projected listing price of $0.40, this translates to $2,374, offering a return of 18.7%. If the token climbs to $1 after listing, the initial offering would be worth $5,936. At $5, it becomes $29,680. Should the token hit $10 after the mainnet launch, the portfolio would swell to $59,360. If it reaches $15, the initial $2,000 investment grows into $89,040—a staggering 4,349% return. While these figures are projections, they’re based on constrained supply, crypto presale momentum, and growing utility among the top crypto coins to buy now. Bitcoin: The Market Giant Enters a Cautionary Phase Bitcoin’s trajectory is always a topic of global debate. Currently, leading analysts have flagged concerns about a “summer trap” in the BTC market. This term refers to misleading bullish activity that lures investors, only to reverse into sharp corrections. Such traps have historically preceded volatile downturns. Investor sentiment has grown cautious following warnings from industry figures. Regulatory developments are adding further layers of complexity. The recent approval of a NASDAQ Crypto Index featuring Bitcoin alongside altcoins like Solana and XRP has stirred optimism. However, macroeconomic uncertainty persists. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s next policy moves and inflation data could cause further shifts in BTC pricing. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the benchmark asset for institutional investors and retail users alike. With its capped supply of 21 million coins and increasing mainstream exposure, it retains its appeal as a long-term hedge and one of the top crypto coins to buy now. But near-term volatility could increase, particularly as summer months bring lighter trading volumes and heightened emotional trading. Stellar’s Institutional Leap: Joining the Nasdaq Crypto Index Stellar (XLM) has seen a resurgence in market cap and relevance, largely due to its recent inclusion in the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index U.S. ETF. Now ranked 16th by market cap, Stellar is valued higher than Bitcoin Cash, a key competitor in the payments and remittance space. Inclusion in an index governed by Nasdaq is a signal of institutional confidence. It exposes Stellar to ETF-linked investments and brings its underlying protocol under a new level of scrutiny and validation. This change came during a reconstitution that also added Solana and other top-tier tokens to the benchmark. Such an endorsement can bring liquidity inflows and increased media coverage. Stellar continues to focus on its core mission of enabling cross-border payments and bridging fiat-crypto integration. Unlike Bitcoin, it offers fast settlement times and low transaction costs. Its partnerships with global financial institutions position it as a serious contender in the remittance market. Conclusion: Innovation, Adoption, and Timing Define the Top Crypto Coins to Buy Now Qubetics, Stellar, and Bitcoin each reflect a different side of the crypto market. Qubetics offers innovation through decentralized infrastructure, providing tools that underpin Web3’s ideals. Stellar presents institutional alignment and scalable financial utility. Bitcoin, the first and largest, commands attention through legacy and macroeconomic relevance, albeit with volatility risk in the short term. Understanding each coin’s role in the current market climate enables better decision-making. These are not just speculative assets; they represent different bets on the future of decentralized technology, financial access, and digital privacy. For those navigating the market today, these three tokens are more than trending tickers—they’re signals of where blockchain innovation is headed. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. What makes Qubetics dVPN different from traditional VPNs? Qubetics dVPN operates without a central server, using peer-to-peer architecture and blockchain rewards to ensure privacy, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. 2. How many tokens are left in Qubetics’ presale? Fewer than 10 million $TICS tokens remain at the fixed price of $0.3370. This is the final presale stage before listing. 3. What is the risk of a “summer trap” in Bitcoin markets? A summer trap involves misleading bullish movements that reverse, potentially leading to steep losses. This has been flagged by analysts recently. 4. Why is Stellar’s inclusion in Nasdaq’s crypto index significant? It signals institutional approval, which may drive liquidity and increase Stellar’s visibility in the ETF investment landscape. 5. Can Qubetics’ $TICS token realistically reach $15 post-mainnet? While projections are optimistic, the reduced supply, growing ecosystem, and final-stage crypto presale dynamics lend credibility to long-term appreciation scenarios.

At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalization has jumped to $3.43 trillion, showing a healthy 4.22% rise in the past 24 hours. Investor sentiment has also turned positive. The Fear & Greed Index now reads 64, firmly in ‘Greed’ territory — a clear sign that traders are feeling confident about the market’s direction. So, what’s fueling this rally? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin Leads the Charge The star of the show is Bitcoin, which finally broke out of a consolidation range it had been stuck in since May 23rd. Currently trading above $109,500, Bitcoin’s breakout is being closely watched by analysts. This move was expected because of a bullish weekly candle formation called a three-inside-up pattern around the $100,000 mark. Historically, this kind of setup often leads to an 8-10% pump within a week or two. If momentum continues, some analysts believe Bitcoin could soon touch $115,000 — or even higher. Global Factors Also at Play Apart from technical signals, positive news on the macro front is also helping the rally. Reports show that trade talks between the United States and China have resumed, easing global market tensions. This, combined with growing institutional interest, has boosted investor confidence. Altcoins Follow Suit Following Bitcoin’s lead, altcoins are also climbing. Ethereum is up over 8% this week, now trading at $2,699, while Solana and Dogecoin have surged 5% and 6.6% respectively. Interestingly, Sui (SUI) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) have posted impressive double-digit gains. The Altcoin Season Index, however, remains at 30 out of 100, meaning that while altcoins are rallying, a full-fledged alt season hasn’t arrived yet.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 02:16:03

This move is in line with a broader recovery in the crypto market, with Bitcoin climbing steadily and Ethereum leading the pack with an 8% surge. As Ethereum moves higher, many smaller altcoins like XRP are following the trend. XRP also continues to display a bullish divergence, a signal where the price makes lower lows, but indicators like the RSI show higher lows. This often hints at a possible price bounce. XRP Finds Support, Eyes New Targets Looking at the daily charts, XRP recently bounced off a key support zone between $2.00 and $2.10. This area has proven strong in the past, with prices rebounding from here several times. If the price falls below $2.00, analysts warn that it could drop toward $1.92-$1.95, and possibly as low as $1.80. But for now, the bullish momentum is holding. Bullish Pattern Taking Shape A positive sign for XRP is the formation of a double bottom pattern — also known as a W pattern — on the charts. This pattern often signals a potential upward breakout. If this pattern plays out fully, the next price target would be around $2.44. However, before reaching that level, XRP could face some resistance near $2.35, an area that previously acted as both support and resistance. Long-Term Outlook: Could $5 Be Next? XRP appears to be in the middle of a fifth wave to the upside. This wave started in April after a market correction and could possibly push prices above $5.00 in the coming months, provided current support levels hold. If XRP stays above the April lows and maintains its upward structure, analysts believe the bullish trend could continue. However, a break below those key support areas might delay the rally, meaning that the market is still working through a correction phase.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-10 02:51:11

Although DOGE is still a cultural emblem with great community support, its expansion mostly depends on sentiment and market cycles. By means of combining artificial intelligence with blockchain architecture, Lightchain AI presents a utility-oriented alternative. Also, Lightchain AI, priced at $0.007 during its presale and already generating $18.3 million, is becoming rather popular among long-term value seekers and the issue now is whether this DeFi-driven token will outperform returns motivated by memes going forward. Can Meme Power Still Provide Significant Returns for Dogecoin? The rise of Dogecoin in 2021 demonstrated how strong meme culture is in influencing bitcoin values and at the time of writing, DOGE is roughly trading at $0.1848 on June 7, 2025 with about 2.54% value increase over the past 24 hours. Recent developments like the addition of Dogecoin to distributed finance (DeFi) systems have been adding to its utility outside its meme past. Apart from this, the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust marks the growing institutional curiosity in it. Nonetheless, the coin has to cope with issues including significant price swings and little technological difference from other rivals. Though the main driver of DOGE has been meme rage, future performance of the meme may be mostly dependent on more general use and technological development rather than being only meme-oriented. Before considering Dogecoin as their next investment, traders should, nevertheless, be especially alert and do thorough investigation. Lightchain AI Gains Ground as DeFi Investors Eye Stronger Fundamentals As DeFi investors give stronger basics top priority over hype, Lightchain AI is becoming more and more relevant. Its system is set up for efficiency; artificial intelligence chores are split up, handled by contributor nodes, and checked with cryptographic proof before integration guarantees flawless operations. Low latency made possible by this makes the platform perfect for real-time artificial intelligence uses. By providing developers tools to create intelligent, distributed applications driven by the AIVM, Lightchain AI also promotes strong dApp development. Supported by strong tokenomics , 40% of LCAI tokens go toward presale, 28.5% to staking incentives, and the rest go toward liquidity, marketing, Treasury, team shares. These principles make Lightchain AI a unique for long-term value that draws intelligent investors in the changing DeFi scene. Bet Now on Lightchain AI for Future Serious Long-Term Development Possibilities Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to open countless opportunities across sectors including finance, healthcare, and more, Lightchain AI is guiding long-term success in the DeFi space. Emphasizing utility and practical applications, this project is not merely riding the wave but rather is helping to shape the future. Supported by strong principles and an innovative vision, Lightchain AI has great potential to provide investors outstanding returns. Looking beyond the hype, this project stands out as a wise decision as DeFi keeps expanding and attracting the attention of institutional players. Ignite the transient buzz of meme coins such as Dogecoin. For those hoping to leverage the future of DeFi, Lightchain AI presents a sustainable, forward-looking investment choice.

33767162,[object Object],1749524436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Nears 8 Million Holders—Where Do XRP, Bitcoin Stand?",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-nears-8-million-holders-xrp-bitcoin-stand/,"On-chain data shows the Dogecoin user base has grown to nearly 8 million recently. Here’s how other major assets like XRP and Bitcoin compare. Dogecoin Beats Several Top Coins In Total Amount Of Holders In a post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has shared how the various top coins in the cryptocurrency sector have compared against each other in terms of the Total Amount of Holders. The Total Amount of Holders here refers to an indicator that measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses that are carrying some non-zero balance on a given network. When the value of this metric rises, it can have a number of underlying causes. New investors coming into the network and old ones who had sold earlier returning, both result in an increase for the indicator. Existing users creating fresh wallets to distribute their holdings or for privacy purposes can also naturally contribute to this trend. In general, all of these factors could be assumed to simultaneously be at play whenever the Total Amount of Holders goes up. As such, some net adoption takes place alongside this trend. For any cryptocurrency, adoption is something that tends to be constructive, as a wider user base can provide for a more solid foundation for the asset to grow on in the future. Usually, though, the positive effects of it only end up being visible in the long term. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Total Amount of Holders for eight top digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Tether (USDT), and USD Coin (USDC). As displayed in the above graph, the Total Amount of Holders has steadily been going up for all of these assets recently, which suggests adoption has been occurring across the top coins. One asset, however, stands out for its particularly sharp growth: Dogecoin. From the chart, it’s visible that the memecoin saw the indicator go through a steep climb last month, indicating that users opened up a large amount of DOGE wallets inside a narrow window. That said, while this was a very sharp jump, the indicator has more or less plateaued for the asset since then. The Dogecoin network now has 7.97 million holders. This makes the cryptocurrency the third largest on this list, ahead of USDC’s 7.79 million and XRP’s 6.53 million. The memecoin is still only the “king of the rest,” though, as both Bitcoin and Ethereum are many times larger. ETH, especially, boasts an impressive 148.38 million non-empty addresses, outweighing BTC by a factor of nearly 3. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.185, down almost 3% in the past week.",Dogecoin|bitcoin|btc|Doge|dogecoin|dogecoin adoption|Dogecoin holders|dogeusdt|XRP,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-10 03:00:36
