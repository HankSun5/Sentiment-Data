Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 22:42:00

With this move, the firm intends to stop accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for payments. According to the report , the firm said the aim of this change offer a more stable, secure, and reliable payment system. Dtcpay, founded in 2019, is one of the key players in fintech, earning support from major industries like Singapore’s Pontiac Land. The company received a payment license from Singapore’s central bank in 2022. Dtcpay’s shift to stablecoins The shift also comes amid the growing demand for stable, secure, and regulated payment options. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can have big price changes, which create risks for businesses and users. Stablecoins, which are tied to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer a more predictable and stable alternative for digital transactions. Dtcpay believes this move will make payments safer and easier for everyone. Dtcpay’s decision is part of a larger trend in the fintech industry. A report from Chainalysis shows that stablecoin payments in Singapore reached nearly $1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Dtcpay will only support certain stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT), Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). These stablecoins are backed by real reserves to keep them at a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar. FDUSD, launched in June 2023, is now the sixth-largest stablecoin with a market value of $1.9 billion. WUSD, backed by the Worldwide Stablecoin Payment Network, is known for its added security since it is fully backed by reserves. The Singapore firm noted that the new stablecoin-only model aligns with its mission to deliver a “more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience” for its clients. The platform’s commitment to stability is important in the financial ecosystem. A large part of their transactions is already done with stablecoins. This change also aligns with growing regulations in places like Singapore, where the government is setting clear rules for digital assets. Dtcpay is ready to these changes to stay compliant and meet demand.

In 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $7,769.79 and $9,361.58, with an average expected price of $9,199.91. In 2030, ETH could trade between $24,373.71 and $26,740.04, with an average price of $25,417.45. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2024 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,574.78 Market Cap $430.55B Trading Volume $41.12B Circulating Supply 120.44M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,682.67 24 Low $3,504.23 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 10.80% 50-day SMA $ 2,935.30 200-day SMA $ 2,914.35 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart On December 03, the 1-day Ethereum price chart shows that Ethereum is trading at $3,584.2, down by 1.67%. The price tested resistance at $3,825.1, as indicated by the upper Bollinger Band, but faced rejection, suggesting bearish momentum. ETH/USD 1-Day price chart The 20-day SMA at $3,370.9 acts as a key support level, with the lower Bollinger Band at $2,916.8, marking a critical defensive zone. The RSI (14) is at 65.62, signaling overbought conditions. A consolidation phase may follow if Ethereum stabilizes above $3,370.9, while a break below could lead to further downside. Overall, caution is warranted in the current range. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis The 4-hour Ethereum chart indicates a slight recovery as the current Ethereum price is $3,583.3, up 0.30%. A recent low of $3,569.5 suggests Ethereum is testing local support. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.38 shows mild bullish momentum but remains inconclusive for a strong upward breakout. ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The MACD displays a bearish crossover, with the MACD line at 1.4 and the signal line at 19.8, highlighting weak momentum. A continued price movement below $3,600 could lead to testing deeper support around $3,550. However, if buyers regain control, resistance at $3,595.5 could serve as the next upward target. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $3,310.19 BUY SMA 5 $3,422.80 BUY SMA 10 $3,399.66 BUY SMA 21 $3,309.67 BUY SMA 50 $2,935.30 BUY SMA 100 $2,715.66 BUY SMA 200 $2,914.35 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $3,237.43 BUY EMA 5 $3,068.89 BUY EMA 10 $2,859.44 BUY EMA 21 $2,695.35 BUY EMA 50 $2,621.57 BUY EMA 100 $2,714.74 BUY EMA 200 $2,814.55 BUY What can you expect from ETH price analysis next? The 1-day and 4-hour charts show that Ethereum currently exhibits mixed signals. On the daily chart, the price faces resistance at $3,825.1 and struggles to maintain above $3,584.2. The RSI suggests overbought levels. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD remains bearish, and the Balance of Power shows weak buying strength. If Ethereum breaches the $3,570 support zone, it could drop toward the lower Bollinger Band at $2,916.8. However, sustained consolidation above $3,600 may allow for a potential retest of the $3,825 resistance. A decisive break is needed to confirm the next trend direction. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark in the near future. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

The cryptocurrency had its biggest 24-hour gain in the last month, which boosted its market capitalization to $44.7 billion. Now, investors have begun talking about whether this momentum can be sustained, or if the rally has just been a temporary burst. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Cardano has gained a remarkable 268% in value over the past month, capturing the attention of bulls. Experts are keenly observing the token as optimism about the broader crypto market grows. Bullish Predictions Fuel Market Hopes Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks ADA has more to go. On December 1, Marks presented a price target of $2.77, or 130% above its current value. He also suggested that ADA could go the same way as it did in 2021 and surge between $5.29 and $7.82. Lark Davis, another prominent analyst, went even further and predicted that ADA would jump by 747% to $10. $ADA (Cardano) continuing to display monumental strength here and can be in full pursuit towards the first target of $2.7709 which can result in another +135% move from here to reach it but history says there can be more 👀! See charts below… https://t.co/OXkUPU1un4 pic.twitter.com/VOCZMOTo5Q — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 Institutional support is further giving the bull case credibility. The CIO at Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, recently stated that Cardano was one of his top altcoin choices for 2024. According to Yusko, traditional banks will be forced to introduce cryptocurrencies like ADA in the future to maintain their status quo. Resistance & Support Levels Under Focus While the rally is exciting, technical analysts suggest caution. The altcoin recently failed to break past the resistance level of $1.15, which raises questions about whether the uptrend can hold. Analysts point out that ADA must decisively reclaim this resistance to sustain its bullish momentum. If ADA succeeds in breaking through and holding up above $1.15, it could open a fresh wave of buying to carry the price even higher. If it fails, there could be a pullback to some critical support levels around $0.88. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Broader Market Trends Could Boost ADA Cardano is just seeing its surge as the overall crypto market is filled with fresh momentum. Bitcoin is approaching $100,000 and the recently held US presidential election brings much-needed optimism for the introduction of friendlier policies to cryptos. The positive context will therefore become a tailwind for ADA and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Cardano plans to release 18.53 million ADA tokens on December 4, which are worth approximately $20 million, adding to its momentum. An increase in supply can be viewed as dilution; however, the funds will go towards staking and treasury reserves, which may boost long-term growth. At present, Cardano seems to be on the bright side of things, but the future depends on breaking some key resistance levels and holding investor confidence.

According to developer WietseWind on the social media platform X, XRPL Labs changed the configuration of its validator last month to lower fees and reserve requirements in anticipation of rising activity on-chain. “There have been several discussion threads about Reserves and Fees on the XRPL. On behalf of XRPL Labs I just changed the configuration of our validator, to be enabled the next validator restart.” According to the developer, the adjustments aim to lower barriers for new users, including a significant reduction in the required reserves. As of December 2nd, reserve requirements for XRPL users have now been lowered from 20 to 1 XRP. According to pseudonymous XRPL developer Vet, the move has freed up excess XRP for traders. “XRP Ledger reserves just dropped! Activating an XRP account cost now 1 XRP Holding a Token Trustline only 0.2 XRP Excessive XRP is now freed up in your account that you can spend now!!” Developers say the changes will make it more affordable for users to participate in the XRP Ledger ecosystem, thus broadening the blockchain’s user base. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also asked validators to upgrade to 2.3.0 of rippled, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger. The move comes at a time when XRP’s value has soared to $2.65, its highest level since 2018. XRP is worth $2.51 at time of writing, up 82% from a week ago.

According to the announcement , this is an important step in its development. The launch began with the creation of the genesis blocks in the network. The initial phase of the mainnet focuses on staking and governance. This sets up a decentralized network driven by its community. Namada Committed to a User-driven Ecosystem Namada is giving away its native tokens, NAM, through an airdrop to eligible wallets as part of its launch. Recipients can immediately use these tokens to stake and participate in governance decisions. This focus on staking and governance shows Namada’s commitment to a user-driven ecosystem. Notably, the rollout will happen in five phases. Token transferability will start in the fifth phase, which is expected to begin in the next few months. This will only happen once the Namada community is confident of its network. Meanwhile, Namada focuses on privacy by using advanced cryptographic methods to protect transaction details. At the same time, it ensures transparency in governance. IOTA Foundation Revamps Mainnet With Move Transition The IOTA Foundation unveiled IOTA Rebased recently , an ambitious upgrade proposal to revolutionize its blockchain network. IOTA Rebased proposes a complete overhaul of the network’s Layer-1 protocol by switching to a Move-based object ledger. Interestingly, this move makes IOTA the first Layer1 blockchain to adopt the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM). This transition opens the doors to programmability at the core layer, enabling developers to create Decentralized Applications (DApps). This transformative upgrade also positions IOTA alongside prominent MoveVM-powered blockchains like Sui and Aptos. Meanwhile, the Move programming language will be added to the architecture, allowing smart contracts to run directly on the Layer 1 ledger. Celo Network Moves to Become Ethereum Layer 2 Recall that last year, cLabs, the Celo blockchain’s core developer, presented an ambitious plan to transform its Layer 1 network into a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum . As revealed, the cLabs proposal outlines a future version of Celo based on a Layer 2 roll-up model. In this model, Celo will leverage Ethereum’s mainnet for security by publishing security proofs. By doing so, Celo can benefit from the robust security guarantees offered by Ethereum, ensuring a higher level of protection than what Celo’s independent infrastructure currently provides.

Toncoin’s recent updates have sparked debates about its scalability compared to Ethereum and Solana, while Stellar’s climb toward a 60% surge has everyone watching. But here comes Qubetics, a game-changer in the presale arena, solving real-world issues that have plagued blockchain technologies for years. With over $4.2 million raised in its presale and over 261 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s becoming the talk of the town. In a market overflowing with innovation, Qubetics stands apart. Why? Its revolutionary QubeQode IDE aims to make blockchain accessible, tackling the very problems of complexity and scalability that many users face daily. Let’s dive deeper into these projects and see what makes Qubetics the best ongoing presale to buy now. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain’s Future Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a movement aimed at solving blockchain’s core issues. With its QubeQode IDE , the project is creating a user-friendly ecosystem that anyone—yes, anyone—can navigate. Think about it: how many times have you heard complaints about blockchain’s complexity driving users away? Qubetics addresses this head-on. Blockchain has long been plagued by unintuitive interfaces and limited transaction scalability. These problems make it harder for new users to dive in and for businesses to rely on the technology. QubeQode IDE simplifies blockchain app development, offering tools that reduce complexity and increase accessibility. It’s designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that transaction processing isn’t a bottleneck, even during peak usage. Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with a current token price of $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.2 million, selling more than 261 million $TICS tokens to over 5,900 holders. These figures show strong community trust and investor interest. Analysts predict that the $TICS token’s value could soar post-launch, making it the best ongoing presale to buy now. FOMO kicking in yet? Unlike its competitors, Qubetics doesn’t just patch problems—it reimagines blockchain technology. By making it accessible and scalable, it’s paving the way for mainstream adoption. Imagine a world where developing blockchain apps is as simple as using a smartphone. That’s the future Qubetics is building. Learn more by watching this video . Toncoin: A Rising Star with Room to Shine Toncoin’s recent performance has been impressive. Analysts are debating whether it might outperform Ethereum or Solana in December. Its robust ecosystem, powered by The Open Network, is gaining traction for its speed and decentralised structure. This makes it a go-to for users craving efficiency in transaction processing. But does it have what it takes to revolutionise blockchain accessibility? According to recent forecasts, Toncoin could double in value by year’s end. The coin’s recent upgrades aim to tackle network congestion and scalability issues, bringing it closer to Ethereum’s dominance. However, its complex ecosystem might still pose challenges for newcomers. Crypto experts warn that while Toncoin offers solutions, it’s not foolproof. The learning curve is steep, and its tools are far from intuitive for first-time users. Toncoin’s growth is exciting, but accessibility remains a significant barrier. As it evolves, its ability to onboard everyday users will determine its long-term success. That’s where it could learn a thing or two from Qubetics’ focus on user-friendly tools. Stellar: Aiming for the Stars with Bold Moves Stellar is no stranger to the limelight. Its mission to simplify cross-border payments has won over institutions and investors alike. Recent predictions suggest a 60% jump in its value, driven by its unique position in enabling fast, cost-effective global transactions. With XRP nearing a $2 milestone, Stellar’s competition in this space is heating up. But here’s the rub: Stellar’s infrastructure, while efficient, doesn’t completely erase the hurdles faced by mainstream users. Technical complexities and a lack of streamlined interfaces make it challenging for those new to crypto. Its scalability also has room for improvement, as transaction volumes increase with adoption. Despite these limitations, Stellar’s potential remains undeniable. Its partnerships with financial institutions and a focus on solving real-world payment issues give it an edge. Still, it’s clear that blockchain needs a simpler, more accessible solution—something Qubetics promises to deliver. Conclusion: Where Does the Smart Money Go? Toncoin and Stellar are undoubtedly making waves, with Toncoin’s potential doubling and Stellar’s steady climb. But both projects struggle with accessibility and scalability issues that hinder widespread adoption. They’re excellent investments for seasoned crypto enthusiasts but might leave newcomers scratching their heads. Enter Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE, it’s solving the very problems that others overlook. Its presale success, intuitive tools, and focus on scalability make it a top contender for anyone looking to invest in blockchain’s future. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale and grab your $TICS tokens before it’s too late. Don’t miss out on the best ongoing presale to buy now!

While the bug bounty program with HackerOne is not a novel idea, the large sum attached to the announcement certainly drew a lot of attention worldwide. Crypto.com announced the daring cybersecurity initiative in a blog posted on its website and shared via social media. It is offering hackers the substantial reward of $2M to test the strength of its security system. The company has an ongoing partnership with HackerOne and this cybersecurity program is a part of that partnership. The exchange said it execs the campaign to help bolster security and maintain the trust of its almost 100 million customers. Crypto.com raises the stakes The $2M incentive on offer is one of the largest of its kind in the cryptocurrency sector. Crypto.com confirmed that it is an exercise to prove the importance of proactively safeguarding digital assets in its custody, especially in the cryptocurrency space where cyber threats are surplus. With this program, Crypto.com hopes participants may help identify vulnerabilities and resolve potential risks before they are found and exploited by the wrong people. The company joins other crypto platforms that have put out bug bounties to bolster their defenses against cyber threats. “When you operate a global app serving more than 100 million customers, finding critical security gaps before bad actors do is essential to system integrity and customer trust,” Kara Sprague, CEO of HackerOne said. She went on to say that Crypto.com’s “record breaking bounty” reflects the company’s emphasis on “consumer protection and their appreciation of the value the ethical hacking community can provide.” Strategic bets in the cryptocurrency space Other companies such as Uniswap, Atomic Wallet, Facebook and even Google consistently run bug bounty programs to quickly identify critical gaps in their security before they pose a problem. In late November, Uniswap launched the largest bug bounty in DeFi history, offering a whopping $15.5M reward to hackers who could identify weaknesses in its v4 smart contracts ahead of their deployment. The project’s UNI token has taken off on a parabolic trajectory since it announced the campaign. The crypto space has been rocked by significant cases of hacks on both decentralized protocols and centralized exchanges . Affected entities have had varying degrees of success in recouping and reimbursing stolen funds to affected users. The WazirX and XT.com exchange hacks were major hacks that affected centralized exchanges running on similar business models as Crypto.com this year alone. Crypto.com is not waiting to record losses before making its move. The Chief Information Security Officer of Crypto.com, Jason Lau, stated, “We have always respected and partnered with the ethical hacking community as an extension of our security team. Deepening our relationship with HackerOne through this milestone and setting this landmark bounty underscores our commitment to enhancing safeguards and consumer protection. We look forward to continuing to productively engage with this community.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Crypto.Com|Uniswap|WazirX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-03 23:33:48

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 00:05:00

Edwards posits that Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 could be the catalyst for an unprecedented price acceleration. He suggests that once this psychological and technical barrier is breached, Bitcoin could potentially double in value within weeks. Drawing parallels with gold’s recent performance, Edwards stated, “If you look at gold this year, it went up 33% in 16 weeks—that’s a $3.8 trillion move in a really old asset. For Bitcoin to go from $100K to $200K, that’s just $2 trillion on an asset that trades 24/7 and is more accessible globally.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin’s relatively smaller market capitalization compared to gold allows for more rapid price movements. Historically, after surpassing previous all-time highs, Bitcoin has experienced significant and swift appreciations, entering periods of price discovery where supply constraints can lead to vertical price increases. When Will Bitcoin Price Double? The $100,000 mark is not just a round number; it represents a significant resistance level due to several factors. Edwards highlighted the presence of a substantial sell wall at this price point, noting, “We have the biggest sell wall we’ve ever seen in the order books for Bitcoin at $100,00. I think just yeah once that’s cleared out, that’s when you know everyone who wanted to sell has sold and you have these really sharp rapid vertical price appreciation moves because there’s just no more supply left.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday Additionally, many investors who entered the market at lower prices may view $100,000 as an optimal point to realize profits, potentially creating selling pressure. However, Edwards remains optimistic that this barrier will be surpassed, especially within the next few months, given the seasonal strength observed in Bitcoin’s price movements during Q4 and Q1. “We are [at a point] in the cycle where we are seasonal and this is kind of like the optimal two to four month period, maybe a five to six month period every four years. After each Halving every four years, you have about 12 to 18 months where you get 90% to 95% of all the cycles returns out of every four years. So most of it happens in that one year alone. If you look at Q4 and Q1 that again is the majority of the returns […] once you have a strong monthly breakout above all time,” the hedge fund CEO stated. While Edwards is bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects, he cautions investors about the inherent volatility of the market. He pointed out that corrections of 20% to 30% are normal during bull markets and that investors should be prepared for such fluctuations. “It’s normal to have 30% drawdowns every few months in a Bitcoin bull market,” he noted. Factors such as increasing leverage in the market could exacerbate price swings. Edwards mentioned that if leverage and funding rates continue to rise without chipping away at the existing sell wall, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels, potentially around $80,000. However, he emphasizes that such volatility is a natural part of Bitcoin’s growth cycle and not necessarily indicative of a long-term downturn. The End Of The Traditional 4-Year Cycle? A significant point of discussion was whether the traditional 4-year cycle, largely driven by the halving events, is reaching its conclusion. Edwards believes that as Bitcoin matures and integrates more deeply with traditional financial systems, the impact of the halving on market cycles will diminish. “As Bitcoin’s inflation rate decreases and it becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the four-year halving cycles may become less impactful. The large 80% drawdowns we’ve seen in the past might not happen in future cycles,” he stated. This maturation process could lead to more stable growth patterns and reduced volatility. Edwards suggests that future cycles may see shallower corrections, possibly around 60% rather than the dramatic declines of previous years. Related Reading: Data Shows Selling Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin: Is The Bull Run at Risk? Notably, several potential catalysts could propel Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented levels. Edwards mentioned the possibility of the US government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President-elect Donald Trump. While he estimates the probability of this occurring in 2025 to be around 30%, he acknowledges that such an event would be a game-changer. “Assuming [the U.S. government] doesn’t sell their existing holdings is great, but it’s probably not going to help the cycle a lot. Actively buying Bitcoin could be a game-changer,” he remarked. Corporate adoption is another significant factor. The potential for major corporations to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets could drive substantial demand. Edwards highlighted the upcoming vote by Microsoft on this matter, saying, “Let’s hope it’s Microsoft [on December 10].” Furthermore, the success of spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has opened the doors for institutional investors. The sustained demand from ETFs has been absorbing Bitcoin supply steadily. Edwards observed, “The ETFs have just been sucking Bitcoin out of the system ferociously.” Bitcoin Price Predictions Edwards provided a base and an optimistic scenario for the Bitcoin price in this cycle. He stated, “I’d be surprised if we don’t get to $140,000.” This base case assumes steady market conditions without any extraordinary positive events. In a more optimistic scenario, he believes Bitcoin could reach $200,000, especially if significant catalysts, such as government or corporate adoption, materialize. “We could easily get to $200,000. Once we clear those all-time highs, Bitcoin does multiples very quickly,” he explained. He concluded: “”Once we’re above $100,000, people who aren’t in Bitcoin just cannot comprehend Bitcoin above $100,000 […] That’s when you see the real switch flick and the flows happen.” At press time, BTC traded at $94,814.

Table of Contents PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong The next ERC-20 to blow up will most likely be DTX Memecoins and market mood The meme coin madness is back, and everyone is getting excited again. In the spotlight, we have these meme coins as leaders, Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), two original meme coins that are definitely back with big rallies. While these household names still dominate the meme coin space, investors and analysts are discussing a new ERC-20 token that could be the next big winner. PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong Pepe , the Ethereum-based token that pays homage to the internet’s favorite Pepe the Frog, has been on a tear lately. PEPE is up 131% in the last month, driven by retail interest and whale activity. A significant development that got everyone’s attention was the withdrawal of 150 billion PEPE tokens worth nearly $3 million from Binance by one wallet. This enormous transfer initially caused some uncertainty, but many see it as a sign of growing confidence in PEPE’s long term. The coin’s recent move is a testament to its popularity among retail investors, thanks to its community-driven and viral nature. Not far behind, Shiba Inu is solidifying its position as a meme coin leader. SHIB has gone beyond its meme roots by adding DeFi applications, NFTs, and governance features to its ecosystem. These have kept the token relevant and attracted a loyal user and investor base. Despite its huge supply, SHIB has held up in price, with early 2025 projections of $0.0000093. SHIB’s ability to innovate while riding its existing popularity makes it a good option for long-term holders and speculators.

It has just hit $9.2 million in presale, and investors are showing big interest. DTX just entered its sixth round, and the price has been raised to $0.12. Early investors are already seeing significant gains of 500% because the initial price when DTX started was $0.02. DTX Exchange is launching its First Hybrid Leaderboard, which will combine the best centralized and decentralized exchanges to bring transparency and gamification to trading. Experts are predicting big growth for DTX Exchange . Some analysts say it could hit $4.5 by February 2025, a 4,500% gain for early investors. Now, rumors of a Binance listing in 2025 are surfacing, which could make it even bigger. With its upcoming Hybrid Leaderboard and strong community, DTX will be a significant player in the crypto space. Memecoins and market mood The comeback of PEPE and SHIB is a sign of the overall market’s risk appetite. These tokens, often criticized for having no intrinsic value, live on community, social media, and market sentiment. Remember, meme coins are highly volatile. They can give users huge short-term gains but also big losses. Analysts advise traders not to overexpose to this speculative asset class and to diversify their portfolio. The meme coin rally signifies a lively and exciting crypto market. Social media and community narratives will continue to shape the path of Pepe, Shiba Inu, and the new DTX Exchange token. As the anticipation grows, the market is waiting for meme coins to blow up. Whether it’s a token based on a new internet meme or a project using new tech, one thing is certain: the meme coin space is a wild west in crypto. Investors, be informed, be cautious, and remember that in the memecoin world, fortunes can change quickly. For more information, visit the DTX Website , buy presale , or join the DTX community .

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 518,000 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche witnessed a strong November. “Avalanche performed a historically bullish monthly close above the light blue level of $38.57. Any dips [below $38.57] in the future would be a retest attempt, in a very similar fashion to the retests from Sept 2021 and March 2024 (green/orange circles).” Source: Rekt Capital/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AVAX tends to rally after retesting $38.57 as support. Avalanche is trading at $51.14 at time of writing, up over 12% in the past day. Next up is Polkadot. The widely followed analyst says the 17th-largest crypto asset by market cap also recorded a “bullish monthly close” to reach a level last witnessed in April. “DOT is also showing very early signs of retesting this level [at around $8.61] into new support. DOT needs to continue doing this to enable further upside. Price stability at $8.61 = crucial.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Polkadot is trading at $10.24 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. As for Dogecoin, Rekt Capital notes the flagship memecoin has broken out from the upper boundary of an ascending triangle pattern that had formed on the daily time frame. In technical analysis, an ascending triangle breakout is considered bullish. “Any dips into the top of the pattern [at around the $0.43 level], if needed, would constitute a post-breakout retest to confirm the breakout.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.421.

From quirky beginnings as internet jokes to skyrocketing investment opportunities, these coins have flipped the script on what a cryptocurrency can be. As 2024 wraps up, the race is on to spot the next big winner in this meme-powered gold rush. Standing out in this vibrant landscape is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a fresh contender with explosive potential and innovative features. But the fun doesn’t stop there. Turbo, Memecoin, and Baby Doge Coin are also heating up the charts, each with its unique charm and promise of massive returns. Let’s dive into the best meme coin presales with 100x potential and see why these picks are turning heads. 1. BTFD Coin If you’re hunting for the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. Launched on November 26, 2024, it entered the market with a price of $0.000004 per coin. In just one week, it’s surged to $0.000058 in its sixth presale stage, raising over $700,000 and selling more than 18 billion coins. These numbers aren’t just impressive—they’re game-changing. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its numbers. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, BTFD Bull Run, lets users earn tokens through interactive challenges. It’s fun, engaging, and, most importantly, profitable. Add to this a staking program with a staggering 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) , and you’ve got a coin that’s catering to gamers, casual investors, and hardcore crypto enthusiasts alike. The backbone of BTFD’s momentum is its community, the “Bulls Squad.” With over 1,700 members rallying behind the coin, it’s more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s presale performance and long-term potential are unmatched. A $4,800 investment at the current presale price could turn into $49,655 when the coin hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. If you missed Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, this could be your second chance. 2. Turbo Turbo isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a race car in crypto form. Born out of a joke about speed and flash, Turbo has quickly gained a loyal following among adrenaline junkies and meme enthusiasts alike. With a clever marketing campaign that blends humour with high-octane imagery, Turbo has carved out a unique niche in the meme coin space. But this isn’t just a gimmick. Turbo’s developers have incorporated a dynamic transaction fee system that adjusts based on trading volume. This mechanism not only discourages pump-and-dump schemes but also rewards long-term holders with passive gains. Its upcoming NFT collection, “TurboCharged,” promises to blend the worlds of gaming and digital art, making it a coin that’s as versatile as it is entertaining. Why did this coin make it to this list? Turbo’s combination of humour, innovation, and community focus makes it one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. Its clever approach to tokenomics and strong branding set it apart in a crowded market. 3. Memecoin Sometimes, simplicity is genius. Memecoin doesn’t try to overcomplicate things—it’s a coin that’s all about memes, pure and simple. This straightforward approach has struck a chord with investors who are tired of overhyped promises and just want to have fun. Memecoin’s charm lies in its transparency. The developers have committed to a no-nonsense roadmap, focusing on community growth and steady price appreciation. With regular “Meme Wars” on social media, the coin has created an interactive platform for its users, making the investment experience as entertaining as it is rewarding. Why did this coin make it to this list? Memecoin is proof that you don’t need complex features to succeed in the meme coin market. Its community-first approach and consistent growth make it a strong contender among the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. 4. Baby Doge Coin Baby Doge Coin has been riding the coattails of its older sibling, Dogecoin, but it’s quickly making a name for itself. Launched as a “cuter and faster” alternative, Baby Doge has captured the hearts of investors with its playful branding and impressive growth metrics. The coin uses a deflationary model, which burns tokens with every transaction, reducing supply and driving up demand. This approach has proven effective, with Baby Doge seeing a 300% increase in its market cap over the past three months. Its charitable initiatives, which include donations to animal shelters, add an extra layer of appeal for socially conscious investors. Why did this coin make it to this list? Baby Doge Coin’s rapid growth, combined with its unique blend of humour and heart, makes it one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. It’s a feel-good investment with serious upside. Conclusion The meme coin market is brimming with opportunities, but not all coins are created equal. BTFD Coin stands out for its explosive presale growth, innovative features, and strong community backing. Turbo’s high-octane branding and smart tokenomics make it a unique entry, while Memecoin’s simplicity and community focus prove that sometimes less is more. Baby Doge Coin, with its deflationary model and charitable initiatives, rounds out the list as a coin that’s as heartwarming as it is profitable. If you’re ready to dive into the world of meme coins, now’s the time. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and take your first step towards potentially life-changing returns.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 01:27:00

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Pal acknowledged the accuracy of XRP enthusiasts’ predictions, admitting his skepticism had been misplaced. Addressing his teeming followers, Pal referred to the XRP supporters as “XRP Jedi Warriors,” recognizing their steadfast belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential. He admitted, “You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth.” Pal also highlighted the community’s challenges, remarking that they had “walked through hell to get here.” The financial expert also recalled the hardships endured during the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. This legal action led to XRP being delisted from prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance US, and Bitstamp. While trading was suspended, users could still hold, deposit, and withdraw XRP. Pal noted that he retained some XRP during that turbulent period, describing it as the “delisting times.” Dear $XRP Jedi Warriors… You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth I just want everyone to make $$ and you guys have walked through hell to get here. I still own some XRP from the delisting but you guys/girls deserve everything. — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 1, 2024 Earlier in the year, Pal had criticized XRP and ADA, suggesting they had become “cults” and advising investors to avoid them. However, the recent market developments compelled him to revise his stance, particularly as XRP’s price climbed past $1 and then surged to over $2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Unlocks One Billion XRP Amid Market Rally The price rally coincided with a significant transaction by Ripple. Data from Whale Alert, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency transfers, revealed that Ripple released one billion XRP tokens from escrow on December 1. At the current market value, this amounted to over $2 billion. XRP’s remarkable performance has been particularly notable since November 24, when the token traded above $1. Since then, XRP has experienced an impressive 84.78% increase, reaching $2.73 at the time of writing. The rally solidified XRP’s position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a spot it had not held in years. The timing of Ripple’s escrow release, coupled with XRP’s price surge, has sparked interest among market analysts and the broader crypto community. This significant development comes as Ripple continues to expand its presence in global payment solutions and reinforces the resilience of XRP supporters despite past challenges. A Shift in Perception Pal’s acknowledgment marks a turning point in his view of XRP, signaling broader recognition of the cryptocurrency’s potential. As the market evolves, dedicated communities like XRP’s remain a testament to the influence of collective conviction in the crypto landscape.

37190958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621892,1733275743,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37190958.jpeg,Bitcoin mining proposed as a solution to UK wind energy waste,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-mining-solution-uk-wind-energy-waste/,"CEO and Chairman of Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital, Fred Thiel, has called for grid operators and renewable asset owners to use Bitcoin mining to manage grid congestion due to excess energy. Thiel expressed this view in response to a recent report about excess energy being wasted by wind farms in the UK. According to Bloomberg ‘s report, the UK is paying £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in congestion costs to wind farms to turn off their operations because the grid cannot handle the excess output from the wind farms. According to reports, the UK has significantly increased its wind power generation capacity over the last few years, with its offshore wind fleet now up by 50% over the last five years and projected to double in the next five. Despite the massive increase in capacity meant to increase Britain’s reliance on renewable energy, its grid capacity has not expanded to match this supply. This has led to congestion issues, forcing the utility provider to pay some plants to turn off while paying others to turn on. Interestingly, the shutoff of wind farms, usually offshore and far away from cities, has invariably led to the turning on of gas plants closer to the demand centers. This is not the first time the UK operator will pay congestion costs, with the 1 billion this year even below the amount it paid in 2022. Experts say Bitcoin mining with excess energy will prevent waste Meanwhile, Thiel has criticized the energy waste and congestion costs, noting that Bitcoin mining could solve this problem. According to Thiel, adding Bitcoin mining is one of the ways to make renewable energy more economically viable. He observed that the IEA estimates that it would cost over $26 trillion to upgrade the grid for renewable energy transition by 2050, and consumers will be the ones to foot all these costs. However, Bitcoin mining could reduce the economic burden on these rate-payers. He said : “Grid operators and renewable asset owners must realize that adding large despatchable loads such as #bitcoin mining behind the meter at renewable energy sites is the only way to eliminate grid congestion and wasted energy.” The mining executive added that Marathon Digital optimally monetized its energy through Bitcoin mining. Marathon is one of the leading publicly listed mining companies and recently acquired Bitcoin using proceeds from convertible notes. Meanwhile, VanEck of digital assets research Matthew Sigel also criticized what he termed a “waste of power,” noting that all the excess energy could be used to mine Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining gains adoption for managing grid capacity Despite UK energy providers’ failure to consider Bitcoin mining for managing grid congestion, many other entities are exploring it for that purpose. In Switzerland, the Bern region recently approved a proposal to evaluate how Bitcoin mining can stabilize the power grid by utilizing surplus energy. The Grand Council of Bern , the region’s parliament, voted 85 – 46 on the proposal, confirming the broad support for the idea within the region. With the approval, the government will now assess whether to integrate Bitcoin mining into its energy strategy. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom is also piloting a Bitcoin mining scheme in Germany focused on using surplus renewable energy to power Bitcoin mining operations. The pilot program intends to lay the groundwork for the large-scale implementation of Bitcoin mining for load balancing within the energy grid. With more entities exploring the use of Bitcoin mining for managing renewable energy fluctuations, the industry might have found a new use case for countries pursuing renewable energy alternatives for power generation.

The company released some of its local and international employees, affecting several teams, including the ASIC repair and hardware teams. The mining pool operations, firmware team, and self-mining department remained partially intact. Familiar sources state that the company’s move to lay off staff is strategic as it aims to improve the main revenue streams. The digital currency group shareholder letter points to Foundry’s race to earn $80 million in revenue from its self-mining business for 2024. Foundry BTC mining pool accounts for 30% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate Foundry boasts of several business lines. One of its most significant lines is the mining pool, which accounts for 30% of the network’s total hashrate . The firm has always been the pool of choice for institutional-scale and public Bitcoin mining firms incorporated in the US. Foundry’s other significant business lines include self-mining, custom hardware, decentralized AI infrastructure, ASIC repairs, firmware, and site operations across other Bitcoin mining and general compute verticals. It launched some revenue streams in 2022 after Genesis, a subsidiary of their shared parent company, Digital Currency Group, collapsed. While most departments were affected by the layoffs, the firm’s site operations, which control and oversee Bitcoin mining firms, remain in place. There are speculations that Foundry is planning to sell, but only time will prove this. DCG restructures by moving Foundry employees to Yuma and resolving Genesis disputes Foundry had moved nearly 20 workers to Yuma, a new subsidiary under Digital Currency Group (DCG). Yuma, a decentralized AI startup, has roots in Foundry and is supported by investments through Foundry’s AI-focused division, Bittensor . The startup is run in an acting capacity by Barry Silbert, the DCG CEO. The Foundry was registered in 2017 under the wings of DCG and has often given more competitive mining pool fee rates. Its offers are always enticing, sometimes extending 0% fees to its most prominent clients. Around 2020 and 2021, the firm introduced ASIC-backed loans. These layoffs are a strategy for the DCG to repair its shredded empire. Genesis, which was DCG pride, went bankrupt after FTX’s implosion. Following the bankruptcy period, DCG spent vast dollars to help Genesis pay its creditors. However, Genesis initiated a legal dispute, claiming that DCG owed its creditors around a $1.7 billion loan. The legal dispute was solved in August, with DCG committing to pay Genesis $324.5 million in cash and $158 million in cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum’s $333M ETF Inflows and Monero’s Privacy Edge Lead Crypto Headlines",https://timestabloid.com/qubetics-presale-phase-11-unlock-52912-roi-potential-ethereums/,"What’s new in the crypto world? Ethereum has seen a surge in institutional interest, with ETF inflows reaching $333 million, fuelling optimism for decentralised finance. On the other hand, Monero is making waves with its focus on privacy but is facing potential regulatory challenges in Brazil. The crypto world keeps proving it’s never short on excitement or surprises. Amid these developments, a fresh contender is shaking things up: Qubetics ($TICS) . Unlike others, Qubetics aims to solve interoperability issues that hinder blockchain growth. Its ongoing presale offers a chance to invest early in what could be a transformative Web3 project, with potential returns of up to 52,912%. Qubetics Is Unlocking Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling a major pain point: interoperability. Many blockchains operate in isolation, making it difficult for users and businesses to transfer assets or share data across networks. Qubetics solves this by functioning as a Web3 aggregator , uniting major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana. This seamless interaction unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies. Picture a logistics company using multiple blockchain networks to track global shipments. Before Qubetics, transferring shipment data between these chains was complicated and inefficient. With Qubetics’ interoperability features, the company can streamline its operations, improving accuracy and reducing costs. Similarly, individual investors who manage assets on different chains can unify them in one system, saving time and hassle. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 11th stage, with over 261 million $TICS tokens sold to 5,900+ holders, raising more than $4.2 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282, with a 10% price increase expected in the next stage. Here’s what analysts predict: $TICS at $0.25 by the presale’s end offers a 783% ROI. $TICS at $1 post-presale yields 3,434%. $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch projects a staggering 52,912% ROI. For example, a $5700 investment at $0.0282 could grow to over $3,000,000. These numbers show why investors are eyeing Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy this week. If you want more information about this project, you can watch this video . Ethereum Gains Traction with Institutional Investors Ethereum remains a dominant force in the crypto space. Recent reports highlight $333 million in inflows into Ethereum ETFs, showcasing growing interest from institutional investors. Experts attribute this to renewed optimism around decentralised finance and the upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. Ethereum has also seen a significant increase in DeFi activity, with total value locked (TVL) surging 12% over the past month to $50 billion. Despite a minor price dip of 3%, Ethereum remains a favourite among investors. Over the last month, it gained 30%, and analysts believe that another bull run like 2021 could send Ethereum to new heights. For long-term holders, Ethereum’s utility in DeFi and its scalability improvements with Ethereum 2.0 make it one of the best cryptos to buy this week. Monero Fights for Privacy in a Changing Regulatory Climate Monero (XMR) is known as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy. Its ability to mask transaction details has made it popular, but it’s also attracted regulatory challenges. Recently, Brazil’s Central Bank proposed a ban on privacy coins like Monero. Despite this, Monero has been holding steady, trading at $166.74. It saw a daily high of $169.03 and a low of $160.52. However, Monero faces an uphill battle to gain mainstream acceptance due to increased regulatory scrutiny. For those prioritising anonymity, Monero remains unmatched. Its consistent performance and dedicated community make it a niche but significant player in the crypto market. While regulatory hurdles persist, Monero’s focus on privacy ensures its relevance, especially for users looking for secure, anonymous transactions. Conclusion Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics shines with its interoperability and presale potential, offering real-world solutions that many investors find compelling. Ethereum’s DeFi growth and institutional backing keep it at the forefront, while Monero’s privacy features cater to those prioritising anonymity. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with the best cryptos to buy this week, Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity to capitalise on its presale and long-term growth.

With so many options, finding the best altcoin to invest today can feel overwhelming. Cardano is refining its blockchain with new governance features, Immutable X is reshaping NFT gaming, and Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with a groundbreaking Web3 aggregated chain. While each has its strengths, Qubetics is carving out a unique path by tackling real-world problems head-on. Unlike earlier projects, Qubetics is redefining how blockchains interact, ensuring seamless communication between networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Its ongoing presale is grabbing attention, with over 260 million $TICS tokens sold already. Let’s dive into what sets these three projects apart and why Qubetics could be the standout choice for the future. Qubetics Leading Blockchain Interoperability: A Unified Approach with Web3 Aggregated Chain One of the biggest hurdles in blockchain today is the lack of compatibility between networks, leaving businesses and developers struggling to connect various platforms. Qubetics ($TICS) solves this issue with its Web3 aggregated chain , integrating EVM, Wasm, and Bitcoin chains into a seamless and unified ecosystem. This breakthrough enhances interoperability, allowing different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. For example, a healthcare company can securely share patient data across blockchains like Ethereum and Solana without compatibility barriers. Similarly, financial institutions can optimise cross-border settlements using Qubetics’ integrated framework, avoiding the inefficiencies of siloed systems. This integration unlocks new opportunities for businesses and developers while driving adoption of decentralised technologies. By focusing on interoperability, Qubetics isn’t just connecting chains; it’s creating a collaborative environment for innovation. Presale Performance That Grabs Attention The $TICS presale is in its 11th stage, with over 261 million tokens sold to more than 5,900 holders, raising $4.2 million. At $0.0282 per token, this stage offers significant potential, with a 10% price surge expected soon. Analysts anticipate extraordinary returns for Qubetics ($TICS). By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to reach $0.25, offering a 783% ROI. Post-presale, predictions place its value at $1 (3,434% ROI) and $5 (17,571% ROI), with a remarkable $15 forecasted after the mainnet launch, equating to an astonishing 52,912% ROI. For instance, an investment of $9,800 at the current price of $0.0282 could potentially grow to $87,238 at $0.25, $336,860 at $1, and an incredible $5,178,960 if $TICS reaches $15. If you’re considering joining this promising project, watch this video or visit the Qubetics website for more details. Cardano’s Latest Updates and Goals Cardano is no stranger to the spotlight. The project has been gaining attention due to its impressive 213% monthly price increase, with analysts predicting a future value of $10 for ADA. These gains reflect its growing adoption and strong technical fundamentals. Its focus on decentralisation and governance is evident with its upcoming “Voltaire” upgrade, which aims to bring user-powered decision-making into the network. However, regulatory concerns persist. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, which also implicated ADA as a security, raised red flags in 2023, leading to price volatility. Immutable X Revolutionising NFT Gaming Immutable X continues to position itself as a leader in the NFT gaming sector. With partnerships like the one with GameStop to launch an NFT marketplace , the platform is delivering efficient and scalable solutions for gaming enthusiasts. Additionally, its Golden Guardians Survivor NFT collection has been making waves in the crypto community. Yet, recent challenges, such as compromised social media accounts, have underlined the importance of robust security measures. Final Thoughts Cardano and Immutable X are pushing boundaries in governance and gaming, but Qubetics is carving a niche with its interoperability solutions. The ongoing $TICS presale offers a unique opportunity for those looking to invest in a forward-thinking project with significant ROI potential. As always, explore your options and research before making investment decisions.

The price hit a range high of $2.82 before hitting a reverse. However, over the last day, the price has broken through significant resistance levels, first surpassing the $2 mark and then pushing above the $2.50 level. Now, the focus is on the $2.75 to $3 range. The $3 level is particularly important, as it marks a major resistance area on the chart. Once XRP breaks through this level, the next target is the all-time high around $3.30, which is becoming increasingly likely given the current price action. Short-Term Price Action However, if the price experiences any short-term pullbacks, key support levels should come into play. For instance, if there’s a dip, the altcoin can expect strong support at the $2.50 level, as this was a previous resistance point. XRP has been showing repeated patterns of brief pullbacks followed by upward movement, similar to what we’ve seen in the past. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if the price continues to fall further, $2 is another level to watch, as it could act as a strong area of support as well. These support zones are crucial to monitor, as any dips toward these levels could present buying opportunities for those looking to enter or add to their positions. Looking at the Bigger Picture From a larger time frame perspective, the bullish trend remains intact, and we’re getting closer to an all-time high breakout. While short-term pullbacks and volatility are common in any bull market, it’s important not to be discouraged by these movements. The bigger picture for XRP remains bullish, and the potential for new all-time highs is on the horizon. So, even if there are some minor retracements or short-term corrections, the long-term outlook remains positive.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 01:59:26

Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle To fully understand XRP’s surge, we must take a step back to its price during the November 5th elections and its value at the start of the year. Immediately after Donald Trump won, the coin was off to a sluggish start, trading at $1.50 levels. But at the beginning of the year, it was trading at $0.61, reflecting a 350% increase. Thanks to XRP’s bullish movement, Tether has been dethroned from the top cryptos in terms of market caps. But if you think that Ripple’s XRP momentum is about to end, well – think again. According to Crypto Michael, a market psychologist, the altcoin is still trading below its potential peak, and he expects a bigger “FOMO” frenzy soon.

Today, XRP is trading at around $2.73, consolidating its price above $2.50. Last month, its price was hovering near the $0.60 level just before the elections, reflecting a growth of over 400% in just one month. XRP’s thrilling price rally has attracted considerable attention from holders, traders, market analysts, and psychologists.

Ver, known for his early investments in Bitcoin and advocacy for digital assets, is accused of failing to report $50 million in taxes on Bitcoin transactions valued at $240 million in 2017. Additional charges allege that Ver underrepresented the value of his businesses during his 2014 renunciation of U.S. citizenship to avoid higher exit taxes. Roger Ver Fights Tax Evasion Charges According to FOX Business , Roger Ver is challenging allegations that he evaded paying $50 million in taxes on substantial Bitcoin sales in 2017. Prosecutors claim Ver also underreported the value of two companies he owned, MemoryDealers US and Agilestar, when he expatriated in 2014. Allegedly, the underreporting allowed him to avoid a higher exit tax, a levy imposed on unrealized capital gains for individuals relinquishing U.S. citizenship. Ver’s legal team, comprising attorneys from prominent law firms Steptoe LLP and Kimura London & White, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The motion argues that the Justice Department engaged in unconstitutional government overreach and selectively withheld key evidence. It also claims the actions violated Ver’s right to due process. The filing includes correspondence between Ver and his attorneys, indicating his efforts to ensure compliance with crypto tax regulations at the time. Allegations of Government Overreach and Communication Misuse Roger Ver’s legal representatives contend that prosecutors improperly obtained privileged attorney-client communications and used them to build their case. These communications include detailed emails in which Ver sought professional advice to meet his tax obligations, even under ambiguous guidelines. The legal team also claims that the indictment reflects selective enforcement against Roger Ver, a vocal critic of U.S. cryptocurrency regulations . The motion claims crypto tax rules during Ver’s expatriation were unclear, making criminal charges unwarranted. Furthermore, the attorneys assert that the government’s actions violate core constitutional protections for individuals seeking to renounce citizenship. More so, Ver’s defense argue that crypto tax regulations were insufficiently defined at the time of his alleged offenses. The IRS began issuing guidance on virtual assets as property in late 2014, after Ver had renounced his U.S. citizenship. His legal team maintains that Roger Ver relied on attorneys and accountants to comply with all applicable laws. In an email correspondence dated April 2013 and included in the filing, Ver expressed to his lawyer, “I want to make sure that my exit tax payments are as clean as possible, with no room to have trouble from the IRS in the future.” Moreover, emails reveal that Ver’s advisors recommended obtaining third-party appraisals to address the difficulty of valuing Bitcoin accurately, given the low market liquidity in 2014. The defense further argues that any discrepancies were unintentional and do not warrant criminal prosecution. The motion to dismiss is being reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Ver’s attorneys express optimism that the incoming Trump administration, may influence the case’s outcome.

The cryptocurrency’s rapid price increase follows the breakout of a key technical pattern and the formation of a golden cross, both of which suggest further upside potential. With increasing investor optimism and a surge in trading activity, analysts are now eyeing a potential rally that could see BNB’s price climb towards $1,000 in the coming weeks. BNB Price Skyrockets To New ATH The recent rally in BNB price to an all time high is largely attributed to the breakout of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal chart formation. This pattern, which typically marks the end of a downtrend, was confirmed when BNB broke above the $680-$700 resistance zone. This breakout indicates that the bearish trend that had held BNB’s price down has now ended, and the market is shifting toward a bullish sentiment. The breakout from the inverse head and shoulders pattern has led to a projected price target of $780, with the next key resistance level seen around $800. However, some analysts believe that BNB’s rally could go even further. Ali from @ali_charts, a crypto analyst, has projected a potential move for BNB to $1,630, should the weekly close remain above $662. This projection has sparked interest among traders, who are closely monitoring BNB price performance to assess if it can maintain the current momentum and reach these higher targets.

On the BNB/USD chart, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has crossed above the 200-day SMA indicating further positive price momentum and the formation of a golden cross on the chart.. This golden cross means that BNB is expected to keep on rising in the short term and in the long term. The fact that 50-day SMA is currently trading above the 200-day SMA supports the view that BNB is still in the early stages of a long term bullish trend. Golden crosses have often preceded major price rises and are a way for many traders to take long positions. Consequently, the market has developed increased confidence that BNB will keep on ascending towards $1000 in the near future. BNB/USD (Source: TradingView) If bears take the control, the $680-$700 range which had provided resistance earlier can now be expected to provide support. This level coincides with the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern and thus any pullback towards this zone will most probably be perceived as a buying opportunity. The first level of resistance for BNB is at $780. If this level is broken the next major resistance is seen at around $800. Such a breakout above $800 can open the doors for more targets including the $1,630 as projected by Ali. Increased Trading Activity Supports Bullish Momentum BNB’s price surge is also backed by a sharp increase in derivative data trading volume and open interest. Volume has risen by 125.30%, reaching $4.42 billion, while open interest has increased by 33.78%, now totaling $1.46 billion. This uptick in volume and open interest is a strong indication that more traders are entering the market, suggesting growing confidence in BNB’s future performance. Source: Coinglass The rise in open interest signals that traders are taking long positions, expecting the price to continue rising. This growing market engagement further supports the view that BNB could experience further upward movement, potentially pushing the price toward Ali’s ambitious $1,630 target.

Today, December 4, 2024, the giant asset manager Grayscale Investments has officially filed for a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ). Will Solana ETF Get Approval? Under Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in mid-2024. Now, after the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the community is eagerly awaiting altcoin ETFs, with Solana appearing to be next in line. However, with the recent growth of the Solana ecosystem and its native token, firms appear to be filing for or hoping to attach ETFs to the token. Grayscale Spot Solana ETF According to Grayscale’s recent filing, the firm believes that turning its existing Solana Trust into a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), similar to its Bitcoin Trust, would provide investors with a safer and more secure way to invest in Solana (SOL). This move would enable trading on a regulated national securities exchange, making access to the cryptocurrency easier and more reliable. The Grayscale Solana Trust is the largest trust of its kind, currently standing out as the leading Solana (SOL) investment fund by assets under management. According to the data, the firm holds an impressive $134.2 million worth of SOL, which represents nearly 0.1% of SOL’s overall circulating supply. However, the crypto community is expecting quicker approval, as Gensler and his team are set to step down in January 2025. A potential approval of the SOL ETF would make it the United States next crypto-product ETF after BTC and ETH. Solana (SOL) Current Price Momentum Following this filing, the SOL price jumped by 7% and is currently trading near $240.

Grayscale Investments, one of the biggest crypto-product-related asset managers, proposed the Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 03. According to the 19b-4 filings with 112 pages, Grayscale is concerned about the importance of Solana, which is considered one of the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain companies in the world. “Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act” or “’34 Act”)1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,2 NYSE Arca, Inc.

The company based in Connecticut, like any other crypto, were actually released the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) in 2021. If this proposal is accepted, they will be allowed to convert it into Solana spot ETF. This move follows the footsteps of 21Shares, which has already proposed the same product to the commission since June. VanEck, Bitwise, and Canary Capital were also among the earlier asset managers who proposed the product after the success of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) funds this year.

According to the fund statement, the trust had approximately $134.2 million in assets under management (AUM), or equivalent to 0.1% of Solana. They also noted that the large number of assets in Solana is accounted for by a quarter of the million investors in the United States. If the commission accepts it, Grayscale will be the first Solana ETF issuer to have already managed the asset for the next Solana spot ETF. In the past month, Solana’s ( SOL ) price in the crypto market has grown 44% to $235, but the market cap was flipped by Ripple’s XRP after they gained an 81 % increase in just a week.

Legal Expert Breaks Down Why RLUSD Launch Will Fuel XRP Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is preparing to launch a new stablecoin, RLUSD, which is expected to be backed by the U.S. dollar. This new token is anticipated to receive regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) soon. The introduction of RLUSD could give Ripple a new way to offer liquidity to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, boosting its working capital. The stablecoin, RLUSD, is expected to play a key role in Ripple’s global payment solutions, helping improve liquidity and efficiency for partners using Ripple’s ODL service. The launch is being closely watched by the XRP Army, who are hopeful that this move will further drive the adoption of Ripple’s technology. How Will RLUSD Affect XRP’s Value? There is speculation around how the launch of RLUSD will affect the value of XRP. Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli shared his thoughts, explaining that any increase in the usage of a blockchain network can lead to an increase in the value of its native token. He pointed to the example of Bitcoin, where the network’s value is driven by its usage, scarcity, and resistance to censorship. Rispoli said that the value of a blockchain is tied to its adoption and use, not just the supply cap, noting that increased network activity generally results in higher token value. When asked for further clarification on why using the XRPL (Ripple’s ledger) would increase XRP’s value, Rispoli explained that the value of Bitcoin rises due to its use as a scarce and secure form of money. He also said that while the total supply of both Bitcoin and XRP could theoretically be changed in the future, the focus should remain on how the networks are used and the value that usage brings to the ecosystem.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 02:19:20

Roger Ver, who was arrested in Barcelona in April 2024, has now filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. He was indicted on eight counts by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California for evading over $48 million in taxes, reports FOX Business . The charges followed after the former CEO of Bitcoin.com underreported his Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings and other assets in 2014. Now, his lawyers argue that the indictment was influenced by government bias. Ver’s motion to dismiss: Claims of attorney-client privilege violations Ver’s attorneys claim that the Department of Justice inappropriately accessed confidential attorney-client communications and did not reveal key evidence to the grand jury. Ver claims he did what any reasonable person would do, following professional advice based on the limited regulatory guidance available at the time regarding cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, the defense team states that only after Ver’s move to Spain did the IRS start to issue clear directions on crypto-taxes. Only then could a fair market valuation for his Bitcoin holdings be applied, which was difficult to determine due to the asset’s low liquidity and high volatility at the time. The indictment, which was unsealed earlier this year by the U.S Department of Justice, reads , “ The indictment..alleges that by June 2017, Ver’s two companies continued to own approximately 70,000 bitcoins. He was also allegedly required to pay a tax – referred to as an “exit tax” – on those capital gains. By Feb. 4, 2014, Ver and his companies allegedly owned approximately 131,000 bitcoins that traded on several large exchanges for around $871 each. MemoryDealers and Agilestar allegedly held approximately 73,000 of those bitcoins.” The case has attracted a lot of attention from the crypto community, with many condemning the U.S. DOJ for its enforcement-first approach to digital assets, especially under the Biden government which has faced criticism for its perceived ‘ anti-crypto ‘ stance. Critics like Robert Barnes , a civil rights attorney who supports Ver’s case, believe the charges represent selective enforcement. “This is another example of lawfare against the crypto industry, targeting individuals based on political considerations rather than clear evidence of wrongdoing,” said Barnes.

Ver’s trial is set to occur in February of 2025 and hinges upon extradition.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 02:55:00

The recent price increase comes after Grayscale Investments filed with the SEC to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot ETF. Other asset managers, like VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise Asset Management, have also filed for spot Solana ETFs. Key Resistance and Price Targets for Solana Solana has recently completed a correction with an ABC structure, where the price has already dipped into the support zone. This correction seems to be nearing its end, with the potential for Solana to reverse and start moving upwards again. The current price structure suggests that wave five of the correction could be complete. The next significant resistance level for Solana is around $246. If the price breaks through this level, the next major target will be $260. However, a breakout above $260 could push Solana towards its next resistance point at $313. Short-Term Support Levels to Watch If Solana faces a pullback, the initial support zone to watch is between $232 and $233. If the price breaks below this level, the next support areas to consider are $222 and $205. Should Solana break above $246, it will likely turn into new support, leading to a bullish continuation. Impact of Bitcoin and Ethereum on Solana’s Price Movement Solana’s price action tends to follow the market trends of Bitcoin and Ethereum. If Bitcoin and Ethereum experience a significant price movement, Solana is likely to mirror that trend. Therefore, monitoring the movements of these major cryptocurrencies will be crucial for predicting Solana’s next moves. Conclusion There’s a chance that Solana could form a bull flag pattern and break out. If it does, it could test higher levels, possibly around Christmas or early in the new year. With the upcoming changes in crypto regulation, there’s a good chance Solana could make a significant move, with some analysts predicting it could reach $300 or even $400.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 02:59:20

Investment Example: An investment of $45,900 at the current price of $0.0282 per token would acquire approximately 1,628,369 $TICS tokens.

Should the token achieve $1 post-presale, the value could rise to $1,628,369, reflecting an ROI of 3,434%. At $5, the investment’s value could soar to $8,141,845, marking an ROI of 17,571%.

With a mix of established giants and innovative newcomers, the options for savvy investors are expanding. Among the heavyweights like Bitcoin and Ethereum, fresh contenders like Qubetics are making waves, promising unique solutions to real-world problems. So, whether you’re a seasoned trader or just dipping your toes into the crypto waters, let’s dive into the best crypto coins to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS) stands out not just for its novel approach as a Layer 1 Web3 multi-chain aggregator but also for its ongoing presale, which is already in its 11th stage. With over 261 million tokens sold and more than $4.2 million raised, it’s clear that interest is high. This isn’t just another coin; Qubetics aims to solve real-life issues that many other cryptocurrencies have yet to tackle effectively, making it a compelling choice for investors looking for something fresh. 1. Qubetics ($TICS) If you haven’t heard about Qubetics yet, you’re in for a treat. This crypto is not just another addition to the market; it’s the world’s first web3 aggregator designed to simplify and enhance the user experience across multiple chains. With its current presale in the 11th stage, Qubetics has already sold over 261 million tokens, raising more than $4.2 million—a fantastic feat in the crypto space. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its Decentralised VPN application. Imagine a small business owner who needs to protect sensitive customer data while working from a coffee shop. With Qubetics’ Decentralised VPN, they can securely access company resources without risking data breaches. Or consider a freelancer who wants to browse the web safely from various locations. This application enables them to stay anonymous, ensuring their online activities remain private. Why did this coin make it to this list? Analysts are predicting a significant price surge for $TICS, potentially reaching between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch. This makes Qubetics not just a coin to buy but a strategic investment. If you’re considering a stake, even an investment of $7,500 could yield substantial returns as the presale momentum builds. 2. Bitcoin (BTC) Let’s kick things off with the king of cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin. This digital gold has been the go-to for investors since its inception. As of December 2024, Bitcoin shows strong signs of recovery, with analysts projecting a bullish trend as institutional adoption continues to grow. The recent approval of Bitcoin ETFs has also sparked renewed interest, pushing its price back into the spotlight. Bitcoin’s robust network and first-mover advantage keep it at the forefront of the crypto market. Additionally, its scarcity—only 21 million coins will ever exist—adds to its allure as an inflation hedge. Many investors view Bitcoin as a store of value, akin to gold, especially in uncertain economic times. Why did this coin make it to this list? Simply put, Bitcoin remains a safe bet for anyone looking to invest in cryptocurrencies. Its historical resilience and ongoing developments make it a staple in any investor’s portfolio. If you put in $7,500, you’re likely to see profits as the market continues to grow. 3. Ethereum (ETH) Next up is Ethereum, the backbone of decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. With the recent transition to Ethereum 2.0, the network has become more efficient, with lower gas fees and faster transaction times. As developers flock to build on its platform, Ethereum’s utility continues to expand, solidifying its position as a leading cryptocurrency. What’s exciting about Ethereum is its upcoming upgrades aimed at improving scalability and security. With the rise of DeFi (Decentralised Finance) and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), Ethereum is at the heart of these innovations, attracting massive investment flows. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform for innovation. Its potential for growth is immense, making it a must-have for any investor. Investing $7,500 in Ethereum can yield significant returns, especially as more projects launch on its blockchain. 4. Solana (SOL) Don’t sleep on Solana! This blockchain has been making headlines for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. With a focus on scalability, Solana has become a favoured choice for developers looking to launch their dApps quickly and efficiently. As of now, Solana is seeing increased adoption in the NFT space and gaming, which are two of the hottest sectors in crypto right now. The growing ecosystem around Solana, including partnerships with major companies and projects, showcases its potential. With the backing of prominent investors, Solana is positioning itself as a formidable competitor to Ethereum. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s rapid growth and innovative approach make it a top contender. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second is a game-changer. A $7,500 investment in Solana could lead to impressive gains as its ecosystem continues to thrive. 5. Cardano (ADA) Finally, we have Cardano—often dubbed the “Ethereum killer.” Cardano is known for its strong focus on security and sustainability, making it a preferred choice for institutions. Its recent upgrades have enhanced its smart contract capabilities, attracting a variety of projects to its platform. Cardano’s unique approach, using a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, sets it apart from other blockchains. This not only reduces energy consumption but also positions Cardano as a forward-thinking cryptocurrency that prioritises environmental sustainability. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s solid fundamentals and commitment to innovation make it a wise investment choice. As the market matures, a $7,500 investment in Cardano could yield significant returns, especially with its growing ecosystem of dApps. Conclusion In this ever-evolving crypto landscape, the best crypto coins to buy in December 2024 offer a mix of established players and innovative newcomers. From the promising Qubetics to the enduring Bitcoin and Ethereum, there’s a coin for every type of investor. With analysts predicting significant growth for these cryptocurrencies, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the exciting world of crypto and consider making a move on these top coins. Whether you’re a long-term investor or looking to make a quick profit, the opportunities are ripe for the picking. Don’t miss out on securing your financial future—start investing today!

ETH is showing bullish signs and might soon aim for a move above the $3,700 resistance zone. Ethereum remained in a positive zone and stayed above the $3,500 zone. The price is trading above $3,620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $3,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could restart its increase if it clears the $3,700 zone. Ethereum Price Makes Fresh Increase Ethereum price failed to clear the $3,680 resistance zone and corrected some gains like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $3,600 and $3,550 support levels. It even retested the $3,500 support level. A low was formed at $3,505 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $3,600 and $3,620 levels. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,760 swing high to the $3,505 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $3,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,680 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,700 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,760 swing high to the $3,505 low. The main resistance is now forming near $3,750. A clear move above the $3,750 resistance might send the price toward the $3,880 resistance. An upside break above the $3,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,000 resistance zone or even $4,120. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,600 level. The first major support sits near the $3,550 zone. A clear move below the $3,550 support might push the price toward the $3,500 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,420 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,350.

This significant milestone reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market, where attention has shifted from Bitcoin (BTC) to altcoins like BNB and XRP, both of which have demonstrated impressive price movements over the past 48 hours. BNB Price’s 235% Year-to-Date Gain After a prolonged consolidation period between $430 and $600 from September to early November, BNB has surged nearly 25% in just the past two weeks. This increase is part of a capital rotation within the market, drawing investor interest toward cryptocurrencies such as Binance Coin. The token’s breakout above the critical resistance level of $658 marks a pivotal moment, indicating increased buying demand and renewed market confidence. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Year-to-date, BNB has delivered remarkable gains of 235%, especially following a significant downturn earlier in 2023 when the token fell to around $203. This decline was largely attributed to regulatory challenges faced by Binance, including charges of money laundering against the company and its former CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), which ultimately led to CZ stepping down. Although trading volumes on the exchange dropped in response, optimism has resurfaced, particularly with anticipated regulatory changes under the incoming administration of Donald Trump in 2025. In addition, the current US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler, has recently announced its departure effective on January 20, coinciding with Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration. This could pave the way not only for further capital injection into the Binance Coin, but also open a range of new investment vehicles such as the surging crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) market led by Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH). Key Levels To Watch As Binance Coin Approaches $800 BNB’s market cap has surged in tandem with its price, reaching approximately $93 billion before the recent 17% price increase, which pushed its market cap to over $112 billion. This price action has been accompanied by a notable increase in trading volume, which rose 14% in the last 24 hours, totaling just over $5 billion, according to CoinGecko data. These developments have contributed to a strong upward trend, positioning BNB closer to the $800 milestone. However, investor behavior, particularly potential profit-taking, and the maintenance of key support levels will be crucial in determining the token’s trajectory moving forward. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Crypto analyst Ali Martinez previously highlighted a critical price point, suggesting that a weekly close above $662 could set BNB up for a significant move towards $1,630. Interestingly, Binance Coin closed the past week just above this mark at $663, which implies a further surge of approximately 110%, which would represent a major milestone for the token in the coming months. For BNB to maintain this optimistic outlook, it will be essential for the token to consolidate around current trading levels, particularly near the last demand zone at $660. Although this support level is below the current price of $773, it remains a crucial area for sustaining momentum and facilitating potential future gains for Binance Coin.

He specifically called out Milbank LLP for hiring Gurbir Grewal, a former SEC enforcement director, saying it was a “mess up.” But why is this such a big deal for crypto? Let’s dive in. Grewal’s Record: Tensions with Crypto Gurbir Grewal isn’t exactly popular in the crypto world. While he was with the SEC, he led more than 100 enforcement actions against major crypto companies. Along with Coinbase, other crypto exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Gemini were all caught up in his actions. This is not a new problem for crypto firms. The SEC has been going behind them taking legal actions sometimes. They want the exchanges to follow rules when there are no rules established. Coinbase’s Pushback Despite the tension, Grewal defended his actions, saying the SEC wasn’t trying to target crypto, just enforce the law. But many in the crypto world aren’t buying it. They feel the rules are unclear, and that the SEC’s stance isn’t helping anyone. So, Coinbase decided to push back. The company even took the SEC to court, demanding clearer rules for digital assets. Eugene Scalia from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher is representing them in this fight. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, took to social media to make one thing clear: any law firm that hires lawyers like Grewal is going to lose Coinbase’s business. It’s a bold move, and it’s clear that Coinbase isn’t backing down from this battle. This shouldn't be terribly complicated to understand. 1/4 https://t.co/LtMbY2WSrA — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 3, 2024 What Happens Next? Coinbase’s warning to law firms is shaking things up. Legal experts are saying this could cost firms big money if they choose to work with controversial figures like Grewal. And with a possible shift in leadership on the horizon, the SEC’s tough stance on crypto might change. If that happens, it could change how crypto businesses and law firms approach the whole regulatory mess.",News|Crypto Vs SEC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 03:33:37

Current SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he will step down on January 20 when Trump is inaugurated. Atkins, who served as an SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, is well-respected in conservative legal circles and among the Republican establishment. One major case before the federal courts is the ongoing Ripple (XRP) lawsuit, in which the SEC claims Ripple violated securities laws by issuing XRP. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP was not a security when sold to retail investors on exchanges but was a security in institutional sales. The SEC initially sought a $2 billion fine against Ripple but was instead given a $125 million penalty. In October 2024, Judge Torres rejected the SEC’s request to appeal, saying they didn’t have strong enough reasons. Despite this, the SEC appealed to the Second Circuit Court, arguing the decision went against Supreme Court rulings. ‘Paul Atkins is not what Trump Needs’ John Deaton recently explained that Paul Atkins would be a very traditional choice, one that Wall Street would likely approve of. He stated that Atkins is someone who respects the SEC and its staff, but what is truly needed is someone who challenges the SEC’s actions. Deaton believes the SEC has harmed investors, rather than protecting them, and that a change in attitude is necessary. While Deaton would support Atkins if chosen, he feels he’s not the right fit if President Trump aims to bring change to crypto regulation. Trump picks former SEC head Paul Atkins to chair his SEC. Pros: He has advocated for reasonable (and workable) regulation in the digital asset space – especially with the exchanges. He's a steady hand who was SEC chair for 8 years. It will be hard for the Dems to attack him.… https://t.co/3RgVq0PxRL — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) December 3, 2024 Attorney Jeremy Hogan mentioned the cons of Atkins’ appointment and wrote, “He won’t be the bull in the china shop many in the crypto space want. He will make measured and deliberate changes. Overall, I give his appointment a B+ for the digital asset industry, and that was good enough to get me a law degree so, yeah!”",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 03:42:10

The Altcoin Season Index hitting an all-time high of 88/100 signals a massive shift in focus to alts, and Solana is once again in the spotlight. Alongside market giants like $ XRP , which exploded 400% in November, $ BNB (new ATH at $770, just now), and $ HBAR , which continues its ETF-driven rally, Solana stands at a crossroads. Source: coinmarket.com Having recently set a new all-time high (ATH) of $264, surpassing its 2021 record, Solana has entered a critical consolidation phase. While XRP and HBAR thrive on institutional buzz, Solana’s recent stagnation raises questions: Is this a healthy pause before price discovery, or is there resistance to further growth? With Greyscale filing for a Solana ETF, the asset is undoubtedly primed for institutional attention, making now the perfect time to dissect Solana’s next moves. Current Situation: From Deep Accumulation to Smart Profit-Taking Solana's journey has been nothing short of remarkable. After setting its previous ATH of $260 in 2021, the bear market was brutal. Following the FTX collapse in late 2022, Solana hit lows of $6-$10, levels that seemed to solidify a near-death narrative. However, a prolonged accumulation phase throughout 2023 and early 2024 paved the way for a stunning recovery. Those smart investors who bought in at these rock-bottom levels are now seeing ROI upwards of 25-40x, explaining the current profit-taking pressure at the recent ATH of $264. However, this consolidation isn’t a cause for concern but rather a natural market cycle of profit-taking and positioning for the next leg up. Combined with Solana’s fundamentals and ETF buzz, this phase is laying the groundwork for a new wave of institutional and retail demand. Fundamentals: Where Solana Shines (and Struggles) The Case for Solana’s Strength Solana’s fundamentals are outstanding, combining innovation, growth, and institutional appeal: Scalability and Speed: Solana consistently leads in transactions per second (TPS), positioning it as the fastest layer-1 blockchain. Ecosystem Growth: Solana’s ecosystem boasts a thriving NFT marketplace, record-breaking DeFi activity, and high developer engagement, as highlighted by Messari's on-chain reports. It’s the blockchain of choice for cutting-edge applications. Institutional Appeal: Fidelity’s ETF application is a game-changer, aligning Solana with Bitcoin and Ethereum in institutional narratives. This alone could drive billions of dollars into Solana upon approval, marking it as a top contender for the next institutional favorite. Tokenomics and Inflation Market Cap: $112.49 billion, ranking Solana as the 5th largest cryptocurrency. Inflation: Solana’s circulating supply has grown by 17.02% year-over-year (source: Messari). While its ecosystem’s adoption rate and activity often offset this inflation, long-term growth may face limitations compared to deflationary or capped-supply cryptos like Ethereum. Fundamental Rating: 8.8/10 Solana shines in adoption and innovation but must address inflationary concerns to fully match Ethereum’s deflationary edge. Technical Analysis: The Blueprint for Traders Solana’s price action has displayed critical developments over time: After reclaiming $210 post-election (November 6), it flipped this major resistance into support, bolstered by massive volume. The recent ATH of $264 was marked by exhaustion in buying pressure, signaling profit-taking from long-term holders. The $186-$189 zone, a major resistance in mid-2024, has since transformed into a strong support level. Moving averages, particularly the 100-day and 200-day MAs, are climbing toward the $186 level, reinforcing its importance as a dip-buying opportunity. Future price continuation hinges on maintaining key support zones and breaking above $270, which would trigger explosive upward momentum. Here’s the actionable roadmap for traders: Strategy 1: “Dip Buy Setup – Catch It Low or Let It Go” If Bitcoin faces rejection at $100K, Solana will likely follow broader market corrections. Look for key levels: $210-$215: This high-probability buy zone is supported by the 50-day MA, which provides strong dynamic support. $186-$189: A critical level flipped into support on November 6, following massive volume during Election Day. Additionally, both the 100-day and 200-day MAs are climbing toward this level, further strengthening it as a buy-the-dip target. Adding moonbag potential: For long-term holders, these dips could serve as prime accumulation zones for moonbags (long-term holdings to ride explosive future growth). Strategy 2: “The Balanced Play – Buy Now, Watch ATH Levels” Buying at current levels ($236-$240) lets you participate in the rally while managing risk: Support Zone: $210-$215 is a critical must-hold level. A breakdown here signals further downside. Resistance at ATH: Pay close attention to the $260-$264 zone. A rejection here confirmed by: Volume divergence (lower buy volume near ATH). RSI signals (overbought on lower timeframes). Would indicate potential range-bound trading below $260. Trim positions or trade the range if necessary. Upside Scenario: A breakout above $270 could result in fireworks, with targets at $300 (psychological level)—and who knows how much higher. Use trailing stops to secure profits on this move. Strategy 3: “Breakout Chase – Ride the Momentum” The safest play is waiting for Solana to decisively break above $264 and confirm price discovery: Confirmation Signal: A daily close above $264 with significant volume. Targets: Fibonacci extensions suggest levels at $300, $320, and $350, supported by higher timeframe cup-and-handle patterns. Moonbag Strategy: For breakout traders, setting a moonbag portion above $300 allows you to ride further uncharted gains while locking in profits on the initial move. Post-breakout, $260-$265 becomes critical support. Monitor this zone carefully—if it holds, it confirms sustainability. Trend Health: Is Solana Ready for Takeoff? Volume: Diminished post-ATH, signaling buyer exhaustion. However, ETF news or a BTC rally could reignite momentum. Moving Averages: The 50-day MA ($210) acts as strong dynamic support, while the 200-day MA ($186) protects against deeper corrections. Relative Strength vs. Bitcoin: Solana’s BTC pair is trading near a multi-year resistance. A breakout above 0.0028 BTC would signal strength and decoupling, opening the doors for independent rallies. Institutional Demand: Solana vs XRP and HBAR While XRP and HBAR ride their ETF narratives, Solana is just entering the game: XRP: XRP saw 400% gains in November after multiple ETF filings and renewed institutional confidence post-SEC settlement. HBAR: Its enterprise focus and ETF buzz make it a top performer in altcoin season. Solana: Greyscale’s ETF application positions Solana as the next institutional favorite, especially as it combines enterprise adoption with DeFi and retail appeal. ETF approval could drive exponential demand. Summary: Solana’s Path Forward Solana’s $264 ATH and ETF buzz set the stage for explosive growth, but inflation and consolidation demand caution. Whether you: Buy the dip during corrections, Trade the current range, or Wait for a confirmed breakout, having a clear plan is critical. The $186-$189 zone and $210-$215 support levels offer prime opportunities to build positions or hold moonbags, while $260-$265 holds the key to sustained rallies. With $112 billion in market cap, Solana trails XRP’s $145 billion, setting the stage for crypto’s next big rivalry. Will Solana overtake XRP? Only time will tell. As altcoin dominance surges, Solana’s blend of innovation, ecosystem growth, and institutional interest makes it a standout. The question isn’t if Solana will break higher—it’s when.

Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio Remains Low For Top Coins According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, sentiment around digital assets has been low recently, even for the coins that have enjoyed historic runs. The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio,” which, as its name suggests, tells us about how the positive and negative comments about a given asset being made by social media users currently compare. This metric sources data from major social media platforms like X, Telegram, Reddit, and 4Chan. It puts these posts/messages/threads containing mentions of the relevant term through a machine-learning model to differentiate between positive and negative ones, and finds the difference in their count. Related Reading: Strong Bitcoin Rise “Expected Within 1-2 Months,” Quant Explains Why When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the posts about a positive sentiment outweigh the ones containing a negative sentiment. On the other hand, being negative implies that a bearish mentality is dominant on social media. Here is a chart showing the recent trend in the Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio for five assets: Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM). As displayed in the above graph, the Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio has remained almost neutral for all these cryptocurrencies recently. This suggests the market isn’t leaning one way or the other. The trend is interesting, considering XRP, Cardano, and Stellar have seen massive price surges. Generally, positive comments tend to spike when such rallies occur, like they did for Bitcoin early last month when Donald Trump won the US Presidential Elections. Historically, digital assets have often shown moves opposite to what the crowd expects. This means that a price correction can become probable whenever bullish sentiment grows too big.

The Positive Sentiment Vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio could still be to keep an eye on in the near future, however, as social media sentiment can sometimes flip very quickly, especially if some big news comes out. A spike in the indicator would naturally be a bearish sign for the market. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.58, up almost 17% over the past seven days.

37197526,https://invezz.com/?p=2352473,1733288937,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Here’s why the EOS, NEO, and BitTorrent prices are surging",https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/04/heres-why-the-eos-neo-and-bittorrent-prices-are-surging/,"Old-school cryptocurrencies are in a strong bull run this week, largely outperforming newer ones. EOS price jumped to a high of $1.5230, its highest level since September 22. It has jumped in the past five consecutive weeks and is up by 250% from its lowest level this year. NEO, another cryptocurrency, jumped to $26.14, its highest level since April 2022. BitTorrent price jumped to $0.000001910, up by 176% from its lowest level this year. Inspired by Ripple and Stellar The main reason for the ongoing EOS, NEO, and BitTorrent prices is that they have been inspired by the recent success of Ripple (XRP) and Stellar Lumens (XLM), which have soared by almost 500% in the past 30 days. Ripple’s market cap has also jumped to over $125 billion, making it the third biggest crypto in the industry. It is slowly nearing its all-time high Similarly, Stellar Lumens , the popular payment-focused coin has also jumped, mirroring that of Ripple. The two have a common history since Jed McCaleb, Stellar’s founder, was also on the team that started Ripple Labs . The two coins have risen because of the recent Donald Trump victory, which promises changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gary Gensler is expected to resign in January, while Trump is considering picking Paul Atkins to be the next head of the agency. The new changes mean that Ripple’s legal challenges could end soon, and that a spot XRP ETF will be listed as soon as in 2025. Ripple has largely won the case brought in 2020. In July last year, a judge ruled that XRP was not a security but that Ripple Labs had committed a crime in its fundraising. As a result, she ordered the company to pay a $250 million fine earlier this year, much lower than the $2 billion that the agency was seeking. The SEC has pledged to appeal the ruling, putting Ripple Labs in legal jeopardy. Therefore, EOS, NEO, and BitTorrent are rising as many cryptocurrencies that became hugely popular in 2021 aim to be the next XRP. Indeed, many others, including Litecoin, Tron, and Bitcoin Cash have all gone vertical. EOS price analysis Technicals also explain why coins like EOS and NEO are soaring. The weekly chart shows that the EOS price has bounced back after being in a consolidation between $0.4325 and $1.3640 in the past three years. It formed a triple bottom at $0.4325 and has now jumped above its neckline at $1.3640. EOS price has moved above the 50-week moving average, signaling that the uptrend may continue. If this happens, the next key resistance level to watch will be at $3, the highest point in March 2022. If that happens, it will imply a 115% above the current level. Neo price forecast The weekly chart shows a close similarity between the EOS and NEO prices. It has formed a cup and handle pattern and is attempting to rise above the key resistance level at $24.18, its highest level in April 2024. The NEO price has jumped above the 50-week moving average, while oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have continued to point upwards. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the next important resistance level at $50 in the near term. A drop below the support at $20 will invalidate the bullish view. BitTorrent price analysis The daily chart shows that the BitTorrent token has jumped, mirroring the performance of Tron, which has surged to a record high. BTT and TRX are related because they are owned by Justin Sun. The BTT token has formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed each other. It is also forming a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $0.0000022, its highest level in March. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target that level, which is about 30% above the current level.

On Earth, companies like MARA are taking advantage of renewable energy to power data centers with repurposed ASICs to reduce costs and environmental impact. Meanwhile, Foundry, the world's largest Bitcoin mining pool, is restructuring to focus on core operations post-halving. Virgin Voyages is embracing Bitcoin in another way by now accepting BTC for its exclusive ”Annual Pass,” which offers unlimited cruises for $120,000. Bitcoin Mining in Space Gains Traction Peter Todd recently sparked some interest with his blog post exploring the feasibility of establishing Bitcoin mining operations in space. Todd argues that mining crypto in space is not only technically possible with current technology but could also become economically viable if the costs of space cargo launches decrease. The concept of space-based crypto mining has been discussed for years already, and certain benefits like unlimited solar energy and the elimination of Earth-based carbon emissions are often mentioned. However, critics warn that the high costs of launching, constructing, and maintaining mining facilities in space could lead to centralized control by entities with larger financial resources. While these concerns are still an issue, Todd directly challenges some of the common technical objections to space mining. In his blog post, Todd brushed off the belief that cooling systems for mining hardware would struggle in space because of the absence of air. Instead, he explains that radiative cooling, which is a process where heat dissipates through thermal radiation , could very effectively tackle this issue. He also dismissed concerns about latency, and explained that careful positioning in a sun-synchronous orbit would minimize delays to negligible levels. Overall, Todd is convinced that there are no fundamental technological barriers preventing the development of space-based mining stations. Todd did acknowledge that economic feasibility is still a key hurdle. He believes there is a need to reduce launch costs to achieve profitability. If launch costs can align with the economic potential of mining operations, space mining could become a reality. The possibility of reduced launch costs are not that far fetched, especially with some of the recent advancements in space exploration led by SpaceX . The company’s Starship rocket set new records for payload capacity and thrust. CEO Elon Musk envisions making space travel a lot more affordable and practical. Some of Musk’s long-term goals include the colonization of Mars. If successful, these innovations could pave the way for more cost-effective extraterrestrial ventures, including crypto mining. Whether or not this concept actually materializes in the near future, it still serves as a glimpse into the exciting possibilities for Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Renewable Energy Powers MARA's ASIC Initiative Conventional crypto mining companies are also exploring innovative ways of doing business. MARA, which was formerly known as Marathon Digital, acquired a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas, as part of its Advanced ASIC Retirement Initiative. The facility has 114 MW of operational wind generation and 240 MW of interconnection capacity. The acquisition ensures the wind farm's energy will not be curtailed due to excess interconnection capacity , which is a very common issue with alternative power sources in the United States. Instead of connecting the facility to the power grid, MARA plans to use the energy directly to power a data center. This center will run last-generation application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which would otherwise be thrown out or sold on secondary markets. MARA’s chairman and CEO, Fred Thiel is taking the company’s commitment to environmental stewardship very seriously, and believes in the benefits of repurposing ASICs and leveraging zero-marginal-cost renewable energy to lower Bitcoin production costs through vertical integration. As of late 2023, MARA operates a fleet of around 200,000 ASICs . The company is still the largest publicly listed Bitcoin miner despite facing a $124.8 million net loss in the third quarter of 2024. This was partly due to a $40 million increase in operational expenses. However, MARA still reported a 34.5% year-on-year revenue increase for the same quarter, reaching $131.6 million. Adding to its strength, MARA disclosed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it bought 6,484 BTC between October and November of 2024 for $618.3 million in cash. As a result, its total treasury stands at approximately 34,797 BTC, which is valued at around $3.3 billion. In October, the company also achieved its highest production since the April halving by mining 717 BTC. Foundry Restructures with 27% Staff Layoffs Foundry, the largest Bitcoin mining pool globally, laid off 27% of its workforce as part of a planned restructuring. The cuts affected 16% of its U.S.-based employees and a portion of its team in India, according to sources. Foundry's parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), revealed plans to spin off Foundry’s self-mining business into a separate entity still under DCG’s control. This move is part of a strategic effort to refocus Foundry on its core operations as the top Bitcoin mining pool and to expand its site operations business. Bitcoin mining pools comparison (Source: Hashrate Index ) Foundry USA, the mining pool operated by Foundry, controls approximately one-third of the global market share among pool operators, which makes it a very dominant player in the industry. Alongside its mining pool operations, Foundry also runs a self-mining business that DCG estimates will generate close to $80 million in revenue by the end of 2024. DCG believes that spinning off the self-mining business as a standalone subsidiary will strengthen its operations. The company also plans to bring in external hires and raise additional capital to support the initiative. Foundry’s restructuring is nothing new, as it reflects broader trends in the Bitcoin mining industry where companies are adapting to the challenges posed after the April halving. This event cuts the number of BTC mined per block in half, which increased operational costs and mining difficulty. Despite these challenges, miners continue to invest in new infrastructure and expand their operations in anticipation of future price increases, according to CoinShares’ Q3 mining report . Virgin Cruises Now Payable with Bitcoin Other companies are also embracing Bitcoin in new and exciting ways. Virgin Voyages announced the launch of its “ Annual Pass ” program for 2025, along with its entry into crypto acceptance by becoming the first cruise product to accept Bitcoin. The new program allows passengers to enjoy unlimited cruises for a year, starting at $120,000 plus taxes, payable in Bitcoin. The company did not share any plans to expand its crypto options to include stablecoins or altcoins. The Annual Pass builds on the success of Virgin’s previous “Season Pass” program, which targeted remote workers with a “work from sea” experience. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is excited about the unlimited travel opportunities it offers across a variety of destinations. The pass includes double-occupancy access to a Sea Terrace cabin, which features a private balcony, along with perks like laundry service, internet access, and a $100 bar tab for each voyage. By integrating Bitcoin, Virgin Voyages positioned itself as a leader in adopting crypto in the travel industry. This move could be very attractive to some whales who might see the offering as a unique way to spend their crypto. While not matching the extravagant lifestyles of yachts and luxury cars often associated with the crypto elite, the Annual Pass still provides an exclusive travel experience.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-04 05:12:43

Let’s dive into the market’s latest updates and analyze the trends shaping December 4. Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $96,000 Bitcoin is trading at $95,900, with a 24-hour range of $93,629 to $96,669. The flagship cryptocurrency’s market cap is impressive $1.9 trillion, supported by a trading volume of $70 billion. However, its market dominance dipped slightly to 54.11%. Source: CoinMarketCap Ark & 21Shares sold $93 million worth of BTC on the institutional front, while Fidelity recorded $52 million in inflows, reflecting mixed sentiment. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s ETF data remains pending, fueling speculation among investors. Additionally, Bitcoin mining giant Foundry reduced its workforce to streamline operations, hinting at a focus on efficiency amid rising competition. Tron (TRX) soars over 70% Tron has emerged as one of the biggest gainers, surging over 70% in 24 hours to trade at $0.38. Its market cap has reached $32 billion, with a trading volume of $12 billion. This rally has propelled Tron into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, signaling growing investor confidence. Ethereum (ETH) gains 1% Ethereum is trading at $3,667, marking a modest 1% increase in the past 24 hours. Its market cap is $441 billion, with trading volume hitting $40 billion. Inflows into Ethereum ETFs reached $67 million, primarily driven by Fidelity’s $73 million contribution. Meanwhile, Solana rose 5% to $238, buoyed by Grayscale’s application for a Solana ETF with the SEC. The move underscores institutional interest in Solana’s blockchain ecosystem, which is gaining traction for its speed and scalability. Reserve Rights (RSR) rockets 55% Reserve Rights stole the spotlight with a stunning 55% gain, trading at $0.026. This surge follows speculation that Paul Atkins could potentially lead the US SEC under a future Trump administration, sparking renewed interest in the token. XRP drops 6% amid regulatory shifts XRP is trading at $2.55, reflecting a 6% decline. Ripple’s legal battle continues to make headlines as Jorge Tenreiro, Ripple’s lead attorney, joined the SEC as Chief Litigation Counsel. This development could signal stricter crypto regulations ahead. Source: CoinMarketCap Meme coins show mixed performance Meme coins saw varied price movements. Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 2% to $0.41, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) rose 3% to $0.00003015. Other meme tokens, including PEPE and WIF, showed minor gains, with Bonk slipping slightly. Top losers: Kaia and Flare Network Kaia (KAIA) was the day’s worst performer, losing 17% to trade at $0.34. Similarly, Flare Network (FLR) dropped 10%, settling at $0.034.

Many of today’s trading bots struggle to meet the needs of modern traders, bogged down by outdated systems, overly complex designs, and questionable value propositions. This stagnant environment has frustrated countless traders, waiting for a solution that works in their favor. Enter FatBot , the upcoming release from the FATTY ecosystem, which promises to rewrite crypto trading rules. Unlike the tools that dominate the market today, FatBot isn’t about doing the bare minimum—it’s about innovation, simplicity, and delivering results. With its launch just around the corner, excitement is building for good reason. We will explain why in this article. Why FatBot Is Worth the Hype FATTY, the crypto project that recently launched the presale of its utility token, $FATTY, is set to launch another big tool soon — FatBot, an innovative trading bot. But what sets FatBot apart from the countless trading bots currently available? Well, it’s a simple yet powerful concept: a bot that works for you, not against you. FatBot addresses three major pain points plaguing traders today: Clunky and outdated systems – Many trading bots fail to keep up with the fast-moving crypto industry, leaving traders stuck with tools that can’t handle the demands of modern markets. Overly complex user interfaces – Trading doesn’t need to be a headache. FatBot promises a user-friendly design approachable for everyone, from beginners to seasoned traders. Flawed monetization strategies – FatBot avoids squeezing users with hidden fees or poor value propositions, focusing instead on delivering meaningful benefits to its community. One of FatBot’s standout features is its Sniping 2.0 functionality. While most bots rely on basic trade executions, FatBot offers precision and flexibility by allowing users to set custom trade criteria. So, whether you’re targeting a fast-rising memecoin or aiming for calculated moves in volatile markets, Sniping 2.0 ensures you’re always ahead of the curve. This advanced tool doesn’t just perform well—it excels, delivering up to 100 more snipes than traditional bots. In a space where milliseconds can make or break a trade, this feature alone positions FatBot as a game-changer. Built by Experts, Designed for Success FatBot is the result of over a year of dedicated development by CleevioX, a team that’s already proven its expertise by creating one of the top 5 trading bots in the industry. By collaborating with Moon5 Labs, they’ve combined technical excellence with innovative thinking to deliver a bot that’s as reliable as it is advanced. And it’s not just about the tech. Transparency has been at the heart of FatBot’s development, with FATTY informing its community at every step. This commitment to trust and openness is a key reason the ecosystem has attracted so much early interest. A Thriving Ecosystem Backing FatBot FatBot’s launch isn’t happening in isolation—it’s part of the broader FATTY ecosystem, which has already proven its value through the success of the $FATTY token and the FatBoy P2E game. The ongoing $FATTY token presale has been a huge success, raising $5.6 million and attracting over 8,000 investors. At just $0.025 per token, the presale offers an incredible opportunity for early adopters. Once the presale ends, the price will jump to $0.030, giving early investors an immediate advantage. What makes $FATTY particularly appealing is its unique utility. It’s a key part of the ecosystem: Revenue Sharing – 50% of all fees collected in the ecosystem are redistributed to $FATTY holders in ETH and SOL, creating a steady stream of passive income. Sniping 2.0 Integration – Holding $FATTY tokens enhances FatBot’s capabilities, offering faster trade executions for those with larger holdings. The process is simple for those eager to join. $FATTY tokens can be purchased on the official website using a range of payment methods, including ETH, USDT, BNB, and traditional options like Visa and Mastercard. The Future of Trading As FatBot’s launch approaches, it’s clear that this is the next step in the evolution of crypto trading. FatBot has the potential to redefine what traders expect from their tools, offering a combination of precision, simplicity, and profitability that’s unmatched in the current market. For anyone looking to gain an edge in trading, FatBot represents a unique opportunity to be part of something transformative. And with the $FATTY ecosystem already proving its strength, this launch’s excitement is well-deserved.

Grayscale has filed with the SEC to launch a spot Solana ETF, potentially converting its existing Solana Trust into a publicly traded product on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, Orbitt has rolled out a staking program for its native token, ORBT, featuring a $2.5 million rewards pool and innovative buyback mechanisms to drive growth and engagement. Grayscale Files for Spot Solana ETF Amid Growing Competition and Solana’s Meteoric Rise Grayscale Investments, a leading digital asset manager, has officially filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, the ETF, under the ticker GSOL, will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking a significant development in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency ETFs. The filing, submitted on Dec. 3, proposes the conversion of the existing Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot ETF. This approach mirrors Grayscale’s earlier moves, where the company successfully converted its Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) trusts into ETFs. The potential approval of the Solana ETF would add another major milestone to Grayscale's portfolio. According to Grayscale's 19b-4 filing , the Grayscale Solana Trust is the largest Solana investment fund globally by assets under management (AUM), with holdings valued at approximately $134.2 million. This figure represents a considerable stake, accounting for roughly 0.1% of all Solana (SOL) tokens in circulation. The trust's transformation into a spot ETF would enhance its accessibility to retail and institutional investors, potentially driving further interest and investment in Solana’s ecosystem. Grayscale has appointed Coinbase Custody as the custodian for the ETF, ensuring the secure storage of its SOL holdings. Additionally, BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, a division of The Bank of New York Mellon, will act as the administrator and transfer agent for the trust. Grayscale’s filing comes at a time of intense competition among asset managers vying for SEC approval to list spot Solana ETFs. Other prominent firms, including 21Shares, Canary Capital, VanEck, and Bitwise, have also submitted proposals for similar products. Franklin Templeton, a heavyweight in traditional asset management, is reportedly exploring the possibility of launching its own spot Solana ETF, further heating up the race. Despite the crowded field, Grayscale’s existing position as the largest Solana investment fund may provide a strategic advantage. The company has already demonstrated its ability to navigate regulatory hurdles, as evidenced by its successful Bitcoin and Ether ETF conversions. To proceed, Grayscale must not only secure approval for its 19b-4 filing—which notifies the SEC of a proposed rule change by a financial regulatory body—but also file an S-1 registration statement. The S-1 approval would be critical, allowing Grayscale to list GSOL on public stock exchanges. The SEC’s decision will likely depend on its assessment of market maturity, surveillance mechanisms, and investor protection measures. The regulatory body has historically been cautious about approving spot cryptocurrency ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation and insufficient oversight. However, the tide appears to be shifting, with the SEC recently displaying a more open stance toward crypto-based investment products. Solana’s Meteoric Rise The filing coincides with Solana's impressive market performance over the past year. The cryptocurrency has surged 277% in the last 12 months, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $112 billion. Currently trading at $238 per token, Solana has experienced a nearly 4% price increase since Grayscale’s filing. The blockchain's high-speed transaction capabilities and low fees have positioned it as a formidable competitor to Ethereum and other smart contract platforms. Solana's growing adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications has fueled its price rally and attracted significant investor interest. Grayscale's move signals an increasing demand for cryptocurrency ETFs as a gateway for traditional investors to access digital assets. Spot ETFs, in particular, provide direct exposure to underlying cryptocurrencies, offering a simpler and more transparent alternative to futures-based ETFs. The launch of a spot Solana ETF could further legitimize the cryptocurrency in the eyes of mainstream investors, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Moreover, it shines the spotlight on the ongoing evolution of financial markets as they adapt to the digital asset revolution. As Grayscale competes with its rivals and navigates regulatory scrutiny, the outcome of its filing will be closely watched by market participants. An approval could set a precedent for future spot cryptocurrency ETFs and potentially accelerate the integration of blockchain assets into the global financial system. Orbitt Launches ORBT Staking Program with $2.5 Million in Rewards, Revolutionizing Solana’s Ecosystem Solana's innovative network hub, Orbitt (ORBT), has unveiled its much-anticipated staking program, providing a substantial $2.5 million rewards pool for participants. Launched on Dec. 3, 2024, this program is designed to enhance community engagement, drive governance participation, and deliver consistent value for ORBT token holders. With its innovative features, including a buyback mechanism and tiered reward structure, the initiative aims to solidify Orbitt’s position as a leading player in Solana's ecosystem. The new staking program empowers ORBT holders to generate rewards while actively participating in the protocol’s governance and ecosystem. By staking ORBT, participants can unlock access to Orbitt’s flagship services, such as Orbitt PAD—a launchpad for vetted, high-potential projects seeking funding, development, and marketing support. The most promising projects on Orbitt PAD will also receive investments of up to $100,000, positioning them for successful launches and long-term growth. This dual benefit of community rewards and ecosystem support ensures a mutually beneficial relationship between stakers and Orbitt’s broader ecosystem. Pixel, the founder of Orbitt, expressed excitement about the staking program’s potential to drive organic growth and foster a stronger community: “We’re thrilled to bring ORBT staking to our community and reward those who believe in our long-term vision. This program exemplifies Orbitt’s dedication to sustainable growth and genuine value creation.” Orbitt’s Chief Marketing Officer echoed this sentiment, highlighting the program’s focus on rewarding trust and fostering participation within a community-driven ecosystem. A cornerstone of the ORBT staking program is its novel buyback mechanism, which ensures a steady flow of rewards for participants. Orbitt has allocated 25% of the total ORBT token supply—over five million tokens—to a buyback wallet dedicated to supporting the staking initiative. These tokens are not stagnant; instead, they are replenished using fees generated by Orbitt’s MM Volume Booster services, which purchase ORBT tokens from the market. This buyback mechanism not only sustains the rewards pool but also strengthens ORBT’s market dynamics by creating consistent demand, driving up the token’s value over time. Tiered Rewards Structure Incentivizes Long-Term Commitment The staking program is designed with a time-based tier system to incentivize long-term participation. Stakers can earn progressively higher rewards based on the duration of their commitment: 30 Days: Participants receive a 2x reward multiplier. 90 Days: Rewards increase to a 3x multiplier. 180 Days: Long-term stakers enjoy a maximum reward multiplier of 4x. This tiered structure is evidence of Orbitt’s emphasis on rewarding loyal community members who contribute to the platform’s stability and growth. Orbitt has carved a niche as a one-stop cryptocurrency ecosystem offering a range of B2B products on the Solana blockchain. The launch of its staking program is a strategic move to elevate its offerings and solidify its position as a leading network hub. By integrating staking rewards with tangible ecosystem benefits, such as Orbitt PAD and buyback mechanisms, Orbitt is redefining how blockchain projects drive community engagement and sustainable growth. The ORBT staking program marks a significant milestone for Orbitt and Solana's blockchain ecosystem. By offering substantial rewards and fostering active community participation, the program has the potential to attract a broader audience of investors and developers. Furthermore, the innovative buyback mechanism could serve as a model for other projects looking to align tokenomics with long-term growth. For Solana , Orbitt’s staking initiative enhances its appeal as a blockchain network capable of hosting robust, scalable ecosystems. With the cryptocurrency market increasingly favoring utility-driven tokens and community-centric platforms, Orbitt’s approach could position Solana as a frontrunner in blockchain innovation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-04 05:25:55

They say the former could rally to $200 while the latter might give investors 10x returns. Lunex’s potential gains have attracted Sui (SUI) investors as the token battle with bears. The cryptocurrency is on the brink of losing the $3 support level if the bearish momentum continues. Litecoin (LTC) Eyes Potential Upside To $200 The Litecoin token is trading in the green region as optimism builds up due to a potential LTC ETF hitting the market. Per CoinMarketCap , the value of Litecoin (LTC) has soared by 26.7% on the 7-day chart. The cryptocurrency is also bullish on the higher timeframes. On the 30-day level, the Litecoin price is up 74.6%. On the 14-day chart, there is a profit of 36.1%. Looking ahead, analysts are optimistic about the future of this altcoin . CryptoBullet, an anonymous trader, said on Sunday that the Litecoin price was trying to break out. In the case of a successful breakout, he forecasts a potential target of $233-$280. Also, prominent trader Peter Brandt wonders whether LTC could “pull another XRP” and soar to $420. Presently, the cryptocurrency’s relative strength index is above 70, signaling a high number of buyers. Also, the Hull Moving Average (9) and Average Directional Index (14) are displaying buy signals pointing to a potential uptrend. Sui (SUI) Price Plummets After a terrific price pump, the Sui coin has come under attack from bears. The Solana killer is currently on a downtrend and might lose the $3 level unless more buyers enter the market. Data from CoinMarketCap reveals the Sui (SUI) price has dipped 4.1% on the 7-day chart. There is also a loss of 11.2% in the 14-day chart. Despite the bearish trend, experts are looking forward to a trend reversal. They expect the Sui price to recover and soar to new peaks in the next few weeks. Paraboli8crypto says the value of the altcoin might rally to $10 before the end of December. Another analyst called CryptoBullet told his followers not to panic. According to him, pullbacks are healthy for the Sui crypto. He said the Sui token could rally to a range of $4.7-5.2 in the coming weeks. The coin’s technical indicators currently support this prediction. The relative strength index is above the midline, for example. The Hull Moving Average (9) is also flashing a buy signal. Lunex Network (LNEX) Presale Gains More Momentum Lunex Network (LNEX) continues to attract a lot of interest from investors in the DeFi market . Its ongoing ICO has already garnered over $4 million, and $LNEX tokens cost $0.0036. This strong start is attributed to growing confidence in Lunex’s early-stage concept of decentralized finance. And as the presale continues, the analysts have predicted a 10x increase for $LNEX. A special feature of Lunex is the possibility of exchanging assets between different blockchains. With the help of cross-chain swapping, one can swap over 50,000 tokens without any difficulty. As active traders are always in search of opportunities to minimize their time cross-chain trading becomes a crucial tool for those in the decentralized finance industry. Another feature is the B2B payment gateway that allows organizations to accept cryptocurrency and instantly convert it into fiat. This feature provides simple answers to how companies can embrace cryptocurrency in their operations. In addition, Lunex Network has a portfolio tracker. It provides you with an overall view of all investments, including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and ETFs. Portfolio tracking and control are made easy by the convenience of the users.

The TOTAL3, which excludes Bitcoin and Ethereum, rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of about $1.14 trillion, thus signaling the onset of the much-anticipated altseason. In the past 24 hours, BNB price surged over 15 percent to reach a new ATH of about $771.60, before retracing to around $750 on Wednesday during the early Asian session. As a result, BNB’s price has broken out of the multi-year resistance range between $697 and $725, thus entering the much-anticipated discovery phase of the macro bull cycle. Growing Binance Ecosystem The Binance ecosystem has grown to a major web3 project, with dozens of DeFi projects. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $107 billion, registered a 100 percent surge in daily average traded volume to around $5.2 billion. Over the years, the Binance ecosystem has become a vibrant online community of developers and investors. As of this report, the total value locked (TVL) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was about $5.57B, and a stablecoins market cap of over $6B. However, the Binance exchange has registered the highest growth in stablecoins inflows in the recent past on various chains. With over 240M registered global users, Binance Exchange is well positioned to grow to a trillion-dollar company amid the mainstream adoption of BNB. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction (Dec 04th 2024) , Midterm Targets for BNB We entered $BNB earlier, but now at $740 and in price discovery, it couldn’t look better! https://t.co/Em0QuV8fIh — Ali (@ali_charts) December 3, 2024 After a successful bullish breakout to new ATH, BNB’s price is now well positioned to regain its prior fourth position, in terms of market cap. From a technical analysis standpoint, BNB price is now aiming to reach the next major psychological milestone of at least $1,000, which will pave the way for a parabolic rally in the subsequent months. However, the BNB price must consistently close above the resistance level of about $725 to validate a successful bullish breakout. Furthermore, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is attempting to rally above the 70 percent threshold for the first time since early this year. FAQs What is driving the surge in BNB price? BNB price is fueled by Binance ecosystem growth, rising DeFi activity, and strong inflows of stablecoins on Binance Exchange. How does Binance’s ecosystem impact BNB price?

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

President-elect Donald Trump, according to Fox, is considering appointing either Perianne Boring or Caroline Pham – who both have pro-crypto credentials – to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which under a Trump administration, could be the go-to digital assets regulator. Recently, Boring has been a staunch defender of the bitcoin mining industry against what she calls ""regulatory overreach."" In a recent CoinDesk op-ed she took aim at the Department of Energy's data collection process, which she accuses of singling out bitcoin miners under the guise of “emergency” measures. She has also accused the Securities and Exchange Commission of ""backdoor rulemaking"" by trying to get a number of cryptocurrencies defined as securities. Boring did not respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk sent by SMS. Pham, one of Trump's other possible contenders for the position, is already in the CFTC as a Republican-appointed commissioner and leader of the Commission's Global Markets Advisory Committee. In 2023, Pham proposed a ""time-limited"" pilot program to regulate digital asset markets and tokenization , aimed at establishing a principles-based framework to address innovation and risk management.

Giá Bitcoin đã giảm mạnh nhất kể từ sau cuộc bầu cử Mỹ, mất 8,64% giá trị trong tuần và xuống còn 90.911 Đô, nhưng sau đó đã nhanh chóng phục hồi và kết thúc tháng ở mức giá kỷ lục 96.506 Đô. Bitcoin đã tăng trưởng ấn tượng 37,3% trong tháng 11, trở thành tháng tăng trưởng tốt thứ hai từ đầu năm 2024 đến nay. Kết quả khả quan này cho thấy Bitcoin đang có đà tăng trưởng rất tốt và hứa hẹn sẽ tiếp tục tăng trưởng trong tháng 12. Lịch sử cho thấy tháng 12 thường là tháng biến động đối với Bitcoin, nhưng trong các năm halving , Bitcoin lại tăng trưởng trung bình tới 38,86%. Với tình hình thị trường tăng giá hiện tại, chúng tôi tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ tiếp tục tăng, mặc dù có thể có những biến động ngắn hạn. Các đợt giảm giá ngắn hạn có thể xảy ra do các quỹ ETF bán ra và nhà đầu tư dài hạn chốt lời. Tuần trước, các quỹ ETF đã bán ròng 135,1 triệu Đô Bitcoin, chủ yếu trong hai ngày giao dịch đầu tiên. Kể từ tháng 9, các nhà đầu tư dài hạn đã bán ra 508.990 Bitcoin, làm tăng lượng cung trên thị trường. Mặc dù con số này vẫn thấp hơn so với 934.000 Bitcoin được bán ra trước khi Bitcoin đạt đỉnh vào tháng 3 năm 2024, áp lực bán này vẫn đòi hỏi nhu cầu từ các quỹ ETF và người mua mới phải đủ lớn để tránh Bitcoin giảm giá. Một điểm đáng chú ý là lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ bởi các nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn đang gần đạt mức cao nhất trong chu kỳ là 3.282.000 BTC. Lịch sử cho thấy giai đoạn cuối của thị trường tăng giá thường bắt đầu khi lượng Bitcoin nắm giữ bởi nhà đầu tư ngắn hạn vượt qua mức cao nhất của chu kỳ trước đó. Điều này cho thấy sự tham gia ngày càng tăng của các nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ, nhưng đồng thời cũng cho thấy thị trường cần có thêm nhu cầu mới để hấp thụ lượng Bitcoin bán ra từ các nhà đầu tư dài hạn. Hiện tại, Bitcoin đang trong giai đoạn củng cố, điều này là cần thiết để thị trường hấp thụ lượng Bitcoin bán ra và điều chỉnh lại nhu cầu. Với dòng tiền từ các quỹ ETF quay trở lại và sự quan tâm ngày càng tăng từ các nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ, chúng tôi tin rằng Bitcoin sẽ sớm vượt qua mốc 100.000 Đô. Nền kinh tế Mỹ cũng cho thấy sự phục hồi vào cuối năm 2024, nhờ vào chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng trưởng, thị trường lao động ổn định và kỳ vọng lạm phát trong tầm kiểm soát. Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn một số thách thức. Trong tháng 10, chi tiêu tiêu dùng tăng 0,4% cùng với thu nhập tăng 0,6%, trong khi lạm phát tăng nhẹ . Đầu tư kinh doanh có dấu hiệu trái chiều, đơn đặt hàng hàng hóa lâu bền tăng nhẹ và tăng trưởng GDP ổn định ở mức 2.8% trong quý 3. Niềm tin của người tiêu dùng trong tháng 11 đạt mức cao nhất trong 16 tháng , nhờ sự lạc quan vào thị trường lao động và kỳ vọng lạm phát giảm xuống 4,9%. Tuy nhiên, vẫn còn những lo ngại về lạm phát do các chính sách của chính quyền mới. Dù vậy, hoạt động tiêu dùng mạnh mẽ và thị trường lao động ổn định được kỳ vọng sẽ giúp kinh tế Mỹ tiếp tục tăng trưởng đến cuối năm. Tuần trước, có một số tin tức đáng chú ý trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử. Hồng Kông thúc đẩy sự đổi mới trong tài chính kỹ thuật số, Celsius Network nỗ lực giải quyết phá sản và những thay đổi về quy định ở Nga là những tin tức nổi bật trong lĩnh vực tiền điện tử tuần trước, trong bối cảnh stablecoin cũng tiếp tục khẳng định vị thế. Cơ quan Tiền tệ Hồng Kông đã ra mắt Chương trình Trợ cấp Trái phiếu Kỹ thuật số, cung cấp các khoản trợ cấp lên tới 2,5 triệu đô Hồng Kông cho mỗi lần phát hành để thúc đẩy trái phiếu được mã hóa, củng cố vị thế của Hồng Kông như một trung tâm tài sản ảo. Trong khi đó, Celsius Network đã thực hiện khoản thanh toán 127 triệu Đô thứ hai cho các chủ nợ, thúc đẩy quá trình phá sản. Đồng thời, cựu Giám đốc điều hành của công ty này đang phải đối mặt với những thách thức pháp lý, nhấn mạnh sự phức tạp của trách nhiệm giải trình của doanh nghiệp trong lĩnh vực này. Tại Nga, luật mới công nhận tiền điện tử là tài sản và miễn trừ khai thác tiền điện tử khỏi thuế GTGT đánh dấu một bước tiến quan trọng trong việc làm rõ quy định, nhằm mục đích cân bằng tăng trưởng trên thị trường tài sản kỹ thuật số với thuế có cấu trúc và tuân thủ. Đồng thời, thị trường stablecoin đã đạt mức vốn hóa kỷ lục là 190 tỷ Đô, với USDt từ Tether chiếm 70% tổng số vốn hoá. Được thúc đẩy bởi hiệu quả thanh toán xuyên biên giới và việc áp dụng bởi các công ty tài chính truyền thống như Stripe và PayPal, stablecoin đang củng cố vai trò của mình trong tài chính chính thống. Những phát triển này làm nổi bật sự tương tác của đổi mới, quy định và động lực thị trường định hình ngành công nghiệp tiền điện tử. Và đó là bản tin tóm tắt từ Bitfinex Alpha 133.

This makes IBIT one of the top three ETF launches for the year 2024. As inflows into IBIT continue almost daily, market analysts are keenly awaiting the BTC price to cross the $100K milestone. BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holds Over 500,000 Bitcoins Last week, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) hit a major milestone surpassing more than 500,000 BTC as part of its holdings. That asset manager achieved this milestone in less than a year since the IBIT launch in January 2024, with $48 billion in assets under management as of the current Bitcoin price of $96,000. This makes IBIT a dominant player in the crypto market, holding 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Considering the current pace of adoption, market analysts believe that IBIT could accumulate nearly 1 million BTC in the coming years. Additionally, the traditional BlackRock funds have also increased exposure to IBIT recently. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the remarkable milestone in a recent statement, noting that IBIT has already outpaced the iShares Gold ETF (IAU), which debuted in 2005. “If IBIT were BlackRock’s only ETF, it would rank among the top 15 issuers globally,” Geraci noted. He also added that although critics have downplayed demand for a Bitcoin ETF, the explosive growth of IBIT has defied expectations. iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) now approaching $50bil in assets… *$50bil* in less than a yr.

BTC to $100K Soon? The Bitcoin price is currently trading at 96,444 with a market cap of $1.91 trillion. Also, the daily trading volumes have shown subdued trading activity in recent weeks as Bitcoin faces a major sell-wall at $100K levels. This was mainly due to the profit-booking from long-term holders, which brought the selling pressure. However, Glassnode data shows that the daily BTC selling pressure has recently reduced to a great extent. In its latest report, Glassnode noted that daily realized profits for Bitcoin sent to exchanges have dropped sharply to $277 million, marking a 42% decline from the $481 million peak recorded on November 16. It calls this decline a signal of reduced profit-taking activity, suggesting traders are holding their positions in anticipation of the next market move.

While the large-cap tokens are gaining more attention, the tokens within the top 10 have been performing exceptionally in the past few days. BinanceCoin (BNB), which usually scales up without making any noise, has just smashed new highs at $773.26, while Tron (TRX) demonstrated a monstrous rally of over 100% jump to surpass the 6-year-old high to reach $0.44. Now that the tokens have entered the discovery phase, the next course of action could be extremely bullish. BinanceCoin (BNB) Clears Path to $1000 The BNB Price has launched a massive bullish attack and is on the verge of demonstrating a 2021-like move soon. The technicals are mirroring the bull run pattern, suggesting the price could be due for a 100% rally to reach $1000 in a short while. However, the bearish activity is expected to rise, which could slow down the pace, but the bulls appear to be self-assured of pushing the price towards a 4-digit level. The BNB price broke above the final resistance wall around $700 and marked a 20% rise to reach new highs. However, the rally does not appear to stop here, as the technicals suggest the price has just started to rise. The MACD shows the rise in the buying pressure while remaining within the positive range. Besides, the RSI is about to enter the overbought zone, which could trigger a 100% move to reach a 4-digit figure in the first few weeks of 2025. Tron (TRX) Price Eyes to Reach $1 The Tron price surged gigantically by over 100% in just a few hours, pushing it towards a new ATH at $0.44. The prime reason is an increase in liquidity with a surge in Tether minting new USDT across Ethereum & Tron networks. As a result, the token’s trading volume surged over 500%, making it the 4th largest traded asset for the day after USDT, BTC, and ETH & XRP. The bulls appear to have gained huge strength, but the current trade setup suggests there could be some scope for a pullback. The price is testing the upper resistance of the rising wedge and if it breaks out, the price will surge to $0.7 and face a retracement to $0.5 followed by a rebound to $1. However, the monthly RSI has reached above 91, suggesting a relaxation phase may soon begin. This could keep the price consolidated within the wedge until it reaches the apex and later breakout beyond $1.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 05:58:51

On Tuesday, the largest digital asset traded above the key $95,000 mark, acting as support for the past 24 hours. This reflects a remarkable surge of over 40% since Trump’s election victory on November 5. Could A National BTC Reserve Become Reality? Trump’s administration is expected to reverse the Biden administration’s stringent regulations on digital assets, which could significantly alter the landscape for cryptocurrencies in the US. The Republican party is already positioning crypto-friendly candidates to lead key regulatory bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Related Reading: XRP Q3 Overview: Key Metrics Suggest A Bright Future For The Third Biggest Crypto Additionally, discussions within Trump’s transition team have included the potential creation of a dedicated White House position focused on digital-asset policy. President-elect Trump has voiced ambitions to establish the US as the global hub for cryptocurrency, even proposing the concept of a national Bitcoin reserve. However, analysts express skepticism about the practicality of this idea. Jaret Seiberg from TD Cowen noted that while Trump may advocate for a Bitcoin reserve in public forums, it would require significant political capital to implement, especially given his firm stance on maintaining the US dollar’s status as the world’s primary currency. Crypto advocate Paul Atkins is considered a strong candidate to replace outgoing SEC chairman Gary Gensler. The current chair officially announced his resignation last week, effective January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. Gensler has played a key role in enforcing compliance in the digital asset space, especially after a tumultuous 2022 that saw a significant market downturn and significant financial losses for investors following the implosion of the once Sam Bankman-led FTX exchange. Political Instability In South Korea Drives Bitcoin Prices Below $72,000 Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), have experienced notable price discrepancies in South Korea due to local political instability. Following the imposition and subsequent rescinding of martial law by President Yoon Suk Yeol, Bitcoin’s price on South Korean exchanges dipped below $72,000 at one point, reflecting heightened risk aversion among investors. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Warns Not To Short XRP Due To Insider Whale Activity However, the overall cryptocurrency market has seen a staggering increase since Trump was declared president-elect, with total market capitalization rising by approximately $1.3 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $95,840, posting slight losses of 0.2%, but halting the upward trend seen over the past few months. Over the past 8 hours, attention has shifted to altcoins such as BNB, which hit a new record high, and XRP, which is trading just 20% below its all-time high.

Speaking at a keynote hosted by Crain's Chicago Business Editor-in-Chief Ann Dwyer, Goolsbee addressed the challenges and opportunities facing the U.S. economy and monetary policy. “We have very few tools. I told you we can only tighten or loosen,” Goolsbee explained. While monetary tightening helps combat inflation, he noted that raising interest rates too high risks unintended economic consequences. “The only way to create deflation for the economy as a whole is to crash it,” he said, drawing historical comparisons such as the Great Depression. Related News: Here's the Top 10 AI Altcoins Developers Have Focused on in the Last Month Goolsbee noted significant economic successes as he assessed progress in 2024. Inflation has been steadily declining, approaching the Fed’s 2% target. At the same time, the labor market remains flexible and sustainable full employment levels are becoming a reality. “We have reached sustainable full employment without overheating. I expect we can get there,” he said. As the Fed nears the end of 2024, Goolsbee expects a “reasonable amount” of rate cuts from current levels over the next year if economic conditions remain stable. However, he acknowledged the need for flexibility, noting that decisions are reviewed every six weeks based on evolving data. *This is not investment advice.

While Korean investors have contributed to XRP's impressive 30-day price surge of over 400% to $2.60, they're not the only game in town. The stateside investors have been hyperactive through the Nasdaq-listed Coinbase exchange. The XRP/USD pair on Coinbase has been consistently pricier than Binance's XRP/USDT pair in the past 30 days, with minute-level premiums ranging from 3% to 13%, according to data from analytics firm CryptoQuant. It's a sign of whales being active on Coinbase, according to CryptoQuant's CEO Ki Young Ju. In the meantime, prices have not seen a significant premium on Upbit, South Korea's leading cryptocurrency exchange. Narratives surrounding crypto adoption under Trump's presidency are likely powering the so-called Coinbase premium. ""The WSJ describes Trump's second term as 'new era for crypto—with fewer government hurdles.' Under a 'litigation peace,' according to the asset's proponents, XRP will become more accessible to major financial institutions using the asset as a 'bridge currency' for foreign exchange,"" FRNT Financial said in the newsletter Tuesday, explaining the XRP rally and booming activity in the U.S. exchanges. Trump's friendliness to crypto is bolstering the thesis that payments-focused XRP will become ""ubiquitous in international capital flows as a ‘bridge currency’ when settling foreign exchange,"" FRNT added. Coinbase lags in trading volume Volume trends, however, indicate Korean leadership in the XRP market. On Upbit, XRP/KRW is the most traded pair of the past 24 hours, with a volume of $7.63 billion, equating to 26% of the total activity, according to data source Coingecko. On Coinbase, the XRP/USD pair has seen a trading volume of nearly $1.7 billion in the past 24 hours, the highest among all pairs, accounting for over 17% of the exchange's total turnover of $9.89 billion, according to data source Coingecko. The BTC/USD is the second-most actively traded pair, with a volume of $1.59 billion. The offshore XRP market is bigger in volume, likely because the cryptocurrency was unavailable for trading in the U.S. for a long time because Ripple was locked in a legal battle with the SEC over alleged securities law violations for issuing XRP to institutions and retail investors. However, favorable resolution of the legal tussle early this year prompted exchanges, including Coinbase, to re-list XRP.",Markets|Coinbase|XRP|Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-04 06:06:39

Solana’s memecoin market cap has scaled to over $20 billion and a daily average traded volume of over $8 billion, led by dogwifhat (WIF), and Bonk (BONK), among others. The notable rise of Solana’s memecoin industry has heavily been impacted by the Pumpfun launchpad. Moreover, the majority of the top meme coins on the Solana network were launched and incubated through the Pumpfun launchpad. Key Metrics for Pumpfun Protocol According to market data provided by Dune analytics, around 40,206 tokens were launched on Pumpfun Protocol in the past 24 hours. However, only 521 tokens were generated in the past 24 hours, thus raising the total tokens launched on Pumpfun to over 4.2 million. On Tuesday, Pumpfun Protocol registered a net revenue of about $3.1 million, thus bringing the total revenue to over $278 million. The protocol’s revenue has, however, been on the decline in the past week following the disabling of the live stream feature, which was marred with huge controversy.

Market Impact The notable rise of memecoins on the Solana ecosystem has resulted in a major increase in the network’s on-chain activity. The Solana network has over $9 billion in TVL and more than $4.7 billion in stablecoins market cap. In the past 24 hours, the Solana network registered more than 5.7 million active addresses, compared to Ethereum’s 436k. Consequently, more institutional investors have been buying Solana to diversify their respective crypto portfolios. For instance, Grayscale Investments filed for a spot in Solana ETF with the US SEC on Tuesday, signaling the rising demand from investors. $SOL is ready for bullish rally #SOLUSDT #SOL #Crypto pic.twitter.com/K8aCdHv9Cw — Clifton Fx (@clifton_ideas) December 4, 2024 From a technical analysis standpoint, Solana’s price is well positioned to rally parabolically in the coming months, despite the continued sales by Pumpfun developers.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 06:10:35

As December 2024 unfolds, whispers of a blockchain contender reaching “Bitcoin-level” significance are captivating investors, developers, and enthusiasts alike. Could this be the moment when a new blockchain project rises to claim its place as a transformative force in the industry? Lightchain Protocol AI Presale Let’s explore why this project has become the crypto world’s spotlight and what it could mean for the future. The Legacy of Bitcoin: A Benchmark for Greatness Bitcoin has long stood as the cornerstone of the cryptocurrency world. As the first decentralized digital currency, it introduced the world to the concept of trustless transactions and financial sovereignty. Its scarcity, resilience, and wide adoption have solidified its position as digital gold. However, Bitcoin’s limitations have become increasingly apparent: Energy Consumption: The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism requires vast amounts of energy, raising environmental concerns. Scalability Issues: Bitcoin’s low transaction throughput makes it impractical for everyday use at scale. Limited Use Cases: While a strong store of value, Bitcoin lacks the flexibility for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale These challenges have set the stage for a new blockchain to emerge with the potential to redefine what’s possible in the space. The New Contender: A Bitcoin-Level Disruptor? Although specifics remain under wraps, industry insiders suggest that this new blockchain project is designed to address the challenges Bitcoin faces while building on its foundational principles. Here’s what sets it apart: 1. Advanced Consensus Mechanism This blockchain reportedly introduces an innovative consensus algorithm—possibly called Proof of Intelligence (PoI)—that rewards meaningful computational contributions rather than relying on energy-intensive mining or staking. This mechanism could achieve both scalability and sustainability, making it a standout solution. 2. AI-Driven Ecosystem The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into its infrastructure is what truly differentiates this platform. By incorporating an Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), it enables dApps that are smarter, faster, and capable of real-time decision-making. Lightchain Protocol AI Presale 3. Seamless Scalability Unlike Bitcoin and even Ethereum, this project promises scalability as a native feature, eliminating the need for Layer 2 solutions. This means faster transactions at lower costs, even under heavy network demand. 4. Environmental Sustainability With energy efficiency as a core design principle, this blockchain aligns with the growing demand for greener technologies, making it a viable choice for environmentally conscious users and enterprises. Why December 2024 Is a Pivotal Moment The timing of this project’s emergence is key. With the crypto market entering a new phase of maturity, projects that combine innovation with practical solutions are gaining traction. December’s buzz around this blockchain challenger suggests it could be poised to take advantage of: Institutional Interest: As traditional institutions explore blockchain applications, they are likely to gravitate toward platforms that are scalable, sustainable, and secure. Mainstream Adoption: Features like user-friendly design and low transaction fees could attract non-technical users and small businesses. Market Evolution: The crypto community is increasingly looking for platforms that go beyond financial applications to solve real-world problems. The Ripple Effect on the Crypto Industry If this blockchain delivers on its promises, its impact could be far-reaching: Challenging Bitcoin’s Dominance: While Bitcoin’s position as digital gold is secure, this new project could rival its significance by offering broader utility and a more sustainable infrastructure. Transforming Decentralized Applications: Developers could create a new generation of intelligent, scalable dApps powered by AI. Driving Mass Adoption: By addressing user needs for speed, efficiency, and eco-friendliness, this blockchain could bring cryptocurrencies into the daily lives of millions. Final Thoughts: A Blockchain Worth Watching December 2024 could mark a turning point in the blockchain industry. With Bitcoin as the benchmark for greatness, this new project is positioning itself as a potential game-changer that could redefine the industry standards. Its unique blend of scalability, sustainability, and intelligent integration suggests it could become one of the most significant developments in blockchain history. For those watching the space closely, this project represents an opportunity to be part of something monumental. Whether you’re an investor, developer, or blockchain enthusiast, it’s time to keep your eyes on this emerging contender—it could be the beginning of the next Bitcoin-level revolution.

Arbitrum on X’s post on Dec. 03 claimed that the first layer-2 platform could reach $20 billion in total value locked (TVL) or increase up to dou ble-digit, which specifically rises 14.2%. “Arbitrum One has just become the first L2 to hit $20 billion in TVL. We did this by inovating together, with the stage 2 horizon and ecosystem growth happening in all verticals, the sky’s the limit for how far we can scale. Accelerate,” Arbitrum mentioned on the post. According to L2Beat data , Arbitrum One achieved $20 billion in TVL with $6.64 in canonical, $5.32 billion in external, and $8.12 billion in native. This milestone also leaves the competitors behind, including Base with $12.4 billion, OP Mainnet with $8.56 billion, and Blast with $1.55 billion. Arbitrum ( ARB ) is the highest native minted value on this platform, with around $4.3 billion, followed by USD Coin ( USDC ), with a value of $2.2 billion.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA.

Will Polymarket take it too far?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/election-war-govt-ousting-polymarket-too-far/,"The escalating situation in South Korea has once again proven why Polymarket sets itself aside in the odd pricing business and why the US government tried to intimidate its creator. For context, Polymarket accurately predicted the escalation of political turmoil brewing in South Korea after President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law out of nowhere. The predictions market also gave people on the outside an early hint of where the heads of people were during the chaos. However, not enough were paying attention. Although, it might have something to do with mainstream media running circles around the happenings as usual, barely able to make sense of the chaos and thus, unable to properly inform the outside world of what was happening and why. What’s happening in South Korea? Chaos reigned as President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in his country on December 3, 2024. In defense of his decision, he alleged that opposition lawmakers and North Korea had teamed up against him to paralyze the government. It was the first time martial law had been declared in the country in over four decades. There was immediate backlash, with the opposition tagging it unconstitutional and the National Assembly voting unanimously to annul it. Despite the vote, the Ministry of Defense remained adamant, insisting on martial law enforcement until the president rescinded it hours later and only under intense pressure. While the drama unfolded, the world would have been left behind in confusion but for Polymarket. The platform kept updating odds across different markets, including that the president would remove the martial law order and impeachment wagers. Of course, this was in response to the Democratic Party’s threat to accuse the president of treason and impeach him. As it stands, Polymarket predicts a 65% chance of the president getting impeached, odds that have been steadily rising since noon of December 3. Does Polymarket pose any real danger? Polymarket’s ability to analyze events and accurately present wager markets makes it stand out. However, many have expressed reservations about how it does it. For example, Chainlink’s Zach Rynes cited concerns about the potential for prediction markets like Polymarket to, in the future, incentivize harmful actions, particularly regarding assassination bets and market manipulation. Vitalik Buterin, a respected voice in the crypto community, defended Polymarket when it faced criticism for its markets based on conflicts in the Middle East. He claimed that he draws the line when a market acts as a primary incentive for harmful actions, promoting insider trading. Rynes is unconvinced and has highlighted that any prediction market on influenceable events could incentivize harmful actions if there is enough liquidity available. “Even if it wasn’t the original intention, highly liquid markets could subsidize war,” Rynes argued. “Prediction markets aren’t passive observers—they can influence outcomes when they scale.” In response, Buterin proposed introducing soft caps on market sizes for platforms like Polymarket. His suggestion was to implement a fee structure that increases as market size approaches the cap, with all proceeds used to support socially beneficial markets with low organic volume. The Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also defended the inclusion of a Hezbollah betting section on Polymarket. In a post from October 1 on X, Buterin highlighted how many individuals, including elites, make harmful and inaccurate predictions about conflicts on platforms like Twitter. He believes knowing whether people with a financial stake believe an event has a 2% or 50% chance of happening offers valuable insight that can help maintain rationality in the face of misinformation. “It’s not about ‘[making] money from bad stuff happening,’” he said. “It’s about creating an environment where speech has consequences (so both unjustified fearmongering and unjustified complacency are punished), without relying on governmental or corporate censors.” Polymarket’s Hezbollah-related markets allowed users to bet on significantly consequential real-life events like ceasefires and US military intervention in the Israel-Lebanon crisis. These markets have drawn in over $7 million in trading volume. Many are now asking about the ethical implications of Polymarket allowing people to bet on such events. The answer is very subjective. However, one thing is clear: Polymarket has changed how the world approaches events with global implications. Will it grow powerful enough to encourage insider trading and manipulation? Only time will tell. But given the human propensity to corrupt things, it is very likely Polymarket will be used for nefarious purposes — they just have to figure it out first. For now, real-life consequences aside, Polymarket has once again shown its ability to finger the pulse of events correctly, no matter how trivial. If South Korea’s president ends up on the impeachment block, it would be another notch on Polymarket’s hat — calling the impeachment way earlier than most.

A New Crypto Era About To Begin As we approach the end of the year, the crypto industry is set to close 2024 with a belt full of milestones, from the approval of crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to Bitcoin’s rally nearing $100,000 to the victory of an industry-friendly administration in the US Presidential Elections. Donald Trump’s victory as the 47th President of the US has created a craze within the industry, fueling optimism and expectations about the new crypto era that will begin when he steps into office in January. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared that Trump could announce his pick to replace Gensler in the coming days, with the announcement potentially dropping “as soon as tomorrow.” SEC’s outgoing chairman, Gary Gensler, announced his departure from the regulatory agency on November 21, revealing he will step down on January 20, 2025, the same day Trump takes office. After the announcement, speculation intensified about the new leader of the Commission, with names like Christopher Giancarlo, Brad Bondi, Daniel Gallagher, and Paul Atkins reportedly being considered. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been supported by Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, who considers the candidate “light years ahead of Gary Gensler.” According to Terrett’s previous reports, Atkins was “the current favorite among the people at Mar-a-Lago who have Trump’s ear.” Recently, Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer (CPO), Faryar Shirzad, shared his thoughts on the future of the SEC. Shirzad noted he can’t predict who will be the next SEC chairman but considers that Trump is good at picking people who share his vision. As long as he picks somebody who’s a change agent and who shares his vision, I think it’ll be good for the U.S., society, good for the people that own crypto. Is The Crypto Crackdown Ending? Besides a new pro-industry SEC chairman, the crypto sector expects the aggressive and unfair crackdown on the industry to stop. Recently, over 30 tech and crypto founders claimed to have been debanked in the last four years. In a recent Podcast , Marc Andreessen, co-founder of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, accused the Biden administration of using financial exclusion as a weapon against more than 30 founders, tackling legal businesses related to the digital assets industry in what he calls “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” Similarly, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss claimed on X that he and his company had been debanked because they are in crypto. He stated that the number of affected companies is larger than 30, adding that “They also assassinated several banks because they banked crypto companies. Totally unlawful, evil behavior.” As a result, Republican Congressman French Hill pledged on Monday to “fully investigate Operation Choke Point 2.0″ as part of his plan to Make Community Banking Great Again (MCBGA). The MCBGA principles stated that Congress should investigate the matter, and the Trump administration should officially halt and reverse this policy. Representative Hill added, “There should be no place for politicized debanking of legal businesses in the American financial system.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Market|Crypto Regulations|Donald Trump|Gary Gensler|SEC|SEC Chairman|US crypto crackdown|US elections|US Lawmaker French Hill,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-04 07:30:02

This decline coincides with the ongoing bull market, which has pushed the digital asset’s price closer to the $100,000 mark. This significant decline could have major implications for the asset’s supply-demand dynamics. Investor Confidence Increasing In Bitcoin? During a bull market, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges increase as long-term holders (LTH) and short-term holders (STH) transfer their holdings to trading platforms to take profits. However, the current bull market is breaking this trend, as BTC exchange reserves dwindle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Hit $140,000 Target In December – Here’s Why Data from Cryptoquant indicates that over 171,000 BTC have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges since pro-crypto Republican candidate Donald Trump won the November US presidential election. The high amount of BTC being withdrawn from exchanges suggests that holders are likely moving their holdings to cold wallets, signaling long-term confidence in BTC. According to the chart below, BTC exchange reserves witnessed a sharp decline starting in November 2022 – falling from 3.33 million BTC on November 5, to 2.93 million BTC on December 21. Another notable drop began in February 2024, likely in anticipation of the Bitcoin halving in April and the ensuing supply scarcity of the digitally-programmed asset. During this period, reserves decreased from 3.05 million BTC to 2.63 million BTC by October 30 – a decline of 13.77% over eight months. Exchange reserves stand at just 2.46 million BTC, the lowest level in years. This ongoing decline hints at a potential supply crunch for Bitcoin, which could propel its price upward in the coming months. BTC Illiquid Supply Continues To Grow Another data point that supports the long-term holding hypothesis for BTC is Glassnode’s illiquid supply metric. The chart shared below shows that the digital asset’s illiquid supply has grown by 185,000 BTC in the past 30 days. Notably, the illiquid supply now accounts for approximately 14.8 million BTC, representing nearly three-fourths of the current circulating supply of 19.8 million BTC. If this trend continues, Bitcoin’s price could experience a significant surge due to supply scarcity. However, this could also introduce heightened volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Resets Open Interest, Targets $100,000 After Holding Key Support – Details While the decline in exchange reserves and rising illiquid supply are long-term bullish indicators for Bitcoin, short-term price movements could see a brief correction. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, BTC has formed a head-and-shoulder pattern on the hourly chart, which may trigger a sell-off that can push the asset’s price to $90,000. That said, another seasoned crypto analyst, Rekt Capital, said that after briefly touching the $98,000 price level, BTC has already entered the parabolic phase of the rally. BTC trades at $94,968 at press time, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours.

In a recent post, crypto expert Max Avery presents some interesting facts to explain ‘how the XRPL’s AMM and RLUSD are set to make a dent in the universe.’ Time to do a fact check! Ready? XRPL’s Speed and Reliability Primarily, in order to present the transaction framework of XRPL as easy, swift, and cost-effective, Avery highlights the ability of the ecosystem to complete a transaction in just 3 to 5 seconds. To prove the reliability factor, he emphasises XRPL’s impressive track record of ‘zero downtime over a decade.’ He also mentions the ecosystem’s carbon-neutral infrastructure. XRPL’s Automated Market Maker Innovations Highlighting the efficiency and easiness brought into trading by AMM innovations, he explains how the traditional order book system has been replaced by a new, futuristic, liquidity pool system.

However, potential users should consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the platform before diving in. What makes ByBit attractive and what should traders beware of? Focusing on the main features, this article explores the key elements of ByBit that pique traders’ interest. Keep reading to find out the truth about ByBit’s offerings and the financial expert’s opinions. ByBit: Key Information and Features Traders Union announces that ByBit, originally registered in the British Virgin Islands, moved its headquarters to Singapore before relocating to Dubai in January 2023 due to regulatory restrictions in Singapore. ByBit is a major player in the crypto derivatives market, offering leverage of up to 100X on Bitcoin and up to 50X on other supported cryptocurrencies. The platform caters to traders, providing a testnet feature for risk-free demo trading with virtual funds. Additionally, ByBit supports over 300 crypto assets and offers free deposits, though small fees apply to withdrawals. ByBit Pros and Cons Overview ByBit offers notable advantages for traders, including high leverage options—up to 100x on Bitcoin and 50x on other cryptocurrencies. Its platform is user-friendly, featuring advanced trading tools, fast transaction speeds, and 99.9% uptime. ByBit also ensures security with multiple layers of authentication and provides a risk-free testnet for demo trading with virtual funds. Traders benefit from 24/7 customer support and a rewarding affiliate program. However, ByBit has a few downsides. It lacks stringent ID verification through KYC policies and doesn’t support fiat deposits or withdrawals, limiting options to credit and debit card purchases of crypto. Additionally, its spot trading pairs remain limited, though this feature is relatively new to the platform. Opening Bybit Demo Account To open a Bybit demo account, first visit the Bybit testnet website, which operates separately from the main platform. On the left, you’ll see the registration box, or you can click “Sign Up” in the top-right corner of other pages like the Home page. Enter your email, create a strong password, and add a referral code if available. After agreeing to the terms and conditions, confirm the details and click “Continue.” A verification code will be sent to your email; enter it to complete the process. Once verified, you’ll have full access to your demo account. Trading on the Bybit Demo Account To start trading on a Bybit demo account, you’ll need to add virtual BTC to your testnet account. Begin by logging into your live account, then switch over to the testnet platform. Contact customer support, have your UID ready, and request 10,000 USDT and 1 BTC in virtual funds. Once your demo account is “funded,” navigate to the “Trade” tab, choose your trading pair (e.g., BTC/USD), and specify the number of contracts to trade. Select “BUY” or “SELL” depending on your position, and your order will appear in the order book. Expert Opinion Financial expert Andrey Mastykin provides a detailed analysis of ByBit’s features, explaining why it has garnered a positive reputation among traders. “ByBit allows users to leverage their trades up to 100X on Bitcoin and 50X on other cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive option for those looking to maximize their profit potential in a volatile market,” he states. He emphasizes the platform’s demo account feature, stating, “The ByBit demo account is crucial for new traders. It allows them to practice trading with virtual funds without risking real money. This feature not only helps beginners learn the platform but also enables experienced traders to test new strategies.” Mastykin also points out the platform’s operational advantages. “ByBit boasts fast transaction speeds and a strong uptime of 99.9%, ensuring that traders can execute their orders quickly and efficiently,” he adds. “Additionally, 24/7 customer support in multiple languages provides users with immediate assistance whenever needed.” On the downside, Mastykin highlights a couple of significant concerns. “ByBit’s lack of stringent ID verification and KYC policies may raise issues for traders concerned about security and regulatory compliance,” he notes. “Furthermore, the platform does not support fiat currency deposits or withdrawals, limiting options for users who prefer traditional payment methods.” Mastykin concludes, “Despite its limitations, ByBit’s high leverage options, user-friendly interface, and demo trading capabilities contribute to its growing popularity among traders looking for a competitive edge in the cryptocurrency market.”",Crypto News|Press Release|bybit|ByBit India,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2024-12-04 07:47:09

This came amid a compelling post from Tron’s founder that compared the protocol’s native token against another high-flyer as of late – XRP. TRX’s Explosion It seems like the recent prediction by CryptoQuant’s CEO – Ki Young Ju, about the current altcoin season is coming true. He said that it will be a different altseason as only a selected handful of assets will skyrocket periodically. After alts like DOGE , XRP, HBAR, and XLM, the past 24 hours belonged to Tron’s native token. There are no better words to describe TRX’s movements since yesterday than a full-on explosion that pushed its price from $0.23 past its 2018 all-time high and toward a new one of $0.43, according to CoinGecko. $TRX broke the 7 year old all-time high!

Additionally, the founder – Justin Sun, has been very active lately, especially in terms of spending cash, which includes a sizeable investment in Donald Trump’s crypto project. TRX = XRP? Sun also made an intriguing comparison as TRX’s rally was beginning, and the asset had just broken its 2018 all-time high. TRX=XRP — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 3, 2024 Recall the price actions of Ripple’s cross-border token. The cryptocurrency became the top performer shortly after Trump won the elections, especially following Gary Gensler’s announcement about leaving the SEC. At one point, XRP had surged by over 420% on a monthly basis. Moreover, the token trades at a multi-year peak of its own, nearing $3 earlier this week. It has become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and continues to capture the community’s attention through its price movements. TRX’s monthly surge of ‘only’ 135% is a lot more modest, but it managed to break its previous all-time high. As of now, TRX’s market cap remains about 5x lower than XRP’s but the crypto market is a wild place especially in the past month so everything can happen these days.

Jacob asserts that MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, could have drastically boosted its return on investment (ROI) if the firm had allocated its $21.91 billion cryptocurrency portfolio to XRP rather than Bitcoin (BTC). If Michael Saylor had bought $XRP instead of $BTC , MicroStrategy’s $21.91 billion investment would now be worth approximately $81.94 billion, yielding a 274% ROI. That would be OVER $60 billion in additional profits! pic.twitter.com/zqMPx2Rwo6 — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) December 2, 2024 This scenario underscores the potential missed opportunities in their investment strategy. According to King’s calculations, such a move would have generated a 274% ROI, translating to $81.94 billion in value—over $60 billion more than its current Bitcoin holdings. King’s Analysis and Its Context The accompanying chart shared by King demonstrates a marked divergence in the price trajectories of XRP and Bitcoin . The visual comparison emphasizes XRP’s strong upward momentum relative to Bitcoin’s more subdued price performance during the same period. King’s argument reflects a hypothetical shift in MicroStrategy’s investment strategy, showcasing the potential impact of selecting a highly volatile but high-performing asset like XRP. In response to this hypothetical scenario, another user, Andrew “Old IT Guy” Wade, emphasized several important considerations regarding altcoins like XRP. He pointed out that MicroStrategy’s investment would represent a substantial portion of XRP’s total market capitalization, potentially distorting the market. Additionally, the large volume of XRP required for such an investment might destabilize the asset’s price if sold. Moreover, XRP carries a fundamentally different risk profile compared to Bitcoin, which many investors consider a more established and reliable store of value. From a financial perspective, Jacob King’s analysis underscores the importance of timing and asset selection in maximizing returns. While XRP’s recent performance has outpaced Bitcoin’s, it is crucial to recognize that past performance does not guarantee future results. Additionally, investments of MicroStrategy’s scale would likely encounter liquidity and market impact challenges, especially in the case of altcoins with relatively smaller market capitalizations than Bitcoin. Bitcoin remains the most widely adopted cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of over $500 billion as of December 2024. Its liquidity, regulatory clarity, and acceptance as a digital gold standard provide a risk-adjusted appeal that aligns with MicroStrategy’s long-term strategy. Despite XRP’s growing adoption in cross-border payments and favorable developments in its legal disputes, it operates within a smaller ecosystem and remains subject to unique risks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risk-Reward Considerations The comparison between XRP and Bitcoin extends beyond ROI metrics. It includes broader considerations like market stability, regulatory environments, and investor perception. XRP has experienced significant price surges recently, driven by optimism surrounding its use cases and legal clarity in the U.S. While Jacob King’s analysis showcases the hypothetical profitability of investing in XRP over Bitcoin, it also highlights the complexity of managing large-scale cryptocurrency investments. XRP’s recent price performance illustrates its potential for significant returns, yet its market dynamics and risk profile make it a fundamentally different asset compared to Bitcoin. For institutional investors like MicroStrategy, the decision to prioritize Bitcoin over altcoins such as XRP reflects a strategic focus on stability, liquidity, and long-term growth. This discussion serves as a reminder of the multifaceted considerations that underpin investment decisions in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

In a Dec. 4 press release , the Australian Securities and Investments Commission announced Consultation Paper 381, outlining plans to address regulatory gaps in the crypto industry and ensure compliance with existing financial laws. ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland says the regulator wants to promote the growth of “responsible financial innovation” while “ensuring consumer protection,” adding further that a “well-regulated financial system” benefits everyone in the community. “Many digital assets and related products are financial products under the current law. Stakeholders have been calling for greater clarity and in response, we are releasing our draft updated guidance.” Alan Kirkland The securities watchdog wants to add 13 practical examples of “how the current financial product definitions” could apply to cryptocurrencies “and related products.” You might also like: Kraken unveils broker offering in Australia for institutions The consultation paper also includes suggestions on potential regulatory relief measures, and transitional approaches for businesses adapting to updated guidance, the press release reads. ASIC is also exploring a “no action” position for firms in the process of applying for or modifying licenses. Public feedback is open until Feb. 28, 2025, with ASIC planning to finalize INFO 225 by mid-year. In the meantime, Australia is also reviewing its approach to crypto taxation, with the Department of Treasury seeking guidance from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. As crypto.news reported earlier, the Treasury is weighing two options: adopting the OECD’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework or tailoring it to domestic needs.

The price is forming a new pattern, and Bitcoin whales are closing large long positions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is slightly trading above the $96,500 level and has slipped into the red zone. Bitcoin Whale Activity Bitcoin whales are closing long positions. Over the past day, 6,000 Bitcoin worth of long positions have been closed, amounting to over $500 million. This could mean profit-taking or anticipation of a pullback in the short term. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, we’re technically in a bull market, but we are starting to lose some short-term momentum. This is common in bull markets, as we saw a similar pattern last year. Around October and November, Bitcoin showed strong bullish movement but also had a period of sideways action. Bullish Momentum Fading Right now, the weekly Bitcoin MACD shows signs of losing momentum, suggesting it may see more sideways consolidation in the coming weeks. This is normal during a larger bull market. Resistance at $100,000 Bitcoin is facing significant resistance at $100,000, driven by both a psychological barrier and the 1618 Fibonacci extension level at $102,000. This is why the price is struggling around that area. Support Levels If BTC sees a pullback, the key support level is around $89,000. On the 3-day chart, BTC has support at $89,000, with a more significant level at $87,000 in case of a larger dip. Price Target if Bitcoin Breaks $100,000 If Bitcoin breaks above $100,000, the next price target is around $113,000 based on the 2618 Fibonacci extension.

These investment vehicles have now enjoyed four consecutive days of net inflows, totaling over $1.45 billion within that span. BlackRock ’s IBIT led the pack for the third consecutive day, with $693.25 million in inflows to the fund. Notably, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF achieved a significant milestone last week, surpassing 500,000 BTC in its holdings. It now accounts for 2.38% of Bitcoin’s total supply. In less than a year since its launch, IBIT is now nearing $50 billion in assets under management, making it one of the top three ETF launches of 2024. Trailing behind, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded inflows of $52.17 million on the same day, followed by VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB, which attracted $16.21 million and $7.8 million, respectively. However, not all ETFs shared in the influx; ARK and 21Shares’ ARKB was the sole fund to report outflows, losing $93.47 million during the day.

Options Market Show Increased Downside Protection",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-100000-goal-in-jeopardy-options-market-show-increased-downside-protection/,"As attention shifts to altcoins, Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a pause in the uptrend that has characterized the past month. Currently trading 3.8% below its record high of $99,540, questions are raised about the sustainability of this growth and the possibility of a correction as the year draws to a close. Investors Flock To Ethereum And XRP Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, pointed out that while strong institutional buying pressure persists—particularly from companies like MicroStrategy, which continues to accumulate Bitcoin—there is a noticeable shift in capital flows. Newhouse noted that the broader crypto ecosystem is experiencing a “diversification of capital flows” from both institutional and non-institutional participants. This diversification indicates that as Bitcoin stabilizes, investor interest is increasingly shifting to other digital assets, including Ethereum (ETH) and XRP, which had previously lagged behind Bitcoin. Related Reading: XRP Q3 Overview: Key Metrics Suggest A Bright Future For The Third Biggest Crypto Following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump, who has emerged as a crypto advocate, expectations for more favorable US regulations have risen. This has contributed to the massive rally in the XRP price, which has seen a 400% increase in the monthly time frame. This optimism is also reflected in the record monthly net inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in November, which reached $6.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. Bloomberg data shows that last Friday marked an all-time high for daily Ether ETF subscriptions. $2 Billion Silk Road Bitcoin Moved To Coinbase In the options market, there has been a noticeable increase in downside protection for Bitcoin at later expiries this month. Meanwhile, BTC futures have exhibited moderate leverage, remaining relatively subdued after Bitcoin surpassed the $99,000 mark. According to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33, on-chain data suggests that traders who purchased BTC in the $55,000 to $70,000 range are now actively realizing profits. “Profit-taking has been particularly intense with BTC trading north of $90,000,” Lunde remarked. Jake Ostrovskis, a trader at Wintermute OTC, observed that “the market has taken a pause over the last 10 days as Bitcoin sits just under $100,000. Volatility levels have compressed slightly, with Bitcoin in the 64th percentile and Ether significantly higher at the 81st.” This volatility compression suggests a cautious sentiment among traders as they assess the market’s next moves, with the potential for a fresh wave of lower support levels to be retested in BTC’s price action, which could jeopardize the $100,000 milestone being reached by the end of the year. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Warns Not To Short XRP Due To Insider Whale Activity Adding to the uncertainty in the market is a recent development reported by NewsBTC on Monday that nearly $2 billion worth of BTC previously confiscated from the Silk Road marketplace has been moved from US government wallets to Coinbase. Such moves often spark speculation among traders, as similar moves by the US government to massively liquidate its holdings contributed to the downtrend in the second and third quarter of the year, when BTC fell over 20% in two consecutive months.

The whale accumulated the Bitcoins when the price was hovering around $625 for a total of $1.68 million. Bitcoin is hovering at $96,500 after gaining 1% over the past 24 hours. Its market cap surpassed the $1.9 trillion market again. The increased exchange inflows could trigger FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) among retail investors. However, a spike in whale accumulation could shift the market sentiment and bring buying pressure.

As of January 2, the Treasury Department must operate under the reinstated limit, kicking off its usual bag of “extraordinary measures” to avoid default. This includes draining its cash reserves in the Treasury General Account (TGA) and cutting back on Treasury bill (T-bill) issuance, all while the Fed is knee-deep in quantitative tightening (QT). Things were already complicated, but this might send the Fed flying blind. The TGA is a key liability on the Fed’s balance sheet, meaning changes to its balance directly affect liquidity in the financial system. When the Treasury spends down its cash pile, bank reserves and demand for the Fed’s reverse repo facility (RRP) shoot up. Extraordinary measures and a tightrope walk Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has no choice but to deploy extraordinary measures, including halting investments in federal retirement funds and borrowing from the Exchange Stabilization Fund. The goal is simple: buy time until Congress gets its act together. But this temporary game plan has real consequences. The TGA will shrink, artificially pumping more cash into markets, while the Fed keeps reducing its balance sheet. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at TD Securities, explained it like this: “The Fed may be flying blind in monitoring the impact of QT as the debt ceiling starts to pressure TGA balances lower.” His concern is that when the ceiling is lifted, the sudden rebuilding of the TGA could cause reserves to drop dangerously low, creating liquidity problems. The current reserve level of $3.23 trillion might seem abundant, but nobody knows how quickly “enough” can turn into “scarce.” Fed officials are worried too. Minutes from their November meeting revealed a focus on the debt ceiling’s ripple effects. According to the New York Fed’s survey, most market participants expect QT to end by mid-2025, but the debt ceiling drama could throw those predictions off. Last time, in 2023, the RRP held $2.2 trillion in liquidity as a buffer. Now, it’s barely above $150 billion. Rebuilding the TGA will hit reserves harder and faster than it did during previous crises. Funding markets are a powder keg Funding markets are a different beast compared to 2023. Hedge funds have doubled down on long Treasury positions, and much of that collateral is now sitting outside the banking system. In July, dealer balance-sheet constraints and repo limitations kept cash stubbornly parked at the RRP. Tobias noted, “Capacity constraints, as well as counterparty risk limits, could push money market fund cash into the RRP.” This disrupts liquidity redistribution, precisely when demand for financing continues to rise. Wall Street is split on what happens next. Deutsche Bank says the Fed might need to slow QT or pause it altogether if things spiral. But they don’t expect a full stop unless Congress completely drops the ball. The harrowing X-date Before Donald Trump’s election win, analysts pegged the so-called X-date (a term for when the government runs out of cash) around August 2025. That’s out the window now. With Republicans taking the White House and Congress , the deadline could move up to the second quarter of 2025. A unified GOP government might reach a quicker agreement to lift the ceiling, but don’t hold your breath. Barclays strategist Joseph Abate warned that politics, not economics, will dictate the timeline. “Getting a bill to the House floor may not be quick,” he said, predicting the ceiling won’t be suspended until late spring. This brinkmanship will likely hammer front-end Treasury rates as the government reduces its supply of short-term debt. Investors, spooked by potential default risks, will dump vulnerable T-bills , creating bizarre distortions in the yield curve. This isn’t the first rodeo. During previous debt ceiling standoffs, agreements came down to the wire, often within a week of a government cash crunch. JPMorgan points out that the ugliest fights happen under a Democratic president and a Republican-controlled Congress. This time, with the GOP in charge, the battle might be less brutal.

According to data from CoinMarketCap , in the past 24 hours the combined crypto spot trading volume from Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax reached a volume of $34.2 billion in the 24 hours leading up to 10:30 am EST. South Korea’s trading volume surged nearly 50% after the nation’s trading volume broke its previous record with $18 billion on Dec. 2, surpassing stock market volumes by 22%. The massive surge is thought to have been triggered by the unrest in the country that followed the implementation of an emergency curfew via the martial law by President Yoon Suk-yeol. The martial law was called off after six hours. According to local media outlet News1 , South Korean traders rushed to sell their cryptocurrencies on the local exchanges which caused the prices to drop to 88 million won. Some exchanges even experienced site outages due to the massive spike in trading activity. Upbit , South Korea’s largest exchange, contributed the biggest portion of today’s crypto spot trading volume, with $27.25 billion worth of crypto. Bithumb came in second with a spot trading volume of more than $6.14 billion in the past 24 hours of trading. You might also like: South Korea’s crypto trading outpaces its stock market by 22%, hits $18B in 24H Meanwhile, the crypto exchange Coinone accumulated a trading volume of more than $531 million in the past 24 hours. This was followed by Korbit with $192 million worth of crypto trading volume and Gopax with nearly $9 million. The South Korean martial law came into effect on Dec. 3 at 23:00 KST. Citizens were banned from conducting protests and the media was placed under government control. The nation’s parliament and political groups were forbidden from holding activities that would challenge the law. President Yoon decided to enact emergency martial law because he claimed it was a necessary precaution to protect the country from “North Korea’s communist forces” and to “eliminate anti-state elements.” Though, many have speculated that it was a desperate act done to combat the domestic pressure that could lead to the President’s impeachment. What impact did the South Korean martial law have on the crypto market? Shortly after the martial law was decreed, political unrest broke out in South Korea. Thousands of South Koreans rushed to the heavily-guarded parliament building to protest, after politicians criticized Yoon’s decision as illegal and unconstitutional. According to the BBC , footage from the site showed some protesters fighting police at the gates. Even regulators had to climb over fences to make it to the voting chamber so that they could overrule the martial law. As previously reported by crypto.news , crypto prices in South Korea plummeted along with the South Korean won. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price fell to its lowest level since Oct. 5 at around 88 million won. Ethereum ( ETH ) also reached its lowest level as it fell to 4.2 million won. Meanwhile, the price of other altcoins like Ripple ( XRP ), Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) and Solana ( SOL ) plummeted by double digits. This evident drop in crypto prices was caused by investors rushing to liquidate their assets in the midst of the political chaos. Similar sell-offs occurred after the Ukraine war started and the COVID-19 pandemic.

This latest development adds to the ongoing management of billions of dollars in digital assets confiscated from high-profile crypto collapses. These massive transfers are creating a panic in the bullish crypto market which saw a consecutive green after months of stagnant phase. Bitcoin is hovering around $96K and altcoins are also making good gains with regulations at ease. At this moment these US transfers tell a different story. Let’s dive into the insight. Massive Transfers of SHIB and ETH On December 3, Arkham Intelligence reported that 54.8 billion Shiba Inu tokens (SHIB), valued at $1.55 million, were transferred to a new wallet. Shortly after, $17.2 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) followed, sparking attention from blockchain analysts monitoring government wallet activities. Beyond SHIB and ETH, the U.S. government also moved several smaller assets, including 13.5 million Binance USD (BUSD), $36,070 of Axie Infinity (AXS), and $296,000 in various other cryptocurrencies. These included Compound (COMP), Numeraire (NMR), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and Yearn Finance (YFI). Bitcoin Seizures Continue In addition to the recent FTX-related transfers, Bitcoin seizures remain a major focus. Earlier this year, the government moved nearly $2 billion worth of Bitcoin to new wallets. These transactions were linked to earlier cases, such as the Silk Road investigation, highlighting the scale of digital assets under federal control. As of now, the U.S. government holds a staggering $19.48 billion in digital assets, primarily Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, WBTC, and BNB. These holdings reflect the outcomes of several high-profile crypto investigations, including FTX’s collapse in November 2022 due to alleged mismanagement. Implications for the Crypto Market The U.S. government recently moved seized cryptocurrencies, including $17.2 million in Ethereum, just as the crypto market is rallying. In the meanwhile, Ethereum has risen to $3,643, and November saw a record $183.74 billion in trading volume. The government also moved 54.89 billion SHIB, which has raised serious selling pressure on the market.

Pal tells his 1.1 million followers on the social media platform X Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is sporting a wedge pattern on the monthly chart and could be headed for gains that “look similar in potential magnitude” to those of XRP. A wedge pattern is characterized by converging trend lines and is considered bullish if price breaks out from above the upper trendline. “ Insane banana chart.” Source: Raoul Pal/X A “Banana” chart or zone is a metaphor Pal uses to describe a bullish period for crypto assets where a rapid increase in prices occurs in the shape of the yellow fruit or a parabola. Dogecoin is trading at $0.404 at time of writing, up by around 172% over the past 30 days. Turning to XRP, Pal says that the third-largest crypto asset by market cap has broken out of the wedge pattern on the monthly time frame. “Last time, it [XRP] broke a long wedge pattern it rose another 5,600%! (obviously won’t repeat but you get the point – it can go up a lot.)” Source: Raoul Pal/X XRP is trading at $2.57 at time of writing, up by around 424% over the past 30 days. Turning to Sui ( SUI ), the former Goldman Sachs executive says that the 21st-largest crypto asset by market cap is flashing a bullish signal against Solana ( SOL ). Pal says that SUI/SOL is sporting an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily time frame and he is watching the chart “like a hawk.” An inverse head and shoulders pattern is typically a bullish signal if price breaks out to the upside.

Released on December 4, the guidelines categorize many digital assets as financial products, compelling firms to obtain Australian Financial Services Licenses (AFSL) or Australian Market Licenses to continue operations. The proposed regulations aim to provide clarity but have elicited mixed reactions from industry stakeholders. While compliance-focused companies see the move as necessary for legitimizing the sector, critics argue it could stifle innovation and force startups to relocate offshore. Kate Cooper, CEO of Zodia Custody, views the shift as a necessary wake-up call for the crypto industry. “Compliance is no longer optional,” she stated, urging businesses to reassess their custody and compliance practices. High Costs Raise Concerns for Startups in Australia The financial burden associated with obtaining licenses is a primary concern, particularly for smaller businesses. Liam Hennessy, a partner at Clyde & Co, warned that the hefty compliance costs could overwhelm startups, leaving the market dominated by larger players better equipped to absorb these expenses. Echoing this sentiment, Joni Pirovich, a prominent crypto lawyer, noted on LinkedIn that launching a crypto firm in Australia may now rival or exceed the costs of setting up operations overseas. This could discourage Australian entrepreneurs from entering the market locally, pushing innovation offshore. Charlie Karaboga, co-founder and CEO of Block Earner, criticized ASIC’s expectations for startups to maintain financial reserves to meet licensing requirements . With only 13 employees , Karaboga described the guidelines as potentially “crippling” for smaller ventures like his. Industry Welcomes Clarity but Questions Implementation Despite the concerns, the guidelines offer much-needed regulatory clarity , a sentiment shared by many industry leaders. “Anything which provides regulatory certainty is a positive step,” said Hennessy, adding that the move could establish Australia as a serious player in the global crypto landscape. However, some worry that the regulations are excessively stringent. Swyftx CEO Jason Titman highlighted that no other country regulates crypto exchanges as strictly as Australia, describing the move as a bold but isolating approach. ASIC’s consultation period for the proposed guidelines runs until February 28, 2025, with final regulations expected by mid-year.

According to Alternative , the platform behind the index, the crypto market remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone , reflecting heightened confidence among investors. The index ranges from 0 to 100 , where 0 represents “Extreme Fear” and 100 indicates “Extreme Greed.” A score in the “Extreme Greed” zone typically suggests bullish momentum, though it may also signal potential overheating of the market. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index What Is the Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index measures market sentiment by analyzing six key factors: Volatility (25%): Tracks recent price swings and stability. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Measures trading activity and price trends. Social Media (15%): Analyzes mentions and engagement across platforms. Surveys (15%): Reflects public opinion through periodic polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Indicates Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. Google Trends (10%): Assesses search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. What Does a Score of 78 Indicate? Extreme Greed Zone: Investors are highly optimistic, often leading to rapid price increases. Market Behavior: Historically, “Extreme Greed” can precede corrections, as overconfidence often fuels speculative behavior. Factors Driving the Recent Increase 1. Reduced Volatility The crypto market has experienced reduced price fluctuations recently, leading to improved sentiment. Stability often encourages greater participation from institutional and retail investors alike. 2. Bullish Momentum Rising trading volumes and consistent upward trends across major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, have fueled the market’s positive outlook. 3. Social Media Buzz Platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit have seen increased mentions of bullish crypto trends, amplifying confidence among investors. 4. Bitcoin’s Influence Bitcoin dominance remains steady, reinforcing its role as a market anchor. This stability supports the broader optimism captured by the index. Implications of “Extreme Greed” for Traders Opportunities Bullish Trends: Rising sentiment often aligns with price increases, presenting opportunities for gains. Momentum Investing: Traders can capitalize on short-term momentum in a bullish market. Risks Market Corrections: Overheated sentiment can precede price drops, as speculative investments are often unsustainable. FOMO (Fear of Missing Out): Excessive enthusiasm may lead to impulsive, high-risk investments. Historical Performance of the Index Patterns in “Extreme Greed” Zones During previous periods of “Extreme Greed,” such as November 2021, the market experienced significant rallies before entering correction phases. Conversely, periods of “Extreme Fear” have historically signaled buying opportunities, as seen during market dips in 2022. How Traders Use the Fear & Greed Index As a Sentiment Indicator The index provides insight into market psychology, helping traders gauge whether the market is overbought or oversold. Risk Management Tool By identifying extremes in sentiment, traders can adjust their strategies to mitigate risk during euphoric or pessimistic phases. Community Reactions to the Latest Score Optimism in Social Media Circles “78 on the index! Bull run confirmed?” “Extreme Greed is here, but remember to take profits.” Cautious Voices “Markets look good, but these scores often precede corrections.” “Fear & Greed Index is useful, but don’t rely on it solely.” What’s Next for the Crypto Market? Key Indicators to Watch Volatility: Increased price swings could shift the index lower into the “Greed” or “Neutral” zones. Trading Volumes: Sustained growth in volume may reinforce bullish momentum. Bitcoin Price: As the market leader, Bitcoin’s performance will heavily influence overall sentiment. Potential Scenarios Sustained Bullish Momentum: If optimism persists, the market could see further price increases. Correction Risk: High “Extreme Greed” scores have historically been followed by corrections, necessitating cautious optimism. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of “Extreme Greed” The Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 78 reflects the market’s strong bullish sentiment, driven by reduced volatility, rising momentum, and social media buzz. While optimism abounds, traders should remain vigilant, as extreme sentiment often precedes market corrections. For investors, this is a critical time to balance optimism with caution, leveraging tools like the Fear & Greed Index to make informed decisions.

This marks another strong indication that the crypto market is firmly in Altcoin Season , a period characterized by altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. This metric, widely used by traders and analysts, tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) over the past 90 days. An index score above 75 confirms Altcoin Season, while scores below 25 signify Bitcoin Season. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index How the Index Works The Altcoin Season Index assesses whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. Altcoin Season Threshold: At least 75% of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season Threshold: If only 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin, the market is in Bitcoin Season. Score Range: The index ranges from 1 to 100 , updated daily based on price data from CMC.

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has proposed new licensing requirements, meaning crypto businesses will no longer be able to avoid following the rules. These changes could force many crypto firms to get licensed, but some fear it could push startups to leave the country. Will Australia’s crypto future be at risk? Mandatory Licensing for Crypto Firms Under the released consultation paper on proposed rules, most crypto exchanges and firms dealing with digital assets must secure financial licenses. This includes obtaining an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) and, in some cases, an Australian Market License. We have released a consultation paper outlining proposals to update our digital asset guidance: https://t.co/PR6k2KDgY7 pic.twitter.com/a3tuRbxOVR — ASIC Media (@asicmedia) December 3, 2024 ASIC’s initiative expands the classification of financial products to include stablecoins, staking services, exchange tokens, and wrapped tokens. However, Bitcoin, Ethereum, memecoins, and gaming-linked NFTs may sidestep these rules. Meanwhile, ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland stated that the objective is to balance innovation with consumer protection, encouraging stakeholders to participate in the consultation process before the February 28, 2025, deadline. Bold Step Toward Clarity! Despite the challenges, some industry leaders see the guidelines as a step in the right direction. Swyftx CEO & ASX Company director Jason Titman acknowledged that regulatory clarity could boost market confidence, even though Australia’s approach is unique and more stringent than other nations. The final version of these guidelines, expected by mid-2025, could determine whether Australia becomes a global leader in regulated crypto markets or loses its innovative edge. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinbase Declares War; Bans Firms Hiring Anti-Crypto Lawyers , Concerns for Smaller Businesses The tighter regulations are raising red flags for smaller crypto businesses.

37203613,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106838,1733304152,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Spot Solana ETF Launch Under Trump’s SEC Is “A Matter of When, Not If,” Says Bloomberg Analyst",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-solana-etf-launch-sec/,"Spot Solana ETF Launch Anticipated Under Trump’s SEC Nominee The launch of a spot Solana ETF may soon become a reality, according to James Seyffart , a Bloomberg ETF analyst. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Seyffart stated that the approval of such ETFs is now “a matter of when—not if,” particularly under the anticipated leadership of Paul Atkins , President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman . While the analyst’s prediction has generated excitement in the cryptocurrency community, Seyffart cautioned that approval might still take time despite Atkins’ known crypto-friendly stance . Who Is Paul Atkins, and Why Does It Matter? Trump’s SEC Nominee and His Stance on Crypto Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner with a reputation for advocating lighter regulatory oversight, is expected to spearhead a more crypto-friendly agenda at the SEC. His nomination aligns with the Trump administration’s broader focus on fostering financial innovation and reducing regulatory hurdles. Implications for Crypto ETFs Atkins’ appointment could signal a shift in how the SEC approaches spot cryptocurrency ETFs , including those tied to Solana (SOL) . The previous SEC leadership faced criticism for delaying or rejecting applications for spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. A more favorable regulatory environment might pave the way for approvals across various cryptocurrencies. Why Solana? Solana’s Growing Popularity Solana has emerged as a leading blockchain platform due to its: High Scalability: The network can handle thousands of transactions per second. Low Fees: Transaction costs on Solana are significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Expanding Ecosystem: A vibrant community of decentralized applications (dApps) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has bolstered Solana’s appeal. Investor Interest As institutional interest in cryptocurrencies grows, Solana-based ETFs offer an opportunity to gain exposure to one of the market’s fastest-growing assets. A spot ETF would allow investors to directly invest in Solana without the complexities of wallet management or direct token purchases. Spot ETFs vs. Futures ETFs: Why Spot Matters A spot ETF tracks the actual price of an asset by holding the underlying tokens, unlike futures ETFs, which derive their value from contracts tied to future prices. Advantages of Spot ETFs Lower Costs: Avoids the rolling fees associated with futures contracts. Greater Price Accuracy: Reflects the real-time value of the asset. Enhanced Adoption: Simplifies crypto investing for retail and institutional investors alike. Challenges in Approval Despite these benefits, the SEC has previously raised concerns about market manipulation and a lack of robust surveillance mechanisms in the spot cryptocurrency market. What Bloomberg’s Analyst Predicts Seyffart’s Outlook James Seyffart believes the shift in SEC leadership under Trump’s administration increases the likelihood of spot crypto ETF approvals, including for Solana. However, he tempered expectations by noting that bureaucratic processes and ongoing market concerns might delay immediate action. Timing Uncertain While the sentiment around Solana ETFs is positive, Seyffart emphasized that “a favorable chair doesn’t mean fast approvals,” suggesting that investors might need to wait for broader regulatory clarity. Community Reactions Optimism Among Crypto Advocates The crypto community has expressed enthusiasm about the possibility of a spot Solana ETF , viewing it as a milestone for mainstream adoption. “This could be a game-changer for Solana and the entire crypto market.” “With Paul Atkins at the helm, we’re finally moving in the right direction.” Skepticism Lingers Others remain cautious, pointing to the SEC’s historically slow pace in approving cryptocurrency-related products. “I’ll believe it when I see it. The SEC isn’t known for quick decisions.” “Even with Atkins, the road ahead won’t be easy.” Potential Impact on the Crypto Market The approval of a spot Solana ETF could have far-reaching implications: 1. Increased Institutional Participation A spot ETF would lower barriers for institutional investors, driving liquidity and legitimacy for Solana and other cryptocurrencies. 2. Boost to Solana’s Price Historically, ETF launches have positively influenced the underlying asset’s price. Solana could experience significant upward momentum if a spot ETF is approved. 3. Broader Crypto Adoption Spot ETFs make cryptocurrencies more accessible, encouraging adoption by mainstream investors unfamiliar with traditional crypto trading. Challenges Ahead While optimism is high, hurdles remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on market manipulation must evolve to accommodate spot crypto ETFs. Market Infrastructure: Exchanges and custodians need to enhance transparency and security measures. Public Perception: Skepticism around crypto’s volatility and environmental impact persists. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto ETFs? The potential approval of a spot Solana ETF under Trump’s SEC appointee Paul Atkins represents a significant turning point for cryptocurrency markets. While challenges remain, the shift in regulatory leadership offers hope for a more favorable environment for digital asset investment products. If realized, a spot Solana ETF could boost institutional adoption, elevate Solana’s market profile, and set the stage for further innovation in crypto investing.

37203647,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106834,1733304283,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"35% of BSC Blocks Affected by Sandwich Attacks on December 1, Impacting $1.5 Billion",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bsc-sandwich-attacks-december-1/,"BSC Under Fire: 35% of Blocks Impacted by Sandwich Attacks On December 1, 2024, 35.5% of BNB Smart Chain (BSC) blocks were targeted by sandwich attacks , according to a report by Decrypt , citing data from Dune Analytics . These sophisticated attacks manipulated the mempool (memory pool), affecting 43,400 transactions and a trading volume exceeding $1.5 billion . The revelation raises pressing concerns about blockchain security , with BSC users and developers calling for immediate action. Meanwhile, Binance, the entity behind BSC, has yet to release a statement addressing the incident. What Are Sandwich Attacks? Mechanics of a Sandwich Attack A sandwich attack is a form of DeFi (decentralized finance) exploitation where attackers front-run and back-run a victim’s transaction. Here’s how it works: Front-Run: The attacker places a buy order ahead of the victim’s transaction. Victim’s Order: The victim’s transaction is executed, causing a price increase for the targeted token. Back-Run: The attacker immediately places a sell order to profit from the artificially inflated price. This manipulation capitalizes on the mempool, where pending transactions wait to be processed by the blockchain. By analyzing and exploiting this pool, attackers can time their trades to trap victims. Key Statistics from the Attack Percentage of Impacted Blocks: 35.5% of all BSC blocks on December 1 contained at least one sandwich attack. Transactions Affected: 43,400 transactions fell victim to this manipulation. Volume Impacted: The total trading volume affected was over $1.5 billion, showcasing the scale of the exploit. Why BSC Was Targeted The BNB Smart Chain (BSC) is one of the largest blockchain ecosystems, known for its low transaction fees and high throughput. These factors attract a mix of legitimate users and malicious actors seeking opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities. High Activity and Liquidity BSC processes a vast number of transactions daily, making it a lucrative target for attackers. High liquidity ensures attackers can profit significantly from even small manipulations. Mempool Visibility The mempool in public blockchains like BSC is transparent, allowing attackers to monitor pending transactions and exploit them in real-time. The Scale of the Damage Impact on Users Victims of sandwich attacks often experience unexpected slippage , leading to unfavorable trade execution prices. This undermines trust in the platform and can result in financial losses. Ecosystem Trust Frequent and large-scale attacks such as this erode confidence in the BSC ecosystem , potentially deterring new users and projects from adopting the platform. Industry Reactions The crypto community has expressed concerns over the increasing frequency of such attacks. Security experts and developers are urging blockchain platforms to implement anti-front-running measures to safeguard users. Community Feedback “This level of exploitation shows that DeFi still has a long way to go in terms of security.” “Transparent mempools are both a strength and a vulnerability. We need solutions like private transactions to counter these attacks.” How Sandwich Attacks Can Be Mitigated Transaction Privacy Tools Platforms can integrate privacy tools such as zero-knowledge proofs or encrypted mempools to prevent attackers from monitoring pending transactions. Slippage Protection DeFi platforms could implement mechanisms to alert users if their transactions are vulnerable to slippage or exploitation. Educational Initiatives Educating users about setting appropriate slippage limits and recognizing potential threats is key to reducing individual exposure to attacks. A Broader Issue in DeFi The sandwich attacks on BSC are not an isolated case. DeFi platforms across various blockchains have faced similar vulnerabilities. The open and permissionless nature of these systems, while revolutionary, also makes them susceptible to exploitation. Other Recent Exploits Ethereum and Polygon have also reported sandwich attacks, albeit on a smaller scale compared to BSC’s December 1 incident. Flash loan attacks remain another persistent issue in the DeFi space. Binance’s Silence: A Missed Opportunity? As the entity behind BSC, Binance plays a crucial role in maintaining user trust. However, the absence of a public statement addressing the attacks has left users questioning the platform’s commitment to security. What Users Expect Transparency: Clear communication about the scale of the issue and steps being taken to mitigate future risks. Action Plans: A roadmap for improving blockchain security and protecting user funds. Conclusion: Lessons from the BSC Sandwich Attacks The revelation that 35.5% of BSC blocks were impacted by sandwich attacks underscores the pressing need for enhanced security measures in DeFi ecosystems. While BSC’s popularity attracts attackers, it also highlights the challenges of balancing transparency with security in blockchain technology. For BSC and other DeFi platforms to thrive, addressing vulnerabilities and rebuilding user trust is paramount. Proactive steps such as improving transaction privacy and slippage protection can pave the way for a safer decentralized future.

37203648,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=106831,1733304337,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Only Four Wallets Hold Over 100K BTC, All Linked to Major Exchanges",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/100k-btc-exchange-wallets/,"Crypto Centralization? Four Wallets Hold Over 100K BTC In a striking revelation, crypto analyst HODL15Capital shared on the social media platform X that only four wallets worldwide hold over 100,000 BTC each , equivalent to billions of dollars. Interestingly, these wallets are all cold storage wallets belonging to major cryptocurrency exchanges , including Binance, Bitfinex, and Robinhood . The finding has sparked discussions within the crypto community about centralization, transparency, and the role of exchanges in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Breaking Down the Big Four Wallets 1. Binance: The Industry Giant Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, unsurprisingly owns one of these massive wallets. As a hub for millions of traders, Binance holds significant BTC reserves to facilitate liquidity and ensure seamless operations. 2. Bitfinex: A Longstanding Market Leader Bitfinex, known for its early adoption of Bitcoin trading, also maintains a cold wallet with over 100,000 BTC. This reflects its commitment to providing a secure environment for its user base. 3. Robinhood: From Stocks to Crypto Robinhood, the popular trading app that started with equities and expanded into crypto, is another significant BTC custodian. Its large holdings indicate growing interest in Bitcoin among retail investors using the platform. 4. The Fourth Wallet: Identity Unconfirmed While the exact identity of the fourth wallet was not disclosed, it is widely believed to be tied to another top-tier exchange or custodial service. The Role of Cold Wallets in Crypto Security Cold wallets, often referred to as “cold storage,” are offline wallets designed to provide maximum security by keeping assets disconnected from the internet. Why Exchanges Use Cold Wallets Security: Prevents hacking and unauthorized access. Reserve Management: Ensures liquidity for platform users while safeguarding the majority of assets. Transparency: Demonstrates the exchange’s ability to meet withdrawal demands. Criticisms and Concerns While cold wallets are secure, the concentration of such massive amounts of BTC in just a few addresses has raised eyebrows. Critics argue that this undermines Bitcoin’s vision of decentralization. Centralization in the Decentralized World Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized digital currency , aiming to reduce reliance on centralized entities like banks. However, the concentration of BTC in a handful of wallets—primarily exchange-controlled—suggests a paradox. Implications for the Market Liquidity Risks: A sudden release or movement of such large holdings could drastically impact market prices. Centralized Power: Exchanges wield significant influence over Bitcoin’s supply and accessibility. Counterarguments Proponents argue that exchanges are necessary for onboarding new users and providing liquidity. The use of cold wallets ensures the safety of funds, making these entities trustworthy custodians for the crypto community. Community Reactions The crypto community on X and other platforms has been buzzing with opinions about the report. Some users expressed concern over centralization, while others defended the exchanges, citing their role in driving adoption and market stability. Supporters Say: “Exchanges are gateways to mass adoption. Cold wallets are a sign of responsible fund management.” “It’s better to have large amounts of BTC secure in cold storage than at risk in hot wallets.” Critics Respond: “This level of concentration undermines the ethos of decentralization.” “Exchanges holding this much power is a systemic risk.” How Does This Compare Globally? While the spotlight is on these four wallets, smaller wallets also play a vital role in the ecosystem. Wallets holding between 1 and 10 BTC represent a significant portion of Bitcoin’s total supply, highlighting the diversity of holders. Institutional Holdings on the Rise As institutions like Grayscale and MicroStrategy continue to acquire BTC, their wallets further contribute to the concentration of Bitcoin holdings. This trend underscores the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrency as an asset class. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin? The concentration of over 100,000 BTC in just four wallets highlights both the maturity and challenges of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While exchanges provide essential services, the centralization of holdings raises questions about Bitcoin’s future as a decentralized currency. Possible Solutions to Reduce Centralization Encouraging self-custody among users to decentralize BTC holdings. Increased transparency from exchanges about fund management. Developing decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to reduce reliance on centralized platforms. Conclusion: Centralization in a Decentralized World The revelation that four wallets hold over 100,000 BTC , all linked to exchanges like Binance, Bitfinex, and Robinhood, sheds light on the evolving dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While these wallets represent security and liquidity, they also challenge the decentralized ideals that underpin Bitcoin’s creation. As the industry grows, finding a balance between centralization for practicality and decentralization for ideology will remain a critical discussion point.

Following an earlier attempt at bullish momentum last week, Ethereum has dropped by 2.4% in the past 24 hours, trading at $3,577 at the time of writing. This decline puts Ethereum at a 26.8% decrease from its all-time high of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Despite this, the network’s daily trading volume remains quite strong, registering $42.4 billion—a significant increase from late last month when volumes dipped below $35 billion. Related Reading: Ethereum Risk-Reward Ratio Is Now Attractive, Brokerage Firm Explains Chart Patterns Indicate Potential Rally While Ethereum’s current price trajectory may appear discouraging, analysts within the cryptocurrency community have expressed optimism regarding its long-term potential. Several technical indicators and chart patterns have emerged, leading some analysts to predict a significant rally for the asset in the coming months. One notable voice among the bullish analysts is CryptoBullet, a widely followed figure in the cryptocurrency space. In a recent post on X, the analyst highlighted a “cup and handle” formation on Ethereum’s monthly price chart. According to CryptoBullet, this pattern suggests that Ethereum could surge to new highs, potentially reaching $6,675. The analyst commented, “Did you guys see the $ETH monthly chart? Bullish AF. This month, we’re going to SMASH through the resistance. Cup&Handle Target – $6675.” Adding to the optimism, Venture Founder, another prominent analyst, projected an even more ambitious target for Ethereum. In a detailed analysis, the venture founder noted that Ethereum has been in a “triangular consolidation phase” for the past three years, a pattern reminiscent of its behavior from 2016 to 2017. The analyst predicted that Ethereum could break out of this consolidation and enter a new price paradigm, estimating a target of $15,937 by May 2025. Venture Founder stated, “Base Case: Ethereum likely to repeat this impulsive breakout it did between 2016-2017 to shoot to new ATH.” 3 years of triangle consolidation for #Ethereum and $ETH could enter a new paradigm which it consolidated for the past 7 years.

The cryptocurrency market has witnessed another major rally as TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain network , surged by 80% to $0.44 on the morning of December 4, 2024. Analysts are attributing this dramatic increase to a confluence of factors, with South Korea’s ongoing political instability taking center stage. How South Korea’s Political Instability Is Driving TRX Demand According to Rachael Lucas , a cryptocurrency analyst at BTC Markets, TRX’s price jump is closely linked to political turmoil in South Korea , where it plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency trading. TRX is commonly used for transferring assets between exchanges in the country. Amid heightened political unrest, restrictions on local crypto platforms have prompted traders to shift their holdings to international exchanges, spurring demand for TRX. South Korea is a key hub for cryptocurrency activity, and disruptions in its trading ecosystem often have ripple effects across global markets. Traders are utilizing TRX to bypass limitations, which explains the sudden spike in trading volume and price. Broader Trends Contributing to TRX’s Rally While political events may have catalyzed TRX’s rise, Min Jung , an analyst at Presto Research, believes the surge is part of a larger pattern. She pointed out that legacy cryptocurrencies like XRP and IOTA have also seen notable gains recently, suggesting a rotational trend within the market. Legacy Cryptocurrencies Are Back in the Spotlight Legacy tokens, including TRX, XRP, IOTA, and VET, have garnered renewed investor interest. Min Jung attributes this to a shift in sentiment as traders look for established cryptocurrencies with proven use cases, especially during times of volatility. TRX’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem A Preferred Token for Transfers TRX has carved out a niche as a reliable and cost-effective token for moving assets across exchanges. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it particularly attractive in high-volume trading environments, like those seen in South Korea. Tron Network’s Growing Influence The Tron blockchain network , spearheaded by Justin Sun, continues to expand its influence in decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). This ecosystem growth supports TRX’s underlying value and utility, further fueling its price action. Examining TRX’s Technical Performance Market Metrics Supporting the Surge Trading Volume: TRX’s trading volume spiked by over 200% in the past 24 hours, signaling heightened investor interest. Market Cap: The token’s market capitalization reached $4.3 billion, reinforcing its position as a top-tier cryptocurrency. Technical Indicators: TRX broke through key resistance levels, setting the stage for continued bullish momentum. Potential Resistance Levels While TRX’s 80% surge is impressive, analysts caution that the token faces resistance around $0.50, a psychological threshold that could trigger profit-taking. South Korea’s Political Turmoil: What’s Happening? South Korea is currently grappling with significant political instability, marked by protests and policy disputes. These events have affected the nation’s financial markets, including its robust cryptocurrency sector. Impact on Local Crypto Platforms Political unrest has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and temporary trading restrictions on local cryptocurrency platforms. Traders are responding by moving assets to international platforms, leveraging TRX for its speed and low costs. Global Ripple Effects The South Korean crypto market’s importance cannot be understated. Shifts in trading behavior within the country often influence global market dynamics, as seen in TRX’s recent rally. Can TRX Sustain Its Gains? Short-Term Momentum TRX’s price surge has been fueled by unique circumstances, including South Korea’s political situation and broader market trends. While these factors have created short-term momentum, sustaining this growth will depend on continued demand and positive sentiment. Long-Term Outlook Analysts like Min Jung emphasize that TRX’s long-term potential lies in its utility within the Tron ecosystem and its adoption in DeFi applications. If the network continues to innovate, TRX could see sustained growth beyond this temporary spike. What This Means for the Broader Crypto Market The TRX rally underscores the influence of geopolitical events on cryptocurrency markets. It also highlights the growing role of legacy cryptocurrencies in providing stability and liquidity during uncertain times. Implications for Investors For investors, TRX’s performance serves as a reminder of the importance of monitoring both market trends and external factors, such as political developments, that can drive sudden price movements. Conclusion: A New Chapter for TRX Amid Market Volatility The 80% surge in TRX’s value is a testament to the complex interplay between geopolitical events, market trends, and cryptocurrency fundamentals. South Korea’s political instability has undoubtedly played a role in this rally, but the broader resurgence of legacy tokens like TRX and XRP suggests deeper market dynamics at work. Whether this momentum can be sustained remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: TRX has cemented its position as a key player in the cryptocurrency landscape.

Meanwhile, other well known crypto figures are also facing legal challenges. Roger Ver is battling U.S. tax evasion charges that could result in a 30-year sentence, while ex-Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky pleaded guilty to fraud and price manipulation. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also recently urged the crypto industry to reject law firms hiring anti-crypto officials in resistance against regulatory hostility. Hydra Founder and Accomplices Sentenced Stanislav Moiseev, the founder of the infamous online black market and crypto mixing service Hydra, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Russian court. The Moscow Regional Court found Moiseev and 15 of his accomplices guilty of organizing a criminal community and the illegal production and sale of psychotropic substances and drugs. The court's decision was announced on Dec. 2 by the Moscow Prosecutor’s Office, and also included sentences for his accomplices ranging from 8 to 23 years in prison. Moiseev was fined $38,100 as well, or 4 million rubles, while his co-defendants were ordered to pay a collective $152,400. As part of the sentencing, properties and vehicles linked to the convicted people were confiscated. According to the Russian media outlet TASS , the sentences will be served in correctional colonies under very strict regimes. Hydra operated from 2015 until its shutdown in 2022, and was the largest darknet marketplace globally. In fact, it was responsible for 80% of all darknet-related crypto transactions in 2021. Over its operational years, Hydra facilitated the exchange of more than $5.2 billion in crypto, according to the United States Department of Justice. The platform was especially known for its sale of illegal items, including stolen credit card information, counterfeit currencies, and fraudulent identity documents. Hydra's operations became increasingly sophisticated over the years, and its cryptocurrency volumes on exchanges grew by 624% between 2018 and 2020, according to a 2021 report from Flashpoint and TRM Labs. Hydra crypto volumes between 2016 and 2020 (Source: Flashpoint ) The marketplace's downfall came in April of 2022, when German authorities dismantled its infrastructure and seized its Bitcoin servers based in the country. German law enforcement also reported that Hydra had 17 million customers and 19,000 vendor accounts at the time of its shutdown. Additionally, authorities confiscated almost a ton of narcotic and psychotropic substances. Hydra has been under investigation by Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs since 2016. The other people sentenced in the case included Alexander Chirkov, Andrei Trunov, Evgeny Andreev, Ivan Koryakin, Vadim Krasninsky, Georgy Kierobiani, Artur Kolesnikov, Nikolai Bilyk, Alekandr Kabalina, Mikhail Dombrovkogo, Alexander Aminova, and Sergey Czech. The convictions and sentences are subject to appeal. Unfortunately, darknet marketplaces still thrive, and their revenues reached at least $1.7 billion in 2023, according to Chainalysis . Roger Ver Battles Federal Tax Evasion Charges Other people involved in the crypto space are also butting heads with the law. Roger Ver , who is widely known as ”Bitcoin Jesus,” filed a motion in a California federal court to dismiss allegations of tax evasion brought against him by United States prosecutors. Ver argues that the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) “exit tax,” which applies to U.S. citizens with more than $2 million in assets renouncing their citizenship, is unconstitutional. In his Dec. 3 filing , Ver claimed the tax violates the Constitution's Apportionment and Due Process Clauses and described the relevant tax provisions as ”inscrutably vague” regarding digital assets. The exit tax is designed to make sure that citizens fulfill their tax obligations before renouncing citizenship. However, Ver believes that prosecutors ignored key evidence, including documents proving he did not intend to file a fraudulent tax return, and that one of his lawyers was unlawfully interrogated. The case stems from allegations that were made by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles, which accused Ver of evading more than $48 million in taxes by failing to report capital gains from selling tens of thousands of Bitcoin for $240 million in cash. Ver was later arrested in Spain on April 30. Ver claimed the exit tax process was slowed down by practical challenges, including the lack of liquid Bitcoin markets at the time. Nonetheless, the U.S. government holds firm that Ver filed a fraudulent tax return after renouncing his U.S. citizenship in favor of Japanese citizenship in 2014. Ver faces charges of tax evasion, mail fraud, and filing false tax returns, which collectively carry a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in federal prison if he is convicted. Ver has been an advocate for Bitcoin since 2011, and gained a lot of recognition for promoting the cryptocurrency when it was still valued under $1. He later became a leading proponent of Bitcoin Cash after the 2017 Bitcoin network hard fork. However, Ver’s reputation has been marred by controversy, including a 2022 dispute with CoinFlex. The company claimed he owed the platform $47 million in USD Coin. Ver also served 10 months in federal prison in 2002 and 2003 for selling explosives on eBay. Ex-Celsius CEO Pleads Guilty Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, reached a plea agreement with United States prosecutors. Mashinsky pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and a scheme to manipulate the price of the CEL token. This happened after a failed bid by Mashinsky's legal team to have the charges dismissed. During a conference in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on Dec. 3, Mashinsky acknowledged his actions , including making false statements about Celsius' Earn Program, which misled investors and resulted in him profiting approximately $42 million. Mashinsky also admitted to falsely claiming that Celsius had regulatory approval and to misleading statements about not selling his CEL tokens. After accepting full responsibility for these actions, he entered a plea agreement that reduced his charges from seven to two years. Each charge carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, which could potentially amount to 30 years if served consecutively. His sentencing is scheduled for April 8. The plea deal was made after Judge John Koeltl rejected arguments from Mashinsky’s legal team, and ruled that their motions to dismiss were either moot or lacked merit. Before the plea agreement, Mashinsky maintained his innocence and was released on a $40-million bond. His trial was initially set for January of 2025. Mashinsky’s case makes him one of many high-profile crypto executives facing potential prison time, including former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who received a 25-year sentence, and Binance’s ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao. CZ pleaded guilty and served four months. Mashinsky stepped down as Celsius CEO in September of 2022 due to increasing scrutiny of the platform's operations. Roni Cohen-Pavon, Celsius’ former chief revenue officer, also pleaded guilty to charges related to CEL price manipulation in September of 2023 and is set to be sentenced on Dec. 11. Coinbase Urges Crypto Industry to Reject Anti-Crypto Officials Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the crypto exchange will no longer work with law firms that employ people who were involved in what he described as anti-crypto actions during their government service. In a post on Dec. 3, Armstrong criticized lawmakers' efforts to undermine the crypto industry without providing any clear regulations and called on the broader crypto community to avoid supporting these individuals. He believes there is a need to hold law firms accountable, and encouraged people to recognize that hiring former officials with anti-crypto agendas could lead to losing business from industry players. Armstrong specifically mentioned Coinbase's decision to sever ties with the law firm Milbank after it hired Gurbir Grewal , who was the former enforcement director of the U.S. SEC. Grewal resigned from the SEC in October, and was involved in recommending more than 100 enforcement actions that targeted noncompliance in the digital asset industry. Milbank welcomed Grewal to its litigation and arbitration group, and its chairman praised his career achievements. However, Armstrong argued that Grewal’s tenure at the SEC was far from ordinary and that senior officials cannot claim to have been merely following orders during their time at the agency. The announcement was made amidst growing optimism in the crypto community after Donald Trump’s 2024 U.S. presidential election victory. Many people now believe this could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BCH|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|FORKS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-04 09:32:37

At this point, Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun stated in his posts that TRX would be the next XRP and what he said came true. Related News: What's Happening With Tron? Will It Be The Next XRP? What's The Source Of The Rise As TRX Breaks Records? TRX has increased by 70% in the last 24 hours and reached $0.40. While this rise of TRX made a big impact on the market, it is thought that the TRX rally is due to political instability in South Korea. As is known, according to the news received yesterday evening, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol declared a state of emergency for the first time in 40 years. Evaluating the rise in Tron, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas attributed the rise to the political turmoil and events in South Korea. Lucas noted that TRX is widely used to transfer funds between exchanges in the country, and that trading restrictions on Korean platforms due to political unrest may have prompted investors to move their assets to other exchanges, which in turn may have increased demand for TRX. “The recent rally in Tron (TRX) appears to be partly due to political instability in South Korea. TRX’s role as a widely used transfer token across exchanges, particularly in South Korea, makes it a widely used tool for investors looking to move funds quickly between platforms. This has increased demand and price.” Presto Research analyst Min Jung also noted that political events in South Korea may have contributed to TRX’s rise, but it is unlikely to be the sole reason. He said that this surge in Tron is part of a broader bullish trend, with legacy cryptocurrencies like XRP experiencing cyclical gains and tokens like IOTA and VET also seeing recent increases. *Not investment advice.

Grayscale’s filing highlights growing institutional confidence in Solana, following in the footsteps of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which scored their own ETFs on Wall Street earlier this year. Grayscale Files For SOL ETF In US According to a 19b-4 form submitted Tuesday, Grayscale seeks to improve investor access to the SOL cryptocurrency by allowing shares of the Solana Trust to trade as an ETF on a regulated exchange. Grayscale noted that the ETF conversion would improve SOL’s price tracking and remove inefficiencies caused by its unlisted structure. If approved, the Trust would trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker GSOL. The filing indicates that the Grayscale Solana Trust is “the world’s largest investment fund by assets under management”, holding at least $134 million in AUM. Grayscale claims the Solana held in the trust is roughly 0.1% of the total SOL in circulation. Coinbase Custody was named the custodian for Grayscale’s spot SOL ETF, while BNY Mellon Asset Servicing is the fund’s administrator and transfer agent. Grayscale is now the fifth asset manager that has made its SOL ETF application official with the SEC, following VanEck , 21Shares , Canary Capital , and Bitwise . Franklin Templeton has also expressed interest in vying for a spot SOL ETF but is yet to formally submit paperwork to the SEC. A spot Solana exchange-traded fund would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL without requiring them to buy and store the token themselves. The price of SOL, alongside other cryptocurrencies, has rocketed higher following pro-crypto Donald Trump’s historic comeback on Nov. 6. His re-election promises a more lenient regulatory environment for the fast-growing crypto industry. Adding to investors’ optimism on the likelihood of spot Solana ETFs notching federal approval to start trading in the U.S. is the imminent departure of current SEC chair, Gary Gensler. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC named SOL as an unregistered security in separate lawsuits it filed against Kraken , Binance , and Coinbase . SOL gained roughly 4.4% after Grayscale’s filing and is up over 135% on a year-to-date basis.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-04 09:35:40

With a 230% increase in value over the past year, SHIB has generated excitement among investors. Despite some market fluctuations, the token’s strong performance signals potential for further growth in 2024. Analysts suggest SHIB could be on track to surpass its all-time high (ATH) after breaking a year-long downtrend, fueling hopes for even bigger gains ahead. Is ATH Soon After Shiba Inu Price Broke 4-Year Downtrend? Shiba Inu price is showing signs of a major breakout after breaking a significant four-year downtrend. The cryptocurrency, which has seen a steady decline since its all-time high in October 2021, may be on track to surpass that peak if its current bullish momentum continues. The last time SHIB reached its highest value of $0.00008845 was over four years ago, on October 28, 2021. Since then, the token has experienced a sharp 65.62% decline, raising concerns among investors. However, recent price movements suggest a reversal may be in progress, as SHIB has finally broken out of its prolonged downtrend. Analysts now speculate that Shiba Inu could reach a new all-time high if the upward trend persists. With growing investor confidence and increasing market activity, the Shiba Inu price prediction may just be gearing up for another surge that could eclipse its previous ATH. Source- X SHIB Price Surge Sparks Bullish Optimism Shiba Inu has seen an impressive surge of over 80% in the past month, including a 22% rise in the past week. The SHIB price is currently at $0.0000303, showing signs of continuing this upward trend with a 3% daily increase. This rally echoes memories of SHIB’s explosive performance in 2021, fueling speculation that a similar surge could be on the horizon. Bitcoin’s recent rally above $96,000 has further stoked the bullish sentiment across the crypto market. If Bitcoin pushes past $100k, many believe this could propel SHIB’s price to ATH. Major altcoins such as ETH, BNB, and TRX also witness price growth, adding to the positive market atmosphere. Top meme coins , including Dogecoin, PEPE, and Floki, have similarly experienced upward momentum, contributing to the broader trend. Whale activity in SHIB has been particularly notable, with large-scale investors increasing interest. Adding to the bullish outlook, Shiba Inu’s ecosystem is evolving with significant updates, particularly in Shibarium and Shibburn projects. The burn rate for SHIB has reached new heights, with over 2 billion tokens burned in the past 24 hours.

This bullisy cryptocurrency market trend shows no signs of stopping. Investors wonder if this momentum is enough to propel XRP price to its all-time high (ATH) this week. Will Ripple bulls come through or will profit-taking catalyze a crash? Can XRP Price Hit ATH After a Massive Bullish Surge Crypto expert tweeted that the recent market retracement for XRP signals a strong price movement, with expectations pointing toward a potential breakout. According to the expert, the price of XRP is likely to surge to an all-time high of $3.80 within the next 24 hours. XRP has been showing remarkable resilience, and with this latest trend, many believe the digital asset is on the cusp of a major rally. Strong technical indicators and increasing market sentiment fuel the anticipation. Source: Tweet XRP price has recently witnessed an strong rally, erasing over three and a half years of losses in a matter of weeks. The Ripple has surged more than 430% since Donald Trump’s reelection as U.S. president, pushing its price from under $0.5 to surpass $1, then $2, and eventually hitting $2.60. This breakthrough comes after XRP broke out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a potential continuation of its bullish momentum. Ripple Price Eyes For A Bullish Break Out The past week has been particularly eventful for XRP, as its market capitalization soared past the $150 billion mark, a level not seen since 2018. This resurgence is largely driven by rising expectations surrounding the imminent approval of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, by the NYDFS. With XRP’s recent performance, speculation is growing that the cryptocurrency could reach its ATH of $3.84, set in January 2018. As the bullish trend continues, analysts believe that if momentum builds further, the Ripple price could break its previous record and enter new price territory. The Ripple explosive growth has sparked widespread interest in the crypto market. XRP may be on the verge of achieving a major milestone if the momentum continues. The price of XRP hovered at $2.45, reflecting a notable 45% surge over the past week. This rally captured market attention, with a slight increase in the last 24 hours, continuing the bullish momentum. On the technical front, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 4-hour chart sits at 63, indicating that XRP is nearing overbought conditions.

In a detailed blog post, the Ethereum co-founder highlighted the need for wallets that align with blockchain’s core principles, gaining support from major industry players like Coinbase and Uniswap. Buterin stressed that Ethereum's success as a decentralized platform relies heavily on the quality of wallets users depend on. He proposed advanced features like social recovery and stealth addresses, aiming to make wallets both secure and user-friendly. Social recovery, for instance, allows users to assign trusted individuals to help recover lost private keys, addressing a significant challenge in wallet security. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed this sentiment, expressing interest in integrating such features into Coinbase Wallet. Privacy enhancements also play a central role in Buterin’s vision. He highlighted tools like Waku and zero-knowledge proof technologies (ZK-SNARKs) that could improve transaction confidentiality and protect sensitive information. Innovative solutions like Myna Wallet and Zkemail were showcased as examples of integrating privacy-friendly IDs into Ethereum addresses. These approaches allow users to verify ownership without revealing personal data, reinforcing the ethos of blockchain transparency and privacy. Uniswap has already begun implementing Buterin’s ideas by introducing features like in-app bridging and cross-layer token swaps. The decentralized exchange announced its collaboration on ERC-7683, a protocol for seamless swaps between Ethereum’s main network and Layer 2 solutions. These upgrades aim to enhance usability and streamline decentralized finance ( DeFi ) interactions. While Buterin also touched on futuristic concepts like AI-driven wallet defense systems, he acknowledged that such ideas remain impractical with current technology. For now, the focus lies on practical, immediate improvements that can strengthen Ethereum’s foundation. Buterin’s proposals mark a shift in how wallets are designed, with industry leaders like Coinbase and Uniswap taking steps to adopt these innovations. These changes could redefine the way users interact with blockchain networks, paving the way for a more secure and user-friendly decentralized future.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-04 09:42:03

Considering the current BTC market sentiment and rising buying demand among Chinese investors, CFX price might reach $0.19 in November. In 2025, CFX might record maximum price of $0.4773. Conflux Network (CFX) is a high-speed layer 1 blockchain that combines proof-of-work consensus with proof-of-stake finality. Originating from China, it follows local regulations, earning it the nickname “Chinese Ethereum.” The network’s native CFX token serves various purposes, such as being a store-of-value and a governance token.

When considering the future value of the CFX token in 2024 and beyond, our CFX network price prediction takes into account various factors that could influence its price.

The Conflux Network is the only blockchain in China that meets regulatory standards, making it a likely choice for Chinese investors who might prefer buying CFX tokens over Bitcoin. Currently, there is no roadmap for the Conflux Network beyond 2030. However, looking at its past updates, there’s a strong chance it could become a top layer 1 blockchain in 2025’s crypto market. For 2025, projections indicate that the Conflux could see a low of $0.3979. The price can reach a high of $0.4773, with the median price likely to be around $0.4123. Conflux price forecast 2026 The team has prepared 2.4 billion CFX tokens as grant awards to encourage developers to broaden its network. With each token priced at $0.2, this amounts to nearly $600 million. The value could increase if the token price goes up. In a bullish scenario, by 2026, the price of Conflux is predicted to bottom out at $0.6022. The peak price could be as high as $0.6951, with an expected average price of $0.6228 throughout the year. Conflux (CFX) price prediction 2027 The analysis for 2027 suggests that Conflux could have a minimum price of $0.8739. The price may escalate to a maximum of $1.06, averaging around $0.9050. Conflux price prediction 2028 It is anticipated that the Conflux price will reach a minimum of $1.22 in 2028. The maximum price might hit $1.51, with an average price of $1.25 throughout the year. Conflux price prediction 2029 Predictions for 2029 show Conflux reaching a minimum price of $1.79. The price could climb to a maximum of $2.11, with an average of $1.86 over the year. Conflux (CFX) price prediction 2030 In 2030, Conflux could trade at a minimum of $2.57. The price is expected to peak at around $3.08, with the average trading value likely to be $2.64.

By the end of 2024, CFX price might record a minimum of $0.2780. The price may peak at $0.3427, with the average trading price anticipated around $0.2893. However, the future market potential for Conflux entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation in China and investor sentiment in long-term holding.

Gambardello shared his views in a recent post on X, highlighting the potential impact of ETF-related developments on ADA’s market value. Gambardello emphasized that Cardano already benefits from numerous positive developments within its ecosystem, although he did not provide specific examples. According to the analyst, favorable ETF news could catalyze ADA’s price to the next level. Cardano has a lot going for it right now. But on top of it all, if Cardano has similar ETF news as $XRP , please take note how fast $ADA hits $3. — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) December 2, 2024 Cardano (ADA) Position in the ETF Landscape Unlike XRP and Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) has yet to gain ETF filings. Recently, the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs has sparked discussions about which other assets might follow. Industry experts have identified ADA, XRP, and Solana as potential candidates for ETF adoption. Despite this optimism, XRP and Solana lead in this aspect. Multiple asset managers, including WisdomTree , Bitwise , Canary Capital, and 21Shares, have submitted applications for ETFs linked exclusively to XRP. In contrast, ADA’s representation in ETF filings is limited to a basket fund managed by Bitwise. Bitwise’s application involves converting the Bitwise 10 Crypto Fund (BITW) into an exchange-traded product (ETP). This fund includes ten prominent cryptocurrencies, such as XRP and Cardano (ADA) with weightings of 5.7% and 1.6%, respectively. In addition, Grayscale Investments has sought to convert its multi-coin fund, which also features XRP, into an ETF. While these developments showcase growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, Cardano remains underrepresented in ETF-related initiatives compared to XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Market Performance and Institutional Interest XRP’s recent surge has been fueled by significant institutional backing and multiple ETF filings . In the past 30 days, XRP has experienced a remarkable price increase of over 470%, climbing from $0.4937 to $2.85. This growth is attributed to increasing investor confidence driven by exclusive ETF applications. Although Cardano experienced a substantial price rally recently, it still lags behind XRP in terms of performance and gains. ADA’s value has risen by over 270% within the same period, moving from $0.32 to $1.32. In summary, while XRP currently leads in ETF filings and price gains, Cardano holds the potential for significant growth if it garners comparable institutional support. Gambardello’s insights underscore the importance of ETF filings as a potential driver for ADA’s market performance, providing a glimpse into what might lie ahead for the asset.

This decision is part of DCG’s broader strategy to streamline Foundry’s operations while focusing resources on new ventures, including Yuma, an AI ecosystem accelerator launched by DCG founder Barry Silbert. The layoffs impacted a significant portion of Foundry’s 250 employees, with 20 reassigned to Yuma and most others dismissed. The company’s hardware team was entirely cut, and Foundry is reportedly considering selling its mining site operations team. Despite these challenges, Foundry’s core mining pool operations remain intact. Bitcoin mining has faced increasing challenges due to higher mining difficulty and reduced profitability, particularly following the halving event earlier this year. These factors have pushed many mining companies, including Foundry, to reevaluate their operational efficiency. While Foundry still ranks among the largest Bitcoin mining pools globally, controlling a significant share of the hash rate alongside AntPool, the industry’s financial pressure is evident. DCG’s recent history includes financial troubles, such as lawsuits from its subsidiary Genesis over unpaid loans and the sale of CoinDesk . However, not all DCG entities are struggling—Silbert’s launch of Yuma suggests a pivot toward AI and new technologies as a way to diversify the group’s business interests. Foundry’s financial health remains unclear. DCG’s Q3 2024 shareholder letter projected $80 million in revenue for Foundry, but the layoffs suggest underlying challenges. These cuts signal potential shifts in Foundry’s focus and operations, leaving its future uncertain as it navigates a volatile mining market.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-04 09:49:53

XRP continues its bullish swing, which was recorded this month as the price hit levels not seen in several years. The recent positive sentiments drove the wider market cap above $3.6 trillion, surging 3.5% in the last 24 hours. A look at crypto charts shows XRP ahead in terms of daily gains among the top 10 assets by market cap. XRP trades at $2.65, recording 89% inflows and taking its market cap to $150 billion. Although daily trading volume remains in the red zone, XRP bulls show signs of a recovery. In a longer time frame, the asset posted 33% gains in the last seven days, wiping out losses seen earlier this week. Similarly, monthly numbers are up 182% as experts tips further bullish sentiments. Charts Show Bull Flag Pattern The recent trading pattern shows the price action forming a bull flag in a 24-hour window. From this, the asset is expected to breach the present mark and rise to new levels. While this seems a far stretch with an upper bull target at $4.25, sharp swings in the last 30 days have ignited institutional interest. Higher open interest is another factor pointing north for XRP bulls as traders use it to assess market sentiments. Since Donald Trump’s success at the US Presidential polls, figures have increased as users anticipate more institutional interest . In previous years, XRP traded at new lows due to the SEC’s lawsuit weakening sentiments. With anticipated clear rules, the asset continues to record inflows. This market trend also affected other assets after Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs, currently trading at $96,941.

In addition to this, 17 other crypto exchanges have been charged for evading GST, with a total amount of ₹824.14 crore. Big platforms like WazirX, CoinDCX, and CoinSwitch Kuber are also in the spotlight, with WazirX facing a ₹40.51 crore tax evasion case.

Ver, 45, was arrested in February while attending a cryptocurrency conference in Barcelona and is awaiting a Spanish court’s decision on his extradition to the U.S. The charges stem from the sale of $240 million in cryptocurrencies and an “exit tax” tied to Ver renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014. His legal team argues that the case is politically motivated, labeling it part of the Biden administration’s heavy-handed approach to crypto enforcement. They claim the charges are an attempt to regulate the cryptocurrency industry through prosecution rather than clear policy guidelines. Critics in the crypto community view Ver’s arrest as an example of targeting prominent figures to set a precedent. Author Bret Weinstein described the case as unjust, stating Ver’s “crime” was promoting decentralized technologies that empower individuals. Ver has long been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin and decentralized finance, calling for reduced government involvement in financial systems. Despite his significant contributions to cryptocurrency, including early investments in Ripple Labs, BitPay, and Kraken, Ver is no stranger to legal battles. He has faced multiple lawsuits from crypto firms like Genesis and ConFLEX, and his recent arrest has reignited debates over U.S. crypto regulations and their impact on industry pioneers. The government has recently taken a strong stance against high-profile crypto figures. Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and associates of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried have all faced successful prosecutions, reflecting increased scrutiny of the industry. Born in the U.S., Ver moved to Japan in 2006 and became a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis in 2014. Known for promoting Bitcoin when it was worth less than $1, Ver frequently gave away BTC to encourage adoption. His arrest raises questions about the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the treatment of its early innovators.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-04 09:53:36

The entities include, Koto Crypto, Finchain, Crypto Force, Coin Cashy, BTC Bay, XT.com, and Stabit. The first entity, Koto Crypto based out of DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Center) which claims to be registered in DMCC Dubai, is carrying out non regulated virtual asset activities operating without a proper license. Based on press releases from Koto Crypto, they have been operating in Dubai as an OTC Crypto provider since 2023. As per the notice , “Any activities related to virtual assets conducted on this platform are therefore not in compliance with VARA Regulations. Engaging with unlicensed platforms that are not in compliance with VARA Regulations exposes users to significant financial risks and potential legal consequences for violating regulatory requirements, or criminal laws.” The same applies to Finchain Payment Service Provider L.L.C. and Finchain Technologies DMCC, which also claim to be registered in DMCC. Moreover, the Finchain website is no longer operational, claiming they are undergoing maintenance. Vara also mentioned Crypto Force, which is registered in DMCC and conducting unregulated virtual asset activities. In addition, VARA issued alerts for Coin Cashy , BTC Bay , whose website is no longer active. As for the 7th crypto entity put under alert status, Stabit, which is associated with Genesis Digital Assets Commercial Brokers Co. L.L.C, also offering un-regulated crypto trading services. XT.com was recently hacked for $1.7 million XT (XT.com), one of the non-regulated crypto entities under the VARA alert, with almost half a million followers on X, recently suspended withdrawals on November 28 th , after suspecting $1.7 million hack. The exchange suspended withdrawals, citing “wallet upgrade and maintenance.” The statement was issued about an hour before blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that XT.com “appeared to have been hacked” for $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrency. XT.com subsequently issued a statement acknowledging an “abnormal transfer of platform wallet assets.” The exchange tried to assure users that they would not be affected. According to PeckShield data, the suspected XT.com hacker had already swapped funds stolen from the exchange for 461.58 Ether. VARA calls on users not to deal with these 7 entities All these entities are unlicensed as per VARA and, as such, are not operating legally in the jurisdiction. As such any promotion, advertising, or solicitation related to these seven entities has not been approved by VARA, and the platform is therefore prohibited from offering, promoting, or marketing any virtual asset products or services in Dubai or to its residents. VARA advised investors and consumers to avoid using them and to exercise caution when considering interactions with unregulated platforms. The regulator also notified users that access to these websites might be restricted without prior notice. As per the regulator, “It is recommended to take immediate necessary measures to ensure protection of user assets.” The alerts come after VARA announced in October that it issued cease-and-desist orders, along with accompanying fines, to 7 entities for operating without the required licenses and for breaching marketing regulations. VARA fines 18 entities for failing to comply with regulations On November 1, VARA shared that 18 Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), commercially licensed on mainland under Dubai’s Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) have thus far, been issued fines for failing to comply with VARA’s directives and regulatory guidance. As per the regulator, these enforcement actions are a pre-requisite to remedy compliance breaches and assure global markets that VARA’s regime can be trusted to have consistency and resilience in deployment. The Dubai regulator noted that if these regulatory gaps are not actively addressed by year-end, further penalties will apply.

The Altcoin Season Index by platforms including Blockchain Center and CoinMarketCap indicated the market has entered altcoin season, with confirmation from one of the top analysts Markus Thielen , CEO of 10x Research. With Bitcoin price in consolidation mode, crypto such as HBAR, XLM, XRP, SUI, ALGO, and OM have led the rally in the last 3 months. Bitcoin dominance has dropped to 53.80% today. Altcoin Season Driving Rally in XRP, SOL, HBAR, SHIB The crypto market is witnessing a FOMO and panic simultaneously, reports 10x Research on December 4. Top analyst Markus Thielen confirmed that altcoin season has priced-in and the trend will sustain and potentially expand trading opportunities. Besides, several altcoins have climbed in the altcoin season rally after Bitcoin retraced from the $99,700 range. BTC price now exchanged hands at $96K. HBAR has recorded an over 600% rally, XLM and XRP followed with over 500% and 400% price growth in the last 90 days. Notably, the Altcoin Season Index has hit 86 today, signaling a massive sentiment towards further gains in altcoins. Markus Thielen expects the demand for crypto tokens will likely continue until Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Altcoin Season Index. Source: Blockchaincenter South Korea Driving the Altcoin Season According to 10x Research, retail-focused trading volumes in South Korean crypto market have surged immensely. In the past 24 hours, it surged to almost $34 billion, marking the highest level. This comes as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared emergency martial law. He now faces impeachment for his decision. Ripple (XRP) led the trading volume, followed by Dogecoin (DOGE), Stellar (XLM), Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Hedera (HBAR), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These high-momentum cryptocurrencies are being driven predominantly by retail traders, capitalizing on and reinforcing momentum-driven trends. What’s Ahead For XRP, SOL, HBAR, and SHIB? The market rotation for Ripple XRP surge shows no signs of slowing down, said Markus Thielen. He added that the rally stands out as “one of the most extraordinary developments in the crypto market this year.” Further, XRP market cap has now surpassed $150 billion to become the third-largest crypto. This explosive move followed a breakout from a long-term triangle pattern, catalyzed by the U.S. election. Source: 10x Research As altcoin season has arrived, Ethereum and Solana are likely to drive the crypto market again. However, the current trends indicate rotation to XRP and other breakout crypto. Ethereum price will gradually surpass the $4000 level if it breaks above $3800 resistance. On the other hand, Solana price will rally toward $400 and $600, as per crypto analysts. HBAR price trades at $0.329, down 5% in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has decreased by 33% amid profit booking by traders. However, traders are bullish on Hedera amid multiple partnerships and developments amid altcoin season. HBAR price is anticipated to hit $0.57 next year. Shiba Inu price jumped 4% in last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.00003039. The trading volumes on both spot and derivatives market have surged in the last 24 hours. Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama spotlighted upcoming dog-themed meme coin SHIFU coin launch . He also hinted at the TREAT token launch near Christmas. The developments could further trigger a rally in SHIB prices.

Bitcoin has been range bound, oscillating around $95,0000 since Nov. 20, two weeks ago. It has failed to register a new all-time high but remains in price discovery as long-term holders are “pumping the sell-side brakes,” said Check. Pumping The Bitcoin Brakes Right now, markets are approximately six times off the FTX cycle low, “and the market has hit resistance, chopped around, and corrected from similar levels in both of the prior cycles,” he added in a newsletter on Dec. 2. However, it has still powered onward to massively higher highs. The analyst compared the market to a car, with demand being the accelerator and sell-side pressure being the brakes. The demand is “pedal to the metal,” with Michael Saylor and the spot Bitcoin ETFs hammering the buy-side, he said before adding: “If the Long-Term Holders are pumping the sell-side brakes at an equal magnitude, the car isn’t going anywhere.” One of the biggest misconceptions in #Bitcoin is that HODLers and OGs never sell.

On-chain analysis platform Glassnode concurred, reporting that daily realized profits to exchanges have cooled off significantly, representing a 42% drop from the peak in mid-November. “This sharp decline signals reduced profit-taking activity, suggesting the market has entered a consolidation phase.” After hitting an all-time high at $99.4K, #Bitcoin has fluctuated between $92K and $98K this past week.

However, mixed technical signals suggest both opportunities and risks for traders. SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key momentum indicator, has cooled significantly, dropping from overbought levels. This shift indicates reduced buying pressure and a possible consolidation phase. While an RSI decline from high levels often points to traders taking profits, it also signals a more balanced market, potentially paving the way for sustainable price movements. The behavior of SHIB's largest holders, known as whales, adds another layer of complexity. The number of whale addresses holding over 1 billion SHIB has dropped by 155 in the past month, suggesting that some large investors are offloading tokens after the recent price surge. This selling pressure could create short-term headwinds, but the redistribution of holdings among smaller investors may lead to greater decentralization, which is beneficial for long-term stability . On the technical side, SHIB has dipped below its shortest Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a signal that short-term bearish momentum may be building. Despite this, longer-term EMA trends remain positive, keeping the potential for a bullish reversal intact. The price is at a critical juncture where both correction and recovery scenarios are equally plausible. A bearish outcome could see SHIB test lower support levels, while renewed buying momentum might drive the price higher, potentially surpassing recent highs. For traders, SHIB’s current volatility offers both risks and opportunities. The market awaits a decisive move that will determine whether the coin continues its upward trajectory or enters a corrective phase.",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-04 09:59:10

Despite producing fewer Bitcoins, the London-headquartered crypto mining firm reported $3.4 million in revenue for November, up from $3.0 million in October, what Argo attributes to the “higher hashprice and BTC price realized in November as compared to October.” You might also like: Foundry slashes workforce to focus on core BTC mining operations The November update follows a challenging Q3 for Argo, which reported a 28% year-over-year revenue decline.

However, total revenue for the first nine months of 2024 stood at $36.7 million, a slight increase from $34.4 million during the same period in 2023. During Q3, Argo mined 123 BTC, averaging 1.3 BTC per day. Mining margins also took a hit, dropping to 8% from 58% in Q3 2023, largely due to the absence of power credits that had supported last year’s performance. Despite the challenges, the company’s net loss for the quarter improved to $6.3 million from $9.9 million in Q3 2023.

Notably, the CME FedWatch Tool has indicated a 74.5% possibility of a 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its forthcoming Dec. 18 meeting. This comes after the 50 bps rate cut in September and 25 bps last month. If it materializes, this move could lower the federal fund’s target rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Such a cut, widely perceived as a dovish signal, will likely bolster the price action of Bitcoin and altcoins. The Fed’s anticipated shift follows months of inflation data that suggests prices are stabilizing. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently voiced support for the cut, citing downward inflation trends. Similarly, Federal Reserve officials, including Raphael Bostic, have hinted at an open mind on whether the bank should cut rates. Market expectations for such a cut have steadily risen in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) price, which saw a massive uptrend in November, hit the $99,655 resistance on the path to $100,000 before facing a pullback driven by profit-taking trades from long-term holders. BTC now changes hands at $96,812 at press time, up 1.52% over the past 24 hours. The price has continued to consolidate between $93,000 and $96,000, suggesting the market awaits a major catalyst to push higher. You might also like: Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surge 90%, closing in on Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC holdings Speaking with crypto.news, Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, argues that a dovish Fed move could provide the necessary momentum. He notes that rate cuts reduce borrowing costs and increase liquidity, conditions that historically favor Bitcoin due to its inflation-hedging appeal. “Freed-up liquidity often translates to more fiat in circulation, driving inflation concerns and prompting investors to seek stable alternatives like Bitcoin,” Sakharov observed. Additionally, Bitcoin’s price actions are supported by a mix of factors, including institutional interest. Sakharov emphasized that the limited supply created by the halving, coupled with increased accumulation, could drive a breakout above $100,000. He also pointed to the optimism surrounding pro-crypto policies from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump , a sentiment fueling market momentum. “Beyond these macroeconomic projections, the market is still hyped about the emergence of Donald Trump as US President. The optimism that a pro-crypto President will take charge for four years helped push the price of Bitcoin above the $99,000 mark.” Sakharov said. “The combined impacts of incoming rate cuts and sustained BTC accumulation by institutional investors can propel the coin’s price above the $100,000 mark this year,” Sakharov added. Notably, as the Federal Reserve’s meeting approaches, scheduled for December 17 and 18, market participants also have their eyes set on other economic indicators that could determine price action. Upcoming employment data and holiday sales trends will further inform the central bank’s decision. However, any unexpected signs of persistent inflation could temper the Fed’s dovish pivot and dampen Bitcoin’s bullish outlook. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 10:11:41
37204913,https://crypto.news/?p=14316080,1733307116,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37204913.jpeg,AMP surged 60% amid increased whale interest,https://crypto.news/amp-surged-60-amid-increased-whale-interest/,"Ampera’s AMP rose 62% in the last 24 hours and continued its rally as on-chain metrics indicated whales have begun accumulating the altcoin, driven by its increasing utility. AMP ( AMP ) soared to a high of $0.0133 on Wednesday morning, marking a jump of over 330% from its lowest point this year. The surge in price pushed its market cap over $1 billion for the first time in 29 months before settling at $978 million when writing. The altcoin’s rally coincided with a 750% surge in daily trading volume, which reached over $601 million, while AMP also trended on Google on the back of heightened retail interest. Why is AMP price rising? There are three potential catalysts driving AMP’s recent rally. Firstly, AMP’s surge coincided with a broader rally in the altcoin market, as major cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Tron ( TRX ) posted significantly higher daily gains of 17.6% and 68.8%, respectively, compared to Bitcoin’s modest 1.4% rise during the same period. Second, Flexa , a digital payments platform that uses AMP as collateral, recently announced its integration with the Zcash wallet app ‘Zashi.’ The integration allows users to make purchases at Flexa-enabled U.S. stores without revealing their wallet or currency details. You might also like: Bitcoin eyes $100,000 amid 74.5% probability of 25bps rate cut As more transactions occur on the platform, the demand for AMP to serve as collateral naturally increases. This reduces the token’s available supply, creating upward pressure on its price, which is potentially fueling growth for the altcoin. Third, AMP’s rally has been bolstered by a surge in whale activity over the past 24 hours. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that whale holder netflow jumped over 150%, shifting from a $186K outflow on Dec. 2 to $473K in inflows on Dec. 3, signaling renewed interest from large investors. AMP price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — Dec. 4 | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, on the daily chart, AMP has risen above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages, indicating bulls are still in control. Further, the 50-day SMA has crossed over the 200-day SMA, forming a golden cross, a major bullish sign in technical analysis. AMP MACD chart — Dec. 4 | Source: crypto.news Further, the MACD line (blue) and the signal line (orange) on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator have been moving higher above the zero mark, which means the rally still holds significant momentum. Considering these signals, AMP could potentially continue its rally, a sentiment also echoed by analyst Javon Marks, who projected that AMP could climb to $0.07048—a potential increase of over 470% from its current price.

Accordingly, the world's largest digital asset company, Grayscale, has applied for a spot Solana ETF. While it was stated that Solana, XRP and other altcoin ETFs have a higher chance of being approved under the Trump administration, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyyfart made a new post about Solana ETFs. James Seyffart, who believes the spot Solana ETF will be approved under Trump's new SEC administration, said it's “just a matter of when, not if” for the SOL ETF to launch. Related News: BREAKING!

With the appointment of a new SEC chairman, it is only a matter of when for spot Solana ETFs to launch, the Bloomberg analyst said. Seyffart cautioned, however, that this does not mean approval for SOL ETFs is imminent. The analyst believes the Solana ETFs will be approved, but he is not sure about the timeline, as Seyffart said he thinks the SOL ETFs could get approval in August 2025 or the process could extend into 2026.

Is $1 Within Reach?,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-trx-coin-price-follow-xrps-massive-rally-is-1-within-reach/,"The post Will TRX Coin Price Follow XRP’s Massive Rally? Is $1 Within Reach? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Tron (TRX) has surged by 66% in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.44 before retracing slightly to $0.39. This impressive rally places TRX as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market, drawing comparisons to Ripple (XRP), which recently saw a massive 300% price increase . The surge follows increased trading volume, reaching over $14 billion, a clear sign of rising investor interest and market support. But what’s behind this sudden jump? A big part of it comes from Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, and his latest moves of calling TRX=XRP. TRX=XRP — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 3, 2024 Long TRX, Short XRP? On December 3, Tron hit a new record for revenue generation, raking in $20 million in just one day, which also helped push the price higher. Sun has been making some bold moves, including declaring that 2025 will be “the year of crypto” due to better conditions, clearer regulations, and more people adopting digital currencies. He also wants Tron to become a leader in cross-border payments, similar to how Ripple’s XRP works. Recently, Sun also announced a $30 million investment in Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance to help expand Tron’s influence in decentralized finance (DeFi). This could be huge for Tron, as it might open up new opportunities to bridge traditional finance with the world of crypto. The key factor driving TRX’s growth is the strong buying pressure, with the Bulls and Bears Indicator showing that bullish activity is outpacing selling. The Money Flow Index (MFI) supports this, highlighting that more liquidity is entering the market, which is a bullish sign for the coin’s future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Avalanche (AVAX) Price To Hit New 52-week High Amid Breakout Rally? , TRX Technical Outlook The technical indicators for TRX over the past week suggest a positive outlook, even though the token might be a bit “overbought” right now. If the volume and buying momentum continue, TRX could target the $0.45 mark, and potentially even approach $1 in a highly bullish scenario. However, if profit-taking takes over, there could be a temporary pullback to around $0.33. For example, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 87.08, which means there’s been a lot of buying, pushing the price up. While this typically signals that the token could take a break or dip soon, there’s also a chance it could continue rising. In the past, when the RSI was this high, TRX went on to reach its all-time high. If history repeats itself, TRX might break its previous record and hit new heights by the end of December. For investors, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether TRX can maintain its upward trajectory or if a correction is imminent. FAQs Why is Tron (TRX) price surging recently? Tron (TRX) surged due to record-breaking revenue, high trading volume, and bullish market sentiment driven by Justin Sun’s initiatives. Can Tron (TRX) reach $1 soon? TRX could reach $1 in a highly bullish scenario if buying momentum continues and technical resistance levels are broken.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 11:36:47

However, the amount of BTC getting withdrawn from exchanges continues to increase, and another address-related metric suggest the asset’s price still has a lot of room to grow. Almost 20K BTC Taken Off Coinbase The amount of a certain asset sitting on trading platforms is a proper hint about its short-term price movements. The bigger the supply on exchanges, the bigger the probability for a correction due to the substantial immediate sell pressure, and vice versa. The landscape around bitcoin has been quite positive in this regard for the past several months as investors are periodically taking t heir funds off exchanges and to cold storage. From a shorter-term perspective, the situation is equally promising, as detailed by CryptoQuant. The analytics company outlined two significant withdrawals from Coinbase within a 24-hour period alone, with nearly 20,000 BTC taken out of the largest US exchange. The approximate value stands at $1.87 billion. Two Significant Outflows Exceeding 8k #BTC Each from Coinbase in the Last 24h “19,487 $BTC were withdrawn, with an average cost of $96,043. The total value of these two transactions amounts to approximately $1.87 billion.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link https://t.co/4WkEJ2p3vw pic.twitter.com/ADf1qWvkV2 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 3, 2024 Average Returns Cool-Off BTC’s massive rally that took the asset from under $70,000 to just shy of $100,000 within the span of a few weeks put every investor in the money. Many decided to realize some profits after this spectacular run, which resulted in a correction for the asset. Although it has recovered from its sub-$91,000 dip from last week, bitcoin is still unable to challenge $100,000. However, Santiment provided another optimistic viewpoint that signals a change for those sitting in profit. The average returns of BTC wallets that have been active in the past month has declined to a ‘more reasonable’ 4.2%. When this metric exceeds 5%, the underlying asset typically retraces, while a percentage lower than that is “usually a strong indicator that a bounce is near.” Recall that BTC dropped by several grand yesterday toward $93,000 but has managed to recovered most losses and is close to $97,000 now. The average returns of Bitcoin wallets that have been active in the past 30 days now sits at a much more reasonable +4.2%. +5% or more on this metric is usually a strong indicator that a correction is near. -5% or less on this metric is usually a strong indicator that… pic.twitter.com/EgGHK1kTxK — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 3, 2024 The post Massive Bitcoin Withdrawals From Coinbase and This Metric Hint at Upcoming BTC Rally appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Bull Run,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-04 11:36:55

Bitcoin targets $120,000 fueling interest in a hidden altcoin, PropiChain, poised to yield 39,305% ROI by Q1 2025 Table of Contents Bitcoin bullish run: $120,000 mark in the horizon PropiChain: Hidden altcoin changing the trillion dollar real estate PropiChain presale: Limited opportunity for 39,305% ROI Bitcoin has had an impressive rally, as analysts suggest that the altcoin has entered a parabolic phase. Similarly, they point to a local top for the Bitcoin price by jumping to $120,000 by the end of Q1 2025. Bitcoin price potential is seen as institutional investors continue to show asset confidence. Whales are concentrating on holding, buying and accumulating Bitcoin for the long run, an indicator of the expected surge in the Bitcoin price. As investors pour into Bitcoin, another altcoin enters a golden era of opportunity. PropiChain, a hidden altcoin, stands out as a project that will capitalize on this surge in market momentum. Similarly, the altcoin offers early investors unmatched gains of 39,305% returns by January 2025. Bitcoin bullish run: $120,000 mark in the horizon In the last month, Bitcoin excited investors as it hit an all-time high on Nov 22. However, the bitcoin price has retreated since then, but substantial gains have been made towards the ATH. Bitcoin’s price was $96,529 at press time, jumping by 6.5% in the last week. Bitcoin continues to break the resistance level, which shows its resilience as a market leader. Similarly, the performance of Bitcoin has drawn attention to altcoins, with investors looking for new projects with strong growth potential. Among the altcoins making waves is PropiChain, which focuses on redefining the competitive crypto market. Just like Bitcoin price, PropiChain has the potential to top the charts. You might also like: ADA at $1 vs. PropiChain’s 18,000% prediction: Both compete to yield higher returns PropiChain: Hidden altcoin changing the trillion dollar real estate The Bitcoin price will break records as analysts suggest that the altcoin will hit $120. However, as the Bitcoin price rise draws interest in altcoins, investors have shown interest in an emerging altcoin, PropiChain . PropiChain’s advantage lies in its real utility, achieved using blockchain, NFTs, AI, and the Metaverse to disrupt the trillion-dollar industry. PropiChain’s outstanding feature is the property tokenization, which enables fractional property ownership. This means that investors can access high-value properties by buying shares of premium real estate with a lower financial burden. Using the power of AI, investors can use AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to offer support during asset acquisition. Similarly, they provide real-time support and guidance, such as filtering suggestions based on user’s preferences. In addition, the AI chatbots simplify complex financial paperwork and help investors understand legal contracts. PropiChain’s Metaverse integration takes real estate investments to another level. It offers virtual property tours and immersive 3D experiences. Using the Propiverse, investors can tour properties from anywhere in the world from their homes. It breaks traditional real estate accessibility barriers, as investors don’t have to physically tour a potential investment property. Again, PropiChain automates lease management using smart contracts, thus ensuring tamper-proof, transparent and binding agreements. In addition, investors will not need intermediaries that reduce paperwork and facilitate the easy execution of the agreements upon agreed terms and conditions. PropiChain’s BlockAudit certification shows the platform’s commitment to a secure and reliable user experience. Similarly, this has also contributed to the growing interest in the PropiChain altcoin. Again, PropiChain’s recent listing on CoinMarketCap boosts investor confidence in the platform. Its listing signals that it has met high standards of integrity and security. Consequently, investors are flocking to the presale to be part of this altcoin. This milestone shows that the best is yet to come. PropiChain presale: Limited opportunity for 39,305% ROI Analysts predict that the Bitcoin price is yet to see better days as it’s expected to rise to $120k. With the Bitcoin rally boosting market confidence, the hype around PropiChain builds up as the next big opportunity by offering a blockchain solution in the lucrative real estate industry. PropiChain presale price is the lowest it will ever be, with the altcoin priced at $0.004, offering early investors a golden opportunity to maximize returns. Currently, 43.86% of the tokens have been sold in the first round, raising over $615k. If you invest $1,000 in the presale stage, it will be worth $394,050 after the predicted gain of 39,305%. Upon hitting major exchanges, the altcoin’s growth potential could rise even higher, leaving new investors to chase higher prices. Take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and join the PropiChain presale today. To learn more about PropiChain, visit the website and join the community .

All the user has to do is establish the project’s name, ticker and basic settings. PancakeSwap SpringBoard also claimed that it does not charge a launch fee for projects on the platform. “Whether you’re building a meme coin, a community-driven project, or a DeFi project, SpringBoard simplifies the process with just a few clicks, from token creation to liquidity setup,” the protocol wrote. However, the protocol will still incur a 1% trading fee, with a minimum fee of 0.001 BNB once the token is succesfully on the market. There is also a seeding fee which amounts to 2% of the token’s liquidity before migrating to PancakeSwap. The blogpost stipulates that 50% of the seeding fee goes to the token creator, while the other 50% goes to PancakeSwap SpringBoard. The protocol also provides users with the option of choosing from multiple tokens for trading pairs and liquidity pools, including Binance Coin, USDT ( USDT ) and PancakeSwap’s token. Once a token’s liquidity reaches 100% of the bonding curve on SpringBoard which equates to 24 BNB, all its minted tokens will be automatically paired on PancakeSwap DEX to establish liquidity. Tokens that meet specific criteria will have their liquidity pools boosted with CAKE based on organic trading volume through what the protocol calls the SpringBoard Farm Program. The Farm Program is meant to drive liquidity, community engagement, and exposure to a user’s project on the SpringBoard ecosystem.

While the exact sale price has not been disclosed, discussions suggest it could exceed the current market value of shares traded on the over-the-counter market, with an expected return of around 100 times or more.

Santiment believes that Bitcoin will continue to rise since the gains are not enough. Stablecoin exchange inflows also skyrocketed, suggesting increased capital flow. Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward trajectory, eyeing the $100,000 price level as traders maintain cautious optimism. The cryptocurrency has remained within the $95,000 to $97,000 range, reflecting a phase of consolidation. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Blockchain analysis platform Santiment highlighted a +4.2% average return on active Bitcoin wallets over the past 30 days. A rise above +5% could trigger a potential price correction, while a dip to -5% or lower may signal strong recovery momentum. Santiment’s analysis noted that many traders incurred losses after buying Bitcoin at peak prices in November.

The exploit, found in versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7, involved malicious code designed to steal private keys. This flaw severely threatened applications and developers relying on the compromised versions, potentially exposing user funds to theft. Phantom’s security team confirmed in a statement on X that the wallet provider has never used these versions in its infrastructure, ensuring its users remain safe. Phantom is not impacted by this vulnerability. Our Security Team confirms that we have never used the exploited versions of @solana/web3.js https://t.co/9wHZ4cnwa1 — Phantom (@phantom) December 3, 2024 The vulnerability has sent ripples through the Solana developer community. Solana developer Trent Sol, who first sounded the alarm, described the compromised versions as a “secret stealer” capable of leaking private keys through seemingly legitimate CloudFlare headers. anyone using @solana/web3.js, versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7 are compromised with a secret stealer leaking private keys. if you or your product are using these versions, upgrade to 1.95.8 (1.95.5 is unaffected) if you run a service that can blacklist addresses, do your thing with… — trent.sol (@trentdotsol) December 3, 2024 He urged developers and projects to immediately upgrade to version 1.95.8 or roll back to unaffected version 1.95.5. Despite these vulnerabilities, major projects such as Drift , Solflare , and Phantom confirmed their immunity, either due to avoiding the impacted versions or deploying additional security layers. Drift is not affected by this vulnerability. The Drift codebase does not have dependency on the two compromised ""@solana/web3.js"" releases. https://t.co/0EbicREB7W — Drift (@DriftProtocol) December 3, 2024 Solflare is not impacted by the recent issue with @solana/web3.js. We enforce version locking and conduct rigorous code reviews, both manual and automated, to protect against supply-chain attacks. Your keys remain safe and secure with Solflare. https://t.co/0jIdYzV1Kn — Solflare – The Solana Wallet (@solflare_wallet) December 3, 2024 The Bug in Solana Web3.js Library: Who Is Affected? According to a Socket.dev post , a supply chain attack compromised the Solana/web3.js library, a core component for developers building on Solana. This type of attack, targeting dependencies widely used by developers, inserted a backdoor function named addToQueue into versions 1.95.6 and 1.95.7. The malicious function enabled the exfiltration of private keys by disguising its activity as legitimate CloudFlare header data. Once captured, these keys were transmitted to a hardcoded Solana wallet address identified as FnvLGtucz4E1ppJHRTev6Qv4X7g8Pw6WPStHCcbAKbfx. Cybersecurity researchers, including Christophe Tafani-Dereeper from Datadog, analyzed the malicious versions and highlighted the sophisticated nature of the exploit. They discovered that the domain used for the operation (sol-rpc[.]xyz) had been registered on November 22, just days before the attack became public. The domain was hosted behind CloudFlare, with the command-and-control (C2) server now offline. This timeline points to a carefully planned attack, likely due to a phishing or social engineering campaign targeting the library’s maintainers. The npm package manager, which hosts Solana/web3.js, swiftly removed the compromised versions. Developers using the affected versions were advised to update version 1.95.8 immediately or audit their projects for suspicious dependencies. Broader Implications for Solana and Web3 Security The Solana ecosystem has responded rapidly to mitigate the fallout. In addition to Phantom, major projects like Backpack have assured their users that the exploit does not affect them. No @Backpack wallets were affected by this. Stay safe. https://t.co/xkpFQZJTjn — Armani Ferrante (@armaniferrante) December 4, 2024 Supply chain attacks like this have become increasingly common as malicious actors target the tools and libraries developers rely on. Earlier this year, a similar attack involved a malicious Python package named “Solana-py,” which masqueraded as a legitimate API to steal wallet keys. Similarly, in October this year, the Checkmarx threat research team uncovered a new malware campaign on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository, targeting cryptocurrency users through a malicious package named “CryptoAITools.” The malware masquerades itself as a legitimate cryptocurrency trading tool and uses a deceptive graphical user interface to distract victims while executing malicious activities on Windows and macOS systems. Once installed, the malware launches a sophisticated multi-stage infection process, downloading additional components from a fake website and stealing sensitive data such as wallet recovery phrases, saved passwords, browsing history, and even Apple Notes on macOS. Beyond the initial infection through PyPI, the campaign extends to other platforms, employing multiple social engineering tactics to lure victims.

The journey of meme coins began with the creation of Dogecoin (DOGE) in 2013. The continuous growth and popularity of Dogecoin, backed by its strong community and widespread adoption, have cleared the roads for new entrants aiming to replicate its success. One such innovative project is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a fresh utility meme coin that combines the meme coin ecosystem with functionality, gaming, and much more. Dogecoin News: The Original Meme Coin Pioneer Dogecoin is credited with kickstarting the meme coin craze. Originally created as a playful alternative to Bitcoin, Dogecoin quickly gained a large community, especially through its strong social media presence and widespread attention. Its success was accelerated further by endorsements from celebrities like Elon Musk and billionaire Mark Cuban. The Dogecoin price has grown remarkably since its creation, proving that a coin that began as a joke can make waves in the global financial industry. However, Dogecoin has its limitations. Since it has an unlimited supply, scarcity is absent, which compromises its long-term value proposition. Discussions about its future performance are ongoing, with most Dogecoin price predictions pointing to moderate increases as adoption grows on payment platforms. The increasing number of stores accepting Dogecoin as a payment method is a positive sign, but questions remain about its sustainability. Nevertheless, Dogecoin continues to inspire other meme coins seeking to replicate its success. For crypto enthusiasts exploring newer options with added features, Yeti Ouro offers a unique alternative for investors. Yeti Ouro: A Meme Coin With Real Utility Borrowing from its big brother, Dogecoin, Yeti Ouro is demonstrating that a meme coin can be more than fun by integrating utility. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, this hot new utility meme coin features Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming through its flagship game, Yeti Go. Unlike Dogecoin, Yeti Ouro has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens, making it a scarce asset and an attractive option for long-term investors. While DOGE is designed for micropayments and everyday use, YETIO is designed for long-term value. Yeti Ouro’s P2E racing game, Yeti Go, offers high-risk, adrenaline-pumping gameplay for crypto enthusiasts and gamers. Built using the Unreal Engine, the game delivers a high-quality, fun experience that allows players to earn YETIO tokens during competitive player-versus-player races. Features like destructible PvP mechanics, power-ups, and environmental challenges set Yeti Go apart from other crypto-based games. Its unique offers and designs show that it is designed by gamers for gamers. The development team has recently shared a viral behind-the-scenes video showing the ongoing work. Beyond gaming, Yeti Ouro’s smart tokenomics ensure sustainable growth while rewarding its community. Key features include allocating 15% of tokens to Play-to-Earn rewards and a token-burning mechanism to maintain scarcity, solidifying Yeti Ouro as a top rival for the next 100x meme coin.

Expanding to TON could help GraFun capture newer audiences, tap into higher liquidity for meme issuances and increase the platform’s visibility among crypto traders. “Creating and trading memecoins directly inside Telegram, one of the most popular messaging apps in the world, is almost here,” a GraFun developer told CoinDesk over Telegram message. “After launching 14k memecoins and generating more than $450M in trading volume on BNB Chain, GraFun is now making memecoin creation simple and fast inside Telegram.” TON holds over $350 million worth of user assets across various platforms based on the blockchain, data shows . A source close to the team shared plans for a GraFun token in the future based on user activity in a message to CoinDesk, although GraFun developers neither confirmed nor denied plans. GraFun uniquely offers a “Fair Curve” model that developers say minimizes rug-pull risks, reduces price manipulation and ensures fairer token issuances that result in fewer users losing money. Memecoin behemoth Floki owns over 40% of GraFun, and other backers include DWF Labs. The most popular examples of memecoin launchpads that use a “Fair Curve” model are Pump on Solana - which pioneered such a model - and Tron’s Sun Pump.",Markets|Telegram|memecoins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|BNB|TON,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-04 12:00:00

Chatter is heating up about a potential “carry trade” that uses DeFi protocol Ethena's yield-bearing staked USDe (sUSDe) to borrow stablecoins like USDC and USDT from the lending giant Aave. Those stablecoins are then flipped back for USDe, yielding a sweet return from the juicy spread between sUSDe's near 30% annualized yield and AAVE's variable borrowing rates, currently less than 20%. The return is way better than ether's staking yield of under 4% and the U.S. 10-year Treasury's 4.24%. If the trade becomes popular, the arbitrage window could eventually close, with borrowing rates potentially matching the yield on sUSDe, according to the pseudonymous observer Clouted . Keep an eye on this one. As for market leader bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency has bounced back to nearly $97,000 as of writing — a level we've seen several times since mid-November — after testing dip demand around $93,500 on Tuesday. Prices on Korean exchanges are back in sync with their global counterparts after Tuesday's flash crash caused by the announcement of martial law. Traders are eagerly awaiting Fed Chairman Powell's speech later today, plus Friday's nonfarms payroll report, hoping for a boost in bitcoin price volatility. With BTC's Coinbase premium returning, the case for renewed bullishness looks promising unless Powell throws cold water on December rate-cut expectations. Meantime, beware of engagement farming on social media. Some X accounts are buzzing about record short positions in CME's ether futures, claiming it's suppressing ether prices. That might not be so. Most of those shorts could be a part of the popular price-neutral cash-and-carry arbitrage strategy that includes long positions in the spot market or spot ETFs. It's no coincidence that Farside Investors data shows there's been a net inflow of $714 million into U.S.-listed ether ETFs in the past seven trading days. Looking at the broader market, Aptos has hit a milestone with its DeFi total value locked surpassing $1 billion, a staggering 19-fold growth year-on-year. The number of transactions and the average cost to transact on the Avalanche C-Chain are at their highest since April and August, just as the Avalanche9000 upgrade approaches, according to data source Artemis. Tron's TRX token and the on-chain perpetual options protocol GammaSwap's GS token have reached record highs, while a whale sold a whopping 240 billion PEPE, according to Lookonchain data. Decentralized exchange PancakeSwap has launched ""PancakeSwap Springboard"" to create and list tokens, taking the page out of Pumpfun's book. Expect more speculative froth. In traditional markets, keep your eye on risk-off signals. The yen remains upbeat and Wall Street executives are aggressively reducing their stocks, driving the ratio of insider sellers to buyers to nearly 6x, according to the Kobeissi Letter.

Several tokens popularized back during what was arguably the first altcoin bull market are following XRP's 400% price rally over the past 30 days with rallies of their own for no immediately apparent reason. Stellar (XLM), bitcoin cash, eos (EOS), tron (TRX) and Hedera (HBAR) have gained at least 50% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows, in a move that has outperformed bitcoin and nearly every ""new"" token that is being promoted or hyped on Crypto Twitter. The term ""dino coins"" reflects a narrative shift where older cryptocurrencies are no longer seen as outdated but as resilient, seasoned projects. This shift can be attributed to their survival through multiple market cycles, which gives them a certain credibility among newer, less-proven offerings. Derivatives Positioning The bitcoin and ether annualized three-month futures basis on offshore exchanges remain flat at around 15%. On the CME, ETH boasts a slightly higher basis at 17%, with BTC at 14%, offering attractive returns to cash and carry traders. Positioning in ETH remains elevated, with global futures and perpetual open interest at a record high of 338,680. The BTC market has cooled, with open interest pulling back to 609,470, down 8% from the peak of 663,710 seen last month. On decentralized options protocol Derive, a trader collected $1.66 million in premiums by selling bitcoin March expiry calls at strikes in the $105,000 to $130,000 range.

According to the press release shared with Cryptonews , the new platform enables projects, developers, and creators to create and launch their tokens on the BNB Chain PancakeSwap . Notably, the process is fast and requires no coding, the team highlights. Projects can configure and deploy their tokens within minutes. They don’t need to have any technical skills or coding to set up token details such as name, ticker, and basic settings. 2/5 Create a Token in Minutes: Choose your token’s name, ticker, and basic settings—SpringBoard handles the rest. Launch your project’s token and start trading in just a few clicks! — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) December 4, 2024 Via a seamless process, PancakeSwap Springboard integrates token deployment, liquidity pairing, and PancakeSwap DEX migration. Additionally, creators can choose from multiple tokens for the project’s token trading pairs and liquidity pools. These include BNB , USDT , and CAKE . Zero Launch Fees and Farm Program On PancakeSwap’s New SpringBoard The DEX noted that there are no launch fees on the novel platform. Moreover, they enabled a fair launch mechanism and transparent distribution without pre-sales or seed rounds. Once a token is launched, there is a 1% fee for trading it via the bonding curve on PancakeSwap SpringBoard. The minimum fee is 0.001 BNB. The seeding fee is 2% of the liquidity before migrating to PancakeSwap DEX. When a token’s liquidity reaches 100% of the bonding curve on the new platform, “100% of the minted tokens will be automatically paired on PancakeSwap DEX to establish liquidity and seamless trading,” the announcement said. 5/5 Boost Liquidity with CAKE: The SpringBoard Farm Program offers CAKE for selected liquidity pools, helping drive community engagement with the power of CAKE. https://t.co/0L2wsZoZGK pic.twitter.com/47D3dO9SKu — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) December 4, 2024 Meanwhile, PancakeSwap may choose eligible projects to participate in the Farm Program .

In today’s urban landscape, cities are increasingly under pressure to become smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable. As municipalities and private developers look for innovative ways to optimize urban management, blockchain technology is stepping up as a pivotal tool. While traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies, blockchain’s potential goes far beyond finance, offering transformative possibilities in how cities are managed and operated. You might also like: Streamlining sustainability with decentralized data | Opinion According to Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, the global smart city market is expected to reach $1.29 trillion by 2025. Leading cities like Singapore and Dubai have already begun leveraging blockchain to enhance services like mobility, energy management, and data transparency. These advancements are not just futuristic ambitions but practical solutions aimed at optimizing urban efficiency and resource allocation. Smart contracts: Automating urban operations One of the most impactful applications of blockchain in urban development lies in smart contracts. These self-executing agreements, where terms are directly encoded into software, can automate complex urban processes such as procurement, maintenance, and even energy distribution. For example, using smart contracts to manage solar power distribution between households can optimize energy usage while cutting down costs. Dubai’s investment of $300 million in blockchain initiatives exemplifies how smart contracts can streamline city operations. The city aims to integrate blockchain across all government services, potentially reducing administrative overhead and accelerating project timelines, with an estimated savings of up to 20% in operational costs by 2030. Ensuring transparency and data integrity A significant challenge in urban development is ensuring data accuracy and transparency. Traditional systems often involve multiple layers of intermediaries, leading to delays, data silos, and potential inaccuracies. Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing a decentralized ledger where all data entries are verified, timestamped, and immutable. For instance, city administrations can use blockchain to enhance procurement processes. Tracking transactions—from project bids to contract awards—on a transparent ledger reduces the risk of fraud while improving accountability. Additionally, blockchain’s cryptographic security can protect sensitive data like property records and environmental metrics, which is crucial as cities move toward interconnected smart infrastructure. Empowering citizen engagement Beyond optimizing city management, blockchain can also enhance citizen engagement. By implementing blockchain-based platforms, cities can facilitate secure and anonymous voting on public consultations, referendums, or community projects. This fosters greater transparency and encourages civic participation. In Chicago, for example, blockchain is being explored for waste management optimization. By using this technology to track waste collection schedules, the city ensures efficient allocation of resources. Residents can access real-time updates, leading to improved accountability and better services. Advancing sustainable development with real-time data As cities strive to meet ambitious sustainability goals, having access to real-time, accurate data is critical. By integrating blockchain with IoT sensors, city planners can gain actionable insights into key areas such as air quality, energy consumption, and water usage. This data can inform policies that drive sustainability and efficiency. In the GCC, where sustainability is a top priority, the green building market is projected to surpass $66 billion by 2029. Blockchain’s ability to securely capture and share vast amounts of data can help cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi meet their net-zero targets. For example, automating energy distribution through smart contracts can help reduce waste and emissions, contributing to more sustainable urban environments. Navigating the future of blockchain in urban development While the benefits of blockchain in urban development are becoming clearer, it’s essential to recognize that the technology isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Successful implementation requires strategic planning, ensuring that blockchain systems are compatible with existing urban infrastructure and regulations. Educating stakeholders about the advantages of blockchain will also be crucial in driving adoption. However, the momentum for blockchain adoption in urban management is already strong. Platforms like DownTown—which is already being utilized in cities like London and Dallas—are creating scalable frameworks that municipalities can leverage to enhance urban services. As blockchain technology continues to mature, its potential to optimize urban management will only grow, making cities more adaptive, efficient, and better interconnected. The future of urban development lies in leveraging the power of blockchain and smart contracts to build cities that are not only smarter but also more sustainable and efficient. By automating operations, ensuring data integrity, and enhancing citizen engagement, blockchain can unlock new possibilities for better urban management. For cities worldwide, the message is clear: embracing blockchain isn’t just about keeping up with technological trends but about preparing urban spaces for the challenges of tomorrow.

The jump in BNB’s value comes amid broader market volatility, with cryptocurrencies posting mixed performances. Analysts suggest that the token’s growth can be attributed to Binance’s expanding ecosystem, strategic developments, or other market dynamics that favor exchange tokens. BNB’s rise underscores the evolving competitive landscape of the cryptocurrency market, where tokens tied to major platforms continue to play important roles. Investors and traders will be closely watching how this momentum develops in the coming days.

Table of Contents King of alts: Ethereum shows who’s boss Pepe Pump Pad lets anyone become a “dev” without coding Buy and track PEPU investments with Best Wallet Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is a viral presale cryptocurrency building the first Ethereum layer 2 blockchain dedicated solely to meme coins. Its fundraising campaign has enjoyed unprecedented success, raising over $65 million so far. Pepe Unchained promises 100x faster speeds and far cheaper fees than Ethereum, making it an optimal environment for trading meme coins. The project is seeing a considerable uptick in demand because the presale will end in ten days, after which PEPU will list on tier-1 exchanges. And the timing could not be better. After months of underperformance, the Ethereum ecosystem has finally started to gather pace and regain market share from Bitcoin and Solana. Pepe Unchained hopes to grab a big chunk of this new Ethereum-focused attention by posing as the ecosystem’s home for meme coins. POV: Pepe is visualizing breaking his chains and getting swole doing it! It's only a matter of time now.. 🐸⛓🧠 pic.twitter.com/KZSq5KDdn1 — Pepe Unchained (@pepe_unchained) November 24, 2024 King of alts: Ethereum shows who’s boss Ethereum – and by association, its ecosystem tokens – are decisively outperforming Solana and Bitcoin counterparts this week. On Layer 1 coins, ETH is in the lead, pumping 6.5%. BTC is up 1% in that window, while SOL is down 4.6%. It doesn’t end there. Ethereum projects are starting to flex their muscles again. Aave is up 73% this month and 3x from its late-summer lows. Ethereum Name Service is up 152% this month, and Ondo is up 159%. Ethereum-based meme coins have also started outperforming. Solana’s market-leading meme coins, Bonk and Dogwifhat, are down 1.7% and 2.4% this week, while Ethereum’s Shiba Inu and Pepe are up 17.9% and 6.9%. As mentioned, this presents the perfect environment for Pepe Unchained to launch. Pepe Unchained is not just another Ethereum meme coin. It will be the infrastructure on which the next generation of Ethereum-based “joke” tokens launch. The presale offers investors an opportunity to capitalize on this from the start. It might be the closest thing to buying Ethereum during its 2014 ICO. Pepe Pump Pad lets anyone become a “dev” without coding One of Pepe Unchained’s most prized features is Pepe Pump Pad, a Pepe Chain version of Pump.fun. Pepe Pump Pad allows anyone to launch a meme coin in two clicks and without coding. People launch thousands of tokens every day on Pump.fun, some of which spawn into the industry’s hottest projects, like Peanut the Squirrel and Moo Deng. Now the Ethereum ecosystem will have its own version in Pepe Pump Pad, enabled by Pepe Unchained’s improved transactional capabilities. With that, Pepe Unchained will be a vibrant ecosystem from the day it launches. It will also include features such as a block explorer, a dedicated Ethereum bridge, a decentralized exchange, and staking. So, it’s not surprising that analysts expect big returns once PEPU lists on exchanges. For instance, Jacob Bury told viewers of the 99Bitcoins YouTube channel that it could 100x. Buy and track PEPU investments with Best Wallet Pepe Unchained was recently featured on the trending Web3 wallet Best Wallet as its “token of the week.” Investors can buy PEPU at presale using the Best Wallet app or by connecting a different wallet to the Pepe Unchained presale website. Those who buy via Best Wallet can also track their tokens and receive real-time updates on the platform’s dashboard. 🐸 Token of the Week: $PEPU 🐸 Currently raised: $25,518,050.37 $PEPU is the future of meme coins, powering the @pepe_unchained Layer 2 blockchain. Fast, secure, and low fees—this is Pepe’s kingdom! Find $PEPU in the Upcoming Tokens tab on Best Wallet! 🔥 Buy your presale… pic.twitter.com/il31SaaZnu — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) November 8, 2024 It’s worth noting that another project that appeared as Best Wallet’s “token of the week,” Catslap, soared over 50x after launching in November and also received a major investment from Jump Trading, a leading US-based money manager. Whether we’ll see the same story for Pepe Unchained remains to be seen. But there’s one thing for sure – the project is creating something we’ve never seen before. It’s certainly one to watch closely. With just ten days left until the ICO ends, prospective buyers should act quickly to not miss out.

The cryptocurrency is marginally up over the past 24 hours and is trading around the $96,500 mark, consolidating between $94,000 and $98,000. BTC’s trading volume is at $70 billion, but market dominance registered a marginal decline. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a marginal increase as it held above $3,600 after bouncing back from a low of $3,504. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) registered a sharp increase, rising almost 5% to$238 as it looks to overcome recent bearish sentiment. Several cryptocurrencies made substantial gains over the past 24 hours including Dogecoin (DOGE) , Tron (TRX) , Toncoin (TON), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) . The crypto market cap continued to grow, registering an increase of 1.50% and moving to $3.54 trillion. South Korea’s Crisis Sparks $34B In Local Crypto Trades South Korean crypto exchanges registered over $34 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours as the country’s president declared martial law, only to be forced to lift it by an overwhelming vote in parliament. The martial law lasted six hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, South Korean exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopa,x recorded a combined crypto trading volume of $34.2 billion in 24 hours, with Upbit processing $27 billion worth of crypto transactions alone. The 24-hour trading volume also increased to record the highest single-day total for the year. The jump in crypto trading occurred after the country’s president, Yoon Suk-yoel, declared martial law late on Tuesday after stating he wanted to protect the country from threats to democracy posed by “anti-state” forces, primarily targeting the country’s primary left-wing opposition. As a result, South Korean crypto traders rushed to sell their crypto on local exchanges. The rush to sell caused BTC’s price on Upbit to drop to $62,182. Almost all major South Korean exchanges saw considerable price drops and experienced outages thanks to a spike in activity. Coinbase Integrates Apple Pay Coinbase has announced the integration of Apple Pay to facilitate seamless fiat-to-crypto transactions. The integration will make purchasing crypto easy and more accessible to millions of users by leveraging the ease and security of Apple Pay’s ecosystem. Coinbase announced the integration in a statement, stating, “Coinbase Onramp takes the hassle out of fiat-to-crypto conversions with lightweight KYC for eligible purchases, free USDC on and offramping, and access to the most popular payment methods.” Users can log in and purchase using Apple Pay on apps developed with Coinbase Onramp services. The integration eliminates manual card entries for external payment processors, a step usually required when funding Coinbase accounts. It also aligns with efforts to streamline user experiences while maintaining security. Onramp solutions could facilitate greater adoption by making it easy to conduct crypto transactions through Apple Pay, giving users a sense of security when interacting with blockchain, crypto, and Web3 solutions. MicroStrategy Can Ignore Bitcoin (BTC) Crash To $20,000 Research published by capital advisor Jeff Walton has stated that Bitcoin (BTC) could drop as low as $20,000 without significantly impacting MicroStrategy’s treasury, indicating the firm could survive an 80% drop in BTC’s value. MicroStrategy’s BTC exposure is higher than ever after the firm added more of the asset to its treasury. BTC has appreciated almost 40% in November, and Walton believes even a protracted correction would not have a significant impact on MicroStrategy, with the price needing to fall significantly lower. “The price of Bitcoin would need to fall to $18,826 in order for $MSTR’s assets to be worth less than their liabilities.” Adding BTC to company balance sheets has drawn considerable criticism since the asset has seen significant corrections previously. BTC crashed from $69,000 to as low as $15,600 between November 2021 and November 2022. However, Walton believes the argument against Bitcoin adoption carries very little weight. “As the price of Bitcoin rises, the financial leverage falls fast. For the ‘This will not end well’ / ‘Ponzi’ ‘pyramid scheme’ bears, run the math. The $MSTR balance sheet is arguably underutilized from a ‘leverage’ perspective.” Charles Edwards, the founder of quantitative Bitcoin and digital asset fund Capriole Investments, is equally bullish. Edwards stated in a post on X that MicroStrategy was just one player in the new institutional Bitcoin investment arena, arguing the market is not bullish enough on the outcome. “MSTR raising $B/week to deploy into Bitcoin. MARA currently boosting its holdings by 30% with a $1B raise. Absolutely insane institutional demand. 13.5% of all Bitcoin is now held by institutions and ETFs and it's going parabolic. It's wild how numb we all are to this now that it's the new normal. But this is the institutional adoption we were all dreaming about.” Is A New Bitcoin Soft Fork Brewing? Cobra, the owner and maintainer of the bitcoin.org domain, has issued an alert about the development of a user-activated soft fork for Bitcoin that unnamed developers outside the Bitcoin Core project could propose next year. “Some bitcoiners are going to attempt to soft fork in CTV through a UASF sometime in 2025. Not enough people are paying attention to this.” CTV, short for Check Template Verify, is a series of improvements that introduce the concept of covenants to Bitcoin. Covenants establish spending conditions for BTC stored in a determined wallet. CTV allows for developments that can enhance the security of Bitcoin transactions. One of these developments is vaults, cold storage addresses with a spending condition that forces users to send transactions to a single, predetermined wallet asset. Users can also cancel these transactions before a predetermined time, allowing them to cancel potentially malicious transactions. However, the biggest drawback of the update is linked to fungibility, as the BTC would be siloed in these addresses and be deemed less valuable. The update could also expose the codebase to attackers looking to take advantage of the update. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell to a low of $93,645 on Tuesday as it remained pinned under $100,000. The drop came after the market was rattled by news that the US government had moved a significant chunk of seized BTC to Coinbase. The cryptocurrency trades between $94,000 and $98,000 after failing to go above the $100,000 mark despite reaching an all-time high of $99,655. The asset fell marginally after the US government moved almost 20,000 BTC valued at $1.9 billion to Coinbase, sparking speculation about the motive. Transferring assets to an exchange typically happens before a sale. However, the move by the government may not necessarily herald a sale given Coinbase has a contract with the Justice Department’s US Marshals Service to provide custody services. The price chart shows BTC continuing to trade sideways as buyers struggle to build momentum for a move past $100,000. The cryptocurrency recorded substantial price action last week but has remained relatively muted this week, trading between $94,000 and $98,000. BTC fell back after setting a new all-time high of $99,655 and recorded a substantial drop at the beginning of last week when it dropped over 5% to $92,846. The price continued to decline on Tuesday, falling to a low of $90,708 before settling at $91,913. BTC made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rebounding to register an increase of 4.32% and settle at $95,883. However, buyers lost momentum on Thursday as BTC registered a marginal decline to settle at $95,690. The price recovered on Friday, registering an increase of almost 2% to climb above $97,000 and settle at $97,374. Source: TradingView BTC was back in the red on Saturday, starting the weekend with a drop of 1.14% to settle at $96,263 before recovering on Sunday to settle at $97,026 after an increase of 0.79%. The current week began with BTC in the red, facing considerable selling pressure and volatility. The price ultimately registered a drop of 1.25% and settled at $95,812. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as sellers dragged BTC to a low of $93,665. However, it recovered from this level to climb above $95,000 and settle at $95,751. The current session sees buyers back in control with BTC up almost 1% and trading around $96,650. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong recovery during the current session as buyers attempt to build momentum and push towards $4,000.

Despite the prevailing bearish sentiment, ETH recovered strongly on Wednesday, rising nearly 10% to go above $3,500 and settle at $3,657. Sellers were back in control on Thursday as ETH fell by 2.09% to $3,580 before registering a marginal recovery on Friday and moving to $3,594. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified over the weekend as ETH registered an increase of over 3% to go above $3,700 and settle at $3,705.

However, with support building at this level, it recovered to climb above $3,600 and settle at $3,618.. ETH has made a strong recovery during the current session, with the price up almost 3% and trading at $3,719. If buyers can build momentum and keep ETH above $3,700, we could see a move to $4,000. However, if sellers retake control, ETH could drop to $3,500 or lower. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) had been facing considerable selling pressure since the previous weekend when it fell in the red after reaching a high of $264. With sellers in control, SOL registered a substantial drop at the beginning of the previous week, dropping 7.37% to $234.

SOL recovered on Tuesday despite falling to a low of $215, registering an increase of almost 4% to settle at $234. Buyers have retained control during the current session, with the price up nearly 1% and trading at $236. Buyers will look to build momentum and push above the 20-day SMA. A break above the moving average could see SOL retest the resistance at $260. Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis Toncoin (TON) has been trading positively since last Tuesday, going above key resistance levels despite significant volatility and selling pressure. TON faced significant volatility last Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to exert influence. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $6.14. TON went past the 200-day SMA on Wednesday after rising almost 4% and settling at $6.39. Volatility returned on Thursday as TON fell to an intraday low of $6.07 and reached an intraday high of $6.63 before settling at $6.42 after a marginal increase. Sellers attempted to drag TON below $6 on Friday as the price dropped to a low of $6.25. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $6.47.

Source: TradingView The weekend saw a spurt in volatility as buyers attempted to go above the resistance, and sellers tried to lower the price. APT ultimately registered a marginal increase to $13.38 but could not go above the resistance level. Volatility persisted on Sunday as APT inched above the resistance with a marginal increase and settled at $13.39. Sellers attempted to take control on Monday, driving APT to a low of $12.31.

This new platform is much-touted to be similar to Solana’s token launch platform Pumpfun. PancakeSwap Launches SpringBoard Aiding Projects On BNB Chain In an official announcement by PancakeSwap on December 4, the DeFi entity revealed that it is introducing an all-in-one platform to create and launch tokens on BNB Chain. This platform is called SpringBoard. Notably, the newly launched portal is set to cause a stir in the market, offering revolutionary features. First off, no coding is required to create tokens on PancakSwap’s new portal. “Once you’ve configured your project’s name, ticker, and basic settings, your token will be live and ready for trading in minutes,” the announcement stated. Further, the new portal also offers users low-cost and fair launch opportunities. This includes zero launch fee, transparent trading fees, and minimal seeding fee required for a token launch. Also, token launchers can choose multiple token pairings, ranging from BNB, USDT, and CAKE on this new portal. Additionally, another feature of the portal, the Farm Program, aims to offer projects increased liquidity with CAKE. PancakeSwap’s announcement also offered a step-by-step guide for those looking to utilize the new platform for token launches. Further, in light of the new platform’s launch, CAKE price soared roughly 30% to $4.12. On the other hand, Solana’s Pumpfun has also garnered noteworthy attention amid this bull cycle. Solana’s Pumpfun Gains Traction CoinGape reported that Pumpfun achieved record-breaking monthly revenue in November, marking a 207% increase from October. This monumental stride comes against the backdrop of initial token launches such as WIF and POPCAT, followed by CHILLGUY, PNUT, MOODENG, and many others. Simultaneously, the Solana-based token launch platform has also recently encountered significant backlash over its live-streaming feature. In the wake of this backlash, Pumpfun also suspended the live-streaming service the previous month. These chronicles have garnered significant attention to the Solana token launch platform. Meanwhile, PancakeSwap’s SpringBoard further remains poised to rival Pumpfun.

Amid this race, CoinEx has emerged as a standout, leveraging its unique strategies, global presence, and ecosystem development. From its technical excellence under founder Haipo Yang to the growing prominence of its native token CET, the exchange positioned itself as a “dark horse” capable of redefining the industry’s future . CoinEx’s Strategic Edge in a Competitive Market Founded in December 2017 by Haipo Yang, CoinEx operates in over 200 countries with a user base of 10 million and growing. The exchange has strategically focused on building trust and accessibility, offering services in 18 languages and ensuring compliance in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia and the Middle East. The platform’s features include spot trading, futures trading, margin trading, and automated market maker (AMM) services, catering to diverse investment needs. Supporting over 1,000 trading pairs, CoinEx excels in asset diversity. For instance, $DOG in the Runes ecosystem and BRC-20 tokens such as $ORDI, $SATS, and $RATS were first listed by CoinEx, showcasing the platform’s sharp ability to capture market trends. These tokens were later listed by major exchanges, further validating CoinEx’s foresight in identifying emerging opportunities. Additionally, its innovative Pre-Token Trading feature allows users to trade tokens before their official launch, offering a significant advantage in seizing early market opportunities. At its core, the exchange’s success is driven by technological excellence. Its self-developed matching engine ensures secure and stable transactions during high-volume periods, a critical requirement in the crypto bull market. In addition, CoinEx was among the first exchanges to adopt the “ Merkle Tree” proof of reserves , providing transparency and building user trust. Localization is another key strength. One of the best no-KYC crypto exchanges has tailored its services to different regions, emphasizing multilingual support and compliance to establish a global presence. This strategy allows it to attract users in underserved markets while maintaining stability and reliability. CoinEx’s Ecosystem and Social Responsibility CoinEx’s integration with the ViaBTC Group has enabled it to build a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem, encompassing services like the CoinEx Smart Chain (CSC) for decentralized applications and the CoinEx Wallet for secure multi-chain asset management. These offerings go beyond trading, providing users with seamless access to blockchain solutions that support diverse digital asset needs, making it a standout player in the industry. The platform shows its commitment to social responsibility through initiatives by its Charity Foundation. These initiatives support education, poverty alleviation, and disaster relief worldwide. Additionally the “Bridge to Hope” initiative helps bridge the digital divide and promote sustainable development. This focus highlights CoinEx’s long-term dedication to driving positive change within the global blockchain industry. At the core of the “Bridge to Hope” initiative is the “ Starlink Program, ” which uses SpaceX’s satellite internet service to connect underserved and isolated communities. By enabling access to online education, business resources, and social platforms, this program empowers communities to thrive in the global information age. CoinEx’s innovative approach to blending blockchain technology with community support demonstrates its vision for inclusive growth and sustainable empowerment. CET Token: Driving Growth and User Engagement CET, CoinEx’s native token, plays a vital role in the platform’s ecosystem. It offers trading fee discounts, VIP benefits, and exclusive access to platform activities. These features incentivize user engagement and foster loyalty. CET is also seen as a valuable long-term investment asset for both traders and investors. In the 2024 crypto bull market, CET’s growth highlights its increasing prominence. Currently priced at $0.091, with a 24-hour low of $0.09 and a high of $0.092, CET has surged by 33% over the past month. This growth is driven by rising adoption. CoinEx has implemented a transparent and efficient economic model by allocating 20% of its daily platform fee revenue toward CET buybacks. These repurchased tokens are burned at the end of each month, a practice that has been maintained for six consecutive years. This approach has successfully reduced CET’s circulating supply by 71%, reflecting CoinEx’s dedication to creating value for holders and fostering long-term ecosystem development. The controlled scarcity and ecosystem-driven demand ensure a balanced market dynamic, offering growth potential while minimizing the impact of market fluctuations. This remarkable growth is also underpinned by its deep integration into a thriving ecosystem, where CET enhances user engagement through features like financial tools, AMM fee rebates, and the newly introduced Mining function. The upcoming Dock feature will further broaden CET’s application by supporting project initiatives. Additionally, CET extends its utility beyond the trading platform by powering the CoinEx Smart Chain (CSC), providing developers with a low-cost and efficient environment for building decentralized applications. These advancements highlight CET’s vital role in driving the CoinEx ecosystem forward and solidifying its position in the market. CET Token Skyrocketed Over 200% This Crypto Bull Market CoinEx’s global expansion and ecosystem enhancements contribute to upside momentum. Additionally, the token’s integration into services like CoinEx Smart Chain (CSC) and staking programs further boosts its utility. This solidifies its role in driving retention and supporting revenue growth. CET trading activity shows its broad appeal, with the token price up over 200% year-to-date. According to CoinGlass , the BTC/USDT trading pair leads in trading volume. ETH and XRP pairs follow closely behind. This high trading activity demonstrates CoinEx’s ability to attract both retail and institutional investors. As CET’s trading volume grows and the platform’s ecosystem expands, CoinEx is positioned to shift from a “dark horse” to a leading force in the crypto industry.

Such a move would erase some of the gains made in the last 30 days when it jumped by almost 500%. XLM Price Could Correct: Analyst Stellar lumens has been a strong performer this year as it jumped to a high of $0.6345, its highest level since May 2021. At its highest point, it was up by over 743% from its lowest level this year. Most analysts are bullish about Stellar price, helped by its strong fundamentals and technicals. In an X post, Rose Premium , predicted that Stellar would jump to $0.98, a few points below the psychological point at $1. If this happens, it means that the XLM price has a 90% upside from the current level. However, the analyst warned that XLM price would have more downside if it dropped below $0.40. If that happens, he sees the coin plunging to $0.3235, down by 35% from the current level. Stellar Price Forecast Stellar Price Analysis: Mean Reversion Is a Key Risk The weekly chart shows that the XLM coin price went parabolic as it jumped for four consecutive weeks. There are signs that it is forming a bullish pennant chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern is made up of a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle and often achieves a bullish breakout. More upside will be confirmed if Stellar price jumps above the upper side of the pennant at $0.6355. If this happens, as we predicted this week , will increase the odds of the coin rising above its all-time high of $0.7960, followed by the psychological point at $1. The risk, however, is that the coin has formed a hanging man candlestick pattern. It is characterized by a long lower shadow and a small body and it usually forms at the upper side of a trend. In most periods, this hanging man leads to a downward breakdown, especially when the price moves below its lower side. XLM Price chart The other risk for Stellar price is that it could go through a mean reversion. This is a situation where an asset falls back to its average prices. In this case, it remains significantly higher than the 50-week moving average at $0.1567 and the 200-average of $01.448. Such a drop would imply a near 70% retreat from the current level.

The presale will take place in three rounds over a span of seven days, with a focus on supporting the project’s long-term development. The price of $CPNUT is fixed across each round at 0.000003 SOL, equating to $0.00072. The first round, which commenced on November 28, concluded at 14:00 UTC. During this round, 50 million CPNUT were allocated to investors, and they received a 100% reward bonus on tokens purchased. For the second round, 100 million CPNUT were allocated to investors. This round concluded in 48 hours, from November 29 to December 1 at 14:00 UTC. Early investors received a 50% bonus on whatever they bought. The third and final round kicked off on December 1, 2024. This round is scheduled to conclude in 96 hours (on December 5, 2024). Investors will receive an additional 10% on tokens purchased during this period. Each round offers a 15% referral reward for participants who invite others to join the presale with their referral link. Interested users can join the presale here: https://chillpnut.io/buy Step 1: Wallet Setup Investors begin by setting up a Solana-compatible wallet, such as Phantom, to generate a SOL address. The ChillPnut website provides a Dashboard where users can log in by entering their SOL address. Step 2: Funding the Wallet To participate in the presale, participants fund their wallets with SOL. SOL can be acquired through cryptocurrency exchanges if not already available. Step 3: Purchasing and Reserving CPNUT Within the Dashboard, participants can specify the amount of SOL intended for investment in the ChillPnut presale. The Dashboard calculates the number of CPNUT tokens associated with the entered amount. SOL is then transferred to the designated wallet address provided on the Dashboard. Once the transaction is confirmed, ChillPnut will reserve allocated tokens and airdrop before the Token Generation Event (TGE). A SOL address can be obtained using Solana-compatible wallets such as Phantom or Solflare. The total supply of CPNUT tokens is 1 billion. Of this supply, 50% is allocated for the presale, 25% for liquidity, 8% for airdrops, 10% for a centralized exchange (CEX) reserve, 5% for marketing efforts, and 2% for development initiatives. The presale event serves as a key milestone for the platform, providing an opportunity for early participants to support what aims to be an innovative development in the memecoin sector. Additionally, the ChillPnut Giveaway is active, targeting 5,000 SOL addresses with a distribution of 15,850 CPNUT (approximately $25) per address. Each referral equals 2,377 CPNUT (about $4). The current token price of $0.00072 marks the latest valuation for CPNUT. ChillPnut has announced its upcoming listing on Bitmart, a recognized cryptocurrency exchange, with additional plans to expand its availability to platforms such as KuCoin, Bybit, BingX, Huobi, Bitget, and OKX. About ChillPnut (CPNUT) The ChillPnut memecoin debuted on the Solana blockchain and rode the wave of the viral “Just A Chill PNUT” meme, gaining popularity on social media. ChillPnut is inspired by the viral story of Peanut, a pet squirrel euthanized by New York authorities. The CPNUT ecosystem may offer P2E aspects, but the token is primarily designed for entertainment.

With prices reaching levels not seen since 2018 and a surge in whale activity driving the momentum, the Ripple-affiliated token has captured widespread attention. Analysts note a combination of institutional interest, robust network growth, and significant wallet accumulation as key factors behind XRP's recent rally, while the broader market also shows signs of renewed interest in established altcoins. Ripple CTO Celebrates 12 Years at the Helm David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, celebrated a significant milestone as XRP reached a pivotal moment in its history. Schwartz, who officially marked 12 years at Ripple, saw the cryptocurrency he helped pioneer climb to third place by market capitalization, overtaking major players like Tether (USDT) and Solana (SOL). This achievement comes as XRP’s blistering rally continued on Sunday, with the cryptocurrency surging by over 28% in just 24 hours. The token’s price skyrocketed to a new multi-year high of $2.48, a monumental feat for the Ripple-affiliated digital asset. The ascent to the third spot is a significant comeback story for XRP, which had faced the threat of being pushed out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies following the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple. The regulatory turmoil had cast a long shadow over XRP’s future, but the latest surge has reinvigorated investor confidence. With a market capitalization of $139 billion, XRP now surpasses major global corporations like Citigroup, Airbus, and Sony. However, it still trails Ethereum (ETH), which maintains a formidable market cap of $444 billion, solidifying its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC). While XRP’s 30% daily gain is impressive, it was not the best-performing cryptocurrency among the top 100. Hedera (HBAR) outshined XRP with an eye-popping 42% gain within the same timeframe. HBAR also eclipsed XRP’s weekly performance, boasting a 78% increase compared to XRP’s 69%. The market’s bullish sentiment extended to other legacy altcoins as well. Litecoin (LTC) and EOS (EOS) posted notable gains of 20.2% and 20.5%, respectively, as traders diversified into time-tested assets alongside their interest in XRP. XRP may have more fuel for its ongoing rally. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently confirmed he had recorded an interview with 60 Minutes, one of the most influential television news programs in the United States. While the air date for the interview remains unconfirmed, its eventual release could serve as a major catalyst for XRP’s continued growth. The interview is expected to spotlight Ripple’s regulatory battle with the SEC, XRP’s recent resurgence, and broader discussions on cryptocurrency’s future in the financial ecosystem. Given 60 Minutes’ reputation for shaping public opinion, the coverage could attract renewed mainstream attention to XRP and the cryptocurrency industry at large. What Lies Ahead for XRP? XRP’s remarkable climb to the third spot signals a resurgence for the cryptocurrency after years of uncertainty. While the token’s recent price surge and market cap position are undoubtedly impressive, surpassing Ethereum remains a distant goal. The gap between Ethereum’s $444 billion market cap and XRP’s $139 billion is vast, requiring sustained momentum and possibly groundbreaking developments for XRP to close the gap. Despite these challenges, XRP’s latest rally shows its enduring relevance in the cryptocurrency market. With a loyal community, significant institutional partnerships, and upcoming media exposure, the Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency appears poised to remain a central player in the digital asset ecosystem. For now, all eyes remain on XRP’s price movements and the impact of Ripple’s ongoing legal and media strategies. Whether it can sustain its upward trajectory or face a pullback will depend on a combination of market dynamics, regulatory clarity, and broader adoption trends. XRP Hits Near-Seven-Year High as Whale Activity Reaches Unprecedented Levels XRP’s rapid growth has brought the crypto back into the spotlight, with analysts noting that its current trajectory mirrors the momentum it had during its peak years. The cryptocurrency’s resurgence is fueled by a mix of institutional and retail interest, with large holders, or “whales,” playing a pivotal role. On-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant revealed that whale activity for XRP has reached unprecedented levels. ”Since its launch, XRP has never captured the attention of whales to this extent,” the platform noted, emphasizing that current activity represents an all-time high for the cryptocurrency. Supporting this analysis, Santiment, another blockchain analytics provider, reported that wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP have accumulated a staggering 679.1 million tokens—worth $1.66 billion—in the past three weeks. Additionally, Santiment highlighted that XRP whales purchased an extra 160 million tokens over the weekend, amounting to approximately $380 million in value. This surge in accumulation is complemented by robust network growth. Over 22,000 new wallets were created on the XRP Ledger on Sunday alone, bringing the total number of non-empty XRP wallets to over 5.5 million—a first in the cryptocurrency’s eight-year history. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, pointed to Coinbase as a potential driving force behind XRP’s meteoric rise. Over the last 30 days, the price premium for XRP on Coinbase has fluctuated between 3% and 13%, suggesting significant whale activity on the US-based exchange. This trend suggests there is a growing interest from US investors despite ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP. Interestingly, Upbit, a Korean exchange known for its substantial XRP investor base, showed no significant price premium during the same period. This disparity highlights the regional dynamics in XRP’s current rally, with Western markets seemingly leading the charge. Beyond whale activity, XRP’s network utility appears to be gaining traction. Santiment noted strong growth across multiple altcoin blockchains, with XRP standing out for its vibrant ledger activity. The creation of thousands of new wallets indicates increased retail and institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Analysts have pointed out that while the short-term impact of this activity may result in price volatility, the long-term implications are promising. Growing utility on the XRP Ledger signals broader adoption and reinforces the cryptocurrency’s relevance in the market. Can XRP Sustain Its Momentum? Despite its impressive rally, XRP faces hurdles. Achieving the $3 mark would be a symbolic victory, but sustaining such levels amid increased retail engagement and potential profit-taking remains uncertain. Furthermore, regulatory challenges, particularly in the US, continue to loom over Ripple and its native token. Nevertheless, the ongoing accumulation by whales and the surge in network activity offer a solid foundation for XRP’s long-term growth. If the momentum continues, XRP could further solidify its position as a leading cryptocurrency, potentially narrowing the gap with Ethereum (ETH), which boasts a significantly larger market cap of over $444 billion. XRP’s near-seven-year high and record-breaking whale activity signal a remarkable comeback for the cryptocurrency. With substantial gains over the past month and robust network growth, XRP is poised for an exciting future. However, whether it can sustain its meteoric rise and overcome challenges will depend on a confluence of market dynamics, regulatory clarity, and continued utility growth on the XRP Ledger.

Inching closer to its psychological mark of $0.010, the overnight surge of more than 10% has driven its market cap to $998 million. As the trading volume surges to $401 million, the Notcoin is soon to become a billion-dollar altcoin. Will this extend the ongoing rally to a new all-time high? Let’s find out. Notcoin Price Analysis In the daily chart, the Notcoin price action shows a recovery rally surpassing a long-coming resistance trend line. This marks a falling channel breakout rally with a burst in trend momentum. Tradingview The breakout rally had struggled to surpass the 38.20% trend level at $0.0094. However, with the double bottom formation and the 100-day EMA line acting as the base, NOT token price has surpassed the crucial resistance. The overhead supply zone extends from $0.0097 to the psychological mark of $0.010. Currently, Notcoin is trading at $0.009743, following last night’s 9% jump. Over the past 24 hours, it has increased by more than 10% and is heading to reclaim the psychological mark. With the bullish turnaround and the neckline breakout, the immediate resistance for Notcoin is at $0.011, or the 50% Fibonacci level. Notcoin Technicals and Price Targets The bullish trend in the MACD and Signal lines has avoided a bearish crossover twice, revealing strong underlying bullishness. Furthermore, the 20-day EMA line is giving a bullish crossover with the 100-day EMA line, reflecting a short-term surge in underlying bullishness. A bull run beyond this point will mark a change in the trend character of Notcoin, bringing $0.016 and $0.022 as the next potential price targets. Hence, the altcoin shows a potential upside of more than 130% in the coming month. On the other hand, crucial support remains the 50-day EMA line at $0.0080 and the 100-day EMA line at $0.0085.

It is currently trading at $12.30, up over 36% in the last 24 hours. Intriguingly, the rapid increase in its price has pushed the token’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) beyond a massive $12 billion. With 333 million tokens circulating out of a 1 billion max supply, HYPE’s market capitalization currently stands at around $4 billion. HYPE Registers New ATH! The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol Hyperliquid had its genesis event on Nov. 29, debuting at $3.90. This put the total airdrop value at $1.2 billion. Roughly 31% of the total supply was distributed during the event. The HYPE price has increased since the airdrop, reaching a new all-time high of $12.95 on Dec. 4. The sentiment around HYPE is positive for numerous reasons besides the price increase. Analyst Base summarized a few of the reasons. Users were all praises that the token generation event went smoothly, without any outages or complaints about the distribution. Additionally, there was no allocation for VCs or private investors. The holders’ distribution also showed a good amount of decentralization, with fairly few large wallets holding a large percentage of the supply. 8 Reasons why you should start BUYING $HYPE below 10$ pic.twitter.com/P4sUZyGqjj — Base (@Basesol_NFT) December 3, 2024 Users are also enthusiastic about the TWAP feature, which divides large orders into smaller ones executed in 30-second intervals, with a maximum slippage of 3%. There is immense demand for HYPE, which is evident by the massive difference between TWAP buy and sell orders. Users noted that HYPE is deflationary and burns nearly 26% of its supply per year at the current rate. The investor interest in the token is pretty evident as well in its 24 hour trading volume of over $279 million. Hyperliquid has also risen to lead in trading volume and total value locked among decentralized perpetual swap platforms. With its valuation up over 514% since the launch and a current market cap exceeding $4.2 billion, Hyperliquid has flashed speculations about which projects might replicate its success. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Algorand (ALGO) is the Best Bet Crypto Right Now? , Which Projects Could Replicate HYPE’s Success? Grass gained attention with its first airdrop on Solana, distributing 10% of its total token supply during its initial phase. Participants earned tokens by contributing computing power and engaging with the network. For its second phase, Grass plans to allocate 17% of tokens to the community. LayerZero’s initial allocation of 15% of its ZRO token supply was designated for future incentivized activities. LayerZero users and developers will receive 23.8% of the token supply. According to an official announcement, unclaimed tokens as of September 20 were reallocated. Analysts recommend engaging with LayerZero’s bridge services regularly and participating in its Discord roles program, which reserves an additional 5 million tokens for the community. Wormhole, a multi-chain interoperability protocol, offered an early airdrop strategy that proved lucrative for active users. Although the project reserves only 6% of its W token supply for community rewards, its focus on rewarding high-value transactions suggests it has room to grow with increased adoption. Arkham recently shifted from blockchain services to building a perpetual exchange. Its airdrop strategy imitates Hyperliquid’s, rewarding users who trade and refer new participants. Growing Prominence Of DEXs Zeta Markets co-founder Anmol Singh noted that the high trading volumes surrounding HYPE’s launch was a sign of the growing prominence of decentralized exchanges and perpetual platforms. He noted that by 2025, the majority of token launches will happen on DEXs, making them the clear choice over CEXs. FAQs Why has HYPE token price surged so much?

With a surge of ~515% in its daily trading volume, the Tron price has achieved a new all-time high of $0.4407 during the early Asian trading hours today. Amid increased bullish sentiment and a high possibility of an Altcoin market, will the Tron ecosystem dominate the cryptocurrency market?

According to a press release shared with crypto.news, the laptop features built-in cold storage for digital assets and an operating system tailored for interactions with decentralized networks and applications. “With more than $1.7 billion stolen from centralized exchanges in 2023 and $3.8 billion in 2022, integrated cold storage will enable users to take control of their crypto custody and avoid placing their digital wealth at risk,” the release noted. Further, the laptop incorporates a multi-party computation (MPC) framework, a cryptographic protocol that distributes private key operations across multiple parties to eliminate single points of failure and enhance security. In this regard, Metavasio partnered with io.finnet , a U.S.-based company specializing in secure digital asset infrastructure and advanced cryptographic solutions, with the collaboration formalized in November 2024. The laptop also integrates the Thomson Computing Wallet alongside an underlying token ecosystem, which will incentivize users through activities such as resource sharing and engaging with decentralized applications. “The Web3 laptop offers a gateway to a decentralized future, empowering users to truly own their digital experiences. More than just a device, it’s designed to help individuals connect, create, and reclaim control of their digital lives.” Stephan Français, founder & CEO of METAVISIO You might also like: Cellula generated $179m in revenue; is it the next big web3 gaming platform? Thomson Computing, the computing branch of Metavasio, has a strong global presence, with its devices sold in over 52 countries and through more than 16,000 physical points of sale. The launch follows the completion of a eur 50 million (roughly $52.53 million) SAFE financing round in October, secured from American AI and Hardware Investments LTD, to support Metavasio’s expansion into blockchain technology and hardware innovation. Recent trends in the tech industry have focused on integrating Web3 capabilities into consumer devices. Web3 smartphones, for instance, have previously emerged as an early attempt to integrate blockchain technology into everyday life. Solana Mobiles, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, developed Saga and Seeker, which are Android smartphones that feature Web3 functionalities and are integrated with the Solana blockchain. Similarly, HTC introd uced the Exodus 1, a blockchain-focused smartphone featuring a built-in cryptocurrency wallet and a secure enclave to protect users’ digital assets.

According to Chair Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve is on track to cut its key interest rates in the coming months. This rate cut aligns perfectly with the crypto bull run as it could see assets such as Avalanche and Dogecoin register meteoric upticks. Dogecoin's price has already been up over 168% in the last month, and Avalanche is set to flip its previous ATH, which has had a 102% uptick in the last 30 days. However, with tons of liquidity flowing into the market during this crypto rally, Rollblock is bound to gain the most, given that its RBLK token is still in its presale. RBLK has already surged over 270% since the start of its presale, and Rollblock's focus on the GambleFi niche has seen experts forecast a potential crypto rally on launch. Dogecoin's price surged over 150% as holders eye $1 As the crypto rally prepares for its next uptick, with Bitcoin's price now settling around the $96,000 region, Dogecoin's price has also found support around the $0.40 zone. Analysts forecast incoming market corrections for Dogecoin's price; however, bullish sentiment is only increasing. Just recently, DOGE holders had a significant breakthrough, with DOGE getting its first exchange-traded product listing on the stock market. This level of recognition solidifies DOGE's position as the top meme coin. Avalanche (AVAX) on track to surpass previous ATH in this crypto rally Avalanche (AVAX) is also on the rise in this crypto rally, with its price surging an impressive 102% in the last 30 days. Avalanche's AVAX, which is built on a general-purpose blockchain, could easily surge 3x from its current price of under $50. AVAX price also recently had a boost upward after news broke out that Avalanche was in talks with the incoming U.S. administration. Given Trump's positive outlook on crypto, Avalanche could soon surge past its previous ATH in this crypto rally. Rollblock's RBLk surges over 270% as crypto rally continues Another crypto project on the verge of a crypto rally is Rollblock's RBLK . Currently, in its presale, Rollblock is championing a bridge between cryptocurrencies and the budding online gambling market. The presale has reached stage 8, and RBLK's price has surged by over 270% since the start. With the online gambling market set to be worth over $744 billion by 2028, Rollblock is spearheading a revolutionary GambleFi protocol that is built with transparency in mind. Rollblock comes with a community-backed crypto casino that offers generous rewards and payouts. A portion of the casino's profits are used to buy back RBLK from the open market, thereby boosting RBLK's crypto rally. What's more, Rollblock offers provably fair casino games as every transaction is registered on the blockchain for an added layer of transparency. There is also a 30% APY staking program for RBLK holders, and players get VIP bonuses and high payouts. So far, the ongoing presale has raised over $6.5 million, and with Rollblock's innovative revenue share model and a community-centric approach, analysts have predicted a crypto rally for RBLK once it's launched on major exchanges.

As this new month starts, Finbold looked at Bitcoin’s historical returns to provide a BTC price projection for December 31. In hindsight, Bitcoin closed November with 37.29% gains, within Finbold’s predicted price range using this same methodology. On November 2, we published the BTC price prediction targeting a monthly close between $75,275 and $100,334, while the leading cryptocurrency was trading at $69,495. Bitcoin closed November 30 at $96,451, validating the method, which we will now repeat for this month. Bitcoin historical returns in December since 2013 Data from Coinglass shows December is usually a month of consolidation, without many expressive results either up and downwards. Notably, Bitcoin’s monthly performance in December, dating back from 2013, has accumulated 5.00% gains on average. However, with six negative years out of eleven, December also has a median return of minus 1.73%. These returns are measured from opening to closing, or December 1 to 31. For example, Bitcoin’s historical best December was in 2020, up 46.92% after a 42.95% November. Something similar also happened in 2017, with a 53.48%-gain November followed by a 38.89%-up December. Nevertheless, 2013 was December’s worst year after November’s best yearly performance, with -34.81% and +449.35%, respectively. Overall, all positive November years were followed by an also positive December with the exception of 2013 and 2014. Bitcoin Monthly returns (%), November and December highlighted. Source: CoinGlass / Finbold / Vini Barbosa Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction by December 31, 2024 As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $95,930, below December’s opening price of $96,451. The leading cryptocurrency now consolidates after breaking out of high and low time frame downtrends that led to its rally. Therefore, based on its historical returns, BTC could trade between $94,782 and $101,273 by the end of 2024. The prediction projects Bitcoin’s price from December’s opening using the median and average historical returns if BTC keeps its pattern. Yet, it could go even higher if mirroring November’s performance as it has before in bull market years. Bitcoin (BTC) 30-day price chart.

Ampere ( AMP ) has surged by about 300% from its yearly low, pushing its market capitalization to over $910 million. The surge coincides with a broader shift into older cryptocurrencies that outperformed in 2021, following notable surges in names like Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) and Ripple ( XRP ). AMP’s utility in the payment industry, particularly for its fast transaction speeds and low costs, has supported its price growth. Recently, AMP technology was integrated into Flexa , a growing payment network for e-commerce. AMP’s price also rose as crypto analysts expressed bullish sentiments about the coin. In a statement, CJ Bennet, a popular crypto analyst, noted that the coin was poised for more gains, potentially reaching a record high. $amp Patience prevails, my friends.

The coin is also gaining as investors celebrate the arrival of altcoin season. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the altcoin season index has climbed to over 80, while the fear and greed index has risen to 88. Most altcoins tend to perform well during periods of high market greed. Meanwhile, there are signs that AMP whales are accumulating the coin. According to Etherscan, one whale moved tokens worth over $2 million from Coinbase, which is seen as a bullish signal. AMP price analysis AMP chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the AMP token price experienced a strong bullish breakout, reaching a high of $0.01450. It surpassed the crucial resistance level at $0.0091, its highest point on April 29. The coin has formed a golden cross pattern as the 200-day and 50-day moving averages crossed each other. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index also indicate upward momentum. Therefore, AMP needs to close above this week’s high of $0.01450 to confirm the bullish trend. A close below this high could validate a shooting star pattern, a common bearish indicator.

Forbes listed these 20 altcoins as follows: XRP, ADA, LTC, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Internet Computer (ICP), ETC, Stellar (XLM), Stacks (STX), Kaspa (KAS), Theta (THETA), Fantom ( FTM), Monero (XMR), Arweave (AR), Algorand (ALGO), Flow (FLOW), MultiversX (EGLD), Bitcoin SV (BSV), Mina (MINA), Tezos (XTZ) and Eos (EOS).

However, Ripple is reportedly awaiting approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, according to local media reports . What is RLUSD? Ripple USD (RLUSD), a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin, offers transparency and stability on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple aims to leverage both its stablecoin and native token, XRP, to enhance its cross-border payment solutions. At present, Ripple Labs has warned investors and institutions to avoid engaging with any token claiming to be RLUSD or Ripple USD before its official launch to prevent falling victim to scams. Despite this warning, RLUSD is currently listed on the cryptocurrency data platform CoinGecko. Since August 2024, Ripple has been beta testing its RLUSD stablecoin on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum’s mainnet. The firm has shared plans to gradually expand RLUSD to more blockchains and DeFi protocols in the future. Will RLUSD Impact XRP Price? Despite the RLUSD launch, Ripple’s native token XRP, has already gained significant attention over the past week. Furthermore, experts anticipate a notable upward momentum for XRP once RLUSD becomes available on exchanges. Currently, XRP is trading near $2.55 and has registered a price decline of 2.55% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by $28%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors amid a bullish outlook.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 13:56:09

Notably, the digital asset trading platform revealed that it is delisting certain pairs for two of the mentioned assets while expanding support for the other two. In turn, crypto market participants are speculating over the future price actions of these four coins amid a broader bull market. Binance Issues Updates on NOT, RDNT, KAIA, and AERO In an official Binance announcement dated December 4, the crypto exchange giant revealed that it is delisting NOT/BNB and RDNT/BTC on December 6 at 03:00 UTC. This decision by the exchange comes primarily to “protect users and maintain a high-quality trading market.” Further, the announcement revealed that Spot Trading Bots services for the abovementioned pairs are also to be discontinued on the same date and time. Overall, the delisting chronicle has raised severe concerns among investors, reducing the assets’ market visibility. Simultaneously, in another announcement , the crypto exchange behemoth revealed that it is expanding trade offerings for KAIA and AERO tokens. The exchange is launching KAIAUSDT and AEROUSDT perpetual contracts on December 4 at 14:00 and 14:15 UTC, respectively. Users remain primed to enjoy 75x leverage trading these tokens. Overall, these enhanced trade offerings spark investor optimism, providing the assets with enhanced market visibility. The leading cryptocurrency exchange ‘s announcements on all four assets have set off mixed investor sentiments regarding prices. While the enhanced offering paves the path for further gains, the discontinuation of support has raised bearish sentiments. How Are The Coins Delivering? Despite Binance’s delisting announcement, RDNT price was up 13% and is sitting at $0.105. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.08658 and $0.1059, respectively. Even NOT price gained 7% to $0.009623. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.008376 and $0.009651, respectively. These tokens have defied usual market sentiments, although market watchers continue to monitor them. Besides, KAIA price soared 2% intraday to reach $0.3573. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.2692 and $0.3754, respectively. AERO price witnessed gains worth 16% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $1.92. Its intraday low and high were $1.57 and $1.85, respectively. Altogether, the rising actions could be the effect of a broader Q4 bull market. Nevertheless, market watchers continue to keep these coins on the radar for further shifts. Also, it’s noteworthy that Binance announced delisting BAND, GTC, AVA, and other tokens in BTC pairs in another similar chronicle.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $16.21 by the end of 2027. By 2030, WIF’s price may surge to $23.65. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance, and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to a crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins expected to hit the market soon. Having closed in on the $5 mark on March 31, 2024, and also recaptured $4 post-U.S. elections in November, can WIF reach $10 soon? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $3.37 Market cap $3,358,149,419.47 Trading volume $1,040,561,472.96 Circulating supply 998,844,851.89 WIF All-time high $4.85 on March 31, 2024 All-time low $0.0677 on January 8, 2024 24-hour high $3.41 24-hour low $2.98 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $11.05 (228.53%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 15.89% 50-day SMA $2.80 14-Day RSI 56.05 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $2.46 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis: WIF struggles to break past $3.476 TL;DR Breakdown WIF’s price analysis shows consolidation. Dogwifhat (WIF) resistance is present at $3.476. WIF’s support level is present at $2.964. The Dogwifhat price analysis for December 4 shows price consolidation, and a continued attempt to break past $3.476. Having seen massive gains over the past month (over 60%), and a rebound afterward, the bulls have been unable to push WIF to its previous highs. What next for Dogwifhat ($WIF)? Continued consolidation or a bullish breakout? Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart: WIF attempts to break out of consolidation zone The 1-day price chart for Dogwifhat (WIF) shows a breakout attempt from the consolidation zone, with strong buyer interest evident in recent green candles. WIF’s key support level is present at $2.964, with $3.476 acting as immediate resistance. WIF attempts to break out of consolidation zone The Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) for 20, 50, 100, and 200 days indicate bullish momentum. The current price is above the 20-day EMA ($3.191), signaling short-term strength. The alignment of the EMAs also suggests a gradual upward trend, with the 50-day EMA at $2.923 and the 200-day EMA at $2.597 forming a broad support zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.71, reflecting neutral-to-bullish momentum. This level suggests room for further upward movement before hitting overbought conditions. A breakout above $3.476 (current high) could see WIF target $3.651 and beyond. Failure to do so may result in retests of support around $2.964. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart: Buyers or sellers to take control next? The 4-hour WIF/USDT chart gives a good glimpse of current market dynamics. Dogwifhat (WIF) is sitting at $3.325, down 2.35%, and moving within the Bollinger Bands. The Bollinger bands are narrowing, which often signals minimal volatility followed by significant price movements. If WIF breaks above the upper band ($3.443), it could spark a bullish run, but if it slips toward the lower band ($2.995), sellers might take control. Buyers or sellers to take control next? The MACD shows some positive momentum, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line. While there’s some bullish energy here, it’s not particularly strong yet. The histogram is in the green, suggesting buyers are present, but they haven’t quite tipped the scales fully in their favor. The Balance of Power corroborates the current price action, with a reading of -0.59 showing sellers still have the upper hand. Even so, this could shift quickly if buyers step in with more conviction. Dogwifhat technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 2.95 BUY SMA 5 3.13 BUY SMA 10 3.06 BUY SMA 21 3.28 BUY SMA 50 2.80 BUY SMA 100 2.37 BUY SMA 200 2.46 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 3.09 BUY EMA 5 2.97 BUY EMA 10 2.81 BUY EMA 21 2.61 BUY EMA 50 2.30 BUY EMA 100 2.16 BUY EMA 200 2.10 BUY What to expect from WIF price analysis? The 1-day chart shows a bullish trend, while the 4-hour chart suggests consolidation and a possible breakout. Buyers have momentum, but sellers remain active. If the price holds above $3.476 and breaks $3.65, the rally could continue, but rejection at resistance may lead to a pullback. Watching key levels will clarify the next move. Is Dogwifhat a good investment? Dogwifhat has experienced notable price fluctuations, particularly with a substantial increase in value in March, July, and October/November of 2024. While analysts hold diverse opinions on the future of this meme coin, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic. Projections indicate that by 2030, the price could rise to between $15 and $20. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank and several others. Why is $WIF down? After the bullish surge in November, Dogwifhat’s price faced correction and is currently consolidating between $2.902 and $3.473. Will WIF reach $10? Having touched $4.67 in November 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Predictions by analysts suggest the token could surpass $10 as soon as 2026. Will WIF reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $7 by 2025 and $20 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

This growth reflects the broader market’s bullishness, highlighting SOL’s potential for further momentum. Analysts anticipate a breakout, with the cryptocurrency targeting $420 by Christmas amid consolidation trends. Analysts Predict Solana Price To Hit $420 By Christmas Crypto Analyst shared an X Post posting prediction for Solana. According to the expert, the analyst forecasts a significant rally for SOL, projecting a price target of $420 by Christmas. Source- X The Solana price has sharply risen, hovering above the support level. This surge follows Grayscale Investments’ SEC filing to convert its Grayscale Solana Trust into a spot ETF. Other major asset managers, including VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and Bitwise Asset Management, have joined the spot Solana ETFs race, signaling increased institutional interest. The SOL price is trading at $234, surging by over 3% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency hit an intraday low of $216 before peaking at $240, reflecting heightened investor confidence and robust market demand. The broader crypto market is also experiencing historic momentum. Bitcoin has surged to $96,000, nearing the $100,000 milestone, while Ethereum has climbed past $3,600. Will SOL Price Hit $300 By Next Week? The Solana price prediction action indicates a bullish trend. A breakout above $300 could fuel a significant upward trajectory toward $420, with $500 remaining a long-term target. The technical indicators for Solana price reveal a potential rally in the near term. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator reflects a possible trend reversal. The MACD line recently crossed above the signal line, suggesting buying momentum is building. If sustained, this crossover could support a rally. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows increasing green bars, signifying growing bullish strength. A sustained positive trend in the AO would reinforce the likelihood of upward price movement. Solana Price Chart: TradingView According to sentiment data, the Solana price has recently seen a significant surge in social volume. This increase in online conversations around cryptocurrency could be a key indicator of growing interest and potential price movements. The surge in social volume often precedes notable market shifts, and Solana appears to be attracting more attention from traders and investors. Source- Santiment The recent surge in Solana prices, bolstered by institutional interest and positive technical indicators, suggests strong bullish momentum. If trends persist, SOL could approach $420 by Christmas, with further gains possible beyond that.

The Reserve Rights (RSR) token surged due to the speculation of Atkins' nomination, despite his limited current involvement with the project. Meanwhile, Jorge Tenreiro, who is known for his involvement in many high-profile crypto cases, has been promoted to SEC Chief Litigation Counsel. Paul Atkins Hesitant to Step In as SEC Chair Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner and founder of Patomak Global Partners, is reportedly the leading candidate for SEC Chair under President-elect Donald Trump. However, insiders suggest that Atkins may be reluctant to take on the role because of the extensive work required to overhaul the agency after what he perceives as mismanagement by outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Despite support from people like former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo, Atkins is hesitant to leave his consulting firm, which specializes in regulatory compliance and includes crypto clients as part of its portfolio. His decision may hinge on the readiness of his firm to operate without him. Other candidates are also under consideration. Crypto attorney Teresa Goody Guillén received a lot of support from industry leaders like Binance’s Changpeng Zhao and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, and is seen as a strong contender due to her pro-crypto stance and experience in SEC-related cases. Brian Brooks , a former acting Comptroller of the Currency, was previously a favorite among Web3 advocates but faces some challenges because of his limited experience in securities law. Circle’s Heath Tarbert , a former CFTC Chair, is also in the mix, along with traditional securities lawyers like Brad Bondi and Norm Champ. However, their lack of strong ties to the crypto community could pose a problem for them. Controversy surrounds some other potential picks, like Robert Stebbins and Dalia Blass. Both faced criticism for their roles in the SEC’s aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies, including the Ripple case. The crypto community is also concerned over candidates with similar regulatory philosophies to Gensler, and seem to prefer people who may adopt a more crypto-friendly approach. If the Senate does not confirm a new chair by Jan. 20, Republican SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda could serve as acting chair. Commissioner Hester Pierce, who has been a very vocal advocate for crypto innovation, reportedly declined interest in the role. To make things even more interesting, the Trump administration preference for a lighter regulatory touch could shift oversight of the digital assets market to the CFTC. The SEC will also need to fill a vacant commissioner seat. Kalshi Puts Paul Atkins at 93% Odds for Trump’s SEC Chair Reports from various outlets suggested differing probabilities of Paul Atkins taking over the SEC Chair position. Prediction platform Kalshi recently placed Atkins’ odds of nomination at 93% before dropping slightly below 90%. Despite these high odds, Trump has not officially announced his choice yet. Atkins reportedly met with Trump’s team after an invitation to interview for the role, according to Politico . Trump’s announcements for his administration are typically made on Truth Social, but no confirmation has been issued regarding the SEC chair. If selected, Atkins will still require formal nomination in January and confirmation by a narrowly Republican-controlled Senate. Trump’s campaign promises included replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who will step down on Inauguration Day. Gensler’s tenure has been very controversial in the crypto industry, and critics accused the SEC of inconsistent enforcement and regulatory overreach. The new chair will have the authority to shape policies affecting digital assets, which is a very critical issue for an industry calling for clearer regulations to prevent businesses from relocating overseas. RSR Token Rallies on Paul Atliks SEC Rumors The Reserve Rights (RSR) token saw an impressive price surge due to the speculation surrounding incoming President Donald Trump’s anticipated nomination of a new SEC Chair. Rumors within the cryptocurrency community suggested a potential link between the token's rally and the possibility of Trump appointing Paul Atkins, who previously served as an advisor to the Reserve Rights Foundation, the organization behind RSR. After Atkins emerged as a leading candidate for SEC Chair, Reserve co-creator and CEO Nevin Freeman clarified that Atkins is no longer actively consulting on the project. Freeman stated that Atkins advised Reserve during its early stages and admires his open-mindedness toward crypto. He also pointed out that Atkins has been very transparent with regards to his advisory role with Reserve. Atkins’ status as the frontrunner for the SEC role was a major contributing factor to RSR’s price rally. On Dec. 3, the token surged by up to 88%, and was even able to reach a multi-year high of $0.017, according to data from CoinMarketCap . RSR’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite this impressive recovery, RSR’s price is still way below its all-time high of $0.11 that was recorded in April of 2021. Its price still requires a 500+% increase to revisit that peak. Jorge Tenreiro Named SEC Chief Litigation Counsel Jorge Tenreiro , the acting chief of the U.S. SEC crypto and cyber unit, stepped into the role of the agency’s chief litigation counsel just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Tenreiro’s promotion places him in charge of overseeing the SEC’s Division of Enforcement lawsuits and investigations. This position offers Tenreiro a salary of up to $305,000 annually. Tenreiro took over from Olivia Choe, who left the SEC in July for a partner role at Milbank LLP. His tenure as chief litigation counsel begins at a critical time, as Trump pledged to reduce regulatory scrutiny of the crypto industry. Before his promotion, Tenreiro served as deputy chief of the crypto assets and cyber unit since October of 2022 and later became its acting chief in June after he left David Hirsch. During his time with the crypto unit, Tenreiro played a central role in several high-profile SEC lawsuits against major crypto firms, including Kraken, Coinbase, and Ripple Labs. He was also involved in cases against Tron founder Justin Sun and in the SEC’s legal battles against FTX, which secured the agency’s largest-ever settlement of $4.47 billion with Terraform Labs and its CEO, Do Kwon, in June. However, his tenure has not been without controversy. The SEC faced sanctions for allegedly misleading a court in its case against Debt Box, leading to the resignation of two agency lawyers. Critics in the crypto industry, including lawyer John Deaton, have been very vocal in their disapproval of Tenreiro’s approach. Deaton even warned firms against hiring him if he leaves the SEC. Tenreiro’s promotion happened at the same time as other leadership changes in the agency’s crypto unit. Mark Sylvester and Laura D’Allaird , former assistant director and counsel to outgoing Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga, respectively, have been named co-chiefs of the crypto assets and cyber unit.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|LUNA|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-04 13:59:52
37211117,https://finbold.com/?p=216758,1733320800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink team up to tokenize Fortlake’s Sigma Opportunities Fund",https://finbold.com/backed-sonic-and-chainlink-team-up-to-tokenize-fortlakes-sigma-opportunities-fund/,"Backed, an asset tokenization platform, has teamed up with Sonic, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible (EVM) blockchain , and Chainlink ( LINK ), an on-chain finance platform, to tokenize Fortlake’s Sigma Opportunities Fund, ccording to reports shared with Finbold on Wednesday, December 4. Given the strong market position of each partner, the collaboration is expected to play an important role in bringing traditional finance (TradFi) assets to the blockchain. Tokenizing the Sigma Opportunities Fund As part of the partnership, Backed will tokenize the Sigma Opportunities Fund by creating permissionless tokens, each collateralized 1:1 by fund units. Token prices will track the fund’s Net Asset Value (NAV) in real time to make them fully compatible with Sonic’s decentralized finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem. On the other hand, Chainlink’s SmartData solutions will ensure NAV data flows seamlessly on-chain while its Proof of Reserves and CCIP solutions verify collateral and assets under management and streamline cross-chain operations, respectively. Fortlake itself will manage the Sigma Opportunities Fund, targeting returns of 7–10% above the federal funds rate. By capitalizing on market inefficiencies, the fund delivered a 10% return over the past year. Why is Fortlake partnering with Sonic? Sonic offers 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with one-second finality, and its focus on scalability in real-world asset tokenization makes it a solid choice for Fortlake as it continues to work on simplifying back-office operations. Adam Levi, Co-Founder of Backed, commented on the team’s commitment to developing new asset management solutions: “Tokenizing the Fortlake Sigma Fund is a major step forward in the blockchain landscape. It showcases how institutions can use blockchain technology to simplify back-office operations and reach new capital. This partnership reflects our commitment to transforming how financial assets are managed and traded.” — Adam Levi Colin Cunningham, Head of Tokenization & Alliances at Chainlink Labs, also expressed hopes that Chainlink’s technology can help improve the liquidity of Fortlake’s fund. Finally, Sam Harcourt, Business Development Lead at Sonic, emphasized Sonic’s broader vision for future endeavours in DeFi: “This is just the beginning. Sonic aims to bring its advanced technology to financial institutions worldwide.” — Sam Harcourt Innovative tokenization solutions The new initiative is the first of its kind for Backed as a Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. With innovative tokenization solutions, Backed seeks to create more opportunities for financial institutions and make blockchain more prominent in traditional finance, especially now that BlackRock is entering the market and the Bank of America is forecasting a $16 trillion market in the next ten years. Early experiments by the likes of Hong Kong Monetary Authority and JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM) also highlight blockchain’s potential in asset management. All that considered, the partnership between Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink exemplifies how blockchain innovation is paving the way for a more efficient financial system.

Key Support Levels And Future Targets,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-under-the-microscope-will-it-break-2-9-key-support-levels-and-future-targets/,"XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently outperformed the top ten cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This significant momentum comes as investor sentiment grows in anticipation of clearer regulatory frameworks in the United States, especially following Donald Trump’s election. In addition, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler recently announced his departure effective January 20, which many believe could pave the way for increased adoption and institutional investment in XRP. This could be achieved through the XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, which is being pursued by asset managers such as Canary Capital, Bitwise, WisdomThree, and 21Shares. With the change in leadership at the agency, the odds of approval continue to rise, especially as the pro-crypto nominee to replace Gensler, Paul Atkins, is shaping up to lead the new era of regulation in the country. Key Fibonacci Resistance Ahead For XRP Over the past thirty days, XRP has experienced a remarkable surge of 400%, culminating in a six-year high of $2.91 reached over the past weekend. This surge has been further supported by a substantial increase in market capitalization, which has risen by $120 billion in the last three weeks, bringing XRP’s total market cap to approximately $140 billion. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price At $1.3-$1.5 Is Still Possible, Here’s Why Despite these encouraging trends, crypto analyst DarkDefender has emphasized the importance of monitoring specific price levels in the coming days. In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), he detailed critical Fibonacci levels for XRP. The analyst identified $2.92 as a significant Fibonacci resistance level, noting that XRP briefly reached $2.90 before experiencing a “normal corrective phase.” DarkDefender highlighted the necessity of holding certain support levels, particularly $2.13 and $1.88, if XRP cannot break through the $2.92 resistance. The analyst expects that the token could bounce between these levels for a “few days,” but if the token breaks above $2.92, it could target a new mid-range level of $3.99. This would mean a new all-time high for the token above its current record mark of $3.40, in the scenario that the token rises 59% as expected by DarkDefender. Trading Volume Surges Past Bitcoin And Ethereum Adding to the positive outlook, financial analyst Jacob King pointed out a historic milestone for XRP: during the current uptrend, XRP’s trading volume has surpassed the combined volumes of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the first time. Related Reading: Cardano Next In Line After XRP? ADA Price Targets $4.88 In Epic Breakout Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s trading volume reached an impressive $2.19 billion, significantly higher than Bitcoin’s $1.6 billion and Ethereum’s $531 million, underscoring the heightened interest from investors in the XRP token. At the time of writing, the market’s third largest token trades at $2.50, recording a 7% correction in the 24 hour time frame.
