Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 22:42:00

With this move, the firm intends to stop accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for payments. According to the report , the firm said the aim of this change offer a more stable, secure, and reliable payment system. Dtcpay, founded in 2019, is one of the key players in fintech, earning support from major industries like Singapore’s Pontiac Land. The company received a payment license from Singapore’s central bank in 2022. Dtcpay’s shift to stablecoins The shift also comes amid the growing demand for stable, secure, and regulated payment options. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can have big price changes, which create risks for businesses and users. Stablecoins, which are tied to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer a more predictable and stable alternative for digital transactions. Dtcpay believes this move will make payments safer and easier for everyone. Dtcpay’s decision is part of a larger trend in the fintech industry. A report from Chainalysis shows that stablecoin payments in Singapore reached nearly $1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Dtcpay will only support certain stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT), Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). These stablecoins are backed by real reserves to keep them at a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar. FDUSD, launched in June 2023, is now the sixth-largest stablecoin with a market value of $1.9 billion. WUSD, backed by the Worldwide Stablecoin Payment Network, is known for its added security since it is fully backed by reserves. The Singapore firm noted that the new stablecoin-only model aligns with its mission to deliver a “more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience” for its clients. The platform’s commitment to stability is important in the financial ecosystem. A large part of their transactions is already done with stablecoins. This change also aligns with growing regulations in places like Singapore, where the government is setting clear rules for digital assets.

In 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $7,769.79 and $9,361.58, with an average expected price of $9,199.91. In 2030, ETH could trade between $24,373.71 and $26,740.04, with an average price of $25,417.45. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2024 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,574.78 Market Cap $430.55B Trading Volume $41.12B Circulating Supply 120.44M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,682.67 24 Low $3,504.23 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 10.80% 50-day SMA $ 2,935.30 200-day SMA $ 2,914.35 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart On December 03, the 1-day Ethereum price chart shows that Ethereum is trading at $3,584.2, down by 1.67%. The price tested resistance at $3,825.1, as indicated by the upper Bollinger Band, but faced rejection, suggesting bearish momentum. ETH/USD 1-Day price chart The 20-day SMA at $3,370.9 acts as a key support level, with the lower Bollinger Band at $2,916.8, marking a critical defensive zone. The RSI (14) is at 65.62, signaling overbought conditions. A consolidation phase may follow if Ethereum stabilizes above $3,370.9, while a break below could lead to further downside. Overall, caution is warranted in the current range. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis The 4-hour Ethereum chart indicates a slight recovery as the current Ethereum price is $3,583.3, up 0.30%. A recent low of $3,569.5 suggests Ethereum is testing local support. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.38 shows mild bullish momentum but remains inconclusive for a strong upward breakout. ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The MACD displays a bearish crossover, with the MACD line at 1.4 and the signal line at 19.8, highlighting weak momentum. A continued price movement below $3,600 could lead to testing deeper support around $3,550. However, if buyers regain control, resistance at $3,595.5 could serve as the next upward target. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $3,310.19 BUY SMA 5 $3,422.80 BUY SMA 10 $3,399.66 BUY SMA 21 $3,309.67 BUY SMA 50 $2,935.30 BUY SMA 100 $2,715.66 BUY SMA 200 $2,914.35 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $3,237.43 BUY EMA 5 $3,068.89 BUY EMA 10 $2,859.44 BUY EMA 21 $2,695.35 BUY EMA 50 $2,621.57 BUY EMA 100 $2,714.74 BUY EMA 200 $2,814.55 BUY What can you expect from ETH price analysis next? The 1-day and 4-hour charts show that Ethereum currently exhibits mixed signals. On the daily chart, the price faces resistance at $3,825.1 and struggles to maintain above $3,584.2. The RSI suggests overbought levels. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD remains bearish, and the Balance of Power shows weak buying strength. If Ethereum breaches the $3,570 support zone, it could drop toward the lower Bollinger Band at $2,916.8. However, sustained consolidation above $3,600 may allow for a potential retest of the $3,825 resistance. A decisive break is needed to confirm the next trend direction. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark in the near future. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

The cryptocurrency had its biggest 24-hour gain in the last month, which boosted its market capitalization to $44.7 billion. Now, investors have begun talking about whether this momentum can be sustained, or if the rally has just been a temporary burst. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Cardano has gained a remarkable 268% in value over the past month, capturing the attention of bulls. Experts are keenly observing the token as optimism about the broader crypto market grows. Bullish Predictions Fuel Market Hopes Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks ADA has more to go. On December 1, Marks presented a price target of $2.77, or 130% above its current value. He also suggested that ADA could go the same way as it did in 2021 and surge between $5.29 and $7.82. Lark Davis, another prominent analyst, went even further and predicted that ADA would jump by 747% to $10. $ADA (Cardano) continuing to display monumental strength here and can be in full pursuit towards the first target of $2.7709 which can result in another +135% move from here to reach it but history says there can be more 👀! See charts below… https://t.co/OXkUPU1un4 pic.twitter.com/VOCZMOTo5Q — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 Institutional support is further giving the bull case credibility. The CIO at Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, recently stated that Cardano was one of his top altcoin choices for 2024. According to Yusko, traditional banks will be forced to introduce cryptocurrencies like ADA in the future to maintain their status quo. Resistance & Support Levels Under Focus While the rally is exciting, technical analysts suggest caution. The altcoin recently failed to break past the resistance level of $1.15, which raises questions about whether the uptrend can hold. Analysts point out that ADA must decisively reclaim this resistance to sustain its bullish momentum. If ADA succeeds in breaking through and holding up above $1.15, it could open a fresh wave of buying to carry the price even higher. If it fails, there could be a pullback to some critical support levels around $0.88. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Broader Market Trends Could Boost ADA Cardano is just seeing its surge as the overall crypto market is filled with fresh momentum. Bitcoin is approaching $100,000 and the recently held US presidential election brings much-needed optimism for the introduction of friendlier policies to cryptos. The positive context will therefore become a tailwind for ADA and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Cardano plans to release 18.53 million ADA tokens on December 4, which are worth approximately $20 million, adding to its momentum. An increase in supply can be viewed as dilution; however, the funds will go towards staking and treasury reserves, which may boost long-term growth. At present, Cardano seems to be on the bright side of things, but the future depends on breaking some key resistance levels and holding investor confidence.

According to developer WietseWind on the social media platform X, XRPL Labs changed the configuration of its validator last month to lower fees and reserve requirements in anticipation of rising activity on-chain. “There have been several discussion threads about Reserves and Fees on the XRPL. On behalf of XRPL Labs I just changed the configuration of our validator, to be enabled the next validator restart.” According to the developer, the adjustments aim to lower barriers for new users, including a significant reduction in the required reserves. As of December 2nd, reserve requirements for XRPL users have now been lowered from 20 to 1 XRP. According to pseudonymous XRPL developer Vet, the move has freed up excess XRP for traders. “XRP Ledger reserves just dropped! Activating an XRP account cost now 1 XRP Holding a Token Trustline only 0.2 XRP Excessive XRP is now freed up in your account that you can spend now!!” Developers say the changes will make it more affordable for users to participate in the XRP Ledger ecosystem, thus broadening the blockchain’s user base. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also asked validators to upgrade to 2.3.0 of rippled, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger. The move comes at a time when XRP’s value has soared to $2.65, its highest level since 2018. XRP is worth $2.51 at time of writing, up 82% from a week ago.

According to the announcement , this is an important step in its development. The launch began with the creation of the genesis blocks in the network. The initial phase of the mainnet focuses on staking and governance. This sets up a decentralized network driven by its community. Namada Committed to a User-driven Ecosystem Namada is giving away its native tokens, NAM, through an airdrop to eligible wallets as part of its launch. Recipients can immediately use these tokens to stake and participate in governance decisions. This focus on staking and governance shows Namada’s commitment to a user-driven ecosystem. Notably, the rollout will happen in five phases. Token transferability will start in the fifth phase, which is expected to begin in the next few months. This will only happen once the Namada community is confident of its network. Meanwhile, Namada focuses on privacy by using advanced cryptographic methods to protect transaction details. At the same time, it ensures transparency in governance. IOTA Foundation Revamps Mainnet With Move Transition The IOTA Foundation unveiled IOTA Rebased recently , an ambitious upgrade proposal to revolutionize its blockchain network. IOTA Rebased proposes a complete overhaul of the network’s Layer-1 protocol by switching to a Move-based object ledger. Interestingly, this move makes IOTA the first Layer1 blockchain to adopt the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM). This transition opens the doors to programmability at the core layer, enabling developers to create Decentralized Applications (DApps). This transformative upgrade also positions IOTA alongside prominent MoveVM-powered blockchains like Sui and Aptos. Meanwhile, the Move programming language will be added to the architecture, allowing smart contracts to run directly on the Layer 1 ledger. Celo Network Moves to Become Ethereum Layer 2 Recall that last year, cLabs, the Celo blockchain’s core developer, presented an ambitious plan to transform its Layer 1 network into a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum . As revealed, the cLabs proposal outlines a future version of Celo based on a Layer 2 roll-up model. In this model, Celo will leverage Ethereum’s mainnet for security by publishing security proofs. By doing so, Celo can benefit from the robust security guarantees offered by Ethereum, ensuring a higher level of protection than what Celo’s independent infrastructure currently provides.

Toncoin’s recent updates have sparked debates about its scalability compared to Ethereum and Solana, while Stellar’s climb toward a 60% surge has everyone watching. But here comes Qubetics, a game-changer in the presale arena, solving real-world issues that have plagued blockchain technologies for years. With over $4.2 million raised in its presale and over 261 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s becoming the talk of the town. In a market overflowing with innovation, Qubetics stands apart. Why? Its revolutionary QubeQode IDE aims to make blockchain accessible, tackling the very problems of complexity and scalability that many users face daily. Let’s dive deeper into these projects and see what makes Qubetics the best ongoing presale to buy now. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain’s Future Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a movement aimed at solving blockchain’s core issues. With its QubeQode IDE , the project is creating a user-friendly ecosystem that anyone—yes, anyone—can navigate. Think about it: how many times have you heard complaints about blockchain’s complexity driving users away? Qubetics addresses this head-on. Blockchain has long been plagued by unintuitive interfaces and limited transaction scalability. These problems make it harder for new users to dive in and for businesses to rely on the technology. QubeQode IDE simplifies blockchain app development, offering tools that reduce complexity and increase accessibility. It’s designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that transaction processing isn’t a bottleneck, even during peak usage. Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with a current token price of $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.2 million, selling more than 261 million $TICS tokens to over 5,900 holders. These figures show strong community trust and investor interest. Analysts predict that the $TICS token’s value could soar post-launch, making it the best ongoing presale to buy now. FOMO kicking in yet? Unlike its competitors, Qubetics doesn’t just patch problems—it reimagines blockchain technology. By making it accessible and scalable, it’s paving the way for mainstream adoption. Imagine a world where developing blockchain apps is as simple as using a smartphone. That’s the future Qubetics is building. Learn more by watching this video . Toncoin: A Rising Star with Room to Shine Toncoin’s recent performance has been impressive. Analysts are debating whether it might outperform Ethereum or Solana in December. Its robust ecosystem, powered by The Open Network, is gaining traction for its speed and decentralised structure. This makes it a go-to for users craving efficiency in transaction processing. But does it have what it takes to revolutionise blockchain accessibility? According to recent forecasts, Toncoin could double in value by year’s end. The coin’s recent upgrades aim to tackle network congestion and scalability issues, bringing it closer to Ethereum’s dominance. However, its complex ecosystem might still pose challenges for newcomers. Crypto experts warn that while Toncoin offers solutions, it’s not foolproof. The learning curve is steep, and its tools are far from intuitive for first-time users. Toncoin’s growth is exciting, but accessibility remains a significant barrier. As it evolves, its ability to onboard everyday users will determine its long-term success. That’s where it could learn a thing or two from Qubetics’ focus on user-friendly tools. Stellar: Aiming for the Stars with Bold Moves Stellar is no stranger to the limelight. Its mission to simplify cross-border payments has won over institutions and investors alike. Recent predictions suggest a 60% jump in its value, driven by its unique position in enabling fast, cost-effective global transactions. With XRP nearing a $2 milestone, Stellar’s competition in this space is heating up. But here’s the rub: Stellar’s infrastructure, while efficient, doesn’t completely erase the hurdles faced by mainstream users. Technical complexities and a lack of streamlined interfaces make it challenging for those new to crypto. Its scalability also has room for improvement, as transaction volumes increase with adoption. Despite these limitations, Stellar’s potential remains undeniable. Its partnerships with financial institutions and a focus on solving real-world payment issues give it an edge. Still, it’s clear that blockchain needs a simpler, more accessible solution—something Qubetics promises to deliver. Conclusion: Where Does the Smart Money Go? Toncoin and Stellar are undoubtedly making waves, with Toncoin’s potential doubling and Stellar’s steady climb. But both projects struggle with accessibility and scalability issues that hinder widespread adoption. They’re excellent investments for seasoned crypto enthusiasts but might leave newcomers scratching their heads. Enter Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE, it’s solving the very problems that others overlook. Its presale success, intuitive tools, and focus on scalability make it a top contender for anyone looking to invest in blockchain’s future. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale and grab your $TICS tokens before it’s too late. Don’t miss out on the best ongoing presale to buy now!

While the bug bounty program with HackerOne is not a novel idea, the large sum attached to the announcement certainly drew a lot of attention worldwide. Crypto.com announced the daring cybersecurity initiative in a blog posted on its website and shared via social media. It is offering hackers the substantial reward of $2M to test the strength of its security system. The company has an ongoing partnership with HackerOne and this cybersecurity program is a part of that partnership. The exchange said it execs the campaign to help bolster security and maintain the trust of its almost 100 million customers. Crypto.com raises the stakes The $2M incentive on offer is one of the largest of its kind in the cryptocurrency sector. Crypto.com confirmed that it is an exercise to prove the importance of proactively safeguarding digital assets in its custody, especially in the cryptocurrency space where cyber threats are surplus. With this program, Crypto.com hopes participants may help identify vulnerabilities and resolve potential risks before they are found and exploited by the wrong people. The company joins other crypto platforms that have put out bug bounties to bolster their defenses against cyber threats. “When you operate a global app serving more than 100 million customers, finding critical security gaps before bad actors do is essential to system integrity and customer trust,” Kara Sprague, CEO of HackerOne said. She went on to say that Crypto.com’s “record breaking bounty” reflects the company’s emphasis on “consumer protection and their appreciation of the value the ethical hacking community can provide.” Strategic bets in the cryptocurrency space Other companies such as Uniswap, Atomic Wallet, Facebook and even Google consistently run bug bounty programs to quickly identify critical gaps in their security before they pose a problem. In late November, Uniswap launched the largest bug bounty in DeFi history, offering a whopping $15.5M reward to hackers who could identify weaknesses in its v4 smart contracts ahead of their deployment. The project’s UNI token has taken off on a parabolic trajectory since it announced the campaign. The crypto space has been rocked by significant cases of hacks on both decentralized protocols and centralized exchanges . Affected entities have had varying degrees of success in recouping and reimbursing stolen funds to affected users. The WazirX and XT.com exchange hacks were major hacks that affected centralized exchanges running on similar business models as Crypto.com this year alone. Crypto.com is not waiting to record losses before making its move. The Chief Information Security Officer of Crypto.com, Jason Lau, stated, “We have always respected and partnered with the ethical hacking community as an extension of our security team. Deepening our relationship with HackerOne through this milestone and setting this landmark bounty underscores our commitment to enhancing safeguards and consumer protection. We look forward to continuing to productively engage with this community.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Crypto.Com|Uniswap|WazirX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-03 23:33:48

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 00:05:00

Edwards posits that Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 could be the catalyst for an unprecedented price acceleration. He suggests that once this psychological and technical barrier is breached, Bitcoin could potentially double in value within weeks. Drawing parallels with gold’s recent performance, Edwards stated, “If you look at gold this year, it went up 33% in 16 weeks—that’s a $3.8 trillion move in a really old asset. For Bitcoin to go from $100K to $200K, that’s just $2 trillion on an asset that trades 24/7 and is more accessible globally.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin’s relatively smaller market capitalization compared to gold allows for more rapid price movements. Historically, after surpassing previous all-time highs, Bitcoin has experienced significant and swift appreciations, entering periods of price discovery where supply constraints can lead to vertical price increases. When Will Bitcoin Price Double? The $100,000 mark is not just a round number; it represents a significant resistance level due to several factors. Edwards highlighted the presence of a substantial sell wall at this price point, noting, “We have the biggest sell wall we’ve ever seen in the order books for Bitcoin at $100,00. I think just yeah once that’s cleared out, that’s when you know everyone who wanted to sell has sold and you have these really sharp rapid vertical price appreciation moves because there’s just no more supply left.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday Additionally, many investors who entered the market at lower prices may view $100,000 as an optimal point to realize profits, potentially creating selling pressure. However, Edwards remains optimistic that this barrier will be surpassed, especially within the next few months, given the seasonal strength observed in Bitcoin’s price movements during Q4 and Q1. “We are [at a point] in the cycle where we are seasonal and this is kind of like the optimal two to four month period, maybe a five to six month period every four years. After each Halving every four years, you have about 12 to 18 months where you get 90% to 95% of all the cycles returns out of every four years. So most of it happens in that one year alone. If you look at Q4 and Q1 that again is the majority of the returns […] once you have a strong monthly breakout above all time,” the hedge fund CEO stated. While Edwards is bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects, he cautions investors about the inherent volatility of the market. He pointed out that corrections of 20% to 30% are normal during bull markets and that investors should be prepared for such fluctuations. “It’s normal to have 30% drawdowns every few months in a Bitcoin bull market,” he noted. Factors such as increasing leverage in the market could exacerbate price swings. Edwards mentioned that if leverage and funding rates continue to rise without chipping away at the existing sell wall, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels, potentially around $80,000. However, he emphasizes that such volatility is a natural part of Bitcoin’s growth cycle and not necessarily indicative of a long-term downturn. The End Of The Traditional 4-Year Cycle? A significant point of discussion was whether the traditional 4-year cycle, largely driven by the halving events, is reaching its conclusion. Edwards believes that as Bitcoin matures and integrates more deeply with traditional financial systems, the impact of the halving on market cycles will diminish. “As Bitcoin’s inflation rate decreases and it becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the four-year halving cycles may become less impactful. The large 80% drawdowns we’ve seen in the past might not happen in future cycles,” he stated. This maturation process could lead to more stable growth patterns and reduced volatility. Edwards suggests that future cycles may see shallower corrections, possibly around 60% rather than the dramatic declines of previous years. Related Reading: Data Shows Selling Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin: Is The Bull Run at Risk? Notably, several potential catalysts could propel Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented levels. Edwards mentioned the possibility of the US government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President-elect Donald Trump. While he estimates the probability of this occurring in 2025 to be around 30%, he acknowledges that such an event would be a game-changer. “Assuming [the U.S. government] doesn’t sell their existing holdings is great, but it’s probably not going to help the cycle a lot. Actively buying Bitcoin could be a game-changer,” he remarked. Corporate adoption is another significant factor. The potential for major corporations to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets could drive substantial demand. Edwards highlighted the upcoming vote by Microsoft on this matter, saying, “Let’s hope it’s Microsoft [on December 10].” Furthermore, the success of spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has opened the doors for institutional investors. The sustained demand from ETFs has been absorbing Bitcoin supply steadily. Edwards observed, “The ETFs have just been sucking Bitcoin out of the system ferociously.” Bitcoin Price Predictions Edwards provided a base and an optimistic scenario for the Bitcoin price in this cycle. He stated, “I’d be surprised if we don’t get to $140,000.” This base case assumes steady market conditions without any extraordinary positive events. In a more optimistic scenario, he believes Bitcoin could reach $200,000, especially if significant catalysts, such as government or corporate adoption, materialize. “We could easily get to $200,000. Once we clear those all-time highs, Bitcoin does multiples very quickly,” he explained. He concluded: “”Once we’re above $100,000, people who aren’t in Bitcoin just cannot comprehend Bitcoin above $100,000 […] That’s when you see the real switch flick and the flows happen.” At press time, BTC traded at $94,814.

Table of Contents PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong The next ERC-20 to blow up will most likely be DTX Memecoins and market mood The meme coin madness is back, and everyone is getting excited again. In the spotlight, we have these meme coins as leaders, Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), two original meme coins that are definitely back with big rallies. While these household names still dominate the meme coin space, investors and analysts are discussing a new ERC-20 token that could be the next big winner. PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong Pepe , the Ethereum-based token that pays homage to the internet’s favorite Pepe the Frog, has been on a tear lately. PEPE is up 131% in the last month, driven by retail interest and whale activity. A significant development that got everyone’s attention was the withdrawal of 150 billion PEPE tokens worth nearly $3 million from Binance by one wallet. This enormous transfer initially caused some uncertainty, but many see it as a sign of growing confidence in PEPE’s long term. The coin’s recent move is a testament to its popularity among retail investors, thanks to its community-driven and viral nature. Not far behind, Shiba Inu is solidifying its position as a meme coin leader. SHIB has gone beyond its meme roots by adding DeFi applications, NFTs, and governance features to its ecosystem. These have kept the token relevant and attracted a loyal user and investor base. Despite its huge supply, SHIB has held up in price, with early 2025 projections of $0.0000093. SHIB’s ability to innovate while riding its existing popularity makes it a good option for long-term holders and speculators.

It has just hit $9.2 million in presale, and investors are showing big interest. DTX just entered its sixth round, and the price has been raised to $0.12. Early investors are already seeing significant gains of 500% because the initial price when DTX started was $0.02. DTX Exchange is launching its First Hybrid Leaderboard, which will combine the best centralized and decentralized exchanges to bring transparency and gamification to trading. Experts are predicting big growth for DTX Exchange . Some analysts say it could hit $4.5 by February 2025, a 4,500% gain for early investors. Now, rumors of a Binance listing in 2025 are surfacing, which could make it even bigger. With its upcoming Hybrid Leaderboard and strong community, DTX will be a significant player in the crypto space. Memecoins and market mood The comeback of PEPE and SHIB is a sign of the overall market’s risk appetite. These tokens, often criticized for having no intrinsic value, live on community, social media, and market sentiment. Remember, meme coins are highly volatile. They can give users huge short-term gains but also big losses. Analysts advise traders not to overexpose to this speculative asset class and to diversify their portfolio. The meme coin rally signifies a lively and exciting crypto market. Social media and community narratives will continue to shape the path of Pepe, Shiba Inu, and the new DTX Exchange token. As the anticipation grows, the market is waiting for meme coins to blow up. Whether it’s a token based on a new internet meme or a project using new tech, one thing is certain: the meme coin space is a wild west in crypto.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 518,000 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche witnessed a strong November. “Avalanche performed a historically bullish monthly close above the light blue level of $38.57. Any dips [below $38.57] in the future would be a retest attempt, in a very similar fashion to the retests from Sept 2021 and March 2024 (green/orange circles).” Source: Rekt Capital/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AVAX tends to rally after retesting $38.57 as support. Avalanche is trading at $51.14 at time of writing, up over 12% in the past day. Next up is Polkadot. The widely followed analyst says the 17th-largest crypto asset by market cap also recorded a “bullish monthly close” to reach a level last witnessed in April. “DOT is also showing very early signs of retesting this level [at around $8.61] into new support. DOT needs to continue doing this to enable further upside. Price stability at $8.61 = crucial.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Polkadot is trading at $10.24 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. As for Dogecoin, Rekt Capital notes the flagship memecoin has broken out from the upper boundary of an ascending triangle pattern that had formed on the daily time frame. In technical analysis, an ascending triangle breakout is considered bullish. “Any dips into the top of the pattern [at around the $0.43 level], if needed, would constitute a post-breakout retest to confirm the breakout.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.421.

From quirky beginnings as internet jokes to skyrocketing investment opportunities, these coins have flipped the script on what a cryptocurrency can be. As 2024 wraps up, the race is on to spot the next big winner in this meme-powered gold rush. Standing out in this vibrant landscape is BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a fresh contender with explosive potential and innovative features. But the fun doesn’t stop there. Turbo, Memecoin, and Baby Doge Coin are also heating up the charts, each with its unique charm and promise of massive returns. Let’s dive into the best meme coin presales with 100x potential and see why these picks are turning heads. 1. BTFD Coin If you’re hunting for the best meme coin presales with 100x potential, BTFD Coin should be at the top of your list. Launched on November 26, 2024, it entered the market with a price of $0.000004 per coin. In just one week, it’s surged to $0.000058 in its sixth presale stage, raising over $700,000 and selling more than 18 billion coins. These numbers aren’t just impressive—they’re game-changing. BTFD’s appeal goes beyond its numbers. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, BTFD Bull Run, lets users earn tokens through interactive challenges. It’s fun, engaging, and, most importantly, profitable. Add to this a staking program with a staggering 90% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) , and you’ve got a coin that’s catering to gamers, casual investors, and hardcore crypto enthusiasts alike. The backbone of BTFD’s momentum is its community, the “Bulls Squad.” With over 1,700 members rallying behind the coin, it’s more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement. Why did this coin make it to this list? BTFD Coin’s presale performance and long-term potential are unmatched. A $4,800 investment at the current presale price could turn into $49,655 when the coin hits its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. If you missed Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, this could be your second chance. 2. Turbo Turbo isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a race car in crypto form. Born out of a joke about speed and flash, Turbo has quickly gained a loyal following among adrenaline junkies and meme enthusiasts alike. With a clever marketing campaign that blends humour with high-octane imagery, Turbo has carved out a unique niche in the meme coin space. But this isn’t just a gimmick. Turbo’s developers have incorporated a dynamic transaction fee system that adjusts based on trading volume. This mechanism not only discourages pump-and-dump schemes but also rewards long-term holders with passive gains. Its upcoming NFT collection, “TurboCharged,” promises to blend the worlds of gaming and digital art, making it a coin that’s as versatile as it is entertaining. Why did this coin make it to this list? Turbo’s combination of humour, innovation, and community focus makes it one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. Its clever approach to tokenomics and strong branding set it apart in a crowded market. 3. Memecoin Sometimes, simplicity is genius. Memecoin doesn’t try to overcomplicate things—it’s a coin that’s all about memes, pure and simple. This straightforward approach has struck a chord with investors who are tired of overhyped promises and just want to have fun. Memecoin’s charm lies in its transparency. The developers have committed to a no-nonsense roadmap, focusing on community growth and steady price appreciation. With regular “Meme Wars” on social media, the coin has created an interactive platform for its users, making the investment experience as entertaining as it is rewarding. Why did this coin make it to this list? Memecoin is proof that you don’t need complex features to succeed in the meme coin market. Its community-first approach and consistent growth make it a strong contender among the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. 4. Baby Doge Coin Baby Doge Coin has been riding the coattails of its older sibling, Dogecoin, but it’s quickly making a name for itself. Launched as a “cuter and faster” alternative, Baby Doge has captured the hearts of investors with its playful branding and impressive growth metrics. The coin uses a deflationary model, which burns tokens with every transaction, reducing supply and driving up demand. This approach has proven effective, with Baby Doge seeing a 300% increase in its market cap over the past three months. Its charitable initiatives, which include donations to animal shelters, add an extra layer of appeal for socially conscious investors. Why did this coin make it to this list? Baby Doge Coin’s rapid growth, combined with its unique blend of humour and heart, makes it one of the best meme coin presales with 100x potential. It’s a feel-good investment with serious upside. Conclusion The meme coin market is brimming with opportunities, but not all coins are created equal. BTFD Coin stands out for its explosive presale growth, innovative features, and strong community backing. Turbo’s high-octane branding and smart tokenomics make it a unique entry, while Memecoin’s simplicity and community focus prove that sometimes less is more. Baby Doge Coin, with its deflationary model and charitable initiatives, rounds out the list as a coin that’s as heartwarming as it is profitable. If you’re ready to dive into the world of meme coins, now’s the time. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and take your first step towards potentially life-changing returns.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 01:27:00

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Pal acknowledged the accuracy of XRP enthusiasts’ predictions, admitting his skepticism had been misplaced. Addressing his teeming followers, Pal referred to the XRP supporters as “XRP Jedi Warriors,” recognizing their steadfast belief in the cryptocurrency’s potential. He admitted, “You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth.” Pal also highlighted the community’s challenges, remarking that they had “walked through hell to get here.” The financial expert also recalled the hardships endured during the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. This legal action led to XRP being delisted from prominent exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance US, and Bitstamp. While trading was suspended, users could still hold, deposit, and withdraw XRP. Pal noted that he retained some XRP during that turbulent period, describing it as the “delisting times.” Dear $XRP Jedi Warriors… You were right, I was wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth I just want everyone to make $$ and you guys have walked through hell to get here. I still own some XRP from the delisting but you guys/girls deserve everything. — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) December 1, 2024 Earlier in the year, Pal had criticized XRP and ADA, suggesting they had become “cults” and advising investors to avoid them. However, the recent market developments compelled him to revise his stance, particularly as XRP’s price climbed past $1 and then surged to over $2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Unlocks One Billion XRP Amid Market Rally The price rally coincided with a significant transaction by Ripple. Data from Whale Alert, a platform that tracks large cryptocurrency transfers, revealed that Ripple released one billion XRP tokens from escrow on December 1. At the current market value, this amounted to over $2 billion. XRP’s remarkable performance has been particularly notable since November 24, when the token traded above $1. Since then, XRP has experienced an impressive 84.78% increase, reaching $2.73 at the time of writing. The rally solidified XRP’s position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a spot it had not held in years. The timing of Ripple’s escrow release, coupled with XRP’s price surge, has sparked interest among market analysts and the broader crypto community. This significant development comes as Ripple continues to expand its presence in global payment solutions and reinforces the resilience of XRP supporters despite past challenges. A Shift in Perception Pal’s acknowledgment marks a turning point in his view of XRP, signaling broader recognition of the cryptocurrency’s potential. As the market evolves, dedicated communities like XRP’s remain a testament to the influence of collective conviction in the crypto landscape.

37190958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=621892,1733275743,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37190958.jpeg,Bitcoin mining proposed as a solution to UK wind energy waste,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-mining-solution-uk-wind-energy-waste/,"CEO and Chairman of Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital, Fred Thiel, has called for grid operators and renewable asset owners to use Bitcoin mining to manage grid congestion due to excess energy. Thiel expressed this view in response to a recent report about excess energy being wasted by wind farms in the UK. According to Bloomberg ‘s report, the UK is paying £1 billion ($1.3 billion) in congestion costs to wind farms to turn off their operations because the grid cannot handle the excess output from the wind farms. According to reports, the UK has significantly increased its wind power generation capacity over the last few years, with its offshore wind fleet now up by 50% over the last five years and projected to double in the next five. Despite the massive increase in capacity meant to increase Britain’s reliance on renewable energy, its grid capacity has not expanded to match this supply. This has led to congestion issues, forcing the utility provider to pay some plants to turn off while paying others to turn on. Interestingly, the shutoff of wind farms, usually offshore and far away from cities, has invariably led to the turning on of gas plants closer to the demand centers. This is not the first time the UK operator will pay congestion costs, with the 1 billion this year even below the amount it paid in 2022. Experts say Bitcoin mining with excess energy will prevent waste Meanwhile, Thiel has criticized the energy waste and congestion costs, noting that Bitcoin mining could solve this problem. According to Thiel, adding Bitcoin mining is one of the ways to make renewable energy more economically viable. He observed that the IEA estimates that it would cost over $26 trillion to upgrade the grid for renewable energy transition by 2050, and consumers will be the ones to foot all these costs. However, Bitcoin mining could reduce the economic burden on these rate-payers. He said : “Grid operators and renewable asset owners must realize that adding large despatchable loads such as #bitcoin mining behind the meter at renewable energy sites is the only way to eliminate grid congestion and wasted energy.” The mining executive added that Marathon Digital optimally monetized its energy through Bitcoin mining. Marathon is one of the leading publicly listed mining companies and recently acquired Bitcoin using proceeds from convertible notes. Meanwhile, VanEck of digital assets research Matthew Sigel also criticized what he termed a “waste of power,” noting that all the excess energy could be used to mine Bitcoin. Bitcoin mining gains adoption for managing grid capacity Despite UK energy providers’ failure to consider Bitcoin mining for managing grid congestion, many other entities are exploring it for that purpose. In Switzerland, the Bern region recently approved a proposal to evaluate how Bitcoin mining can stabilize the power grid by utilizing surplus energy. The Grand Council of Bern , the region’s parliament, voted 85 – 46 on the proposal, confirming the broad support for the idea within the region. With the approval, the government will now assess whether to integrate Bitcoin mining into its energy strategy. Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom is also piloting a Bitcoin mining scheme in Germany focused on using surplus renewable energy to power Bitcoin mining operations. The pilot program intends to lay the groundwork for the large-scale implementation of Bitcoin mining for load balancing within the energy grid.

The company released some of its local and international employees, affecting several teams, including the ASIC repair and hardware teams. The mining pool operations, firmware team, and self-mining department remained partially intact. Familiar sources state that the company’s move to lay off staff is strategic as it aims to improve the main revenue streams. The digital currency group shareholder letter points to Foundry’s race to earn $80 million in revenue from its self-mining business for 2024. Foundry BTC mining pool accounts for 30% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate Foundry boasts of several business lines. One of its most significant lines is the mining pool, which accounts for 30% of the network’s total hashrate . The firm has always been the pool of choice for institutional-scale and public Bitcoin mining firms incorporated in the US. Foundry’s other significant business lines include self-mining, custom hardware, decentralized AI infrastructure, ASIC repairs, firmware, and site operations across other Bitcoin mining and general compute verticals. It launched some revenue streams in 2022 after Genesis, a subsidiary of their shared parent company, Digital Currency Group, collapsed. While most departments were affected by the layoffs, the firm’s site operations, which control and oversee Bitcoin mining firms, remain in place. There are speculations that Foundry is planning to sell, but only time will prove this. DCG restructures by moving Foundry employees to Yuma and resolving Genesis disputes Foundry had moved nearly 20 workers to Yuma, a new subsidiary under Digital Currency Group (DCG). Yuma, a decentralized AI startup, has roots in Foundry and is supported by investments through Foundry’s AI-focused division, Bittensor . The startup is run in an acting capacity by Barry Silbert, the DCG CEO. The Foundry was registered in 2017 under the wings of DCG and has often given more competitive mining pool fee rates. Its offers are always enticing, sometimes extending 0% fees to its most prominent clients. Around 2020 and 2021, the firm introduced ASIC-backed loans. These layoffs are a strategy for the DCG to repair its shredded empire. Genesis, which was DCG pride, went bankrupt after FTX’s implosion. Following the bankruptcy period, DCG spent vast dollars to help Genesis pay its creditors. However, Genesis initiated a legal dispute, claiming that DCG owed its creditors around a $1.7 billion loan. The legal dispute was solved in August, with DCG committing to pay Genesis $324.5 million in cash and $158 million in cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum’s $333M ETF Inflows and Monero’s Privacy Edge Lead Crypto Headlines",https://timestabloid.com/qubetics-presale-phase-11-unlock-52912-roi-potential-ethereums/,"What’s new in the crypto world? Ethereum has seen a surge in institutional interest, with ETF inflows reaching $333 million, fuelling optimism for decentralised finance. On the other hand, Monero is making waves with its focus on privacy but is facing potential regulatory challenges in Brazil. The crypto world keeps proving it’s never short on excitement or surprises. Amid these developments, a fresh contender is shaking things up: Qubetics ($TICS) . Unlike others, Qubetics aims to solve interoperability issues that hinder blockchain growth. Its ongoing presale offers a chance to invest early in what could be a transformative Web3 project, with potential returns of up to 52,912%. Qubetics Is Unlocking Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics is setting itself apart by tackling a major pain point: interoperability. Many blockchains operate in isolation, making it difficult for users and businesses to transfer assets or share data across networks. Qubetics solves this by functioning as a Web3 aggregator , uniting major blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana. This seamless interaction unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies. Picture a logistics company using multiple blockchain networks to track global shipments. Before Qubetics, transferring shipment data between these chains was complicated and inefficient. With Qubetics’ interoperability features, the company can streamline its operations, improving accuracy and reducing costs. Similarly, individual investors who manage assets on different chains can unify them in one system, saving time and hassle. Currently, the Qubetics presale is in its 11th stage, with over 261 million $TICS tokens sold to 5,900+ holders, raising more than $4.2 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282, with a 10% price increase expected in the next stage. Here’s what analysts predict: $TICS at $0.25 by the presale’s end offers a 783% ROI. $TICS at $1 post-presale yields 3,434%. $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch projects a staggering 52,912% ROI. For example, a $5700 investment at $0.0282 could grow to over $3,000,000. These numbers show why investors are eyeing Qubetics as one of the best cryptos to buy this week. If you want more information about this project, you can watch this video . Ethereum Gains Traction with Institutional Investors Ethereum remains a dominant force in the crypto space. Recent reports highlight $333 million in inflows into Ethereum ETFs, showcasing growing interest from institutional investors. Experts attribute this to renewed optimism around decentralised finance and the upcoming regulatory clarity in the United States. Ethereum has also seen a significant increase in DeFi activity, with total value locked (TVL) surging 12% over the past month to $50 billion. Despite a minor price dip of 3%, Ethereum remains a favourite among investors. Over the last month, it gained 30%, and analysts believe that another bull run like 2021 could send Ethereum to new heights. For long-term holders, Ethereum’s utility in DeFi and its scalability improvements with Ethereum 2.0 make it one of the best cryptos to buy this week. Monero Fights for Privacy in a Changing Regulatory Climate Monero (XMR) is known as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy. Its ability to mask transaction details has made it popular, but it’s also attracted regulatory challenges. Recently, Brazil’s Central Bank proposed a ban on privacy coins like Monero. Despite this, Monero has been holding steady, trading at $166.74. It saw a daily high of $169.03 and a low of $160.52. However, Monero faces an uphill battle to gain mainstream acceptance due to increased regulatory scrutiny. For those prioritising anonymity, Monero remains unmatched. Its consistent performance and dedicated community make it a niche but significant player in the crypto market. While regulatory hurdles persist, Monero’s focus on privacy ensures its relevance, especially for users looking for secure, anonymous transactions. Conclusion Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics shines with its interoperability and presale potential, offering real-world solutions that many investors find compelling. Ethereum’s DeFi growth and institutional backing keep it at the forefront, while Monero’s privacy features cater to those prioritising anonymity. For those looking to diversify their portfolios with the best cryptos to buy this week, Qubetics offers an exciting opportunity to capitalise on its presale and long-term growth.

With so many options, finding the best altcoin to invest today can feel overwhelming. Cardano is refining its blockchain with new governance features, Immutable X is reshaping NFT gaming, and Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with a groundbreaking Web3 aggregated chain. While each has its strengths, Qubetics is carving out a unique path by tackling real-world problems head-on. Unlike earlier projects, Qubetics is redefining how blockchains interact, ensuring seamless communication between networks like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Its ongoing presale is grabbing attention, with over 260 million $TICS tokens sold already. Let’s dive into what sets these three projects apart and why Qubetics could be the standout choice for the future. Qubetics Leading Blockchain Interoperability: A Unified Approach with Web3 Aggregated Chain One of the biggest hurdles in blockchain today is the lack of compatibility between networks, leaving businesses and developers struggling to connect various platforms. Qubetics ($TICS) solves this issue with its Web3 aggregated chain , integrating EVM, Wasm, and Bitcoin chains into a seamless and unified ecosystem. This breakthrough enhances interoperability, allowing different blockchains to communicate effortlessly. For example, a healthcare company can securely share patient data across blockchains like Ethereum and Solana without compatibility barriers. Similarly, financial institutions can optimise cross-border settlements using Qubetics’ integrated framework, avoiding the inefficiencies of siloed systems. This integration unlocks new opportunities for businesses and developers while driving adoption of decentralised technologies. By focusing on interoperability, Qubetics isn’t just connecting chains; it’s creating a collaborative environment for innovation. Presale Performance That Grabs Attention The $TICS presale is in its 11th stage, with over 261 million tokens sold to more than 5,900 holders, raising $4.2 million. At $0.0282 per token, this stage offers significant potential, with a 10% price surge expected soon. Analysts anticipate extraordinary returns for Qubetics ($TICS). By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to reach $0.25, offering a 783% ROI. Post-presale, predictions place its value at $1 (3,434% ROI) and $5 (17,571% ROI), with a remarkable $15 forecasted after the mainnet launch, equating to an astonishing 52,912% ROI. For instance, an investment of $9,800 at the current price of $0.0282 could potentially grow to $87,238 at $0.25, $336,860 at $1, and an incredible $5,178,960 if $TICS reaches $15. If you’re considering joining this promising project, watch this video or visit the Qubetics website for more details. Cardano’s Latest Updates and Goals Cardano is no stranger to the spotlight. The project has been gaining attention due to its impressive 213% monthly price increase, with analysts predicting a future value of $10 for ADA. These gains reflect its growing adoption and strong technical fundamentals. Its focus on decentralisation and governance is evident with its upcoming “Voltaire” upgrade, which aims to bring user-powered decision-making into the network. However, regulatory concerns persist. The SEC’s lawsuit against Binance, which also implicated ADA as a security, raised red flags in 2023, leading to price volatility. Immutable X Revolutionising NFT Gaming Immutable X continues to position itself as a leader in the NFT gaming sector. With partnerships like the one with GameStop to launch an NFT marketplace , the platform is delivering efficient and scalable solutions for gaming enthusiasts. Additionally, its Golden Guardians Survivor NFT collection has been making waves in the crypto community. Yet, recent challenges, such as compromised social media accounts, have underlined the importance of robust security measures. Final Thoughts Cardano and Immutable X are pushing boundaries in governance and gaming, but Qubetics is carving a niche with its interoperability solutions. The ongoing $TICS presale offers a unique opportunity for those looking to invest in a forward-thinking project with significant ROI potential. As always, explore your options and research before making investment decisions.

The price hit a range high of $2.82 before hitting a reverse. However, over the last day, the price has broken through significant resistance levels, first surpassing the $2 mark and then pushing above the $2.50 level. Now, the focus is on the $2.75 to $3 range. The $3 level is particularly important, as it marks a major resistance area on the chart. Once XRP breaks through this level, the next target is the all-time high around $3.30, which is becoming increasingly likely given the current price action. Short-Term Price Action However, if the price experiences any short-term pullbacks, key support levels should come into play. For instance, if there’s a dip, the altcoin can expect strong support at the $2.50 level, as this was a previous resistance point. XRP has been showing repeated patterns of brief pullbacks followed by upward movement, similar to what we’ve seen in the past. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, if the price continues to fall further, $2 is another level to watch, as it could act as a strong area of support as well. These support zones are crucial to monitor, as any dips toward these levels could present buying opportunities for those looking to enter or add to their positions. Looking at the Bigger Picture From a larger time frame perspective, the bullish trend remains intact, and we’re getting closer to an all-time high breakout. While short-term pullbacks and volatility are common in any bull market, it’s important not to be discouraged by these movements. The bigger picture for XRP remains bullish, and the potential for new all-time highs is on the horizon. So, even if there are some minor retracements or short-term corrections, the long-term outlook remains positive.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 01:59:26

Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle To fully understand XRP’s surge, we must take a step back to its price during the November 5th elections and its value at the start of the year.

Thanks to XRP’s bullish movement, Tether has been dethroned from the top cryptos in terms of market caps. But if you think that Ripple’s XRP momentum is about to end, well – think again. According to Crypto Michael, a market psychologist, the altcoin is still trading below its potential peak, and he expects a bigger “FOMO” frenzy soon.

Today, XRP is trading at around $2.73, consolidating its price above $2.50. Last month, its price was hovering near the $0.60 level just before the elections, reflecting a growth of over 400% in just one month. XRP’s thrilling price rally has attracted considerable attention from holders, traders, market analysts, and psychologists.

Ver, known for his early investments in Bitcoin and advocacy for digital assets, is accused of failing to report $50 million in taxes on Bitcoin transactions valued at $240 million in 2017. Additional charges allege that Ver underrepresented the value of his businesses during his 2014 renunciation of U.S. citizenship to avoid higher exit taxes. Roger Ver Fights Tax Evasion Charges According to FOX Business , Roger Ver is challenging allegations that he evaded paying $50 million in taxes on substantial Bitcoin sales in 2017. Prosecutors claim Ver also underreported the value of two companies he owned, MemoryDealers US and Agilestar, when he expatriated in 2014. Allegedly, the underreporting allowed him to avoid a higher exit tax, a levy imposed on unrealized capital gains for individuals relinquishing U.S. citizenship. Ver’s legal team, comprising attorneys from prominent law firms Steptoe LLP and Kimura London & White, filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. The motion argues that the Justice Department engaged in unconstitutional government overreach and selectively withheld key evidence. It also claims the actions violated Ver’s right to due process. The filing includes correspondence between Ver and his attorneys, indicating his efforts to ensure compliance with crypto tax regulations at the time. Allegations of Government Overreach and Communication Misuse Roger Ver’s legal representatives contend that prosecutors improperly obtained privileged attorney-client communications and used them to build their case. These communications include detailed emails in which Ver sought professional advice to meet his tax obligations, even under ambiguous guidelines. The legal team also claims that the indictment reflects selective enforcement against Roger Ver, a vocal critic of U.S. cryptocurrency regulations . The motion claims crypto tax rules during Ver’s expatriation were unclear, making criminal charges unwarranted. Furthermore, the attorneys assert that the government’s actions violate core constitutional protections for individuals seeking to renounce citizenship. More so, Ver’s defense argue that crypto tax regulations were insufficiently defined at the time of his alleged offenses. The IRS began issuing guidance on virtual assets as property in late 2014, after Ver had renounced his U.S. citizenship. His legal team maintains that Roger Ver relied on attorneys and accountants to comply with all applicable laws. In an email correspondence dated April 2013 and included in the filing, Ver expressed to his lawyer, “I want to make sure that my exit tax payments are as clean as possible, with no room to have trouble from the IRS in the future.” Moreover, emails reveal that Ver’s advisors recommended obtaining third-party appraisals to address the difficulty of valuing Bitcoin accurately, given the low market liquidity in 2014. The defense further argues that any discrepancies were unintentional and do not warrant criminal prosecution. The motion to dismiss is being reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Ver’s attorneys express optimism that the incoming Trump administration, may influence the case’s outcome.

The cryptocurrency’s rapid price increase follows the breakout of a key technical pattern and the formation of a golden cross, both of which suggest further upside potential. With increasing investor optimism and a surge in trading activity, analysts are now eyeing a potential rally that could see BNB’s price climb towards $1,000 in the coming weeks. BNB Price Skyrockets To New ATH The recent rally in BNB price to an all time high is largely attributed to the breakout of an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal chart formation. This pattern, which typically marks the end of a downtrend, was confirmed when BNB broke above the $680-$700 resistance zone. This breakout indicates that the bearish trend that had held BNB’s price down has now ended, and the market is shifting toward a bullish sentiment. The breakout from the inverse head and shoulders pattern has led to a projected price target of $780, with the next key resistance level seen around $800. However, some analysts believe that BNB’s rally could go even further. Ali from @ali_charts, a crypto analyst, has projected a potential move for BNB to $1,630, should the weekly close remain above $662. This projection has sparked interest among traders, who are closely monitoring BNB price performance to assess if it can maintain the current momentum and reach these higher targets. Golden Cross Signals Strengthening Uptrend, Rally To $1000? On the BNB/USD chart, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) has crossed above the 200-day SMA indicating further positive price momentum and the formation of a golden cross on the chart.. This golden cross means that BNB is expected to keep on rising in the short term and in the long term. The fact that 50-day SMA is currently trading above the 200-day SMA supports the view that BNB is still in the early stages of a long term bullish trend. Golden crosses have often preceded major price rises and are a way for many traders to take long positions. Consequently, the market has developed increased confidence that BNB will keep on ascending towards $1000 in the near future. BNB/USD (Source: TradingView) If bears take the control, the $680-$700 range which had provided resistance earlier can now be expected to provide support. This level coincides with the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern and thus any pullback towards this zone will most probably be perceived as a buying opportunity. The first level of resistance for BNB is at $780. If this level is broken the next major resistance is seen at around $800. Such a breakout above $800 can open the doors for more targets including the $1,630 as projected by Ali. Increased Trading Activity Supports Bullish Momentum BNB’s price surge is also backed by a sharp increase in derivative data trading volume and open interest. Volume has risen by 125.30%, reaching $4.42 billion, while open interest has increased by 33.78%, now totaling $1.46 billion. This uptick in volume and open interest is a strong indication that more traders are entering the market, suggesting growing confidence in BNB’s future performance. Source: Coinglass The rise in open interest signals that traders are taking long positions, expecting the price to continue rising. This growing market engagement further supports the view that BNB could experience further upward movement, potentially pushing the price toward Ali’s ambitious $1,630 target.

Today, December 4, 2024, the giant asset manager Grayscale Investments has officially filed for a Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ). Will Solana ETF Get Approval? Under Gary Gensler, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 Bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of 2024 and Ethereum ETFs in mid-2024. Now, after the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the community is eagerly awaiting altcoin ETFs, with Solana appearing to be next in line. However, with the recent growth of the Solana ecosystem and its native token, firms appear to be filing for or hoping to attach ETFs to the token. Grayscale Spot Solana ETF According to Grayscale’s recent filing, the firm believes that turning its existing Solana Trust into a spot SOL Exchange-Traded Product (ETP), similar to its Bitcoin Trust, would provide investors with a safer and more secure way to invest in Solana (SOL). This move would enable trading on a regulated national securities exchange, making access to the cryptocurrency easier and more reliable. The Grayscale Solana Trust is the largest trust of its kind, currently standing out as the leading Solana (SOL) investment fund by assets under management. According to the data, the firm holds an impressive $134.2 million worth of SOL, which represents nearly 0.1% of SOL’s overall circulating supply. However, the crypto community is expecting quicker approval, as Gensler and his team are set to step down in January 2025. A potential approval of the SOL ETF would make it the United States next crypto-product ETF after BTC and ETH.

Grayscale Investments, one of the biggest crypto-product-related asset managers, proposed the Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 03. According to the 19b-4 filings with 112 pages, Grayscale is concerned about the importance of Solana, which is considered one of the biggest cryptocurrency and blockchain companies in the world. “Pursuant to the provisions of Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act” or “’34 Act”)1 and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,2 NYSE Arca, Inc.

The company based in Connecticut, like any other crypto, were actually released the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL) in 2021. If this proposal is accepted, they will be allowed to convert it into Solana spot ETF. This move follows the footsteps of 21Shares, which has already proposed the same product to the commission since June. VanEck, Bitwise, and Canary Capital were also among the earlier asset managers who proposed the product after the success of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) funds this year.

They also noted that the large number of assets in Solana is accounted for by a quarter of the million investors in the United States. If the commission accepts it, Grayscale will be the first Solana ETF issuer to have already managed the asset for the next Solana spot ETF.

Legal Expert Breaks Down Why RLUSD Launch Will Fuel XRP Growth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is preparing to launch a new stablecoin, RLUSD, which is expected to be backed by the U.S. dollar. This new token is anticipated to receive regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) soon. The introduction of RLUSD could give Ripple a new way to offer liquidity to its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) partners, boosting its working capital. The stablecoin, RLUSD, is expected to play a key role in Ripple’s global payment solutions, helping improve liquidity and efficiency for partners using Ripple’s ODL service. The launch is being closely watched by the XRP Army, who are hopeful that this move will further drive the adoption of Ripple’s technology. How Will RLUSD Affect XRP’s Value? There is speculation around how the launch of RLUSD will affect the value of XRP. Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli shared his thoughts, explaining that any increase in the usage of a blockchain network can lead to an increase in the value of its native token. He pointed to the example of Bitcoin, where the network’s value is driven by its usage, scarcity, and resistance to censorship. Rispoli said that the value of a blockchain is tied to its adoption and use, not just the supply cap, noting that increased network activity generally results in higher token value. When asked for further clarification on why using the XRPL (Ripple’s ledger) would increase XRP’s value, Rispoli explained that the value of Bitcoin rises due to its use as a scarce and secure form of money. He also said that while the total supply of both Bitcoin and XRP could theoretically be changed in the future, the focus should remain on how the networks are used and the value that usage brings to the ecosystem.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-04 02:19:20

Roger Ver, who was arrested in Barcelona in April 2024, has now filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. He was indicted on eight counts by the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California for evading over $48 million in taxes, reports FOX Business . The charges followed after the former CEO of Bitcoin.com underreported his Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings and other assets in 2014. Now, his lawyers argue that the indictment was influenced by government bias. Ver’s motion to dismiss: Claims of attorney-client privilege violations Ver’s attorneys claim that the Department of Justice inappropriately accessed confidential attorney-client communications and did not reveal key evidence to the grand jury. Ver claims he did what any reasonable person would do, following professional advice based on the limited regulatory guidance available at the time regarding cryptocurrencies.

Furthermore, the defense team states that only after Ver’s move to Spain did the IRS start to issue clear directions on crypto-taxes. Only then could a fair market valuation for his Bitcoin holdings be applied, which was difficult to determine due to the asset’s low liquidity and high volatility at the time. The indictment, which was unsealed earlier this year by the U.S Department of Justice, reads , “ The indictment..alleges that by June 2017, Ver’s two companies continued to own approximately 70,000 bitcoins. He was also allegedly required to pay a tax – referred to as an “exit tax” – on those capital gains. By Feb. 4, 2014, Ver and his companies allegedly owned approximately 131,000 bitcoins that traded on several large exchanges for around $871 each. MemoryDealers and Agilestar allegedly held approximately 73,000 of those bitcoins.” The case has attracted a lot of attention from the crypto community, with many condemning the U.S. DOJ for its enforcement-first approach to digital assets, especially under the Biden government which has faced criticism for its perceived ‘ anti-crypto ‘ stance. Critics like Robert Barnes , a civil rights attorney who supports Ver’s case, believe the charges represent selective enforcement. “This is another example of lawfare against the crypto industry, targeting individuals based on political considerations rather than clear evidence of wrongdoing,” said Barnes.

Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 02:55:00
