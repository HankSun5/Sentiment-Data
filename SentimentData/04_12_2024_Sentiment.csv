Donald vs Israel (DONISRA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONISRA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Donald vs Israel can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald vs Israel could become the next viral memecoin. Donald vs Israel launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. To buy Donald vs Israel on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald vs Israel by entering its contract address – CKYA6Q1KcWsSJyXgFKwyNXyTAjHD1dRPKTDD2FTUFryn – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONISRA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-03 22:42:00

With this move, the firm intends to stop accepting Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) for payments. According to the report , the firm said the aim of this change offer a more stable, secure, and reliable payment system. Dtcpay, founded in 2019, is one of the key players in fintech, earning support from major industries like Singapore’s Pontiac Land. The company received a payment license from Singapore’s central bank in 2022. Dtcpay’s shift to stablecoins The shift also comes amid the growing demand for stable, secure, and regulated payment options. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum can have big price changes, which create risks for businesses and users. Stablecoins, which are tied to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer a more predictable and stable alternative for digital transactions. Dtcpay believes this move will make payments safer and easier for everyone. Dtcpay’s decision is part of a larger trend in the fintech industry. A report from Chainalysis shows that stablecoin payments in Singapore reached nearly $1 billion in the second quarter of 2024. Dtcpay will only support certain stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT), Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), First Digital USD (FDUSD), and Worldwide USD (WUSD). These stablecoins are backed by real reserves to keep them at a 1:1 value with the U.S. dollar. FDUSD, launched in June 2023, is now the sixth-largest stablecoin with a market value of $1.9 billion. WUSD, backed by the Worldwide Stablecoin Payment Network, is known for its added security since it is fully backed by reserves. The Singapore firm noted that the new stablecoin-only model aligns with its mission to deliver a “more reliable, scalable, and secure payment experience” for its clients. The platform’s commitment to stability is important in the financial ecosystem. A large part of their transactions is already done with stablecoins. This change also aligns with growing regulations in places like Singapore, where the government is setting clear rules for digital assets.

In 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $7,769.79 and $9,361.58, with an average expected price of $9,199.91. In 2030, ETH could trade between $24,373.71 and $26,740.04, with an average price of $25,417.45. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2024 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,574.78 Market Cap $430.55B Trading Volume $41.12B Circulating Supply 120.44M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,682.67 24 Low $3,504.23 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 10.80% 50-day SMA $ 2,935.30 200-day SMA $ 2,914.35 Sentiment Bullish Fear and Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart On December 03, the 1-day Ethereum price chart shows that Ethereum is trading at $3,584.2, down by 1.67%. The price tested resistance at $3,825.1, as indicated by the upper Bollinger Band, but faced rejection, suggesting bearish momentum. ETH/USD 1-Day price chart The 20-day SMA at $3,370.9 acts as a key support level, with the lower Bollinger Band at $2,916.8, marking a critical defensive zone. The RSI (14) is at 65.62, signaling overbought conditions. A consolidation phase may follow if Ethereum stabilizes above $3,370.9, while a break below could lead to further downside. Overall, caution is warranted in the current range. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis The 4-hour Ethereum chart indicates a slight recovery as the current Ethereum price is $3,583.3, up 0.30%. A recent low of $3,569.5 suggests Ethereum is testing local support. The Balance of Power (BoP) at 0.38 shows mild bullish momentum but remains inconclusive for a strong upward breakout. ETH/USD 4-hour price chart The MACD displays a bearish crossover, with the MACD line at 1.4 and the signal line at 19.8, highlighting weak momentum. A continued price movement below $3,600 could lead to testing deeper support around $3,550. However, if buyers regain control, resistance at $3,595.5 could serve as the next upward target. Ethereum technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $3,310.19 BUY SMA 5 $3,422.80 BUY SMA 10 $3,399.66 BUY SMA 21 $3,309.67 BUY SMA 50 $2,935.30 BUY SMA 100 $2,715.66 BUY SMA 200 $2,914.35 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $3,237.43 BUY EMA 5 $3,068.89 BUY EMA 10 $2,859.44 BUY EMA 21 $2,695.35 BUY EMA 50 $2,621.57 BUY EMA 100 $2,714.74 BUY EMA 200 $2,814.55 BUY What can you expect from ETH price analysis next? The 1-day and 4-hour charts show that Ethereum currently exhibits mixed signals. On the daily chart, the price faces resistance at $3,825.1 and struggles to maintain above $3,584.2. The RSI suggests overbought levels. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD remains bearish, and the Balance of Power shows weak buying strength. If Ethereum breaches the $3,570 support zone, it could drop toward the lower Bollinger Band at $2,916.8. However, sustained consolidation above $3,600 may allow for a potential retest of the $3,825 resistance. A decisive break is needed to confirm the next trend direction. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark in the near future. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

The cryptocurrency had its biggest 24-hour gain in the last month, which boosted its market capitalization to $44.7 billion. Now, investors have begun talking about whether this momentum can be sustained, or if the rally has just been a temporary burst. Related Reading: Shiba Inu All Set For ‘Bull Show’, Eyes 180% Rally – Analyst Cardano has gained a remarkable 268% in value over the past month, capturing the attention of bulls. Experts are keenly observing the token as optimism about the broader crypto market grows. Bullish Predictions Fuel Market Hopes Crypto analyst Javon Marks thinks ADA has more to go. On December 1, Marks presented a price target of $2.77, or 130% above its current value. He also suggested that ADA could go the same way as it did in 2021 and surge between $5.29 and $7.82. Lark Davis, another prominent analyst, went even further and predicted that ADA would jump by 747% to $10. $ADA (Cardano) continuing to display monumental strength here and can be in full pursuit towards the first target of $2.7709 which can result in another +135% move from here to reach it but history says there can be more 👀! See charts below… https://t.co/OXkUPU1un4 pic.twitter.com/VOCZMOTo5Q — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) December 1, 2024 Institutional support is further giving the bull case credibility. The CIO at Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, recently stated that Cardano was one of his top altcoin choices for 2024. According to Yusko, traditional banks will be forced to introduce cryptocurrencies like ADA in the future to maintain their status quo. Resistance & Support Levels Under Focus While the rally is exciting, technical analysts suggest caution. The altcoin recently failed to break past the resistance level of $1.15, which raises questions about whether the uptrend can hold. Analysts point out that ADA must decisively reclaim this resistance to sustain its bullish momentum. If ADA succeeds in breaking through and holding up above $1.15, it could open a fresh wave of buying to carry the price even higher. If it fails, there could be a pullback to some critical support levels around $0.88. Related Reading: Cardano To Hit $10? Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle Broader Market Trends Could Boost ADA Cardano is just seeing its surge as the overall crypto market is filled with fresh momentum. Bitcoin is approaching $100,000 and the recently held US presidential election brings much-needed optimism for the introduction of friendlier policies to cryptos. The positive context will therefore become a tailwind for ADA and other altcoins. Meanwhile, Cardano plans to release 18.53 million ADA tokens on December 4, which are worth approximately $20 million, adding to its momentum. An increase in supply can be viewed as dilution; however, the funds will go towards staking and treasury reserves, which may boost long-term growth. At present, Cardano seems to be on the bright side of things, but the future depends on breaking some key resistance levels and holding investor confidence.

According to developer WietseWind on the social media platform X, XRPL Labs changed the configuration of its validator last month to lower fees and reserve requirements in anticipation of rising activity on-chain. “There have been several discussion threads about Reserves and Fees on the XRPL. On behalf of XRPL Labs I just changed the configuration of our validator, to be enabled the next validator restart.” According to the developer, the adjustments aim to lower barriers for new users, including a significant reduction in the required reserves. As of December 2nd, reserve requirements for XRPL users have now been lowered from 20 to 1 XRP. According to pseudonymous XRPL developer Vet, the move has freed up excess XRP for traders. “XRP Ledger reserves just dropped! Activating an XRP account cost now 1 XRP Holding a Token Trustline only 0.2 XRP Excessive XRP is now freed up in your account that you can spend now!!” Developers say the changes will make it more affordable for users to participate in the XRP Ledger ecosystem, thus broadening the blockchain’s user base. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also asked validators to upgrade to 2.3.0 of rippled, the reference server implementation of the XRP Ledger. The move comes at a time when XRP’s value has soared to $2.65, its highest level since 2018. XRP is worth $2.51 at time of writing, up 82% from a week ago.

According to the announcement , this is an important step in its development. The launch began with the creation of the genesis blocks in the network. The initial phase of the mainnet focuses on staking and governance. This sets up a decentralized network driven by its community. Namada Committed to a User-driven Ecosystem Namada is giving away its native tokens, NAM, through an airdrop to eligible wallets as part of its launch. Recipients can immediately use these tokens to stake and participate in governance decisions. This focus on staking and governance shows Namada’s commitment to a user-driven ecosystem. Notably, the rollout will happen in five phases. Token transferability will start in the fifth phase, which is expected to begin in the next few months. This will only happen once the Namada community is confident of its network. Meanwhile, Namada focuses on privacy by using advanced cryptographic methods to protect transaction details. At the same time, it ensures transparency in governance. IOTA Foundation Revamps Mainnet With Move Transition The IOTA Foundation unveiled IOTA Rebased recently , an ambitious upgrade proposal to revolutionize its blockchain network. IOTA Rebased proposes a complete overhaul of the network’s Layer-1 protocol by switching to a Move-based object ledger. Interestingly, this move makes IOTA the first Layer1 blockchain to adopt the Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM). This transition opens the doors to programmability at the core layer, enabling developers to create Decentralized Applications (DApps). This transformative upgrade also positions IOTA alongside prominent MoveVM-powered blockchains like Sui and Aptos. Meanwhile, the Move programming language will be added to the architecture, allowing smart contracts to run directly on the Layer 1 ledger. Celo Network Moves to Become Ethereum Layer 2 Recall that last year, cLabs, the Celo blockchain’s core developer, presented an ambitious plan to transform its Layer 1 network into a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum . As revealed, the cLabs proposal outlines a future version of Celo based on a Layer 2 roll-up model. In this model, Celo will leverage Ethereum’s mainnet for security by publishing security proofs. By doing so, Celo can benefit from the robust security guarantees offered by Ethereum, ensuring a higher level of protection than what Celo’s independent infrastructure currently provides.

Toncoin’s recent updates have sparked debates about its scalability compared to Ethereum and Solana, while Stellar’s climb toward a 60% surge has everyone watching. But here comes Qubetics, a game-changer in the presale arena, solving real-world issues that have plagued blockchain technologies for years. With over $4.2 million raised in its presale and over 261 million $TICS tokens sold, it’s becoming the talk of the town. In a market overflowing with innovation, Qubetics stands apart. Why? Its revolutionary QubeQode IDE aims to make blockchain accessible, tackling the very problems of complexity and scalability that many users face daily. Let’s dive deeper into these projects and see what makes Qubetics the best ongoing presale to buy now. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain’s Future Qubetics isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a movement aimed at solving blockchain’s core issues. With its QubeQode IDE , the project is creating a user-friendly ecosystem that anyone—yes, anyone—can navigate. Think about it: how many times have you heard complaints about blockchain’s complexity driving users away? Qubetics addresses this head-on. Blockchain has long been plagued by unintuitive interfaces and limited transaction scalability. These problems make it harder for new users to dive in and for businesses to rely on the technology. QubeQode IDE simplifies blockchain app development, offering tools that reduce complexity and increase accessibility. It’s designed with scalability in mind, ensuring that transaction processing isn’t a bottleneck, even during peak usage. Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, with a current token price of $0.0282. The project has already raised over $4.2 million, selling more than 261 million $TICS tokens to over 5,900 holders. These figures show strong community trust and investor interest. Analysts predict that the $TICS token’s value could soar post-launch, making it the best ongoing presale to buy now. FOMO kicking in yet? Unlike its competitors, Qubetics doesn’t just patch problems—it reimagines blockchain technology. By making it accessible and scalable, it’s paving the way for mainstream adoption. Imagine a world where developing blockchain apps is as simple as using a smartphone. That’s the future Qubetics is building. Learn more by watching this video . Toncoin: A Rising Star with Room to Shine Toncoin’s recent performance has been impressive. Analysts are debating whether it might outperform Ethereum or Solana in December. Its robust ecosystem, powered by The Open Network, is gaining traction for its speed and decentralised structure. This makes it a go-to for users craving efficiency in transaction processing. But does it have what it takes to revolutionise blockchain accessibility? According to recent forecasts, Toncoin could double in value by year’s end. The coin’s recent upgrades aim to tackle network congestion and scalability issues, bringing it closer to Ethereum’s dominance. However, its complex ecosystem might still pose challenges for newcomers. Crypto experts warn that while Toncoin offers solutions, it’s not foolproof. The learning curve is steep, and its tools are far from intuitive for first-time users. Toncoin’s growth is exciting, but accessibility remains a significant barrier. As it evolves, its ability to onboard everyday users will determine its long-term success. That’s where it could learn a thing or two from Qubetics’ focus on user-friendly tools. Stellar: Aiming for the Stars with Bold Moves Stellar is no stranger to the limelight. Its mission to simplify cross-border payments has won over institutions and investors alike. Recent predictions suggest a 60% jump in its value, driven by its unique position in enabling fast, cost-effective global transactions. With XRP nearing a $2 milestone, Stellar’s competition in this space is heating up. But here’s the rub: Stellar’s infrastructure, while efficient, doesn’t completely erase the hurdles faced by mainstream users. Technical complexities and a lack of streamlined interfaces make it challenging for those new to crypto. Its scalability also has room for improvement, as transaction volumes increase with adoption. Despite these limitations, Stellar’s potential remains undeniable. Its partnerships with financial institutions and a focus on solving real-world payment issues give it an edge. Still, it’s clear that blockchain needs a simpler, more accessible solution—something Qubetics promises to deliver. Conclusion: Where Does the Smart Money Go? Toncoin and Stellar are undoubtedly making waves, with Toncoin’s potential doubling and Stellar’s steady climb. But both projects struggle with accessibility and scalability issues that hinder widespread adoption. They’re excellent investments for seasoned crypto enthusiasts but might leave newcomers scratching their heads. Enter Qubetics. With its innovative QubeQode IDE, it’s solving the very problems that others overlook. Its presale success, intuitive tools, and focus on scalability make it a top contender for anyone looking to invest in blockchain’s future. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale and grab your $TICS tokens before it’s too late. Don’t miss out on the best ongoing presale to buy now!

While the bug bounty program with HackerOne is not a novel idea, the large sum attached to the announcement certainly drew a lot of attention worldwide. Crypto.com announced the daring cybersecurity initiative in a blog posted on its website and shared via social media. It is offering hackers the substantial reward of $2M to test the strength of its security system. The company has an ongoing partnership with HackerOne and this cybersecurity program is a part of that partnership. The exchange said it execs the campaign to help bolster security and maintain the trust of its almost 100 million customers. Crypto.com raises the stakes The $2M incentive on offer is one of the largest of its kind in the cryptocurrency sector. Crypto.com confirmed that it is an exercise to prove the importance of proactively safeguarding digital assets in its custody, especially in the cryptocurrency space where cyber threats are surplus. With this program, Crypto.com hopes participants may help identify vulnerabilities and resolve potential risks before they are found and exploited by the wrong people. The company joins other crypto platforms that have put out bug bounties to bolster their defenses against cyber threats. “When you operate a global app serving more than 100 million customers, finding critical security gaps before bad actors do is essential to system integrity and customer trust,” Kara Sprague, CEO of HackerOne said. She went on to say that Crypto.com’s “record breaking bounty” reflects the company’s emphasis on “consumer protection and their appreciation of the value the ethical hacking community can provide.” Strategic bets in the cryptocurrency space Other companies such as Uniswap, Atomic Wallet, Facebook and even Google consistently run bug bounty programs to quickly identify critical gaps in their security before they pose a problem. In late November, Uniswap launched the largest bug bounty in DeFi history, offering a whopping $15.5M reward to hackers who could identify weaknesses in its v4 smart contracts ahead of their deployment. The project’s UNI token has taken off on a parabolic trajectory since it announced the campaign. The crypto space has been rocked by significant cases of hacks on both decentralized protocols and centralized exchanges . Affected entities have had varying degrees of success in recouping and reimbursing stolen funds to affected users. The WazirX and XT.com exchange hacks were major hacks that affected centralized exchanges running on similar business models as Crypto.com this year alone. Crypto.com is not waiting to record losses before making its move. The Chief Information Security Officer of Crypto.com, Jason Lau, stated, “We have always respected and partnered with the ethical hacking community as an extension of our security team. Deepening our relationship with HackerOne through this milestone and setting this landmark bounty underscores our commitment to enhancing safeguards and consumer protection. We look forward to continuing to productively engage with this community.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",News|Crypto.Com|Uniswap|WazirX,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|UNI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-03 23:33:48

Elon’s Billions (ELONBILL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONBILL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Billions can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Billions could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Billions launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Billions on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Billions by entering its contract address – 5VkZGZPArjvA7aDTMVenePmqW62rRZtugUPqC8kEXaez – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONBILL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-04 00:05:00

Edwards posits that Bitcoin’s journey to $100,000 could be the catalyst for an unprecedented price acceleration. He suggests that once this psychological and technical barrier is breached, Bitcoin could potentially double in value within weeks. Drawing parallels with gold’s recent performance, Edwards stated, “If you look at gold this year, it went up 33% in 16 weeks—that’s a $3.8 trillion move in a really old asset. For Bitcoin to go from $100K to $200K, that’s just $2 trillion on an asset that trades 24/7 and is more accessible globally.” He emphasizes that Bitcoin’s relatively smaller market capitalization compared to gold allows for more rapid price movements. Historically, after surpassing previous all-time highs, Bitcoin has experienced significant and swift appreciations, entering periods of price discovery where supply constraints can lead to vertical price increases. When Will Bitcoin Price Double? The $100,000 mark is not just a round number; it represents a significant resistance level due to several factors. Edwards highlighted the presence of a substantial sell wall at this price point, noting, “We have the biggest sell wall we’ve ever seen in the order books for Bitcoin at $100,00. I think just yeah once that’s cleared out, that’s when you know everyone who wanted to sell has sold and you have these really sharp rapid vertical price appreciation moves because there’s just no more supply left.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy Continues Bitcoin Buying Streak: 15,400 BTC Added This Monday Additionally, many investors who entered the market at lower prices may view $100,000 as an optimal point to realize profits, potentially creating selling pressure. However, Edwards remains optimistic that this barrier will be surpassed, especially within the next few months, given the seasonal strength observed in Bitcoin’s price movements during Q4 and Q1. “We are [at a point] in the cycle where we are seasonal and this is kind of like the optimal two to four month period, maybe a five to six month period every four years. After each Halving every four years, you have about 12 to 18 months where you get 90% to 95% of all the cycles returns out of every four years. So most of it happens in that one year alone. If you look at Q4 and Q1 that again is the majority of the returns […] once you have a strong monthly breakout above all time,” the hedge fund CEO stated. While Edwards is bullish on Bitcoin’s prospects, he cautions investors about the inherent volatility of the market. He pointed out that corrections of 20% to 30% are normal during bull markets and that investors should be prepared for such fluctuations. “It’s normal to have 30% drawdowns every few months in a Bitcoin bull market,” he noted. Factors such as increasing leverage in the market could exacerbate price swings. Edwards mentioned that if leverage and funding rates continue to rise without chipping away at the existing sell wall, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels, potentially around $80,000. However, he emphasizes that such volatility is a natural part of Bitcoin’s growth cycle and not necessarily indicative of a long-term downturn. The End Of The Traditional 4-Year Cycle? A significant point of discussion was whether the traditional 4-year cycle, largely driven by the halving events, is reaching its conclusion. Edwards believes that as Bitcoin matures and integrates more deeply with traditional financial systems, the impact of the halving on market cycles will diminish. “As Bitcoin’s inflation rate decreases and it becomes more integrated with traditional finance, the four-year halving cycles may become less impactful. The large 80% drawdowns we’ve seen in the past might not happen in future cycles,” he stated. This maturation process could lead to more stable growth patterns and reduced volatility. Edwards suggests that future cycles may see shallower corrections, possibly around 60% rather than the dramatic declines of previous years. Related Reading: Data Shows Selling Pressure Mounts On Bitcoin: Is The Bull Run at Risk? Notably, several potential catalysts could propel Bitcoin’s price to unprecedented levels. Edwards mentioned the possibility of the US government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve under President-elect Donald Trump. While he estimates the probability of this occurring in 2025 to be around 30%, he acknowledges that such an event would be a game-changer. “Assuming [the U.S. government] doesn’t sell their existing holdings is great, but it’s probably not going to help the cycle a lot. Actively buying Bitcoin could be a game-changer,” he remarked. Corporate adoption is another significant factor. The potential for major corporations to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets could drive substantial demand. Edwards highlighted the upcoming vote by Microsoft on this matter, saying, “Let’s hope it’s Microsoft [on December 10].” Furthermore, the success of spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has opened the doors for institutional investors. The sustained demand from ETFs has been absorbing Bitcoin supply steadily. Edwards observed, “The ETFs have just been sucking Bitcoin out of the system ferociously.” Bitcoin Price Predictions Edwards provided a base and an optimistic scenario for the Bitcoin price in this cycle. He stated, “I’d be surprised if we don’t get to $140,000.” This base case assumes steady market conditions without any extraordinary positive events. In a more optimistic scenario, he believes Bitcoin could reach $200,000, especially if significant catalysts, such as government or corporate adoption, materialize. “We could easily get to $200,000. Once we clear those all-time highs, Bitcoin does multiples very quickly,” he explained. He concluded: “”Once we’re above $100,000, people who aren’t in Bitcoin just cannot comprehend Bitcoin above $100,000 […] That’s when you see the real switch flick and the flows happen.” At press time, BTC traded at $94,814.

Table of Contents PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong The next ERC-20 to blow up will most likely be DTX Memecoins and market mood The meme coin madness is back, and everyone is getting excited again. In the spotlight, we have these meme coins as leaders, Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), two original meme coins that are definitely back with big rallies. While these household names still dominate the meme coin space, investors and analysts are discussing a new ERC-20 token that could be the next big winner. PEPE’s has a big jump, and SHIB stays strong Pepe , the Ethereum-based token that pays homage to the internet’s favorite Pepe the Frog, has been on a tear lately. PEPE is up 131% in the last month, driven by retail interest and whale activity. A significant development that got everyone’s attention was the withdrawal of 150 billion PEPE tokens worth nearly $3 million from Binance by one wallet. This enormous transfer initially caused some uncertainty, but many see it as a sign of growing confidence in PEPE’s long term. The coin’s recent move is a testament to its popularity among retail investors, thanks to its community-driven and viral nature. Not far behind, Shiba Inu is solidifying its position as a meme coin leader. SHIB has gone beyond its meme roots by adding DeFi applications, NFTs, and governance features to its ecosystem. These have kept the token relevant and attracted a loyal user and investor base. Despite its huge supply, SHIB has held up in price, with early 2025 projections of $0.0000093. SHIB’s ability to innovate while riding its existing popularity makes it a good option for long-term holders and speculators.

It has just hit $9.2 million in presale, and investors are showing big interest. DTX just entered its sixth round, and the price has been raised to $0.12. Early investors are already seeing significant gains of 500% because the initial price when DTX started was $0.02. DTX Exchange is launching its First Hybrid Leaderboard, which will combine the best centralized and decentralized exchanges to bring transparency and gamification to trading. Experts are predicting big growth for DTX Exchange . Some analysts say it could hit $4.5 by February 2025, a 4,500% gain for early investors. Now, rumors of a Binance listing in 2025 are surfacing, which could make it even bigger. With its upcoming Hybrid Leaderboard and strong community, DTX will be a significant player in the crypto space. Memecoins and market mood The comeback of PEPE and SHIB is a sign of the overall market’s risk appetite. These tokens, often criticized for having no intrinsic value, live on community, social media, and market sentiment. Remember, meme coins are highly volatile. They can give users huge short-term gains but also big losses. Analysts advise traders not to overexpose to this speculative asset class and to diversify their portfolio. The meme coin rally signifies a lively and exciting crypto market. Social media and community narratives will continue to shape the path of Pepe, Shiba Inu, and the new DTX Exchange token. As the anticipation grows, the market is waiting for meme coins to blow up. Whether it’s a token based on a new internet meme or a project using new tech, one thing is certain: the meme coin space is a wild west in crypto.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 518,000 followers on the social media platform X that Avalanche witnessed a strong November. “Avalanche performed a historically bullish monthly close above the light blue level of $38.57. Any dips [below $38.57] in the future would be a retest attempt, in a very similar fashion to the retests from Sept 2021 and March 2024 (green/orange circles).” Source: Rekt Capital/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that AVAX tends to rally after retesting $38.57 as support. Avalanche is trading at $51.14 at time of writing, up over 12% in the past day. Next up is Polkadot. The widely followed analyst says the 17th-largest crypto asset by market cap also recorded a “bullish monthly close” to reach a level last witnessed in April. “DOT is also showing very early signs of retesting this level [at around $8.61] into new support. DOT needs to continue doing this to enable further upside. Price stability at $8.61 = crucial.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Polkadot is trading at $10.24 at time of writing, up nearly 7% in the last 24 hours. As for Dogecoin, Rekt Capital notes the flagship memecoin has broken out from the upper boundary of an ascending triangle pattern that had formed on the daily time frame. In technical analysis, an ascending triangle breakout is considered bullish. “Any dips into the top of the pattern [at around the $0.43 level], if needed, would constitute a post-breakout retest to confirm the breakout.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Dogecoin is trading at $0.421.
