Notably, the data for Bitcoin whales shows the number of addresses in this category is now at its highest point since the January 2021 bull market levels. With Bitcoin still trading close to its all-time high, this new whale milestone brings into question a better chance of Bitcoin breaking above and creating a new all-time high very soon. Whale Activity And Holder Count Reaches New Highs Bitcoin whales have always been one of the most important indicators for ongoing sentiment among traders and long-term holders. According to Glassnode data presented by André Dragosch, director and head of research for Europe at Bitwise, the number of addresses that fall into the whale category has been on a steady climb since January 2024, where it stood just below 1,500 addresses. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Court Orders Massive LUNC Burn As Part Of $4.5 Billion Settlement For Terraform Labs The current market climate and inflow from institutional investors have allowed this upward trajectory to persist over the past months, pushing it past multiple levels. The most recent figures reveal that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC has reached 1,678, marking the highest point in whale activity since January 2021, during the height of the last major bull run. What this suggests is that each of these addresses now holds at least $67 million worth of Bitcoin, given the current price of the cryptocurrency. New All-Time High Incoming? Whale accumulation leading up to the previous highest level in January 2021 was one of the key factors that drove the Bitcoin price to peak above $69,000 in 2021. Although the Bitcoin price has now broken above this previous peak to create an all-time high of $73,737 in March 2024, the same accumulation pattern appears to be unfolding. This interesting accumulation of BTC by Bitcoin whales has proven to be the much-needed boost to stop deeper price corrections after a false breakout of a descending triangle earlier in the week. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge Even with the false breakout, the overall sentiment around Bitcoin remains optimistic. According to on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant, it’s not just the whales driving the market. Retail investors have also joined the action. On-chain data shows a 13% rise in retail demand over the last 30 days, a notable increase that mirrors the retail interest seen in March 2024, just before Bitcoin reached its latest all-time high. Retail on-chain activity returns after 4 months “In the last 30 days, retail demand grew by about 13%, highlighting a scenario that was only seen in March, when we were close to the last historical high.” – By @caueconomy Full post 👇https://t.co/VORO90JhVg pic.twitter.com/jHGzjUBgII — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 22, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,000, having traded between $65,161 to $67,538 in a 24-hour range and $65,441 to $69,227 in a seven-day range. Interestingly, Bitcoin is only about 10% away from surpassing its all-time high once again. With this increased buying interest and whale accumulation, Bitcoin seems ready for another breakout to set a new price record before the end of 2024.

Regarding the possible creation of an ETF for XRP, CEO Brad Garlinghouse has voiced enthusiasm that would significantly increase the market presence of the cryptocurrency if realized. Still, many investors could show reluctance unless these legal questions are resolved.

Despite the potential for development suggested by future price forecasts, the current outlook implies that this may not be the ideal moment to enter the market.

What This Indicator Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-too-late-to-accumulate-bitcoin-what-indicator/,"Here’s what the historical pattern of an on-chain indicator suggests regarding whether the time to accumulate Bitcoin is over or not. Bitcoin 150-Day MA aSOPR Currently Has A Value Of 1.01 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the 150-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin aSOPR has a value of just 1.01 right now. The “Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio” (aSOPR) here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of all tokens being sold/transferred to see what price they were transacted at prior to this. When this price for any coin is less than the current price at which they are now being sold, then that particular token’s sale could be assumed to be leading to profit realization. Related Reading: Analytics Firm Reveals Why Dogecoin & Apecoin Hit Tops Similarly, coins of the opposite type could be considered to be adding to the loss realization. The aSOPR combines such profits and losses being realized across the network, and calculates their ratio. The “adjusted” in this metric’s name comes from the fact that it filters out transactions of coins that were moved inside an hour of their last transaction. Transfers like these are generally of no consequence to the wider market, so it makes sense to take them out of the data. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 150-day MA of the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 150-day MA Bitcoin aSOPR has consistently remained above the 1 mark this year, which implies the investors as a whole have been realizing more profits than losses. Earlier in the year, the indicator had grown to a high of 1.04 as the investors had taken the profits of the rally. As the consolidation of the cryptocurrency has dragged on, though, the metric has declined, with its value now sitting at 1.01. In the chart, the quant has highlighted two zones that have historically been significant for the aSOPR. The first is the region under 0.98, where bottoms have historically occurred. At levels this low, the investors are participating in notable loss realization. Resolute hands pick up the coins from these capitulators, thus helping the price reach a point of turnaround. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? The other zone is the one above 1.08, where tops have formed in the past as a result of the aggressive profit-taking from the whales. So far, the current cycle hasn’t seen the Bitcoin aSOPR visit this territory. “Based on previous trends, accumulating Bitcoin until aSOPR reaches 1.04 could be a solid strategy for long-term gains,” says the analyst. “Timing the market by observing whale behavior may prove fruitful.” BTC Price Bitcoin had plunged to the $65,000 level yesterday, but the coin has already made recovery as its price is now floating around $67,100.

Key Data Suggests New Investors Hold the Key",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/would-bitcoin-reclaim-70000-soon-key-data-suggests-new/,"Bitcoin recent decline has led to a slight pushback in investor confidence and increased anticipation within the crypto community, with many now craving a rally back above $70,000 more than before. Amid this, a new analysis suggests that although the Bitcoin market could be on the brink of a major breakout, it hinges on a major indicator that concerns new investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Network Fundamentals Turn Bullish—Here Are The Details New Investors Hold the Key According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Avocado Onchain, new market investors could drive the next significant upward price movement. The analyst shared these insights on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlighting key data trends that point to a potential price surge. Avocado Onchain’s analysis focuses on “Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs),” specifically those under six months old. UTXOs represent the amount of cryptocurrency that remains unspent after a transaction, and they can provide valuable insights into market sentiment. According to the analyst, the decline in UTXOs under six months has stopped and is now leveling off. Currently, only 8.6% of Bitcoin investors are at a loss based on the present price of the cryptocurrency. In past market cycles, when the decline in UTXOs halted and showed an increase, Bitcoin’s price often surged, marking the beginning of a new bull run. Bitcoin Historical Patterns And Market Sentiment The CryptoQuanat analyst further highlighted that the data from previous Bitcoin market cycles reveals a pattern in which the percentage of investors holding losses converged toward zero before significant price increases occurred. Avocado points out that in those instances, as the number of investors in loss diminished, new investors entered the market in large numbers, driven by rising optimism. This influx of new participants tends to trigger a sharp price rise as new buyers increase demand for Bitcoin and fuel further upward momentum. For Bitcoin’s price to reach new heights, the analyst suggests that market sentiment must shift more favorably. This positive sentiment is typically fuelled by the entry of new investors who tend to buy in when market conditions are improving. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? Avocado also highlights that these new investors often show increased interest when Bitcoin nears or breaks through its previous all-time high, leading to an “explosive influx” of new buyers. If Bitcoin’s current market conditions align with historical patterns, the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a significant breakout. The CryptoQuant analyst further notes that while Bitcoin’s price has recently been in a downtrend, this leveling off of UTXO data is a key sign that could indicate a reversal. The analyst noted: If history repeats itself, the current price of Bitcoin could be seen as being on the verge of an explosive breakout.

While there were initial doubts about the network dying a natural death due to the then “superior” competitor Ethereum in the first few years, the smart contracts platform has surpassed expectations. Tron Energy Demand Doubles In 3 Months At spot rates, is TRX likely to print fresh all-time highs, and the mainnet is also thriving. According to IntoTheBlock, the Tron energy requirements have expanded 100% in the past three months. Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin In 2025? $791 Billion Asset Manager Calls It ‘Conservative’ Experts say the rapid increase in Tron energy indicates growing network activity and rapid adoption. Like Ethereum and other modern chains, Tron is energy efficient and relies on validators for transaction processing. However, in Tron’s case, energy is useful when executing smart contracts on the mainnet. As more people deploy meme coins or launch DeFi dapps, the mainnet’s “fuel” demand also increases. Rising resource needs push Tron energy to fresh levels. By how Tron is designed, more energy is needed during periods of high demand to prevent gas fees from spiking in case transactions are congested. That energy has been rising in the past few months is not surprising. Not only does Tron boast of a thriving DeFi ecosystem, but it also has a vibrant meme coin scene. Ecosystem Boom Driven By Meme Coins: TRX Priming For New All-Time Highs? DeFiLlama shows that all Tron DeFi dapps manage over $7 billion of assets. On the other hand, the recent launch of SunPump, a meme coin launchpad in August, has seen over 91,000 meme coins deploy on the network. Looking at Dune, over 1,700 tokens have been listed on Sunswap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Bullish Channel At $65,000, Analyst Reveals What’s Next Coincidentally, the spike came with the activation of SunPump in August. As of October 24, SunPump has helped Tron generate over $5.4 million in revenue, looking at Dune data. Others came from smart contract deployments via gaming, DeFi, and other diverse dapps on the platform. TRX is trading at around October 2024 highs at press time, defying gravity. Interestingly, despite the momentum challenges Ethereum faces, TRX, on the other hand, is less than 4% away from all-time highs. If bulls build on October 24 gains, the coin may easily break August highs, printing a new all-time high in Q4 2024.

The price must clear the $0.5400 and $0.5500 resistance levels to gain pace. XRP price is correcting losses from the $0.5120 zone. The price is now trading below $0.5380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5360 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Many Hurdles XRP price remained in a bearish zone and extended losses below $0.5300, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.5280 and $0.5250 levels. The price even dipped below $0.5200 and tested $0.5120. A low was at $0.5117 and the price is now attempting to recover losses. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5600 swing high to the $0.5120 low. There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $0.5380 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5360 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5360 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $0.5600 swing high to the $0.5120 low. The next key resistance could be $0.5485. A clear move above the $0.5485 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5550 resistance or even $0.5620 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.5650. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5360 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5230 level. The next major support is near the $0.5185 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5185 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5120 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.500 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now near the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5230 and $0.5185.

DOGE must clear the $0.1425 resistance to start another increase. DOGE price started a downside correction from the $0.1500 resistance level. The price is trading below the $0.1420 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1425 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1425 and $0.1450 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Upside Break Dogecoin price started a downside correction from the $0.1500 resistance zone. DOGE dipped below $0.1450 and $0.1420 levels. A low was formed at $0.1330 and the price is now recovering losses like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was also a move above the $0.1350 and $0.1380 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1482 swing high to the $0.1330 low. However, the bears are active near the $0.1425 resistance zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1425 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1482 swing high to the $0.1330 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1420 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1425 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1450 level. A close above the $0.1450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1550 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1585. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1425 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1365 level. The next major support is near the $0.1350 level. The main support sits at $0.1320. If there is a downside break below the $0.1320 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1250 level or even $0.1220 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now near the 50 level.

How Trump’s Campaign And Rising Yields Impact Bitcoin Price According to a recent Bloomberg report, Bitcoin’s association with Trump is becoming more pronounced as global markets react to his potential return to the White House. Nonetheless, the financial landscape is shifting, with rising bond yields and a strengthening dollar coinciding with Trump’s lead in prediction markets. Experts anticipate that a Trump victory could usher in a pro-growth economic agenda, thereby tightening monetary policy. Related Reading: Bitcoin MACD Turns Bullish Since 2023: Predictions Of Cycle Top And Next Bear Market Bottom Market analysts, such as Tony Sycamore from IG Australia Pty, emphasize that the current selloff in stocks and a stronger US dollar and rising yields signal tightening financial conditions. The analyst explains that this environment is generally unfavorable for the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market, which tends to thrive in more liquid market conditions. Sycamore went on to say that while the initial monetary conditions were already loose, the speed of the tightening poses a significant threat to the Bitcoin price and other risk assets as the likelihood of Trump securing another term in the Oval Office increases. Regulatory Easing Under Trump’s Return? Trump’s campaign has openly embraced the cryptocurrency sector, promising to position the US as the “crypto capital of the world.” His approach starkly contrasts Harris’s more cautious stance, which involves supporting a regulatory framework to foster industry growth while ensuring consumer protection. The recent Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll reveals that Trump and Harris are statistically tied among likely voters in key swing states, indicating that the upcoming election could hinge on targeted advertising, rallies, and grassroots efforts—all of which could influence market sentiment. In the crypto market, investors are increasingly betting on a potential victory for former President Donald Trump on Polymarket. Current polls show Trump leading with 62% support compared to 38% for Vice President Kamala Harris as of Thursday, marking the largest margin since the race began. Related Reading: XRP Price Aims to Recover: Can It Reverse the Downtrend? Should Trump win in the upcoming election, Bloomberg notes that experts predict a potential yield increase, which could negatively impact risk assets, including the Bitcoin price performance. Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, points out that while higher yields may pose challenges, the anticipated regulatory easing under a Trump administration could be pivotal in shaping the crypto landscape. Despite potential economic challenges that could negatively impact BTC’s performance, Mauron concludes that the regulatory shift could support Bitcoin and other digital assets in regaining their footing. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,670, up 2.4% over the past 24 hours.

MEW Hits $1 Billion Market Cap After New ATH,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-the-cat-season-here-mew-hits-1-billion-market-cap-after-new-ath/,"Cat in a dogs world (MEW) has taken the market by storm after becoming the second cat-themed memecoin to hit a $1 billion market capitalization. The token joined POPCAT’s rally and reached a new all-time high (ATH) on Thursday, leading the whole feline sector. Related Reading: Web3 Automation Provider Ava Protocol’s Demand Surges 900% Ahead Of Token Launch MEW Hits Major Milestones Cat in a dogs world registered a significant 18.4% surge in the last 24 hours, propelling to a new ATH twice this morning. The cryptocurrency recorded its fifth ATH in the past two weeks, increasing over 95.2% and taking the memecoin sector by storm. After its surge to $0.01127, the cryptocurrency hit the long-awaited $1 billion mark, becoming the second cat-themed token to achieve this feat. As a result, MEW flipped Base Network’s token Brett as the tenth largest memecoin by this metric. MEW initially joined the memecoin’s top ten list back in Q2, ranking 8th among the dog-themed pack. It significantly retraced as POPCAT’s popularity grew, registering a 60% correction after leading the cat-themed sector during Q1. Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency has been on an uptrend for the past month after hovering between the $0.004-$0.006 price range during most of Q3. MEW’s rally this week seems to be fueled by the token’s listing on the Korean crypto exchange Upbit. Market watcher Crypto General noted the memecoin’s recent performance, revealing its next target for MEW. The analyst highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been “in a consistent uptrend from its launch, showing great strength and potential.” Crypto General expects parabolic surges in the coming days, suggesting that the cryptocurrency will target the $0.045 range for its price discovery period. As of this writing, MEW traders at $0.0112, 1.1% below its ATH. Has The Cat Season Arrived? Many crypto analysts have previously suggested that a cat-themed memecoin season was coming. Solana’s feline leader, POPCAT, recorded a new ATH on Thursday after hitting the $1.67 mark. The memecoin has registered an 82% growth in the last thirty days, becoming the first cat-themed token to achieve the $1 Billion market cap milestone a month ago. Alongside MEW and POPCAT’s remarkable rally, other cat-inspired memecoins have seen a notable performance over the past week. BNB Chain-based token Simon’s Cat (CAT) recorded a massive surge in the past week, nearing its all-time high price on Wednesday. CAT’s price skyrocketed 80.4% in the last three days following its Future Listing on the crypto exchange Binance. Related Reading: SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction The price jumped from the $0.0000245 level to the $0.0000442 mark, trading just 5% below its $0.0000462 ATH registered over a month ago. Despite being down 5.1% from yesterday’s surge, CAT still registers a 53% weekly increase. Crypto Trader Bluntz stated that the “cat season is truly underway” as the whole sector soars over 8%, according to CoinGecko data.

Taking to social media platform X, a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as @IamCryptoWolf highlighted that Ethereum is still bullish, with price targets reaching up to $12,000. This analysis comes in light of a 6.22% decline in the price of Ethereum in the past seven days and a continued increase in the Bitcoin dominance. Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin Ethereum has mostly lagged behind Bitcoin in price performance since the current market cycle began, struggling to gain momentum above the $3,000 mark since July. Ethereum bulls have faced challenges in attracting significant inflows, which has kept the price below key levels while Bitcoin has surged. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Numbers Return To January 2021 Bull Market Levels, Is A New ATH Coming? Bitcoin recently climbed back above $67,000 and is now approaching its yearly high of $73,737. Solana has also found its way above $170 again and could continue on the momentum to break above its yearly high of $202. However, despite Ethereum’s underperformance relative to these two crypto heavyweights, crypto analyst @IamCryptoWolf believes the trend is going to reverse in the second half of the cycle. The analyst provided his Ethereum outlook in reference to its price movements on the 3-day candlestick chart. The chart shows Ethereum rebounding off the bottom trendline of an ascending triangle, indicating the potential for an upward move. Consequently, the analyst projected a full breakout of multiple price resistances when the momentum finally rolls into Ethereum. Should this breakout occur, @IamCryptoWolf predicts Ethereum will surpass Bitcoin and Solana in performance during the second half of this bull cycle. He further noted a price target range for Ethereum’s surge, placing the lower boundary at $8,428, with a high-end target reaching up to $12,000. This projected breakout has sparked renewed interest in Ethereum’s ability to regain a leading position, especially among investors who are still waiting for an altcoin rally phase led by Ethereum. What’s Next For ETH? At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,472, having lost about 3% of its value in the past 24 hours. This sort of performance has left many ETH investors feeling uncertain about the asset’s near-term outlook. According to data from IntoTheBlock, about 51.40% of addresses that bought in between $2,106.27 and $2,855.96 are in losses, not to talk of those that bought above $2,855.96. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Retests Bullish Channel At $65,000, Analyst Reveals What’s Next Interestingly, @IamCryptoWolf addressed this trend among ETH investors in another post on social media platform X. Here, he highlighted that Ethereum is still bullish despite the underperformance. The analyst explained that Ethereum’s current price movement appears to be forming either an inverted head and shoulders or an ascending triangle pattern on the charts, both of which are traditionally seen as bullish formations in technical analysis.
