Notably, the data for Bitcoin whales shows the number of addresses in this category is now at its highest point since the January 2021 bull market levels. With Bitcoin still trading close to its all-time high, this new whale milestone brings into question a better chance of Bitcoin breaking above and creating a new all-time high very soon. Whale Activity And Holder Count Reaches New Highs Bitcoin whales have always been one of the most important indicators for ongoing sentiment among traders and long-term holders. According to Glassnode data presented by André Dragosch, director and head of research for Europe at Bitwise, the number of addresses that fall into the whale category has been on a steady climb since January 2024, where it stood just below 1,500 addresses. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Court Orders Massive LUNC Burn As Part Of $4.5 Billion Settlement For Terraform Labs The current market climate and inflow from institutional investors have allowed this upward trajectory to persist over the past months, pushing it past multiple levels. The most recent figures reveal that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC has reached 1,678, marking the highest point in whale activity since January 2021, during the height of the last major bull run. What this suggests is that each of these addresses now holds at least $67 million worth of Bitcoin, given the current price of the cryptocurrency. New All-Time High Incoming? Whale accumulation leading up to the previous highest level in January 2021 was one of the key factors that drove the Bitcoin price to peak above $69,000 in 2021. Although the Bitcoin price has now broken above this previous peak to create an all-time high of $73,737 in March 2024, the same accumulation pattern appears to be unfolding. This interesting accumulation of BTC by Bitcoin whales has proven to be the much-needed boost to stop deeper price corrections after a false breakout of a descending triangle earlier in the week. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge Even with the false breakout, the overall sentiment around Bitcoin remains optimistic. According to on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant, it’s not just the whales driving the market. Retail investors have also joined the action. On-chain data shows a 13% rise in retail demand over the last 30 days, a notable increase that mirrors the retail interest seen in March 2024, just before Bitcoin reached its latest all-time high. Retail on-chain activity returns after 4 months “In the last 30 days, retail demand grew by about 13%, highlighting a scenario that was only seen in March, when we were close to the last historical high.” – By @caueconomy Full post 👇https://t.co/VORO90JhVg pic.twitter.com/jHGzjUBgII — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 22, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,000, having traded between $65,161 to $67,538 in a 24-hour range and $65,441 to $69,227 in a seven-day range. Interestingly, Bitcoin is only about 10% away from surpassing its all-time high once again. With this increased buying interest and whale accumulation, Bitcoin seems ready for another breakout to set a new price record before the end of 2024.

Despite this favorable projection, the prevailing market sentiment is pessimistic, reflecting apprehension among investors. Related Reading: 5 Million Strong: Active Ethereum Wallets Drive Strong Momentum The Fear & Greed Index stands at 69, indicating a market characterized by greed, which frequently results in heightened volatility. In the last 30 days, XRP has experienced 14 positive trading days, equating to around 47%, with a price volatility of 5.84%. Present Market Circumstances Right now, XRP is worth $0.5293, a little decline of 0.77%. This dip draws attention to a more general trend of resistance the token has been faced with since October started. According to analysts, it is still not the right moment to invest in XRP, at least with regard to current bearish emotions and recent difficulties with price. In terms of market capitalization, XRP has reached $30 billion, showing some improvement of late. Despite the warning signs, the majority of analysts are still bullish on the potential price increase for XRP in the next several months. Depending on market conditions and sentiment, predictions range from $0.75 to $0.86, with further upside by the end of 2024. Crypto analyst Dark Defender forecasts the altcoin hitting the key $0.86 mark, which is a 27% increase in price at current levels. The path to such target, he said, will be a “tremendous move.” Hey there. This post is a long one. So get ready. Let’s check together where we are in the weekly time frame. We set a structure for $XRP over a year back, considering the 1st wave at $0.9327. 1. The ones know, know, that we targeted $0.89 and above when XRP was at $0.28.… pic.twitter.com/72QRlt1Djy — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) October 22, 2024 Investor Sentiment And Forecasts The conflicting signals in the market impede investor decision-making on their next behavior. While the technical signals caution, the Fear & Greed Index shows that many people still have a tendency to welcome risks. This discrepancy frequently results in erratic price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies such as XRP. Investors are urged to monitor market movements and mood indicators prior to making decisions. Moreover, Ripple’s continuous legal conflicts with the SEC constantly hide XRP’s expected performance. Regarding the possible creation of an ETF for XRP, CEO Brad Garlinghouse has voiced enthusiasm that would significantly increase the market presence of the cryptocurrency if realized. Still, many investors could show reluctance unless these legal questions are resolved.

Despite the potential for development suggested by future price forecasts, the current outlook implies that this may not be the ideal moment to enter the market.
