Notably, the data for Bitcoin whales shows the number of addresses in this category is now at its highest point since the January 2021 bull market levels. With Bitcoin still trading close to its all-time high, this new whale milestone brings into question a better chance of Bitcoin breaking above and creating a new all-time high very soon. Whale Activity And Holder Count Reaches New Highs Bitcoin whales have always been one of the most important indicators for ongoing sentiment among traders and long-term holders. According to Glassnode data presented by André Dragosch, director and head of research for Europe at Bitwise, the number of addresses that fall into the whale category has been on a steady climb since January 2024, where it stood just below 1,500 addresses. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Court Orders Massive LUNC Burn As Part Of $4.5 Billion Settlement For Terraform Labs The current market climate and inflow from institutional investors have allowed this upward trajectory to persist over the past months, pushing it past multiple levels. The most recent figures reveal that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC has reached 1,678, marking the highest point in whale activity since January 2021, during the height of the last major bull run. What this suggests is that each of these addresses now holds at least $67 million worth of Bitcoin, given the current price of the cryptocurrency. New All-Time High Incoming? Whale accumulation leading up to the previous highest level in January 2021 was one of the key factors that drove the Bitcoin price to peak above $69,000 in 2021. Although the Bitcoin price has now broken above this previous peak to create an all-time high of $73,737 in March 2024, the same accumulation pattern appears to be unfolding. This interesting accumulation of BTC by Bitcoin whales has proven to be the much-needed boost to stop deeper price corrections after a false breakout of a descending triangle earlier in the week. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge Even with the false breakout, the overall sentiment around Bitcoin remains optimistic. According to on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant, it’s not just the whales driving the market. Retail investors have also joined the action. On-chain data shows a 13% rise in retail demand over the last 30 days, a notable increase that mirrors the retail interest seen in March 2024, just before Bitcoin reached its latest all-time high. Retail on-chain activity returns after 4 months “In the last 30 days, retail demand grew by about 13%, highlighting a scenario that was only seen in March, when we were close to the last historical high.” – By @caueconomy Full post 👇https://t.co/VORO90JhVg pic.twitter.com/jHGzjUBgII — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 22, 2024 At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,000, having traded between $65,161 to $67,538 in a 24-hour range and $65,441 to $69,227 in a seven-day range. Interestingly, Bitcoin is only about 10% away from surpassing its all-time high once again. With this increased buying interest and whale accumulation, Bitcoin seems ready for another breakout to set a new price record before the end of 2024.

While the technical signals caution, the Fear & Greed Index shows that many people still have a tendency to welcome risks. This discrepancy frequently results in erratic price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies such as XRP. Investors are urged to monitor market movements and mood indicators prior to making decisions. Moreover, Ripple’s continuous legal conflicts with the SEC constantly hide XRP’s expected performance. Regarding the possible creation of an ETF for XRP, CEO Brad Garlinghouse has voiced enthusiasm that would significantly increase the market presence of the cryptocurrency if realized. Still, many investors could show reluctance unless these legal questions are resolved.

Despite the potential for development suggested by future price forecasts, the current outlook implies that this may not be the ideal moment to enter the market.

What This Indicator Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-too-late-to-accumulate-bitcoin-what-indicator/,"Here’s what the historical pattern of an on-chain indicator suggests regarding whether the time to accumulate Bitcoin is over or not. Bitcoin 150-Day MA aSOPR Currently Has A Value Of 1.01 As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the 150-day moving average (MA) of the Bitcoin aSOPR has a value of just 1.01 right now. The “Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio” (aSOPR) here refers to an indicator that basically tells us about whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of all tokens being sold/transferred to see what price they were transacted at prior to this. When this price for any coin is less than the current price at which they are now being sold, then that particular token’s sale could be assumed to be leading to profit realization. Related Reading: Analytics Firm Reveals Why Dogecoin & Apecoin Hit Tops Similarly, coins of the opposite type could be considered to be adding to the loss realization. The aSOPR combines such profits and losses being realized across the network, and calculates their ratio. The “adjusted” in this metric’s name comes from the fact that it filters out transactions of coins that were moved inside an hour of their last transaction. Transfers like these are generally of no consequence to the wider market, so it makes sense to take them out of the data. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 150-day MA of the Bitcoin aSOPR over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 150-day MA Bitcoin aSOPR has consistently remained above the 1 mark this year, which implies the investors as a whole have been realizing more profits than losses. Earlier in the year, the indicator had grown to a high of 1.04 as the investors had taken the profits of the rally. As the consolidation of the cryptocurrency has dragged on, though, the metric has declined, with its value now sitting at 1.01. In the chart, the quant has highlighted two zones that have historically been significant for the aSOPR. The first is the region under 0.98, where bottoms have historically occurred. At levels this low, the investors are participating in notable loss realization. Resolute hands pick up the coins from these capitulators, thus helping the price reach a point of turnaround. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? The other zone is the one above 1.08, where tops have formed in the past as a result of the aggressive profit-taking from the whales. So far, the current cycle hasn’t seen the Bitcoin aSOPR visit this territory. “Based on previous trends, accumulating Bitcoin until aSOPR reaches 1.04 could be a solid strategy for long-term gains,” says the analyst. “Timing the market by observing whale behavior may prove fruitful.” BTC Price Bitcoin had plunged to the $65,000 level yesterday, but the coin has already made recovery as its price is now floating around $67,100.

Key Data Suggests New Investors Hold the Key",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/would-bitcoin-reclaim-70000-soon-key-data-suggests-new/,"Bitcoin recent decline has led to a slight pushback in investor confidence and increased anticipation within the crypto community, with many now craving a rally back above $70,000 more than before. Amid this, a new analysis suggests that although the Bitcoin market could be on the brink of a major breakout, it hinges on a major indicator that concerns new investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Network Fundamentals Turn Bullish—Here Are The Details New Investors Hold the Key According to a CryptoQuant analyst, Avocado Onchain, new market investors could drive the next significant upward price movement. The analyst shared these insights on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlighting key data trends that point to a potential price surge. Avocado Onchain’s analysis focuses on “Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs),” specifically those under six months old. UTXOs represent the amount of cryptocurrency that remains unspent after a transaction, and they can provide valuable insights into market sentiment. According to the analyst, the decline in UTXOs under six months has stopped and is now leveling off. Currently, only 8.6% of Bitcoin investors are at a loss based on the present price of the cryptocurrency. In past market cycles, when the decline in UTXOs halted and showed an increase, Bitcoin’s price often surged, marking the beginning of a new bull run. Bitcoin Historical Patterns And Market Sentiment The CryptoQuanat analyst further highlighted that the data from previous Bitcoin market cycles reveals a pattern in which the percentage of investors holding losses converged toward zero before significant price increases occurred. Avocado points out that in those instances, as the number of investors in loss diminished, new investors entered the market in large numbers, driven by rising optimism. This influx of new participants tends to trigger a sharp price rise as new buyers increase demand for Bitcoin and fuel further upward momentum. For Bitcoin’s price to reach new heights, the analyst suggests that market sentiment must shift more favorably. This positive sentiment is typically fuelled by the entry of new investors who tend to buy in when market conditions are improving. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? Avocado also highlights that these new investors often show increased interest when Bitcoin nears or breaks through its previous all-time high, leading to an “explosive influx” of new buyers. If Bitcoin’s current market conditions align with historical patterns, the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of a significant breakout. The CryptoQuant analyst further notes that while Bitcoin’s price has recently been in a downtrend, this leveling off of UTXO data is a key sign that could indicate a reversal. The analyst noted: If history repeats itself, the current price of Bitcoin could be seen as being on the verge of an explosive breakout.

While there were initial doubts about the network dying a natural death due to the then “superior” competitor Ethereum in the first few years, the smart contracts platform has surpassed expectations. Tron Energy Demand Doubles In 3 Months At spot rates, is TRX likely to print fresh all-time highs, and the mainnet is also thriving. According to IntoTheBlock, the Tron energy requirements have expanded 100% in the past three months. Related Reading: $200,000 Bitcoin In 2025? $791 Billion Asset Manager Calls It ‘Conservative’ Experts say the rapid increase in Tron energy indicates growing network activity and rapid adoption. Like Ethereum and other modern chains, Tron is energy efficient and relies on validators for transaction processing. However, in Tron’s case, energy is useful when executing smart contracts on the mainnet. As more people deploy meme coins or launch DeFi dapps, the mainnet’s “fuel” demand also increases. Rising resource needs push Tron energy to fresh levels. By how Tron is designed, more energy is needed during periods of high demand to prevent gas fees from spiking in case transactions are congested. That energy has been rising in the past few months is not surprising. Not only does Tron boast of a thriving DeFi ecosystem, but it also has a vibrant meme coin scene. Ecosystem Boom Driven By Meme Coins: TRX Priming For New All-Time Highs? DeFiLlama shows that all Tron DeFi dapps manage over $7 billion of assets. On the other hand, the recent launch of SunPump, a meme coin launchpad in August, has seen over 91,000 meme coins deploy on the network. Looking at Dune, over 1,700 tokens have been listed on Sunswap.

As of October 24, SunPump has helped Tron generate over $5.4 million in revenue, looking at Dune data. Others came from smart contract deployments via gaming, DeFi, and other diverse dapps on the platform. TRX is trading at around October 2024 highs at press time, defying gravity. Interestingly, despite the momentum challenges Ethereum faces, TRX, on the other hand, is less than 4% away from all-time highs. If bulls build on October 24 gains, the coin may easily break August highs, printing a new all-time high in Q4 2024.
