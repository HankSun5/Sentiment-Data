Recapturing 2017 BTC Peak,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/analyst-sees-double-digit-xrp-price-the-catch-recapturing-2017-btc-peak/,"Experts are thrilled about the chances that XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, will hit new heights. Recent trends show that it could reach $20 if it can regain its 2017 high against Bitcoin. This hopeful prediction is based on the fact that the altcoin has shown strong signs of recovery, having come back from a low point of $1.28 earlier this week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes Explosive Growth: Over 200% Surge Ahead, Analyst Says XRP’s Most Recent Performance XRP swiftly recovered from that low point, surpassing critical psychological levels at $1.3 and $1.4, and is currently pursuing a stable position above $1.5. The current market rally has led analysts to believe that the crypto asset may outperform Bitcoin due to its upward momentum. Crypto analyst CryptoBull has been particularly vocal about this potential, stating that if XRP can reclaim its 2017 peak against Bitcoin, the price could skyrocket to $20. Analyzing the #XRP price in Dollars vs Bitcoin shows us how early we are in this bullrun. We are still 1,500% behind in Bitcoin value compared to early 2017. If we meet the same Bitcoin value $XRP price will be around $20. pic.twitter.com/ofxd6Izv5g — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 26, 2024 XRP has faced great difficulties in its competitiveness with Bitcoin since its all-time top of $3.31 in January 2018. The value of the cryptocurrency in respect to BTC has been dropping over recent months. Still, new data shows XRP has surged by an amazing 111% against Bitcoin this month, implying a possible breakout is about ready. Resistance Levels Broken In order for XRP to maintain its upward trajectory, it must overcome substantial resistance levels. In an effort to conclude the month above the descending trendline that has plagued XRP since July of last year, analysts are closely monitoring the price action. If successful, this could presage additional gains and corroborate a bullish breakout. The current trading value of the altcoin against Bitcoin stands at about 0.00001544 BTC and still remains much lower than it reached at its historical high. CryptoBull still sees hope, though, and believes a similar rally to that of the early 2017 market might send XRP right back into double digits. XRP: Predictions And Market Sentiment The broader cryptocurrency industry is also seeing a comeback while Bitcoin tries to break past the $95,000 level. Analysts believe that if XRP can turn the important $2 resistance level into support, then a fast climb towards $20 might be started. Related Reading: Critical XRP Warning: Analyst Flags Biggest Reason To Sell Apart from these technical factors, regulatory optimism also plays a role in how the market shapes its sentiment. The upcoming resignation of the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, can lead to better regulatory conditions for cryptocurrencies like XRP, which further boosts the euphoria surrounding Ripple’s prospect. XRP is currently trading at approximately $1.47, which represents a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Many investors are closely monitoring the altcoin as it navigates this critical phase of its market voyage, as analysts anticipate that bullish momentum will persist.

He drew attention to a Dogecoin chart that connects the monthly tops of 2017 and 2021, with an arc representing diminishing returns with a larger market cap, using a logarithmic scale. He suggested that the first step to reaching this $3 target will be for Dogecoin to reach $1. However, the analyst is convinced that the meme coin can reach $3 in this cycle. Based on crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade’s recent analysis, this Dogecoin price rally to $1 could happen soon, putting the rally to $3 in motion. In an X post, the analyst said the Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been bouncing up from the oversold zone on a 4-hour chart. The recent RSI bounces from the same zone caused Dogecoin to surge 40% and 200%. The crypto analyst added that the pump intensity is even getting stronger. In line with this, he remarked that it won’t be surprising if the Dogecoin price spikes beyond the 200% level and rallies above $1.15. Trader Tardigrade also recently predicted that Dogecoin could rise as high as $3.52. This came as he noted how the meme coin always enjoys a 2x increase from previous local tops. Meanwhile, as these crypto analysts have suggested, this $3 target might not be the market top for the Dogecoin price in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Philip recently predicted that Dogecoin could at least reach a conservative target of $5. The analyst made this prediction in relation to DOGE’s performance in previous cycles. Anything Above $5 Is Unrealistic In an X post, crypto analyst Master Kenobi asserted that any chart projecting the Dogecoin price above $5 in this market cycle is unrealistic. He made this claim in relation to what Dogecoin’s market cap would be if it were to reach targets above $5, which he believes cannot happen in this bull run. Master Kenobi warned investors about looking forward to these price targets above $5 as they risk becoming bagholders for another four years. As to how high he believes the Dogecoin price can rise in this cycle, the analyst predicts that the range between $1 and $2 is realistic. He is confident that the rally to $1 could mirror Bitcoin’s rally from $1,000 to $10,000, and the rally to $2 could happen the same way BTC rallied$10,000 to $20,000 in just two weeks. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.4, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This initiative seeks to diversify the city’s financial assets by including Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The Mayor’s Plan During a November 26 Vancouver city council meeting , Sim introduced a notice of motion titled “Preserving the city’s purchasing power through diversification of financial resources: Becoming a Bitcoin-friendly city.” The motion, set to be formally presented on December 11, is part of a broader strategy to modernize Vancouver’s financial framework and mitigate economic risks by leveraging Bitcoin’s growing value. With BTC recently reaching an all-time high of over $98,000, Sim believes incorporating the cryptocurrency into the city’s financial portfolio could provide stability and growth opportunities in the long term. Although the leader has rarely discussed cryptocurrency adoption publicly since taking office in October 2022, his interest in Bitcoin has been evident. During his mayoral campaign, his political party, A Better City, announced that it would accept crypto donations. At the time, Sim said the initiative was a commitment to promoting technology in governance. Furthermore, a copy of the influential book The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous, often cited by crypto proponents, was recently spotted in Sim’s office during a Global News interview. A Global Shift Vancouver’s latest initiative to incorporate Bitcoin into its financial portfolio reflects a global shift toward recognizing cryptocurrency as a viable financial hedge. At the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump proposed creating a national Bitcoin reserve. He positioned the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset comparable to gold in the country’s financial system. Other leaders worldwide have also embraced similar ideas. Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has advocated for Bitcoin’s adoption as a national reserve asset. In a previous interview, she described the asset as a “lifeline” and an essential tool of resistance against her country’s economic turmoil. Canada, where BTC is fully legal and widely embraced, has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption. The nation was the first to approve spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering citizens easy access to cryptocurrency investments. The fate of Mayor Ken Sim’s motion remains uncertain as it awaits consideration by the city council. If approved, Vancouver would join a growing list of cities and nations embracing Bitcoin’s potential to enhance financial resilience and drive economic growth.

The asset’s recovery is a welcome development for holders and investors, who have witnessed a two-day decline, dipping to $90k on November 27th. Bitcoin’s price surge happened after the market witnessed Tornado Cash’s major court victory. A US Appeals Court reversed a 2022 decision, saying that the Treasury Department acted beyond its authority when it imposed sanctions on the crypto mixing platform. Coinbase joined in the celebration over the court victory since it’s one of the crypto exchanges that supported Tornado Cash. With the recent Tornado Cash court win and favorable macroeconomics, one analyst boldly offers a price prediction for Bitcoin. In a Twitter/X post on the Angry Crypto Show, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson believes that the world’s top digital asset can hit $250,000 to $500,000 in 12 to 24 months. BREAKING: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says “it is my belief that #Bitcoin will go to $250,000 to $500,000 within 12 to 24 months, because of inflows and interest. $BTC is the store of value for the Internet, and will remain in that role now that it has a DeFi layer.” pic.twitter.com/1txPQV61Nl — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 26, 2024 Tornado Cash Court Victory Boosts Bitcoin Price In a post by Paul Grewal at Twitter/X, Tornado Cash’s court victory was a “win for privacy.” Grewal reported that the Treasury Department’s sanctions on the crypto mixing platform were unlawful. He added that the recent court decision was a victory for the crypto sector and those supporting freedom. Privacy wins. Today the Fifth Circuit held that @USTreasury ’s sanctions against Tornado Cash smart contracts are unlawful. This is a historic win for crypto and all who cares about defending liberty. @coinbase is proud to have helped lead this important challenge. 1/6 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) November 26, 2024 Tornado Cash’s victory is the latest in a string of wins for the crypto industry, which has helped push Bitcoin’s price up. The crypto sector is also anticipating the next moves of incoming US President Donald Trump, who is expected to adopt crypto-friendly policies. Hoskinson Remains Bullish On BTC For some analysts and observers, Bitcoin’s recent losses were just a retracement, and the bullish sentiment remains. For Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, Bitcoin remains on the bullish trend, and he thinks that the asset’s price can increase to $250k and $500k in 12 to 24 months. According to Hoskinson, a few factors help boost Bitcoin’s price stability. He mentioned that there is still a growing interest in Bitcoin as an asset. For example, MicroStrategy has been increasing its Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s company currently holds $32 billion worth of BTC, and its market cap now exceeds $70 billion. Other countries are also interested in Bitcoin, with El Salvador being the top country outside the US in harnessing the asset. Continuous Inflow And Interest Help Bitcoin According to Hoskinson, Bitcoin remains bullish for him because of soaring interest and inflows. The Cardano founder says that Bitcoin remains a viable store of value, and it will continue this service now that DeFi is becoming more popular. Recently, Cardano’s Emurgo shared that it’s developing a bridge in collaboration with BTCOS. According to Hoskinson, this new network will feature DeFi apps secured by Bitcoin. He added that developers can design Hybrid Cardano and Bitcoin apps in Aiken and pay fees in BTC.

Svenson tells his 80,700 YouTube subscribers that if Bitcoin stays above an ascending trendline that has lasted more than two weeks on the daily time frame, the crypto king could target a six-figure price next. “There’s a lot of demand for Bitcoin and if we hold this level [ascending trendline], I think that means we might just kind of settle up going into Thanksgiving. Maybe one more test down after Thanksgiving, maybe not. But ultimately we’re looking for the $100,000 level most likely by the New Year. If Bitcoin maintains this trend line and just breaks out again we’ll probably have $100,000 in December.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X Svenson further says, “If we are unable to maintain this trend line and we dip maybe one more time to the 0.382 Fibonacci [retracement level] which is like $87,500, well then we would probably have $100,000 maybe at the end of December or going into the New Year. Those are the two scenarios that I find likely.” Fibonacci retracement levels, which are based on the Fibonacci sequence, are used to identify potential levels of support and resistance with the most common being 0.236, 0.382, 0.5 and 0.618. Source: Kevin Svenson/X According to Svenson, the recent Bitcoin correction is a “pretty shallow retrace.” “This pullback is really nothing in Bitcoin land.

Nicolas Puech says he is completely unable to track where his six million Hermès shares have gone. Puech claims his former financial advisor Eric Freymond stole the assets in a “gigantic fraud” orchestrated over more than two decades, reports the Wall Street Journal. Freymond denies the allegations, claiming Puech himself may be lying to avoid inheritance taxes and transfer his wealth to longtime employees. Puech has filed multiple lawsuits in Geneva against Freymond, but the Swiss courts have dismissed them, citing insufficient evidence and an overall lack of attention to his financial affairs. And the legal battles continue as the Hermès family and others try to uncover the truth behind the missing billions. Hermès was founded in 1837 by Thierry Hermès in Paris, originally creating finely crafted harnesses and bridles for horse-drawn carriages. Over time, the company expanded into luxury leather goods, accessories, and clothing, earning a reputation as one of the world’s most prestigious luxury brands.

A Leap Towards New All-Time High For Dogecoin Delving into Dogecoin’s current price action, seasoned market expert and investor Master Kenobi has underscored DOGE’s path to a new all-time high while offering a potential time frame for the milestone. As the crypto community awaits this historical moment, the market expert claims DOGE hitting a new peak is much closer than widely expected. Master Kenobi’s prognosis is based on aligning events roughly two months ahead between this current cycle and the previous one. “Back then, the start was on November 3, 2020, while this time it kicked off on September 2, 2024,” he added. Given that Master Kenobi’s long-term forecast for Dogecoin for the past 1.5 years has come to pass, he is confident that what comes next will likely fit into the rest of his expectations. As a result, the analyst claims that the dog-themed meme coin is at most two weeks away from reaching a new all-time high, particularly between December 2 and 9, considering the weekly chart of DOGE. While several members of the community may express disbelief in this prediction, Kenobi has drawn attention to the last two market cycles where Dogecoin saw a breakout to past peaks, suggesting that history might repeat itself and DOGE could experience a massive breakout from the green trendline to the orange line as indicated in his chart. Since the expert is confident about Dogecoin hitting a new all-time in the following weeks, he has expressed his robust contentment with historical price trends as they are the only trustworthy resource to get a glimpse of DOGE’s future. Meanwhile, following its rally, Kenobi anticipates the next target halfway of the orange line positioned at the $2.90 level or double the previous all-time high price, which would put the meme coin between $1.40 and $1.45 in the coming weeks. With optimism brewing and DOGE gaining traction across various sectors, traders and investors are closely watching for more signs of a sustained upward direction in anticipation of a significant rally to new highs akin to past trends. DOGE In A Consolidation Phase? In the past few days, DOGE has fluctuated between the $0.36 and $0.42 levels, sparking speculations of a possible consolidation phase. Given the renewed strength in the market, DOGE’s trend within the range may be brief, as the current momentum could bolster the meme coin’s uptrend. Dogecoin is displaying upside potential, rising by 1% in the past day despite a decline in its daily trading volume. Meanwhile, in the larger view, such as the weekly and monthly time frame, the meme coin has increased by over 4% and 141%, respectively.",Dogecoin|Doge|dogecoin|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Master Kenobi|meme coin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|BONK|SEI|BSV|WLD|HNT|FTT|BTG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-11-29 01:30:40

Qubetics Might Be the Next Big Thing,https://thecoinrise.com/still-thinking-about-tron-qubetics-might-be-the-next-big-thing/,"The crypto world’s buzzing as usual, and if you’ve been paying attention, you’ve probably heard about Tron’s recent moves. From blockchain enthusiasts to big-shot investors, everyone’s been talking about its growing ecosystem and affordable transaction fees. But let’s face it—if you’re just jumping into the Tron party now, you might feel like you’ve missed the best part. The good news? You’ve still got time to ride the wave with two standout cryptos: Tron ($TRX) and the game-changing Qubetics ($TICS) . These projects are creating serious buzz for those looking for the best crypto to buy in November 2024 . Tron has already earned its spot in the blockchain hall of fame, but Qubetics is the new kid on the block, offering solutions to problems the crypto world has struggled with for years. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, these two cryptos are worth a closer look. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Everyone’s Talking About Solving Real Problems with Real-World Asset Tokenisation Ever get frustrated with how clunky and complicated blockchain can be? That’s where Qubetics shines. Unlike many crypto projects that focus on hype, Qubetics is all about utility. It’s the world’s first Web3 aggregator , uniting major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into one cohesive ecosystem. But what’s got people buzzing is its real-world asset tokenisation (RWAT) platform. Imagine you’re a small business owner with assets like equipment or real estate. Normally, turning those assets into liquid funds would involve tedious processes and middlemen. With Qubetics, you can tokenize those assets and trade them on a blockchain seamlessly. Say you own a fleet of food trucks. You could tokenize your trucks and secure quick liquidity to expand your business. Artists can do the same with their work, turning sculptures or paintings into tradable tokens without handing over hefty commissions to galleries. This isn’t just theoretical. Qubetics’ technology is already attracting real-world interest. The Qubetics presale, now in its 10th stage, has sold over 227 million tokens to more than 4,300 holders, raising over $3.3 million. With $TICS priced at $0.025, investors are getting in before a planned 10% price increase in the next stage this weekend. Investment Potential: Why Analysts Are All In on $TICS Let’s get to the numbers, shall we? Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 at the end of the presale , offering an 871% ROI. But that’s just the beginning. After the presale, $TICS is projected to soar to $1, giving investors a jaw-dropping 3,787% return. And if it climbs to $15 post-mainnet launch? That’s a staggering 58,213% ROI. To put that into perspective, a $5,000 investment at the current price of $0.025 could land you $43,500 by the presale’s end. Hold onto your tokens until $1, and you’ve got $200,000. If $TICS reaches $15, you’re looking at $3 million. Yeah, those are life-changing numbers. Tron: The Blockchain Veteran with Staying Power Tron’s been around long enough to prove it’s no passing trend. With a focus on decentralised content sharing, Tron has carved out a niche that sets it apart from other blockchains. Its ecosystem—spanning DeFi, gaming, and NFTs—has grown steadily, and its affordable transaction fees make it a favourite for developers and users alike. At its core, Tron’s mission is to decentralise the internet. Platforms like YouTube and Spotify may dominate the content world, but Tron gives power back to creators, allowing them to earn directly from their audience without middlemen taking a cut. This has made Tron a go-to platform for content creators, especially in emerging markets. But Tron isn’t just about content. Its DeFi ecosystem is expanding rapidly, offering users a range of decentralised financial services, from lending and borrowing to yield farming. And let’s not forget its growing presence in the gaming world, where developers are leveraging Tron’s speed and efficiency to create next-gen blockchain games. Conclusion: Two Cryptos, Two Paths to Success Whether you’re chasing massive returns or looking for a stable investment, Qubetics and Tron are two of the best cryptos to buy in November 2024 . Qubetics’ innovative approach to asset tokenisation and user-friendly blockchain development tools make it a standout for those seeking high-growth opportunities. Tron, with its proven track record and expanding ecosystem, offers a mix of stability and potential that’s hard to ignore. The clock’s ticking. Qubetics’ $TICS tokens are still priced at $0.025, but the next presale stage is just around the corner. Meanwhile, Tron continues to grow, offering steady returns for those who believe in its vision of a decentralised internet. Whether you’re all about the moonshot or prefer a steady climb, now’s the time to make your move.

Cardano (ADA) Price Set for Major Rally, $1.50 Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, is poised to continue its upward momentum after trading sideways for a week. On November 29, 2024, ADA has formed a bullish price action pattern on a smaller time frame and is on the verge of a breakout. This breakout could potentially propel ADA’s price to a new high and attract new investors. ADA Price Action, Breakout Imminent? According to expert technical analysis, ADA has formed a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders price action, signaling a potential breakout. Source: Trading View Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction Based on recent price action and technical analysis, if ADA breaches the neckline of the pattern and closes a four-hour candle above the $1.07 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 15% to reach the $1.23 level in the coming days, and potentially even higher to $1.50 if the momentum remains unchanged. On the positive side, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the altcoin has sufficient room for upward momentum in the coming days. The chart on the four-hour time frame shows that ADA’s RSI is currently at 59, which is below the overbought zone of 70. Bullish On-Chain Metrics ADA’s bullish technical outlook is further supported by large holders and traders. According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, traders and investors are actively participating in the altcoin. Coinglass’s ADA spot inflow/outflow data indicates that whales and investors have significantly accumulated the token. Since November 17, 2024, ADA has experienced negative net flow, meaning whales and traders have continuously withdrawn tokens from exchanges to their wallets. Source: Coinglass This negative net flow is a bullish sign for token holders and suggests that a price decline is less likely in the coming days. Additionally, traders also appear bullish, as indicated by the ADA Long/Short ratio. This Coinglass metric currently stands at 1.10, reflecting strong bullish sentiment among traders. At present, 54% of top traders hold long positions, while 46% hold short positions. Source: Coinglass Combining these on-chain metrics with technical analysis suggests that bulls are currently dominating the asset, which could support the altcoin in an upcoming bull run. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $1.04 and has experienced an upside momentum of 2.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume dropped by 40%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-11-29 01:45:47

If you missed out on early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu action, don’t sweat it. The meme coin scene is hotter than ever, and right now, three projects are making waves: BTFD Coin (BTFD), Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). From a presale offering massive ROI to tokens riding on bullish waves, here’s everything you need to know to make your move on the best meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin: The Presale Opportunity You Can’t Afford to Miss BTFD—short for “Buy The Dip”—isn’t just a token; it’s a rallying cry for traders who see opportunity in market downturns. Built on Ethereum, BTFD combines meme coin appeal with real utility through a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a passionate community dubbed the “Bulls Squad.” Currently, BTFD’s presale is in its fourth stage. Over 8.5 billion tokens have been sold to 700+ holders, raising $220,000. Investors are snapping up BTFD tokens at just $0.000038, with prices set to jump in stage five. By the presale’s end, the token will list at $0.0006, promising a whopping 15x ROI for early adopters. For instance: You spot a crypto gem in its early days. If you grab $350 worth of tokens at presale prices, and by the time it lists, your investment balloons by 15x. This isn’t a fantasy—it’s the reality for those getting in on BTFD Coin’s presale. When the price hits $0.0006, your investment would soar to $5,526. That’s the kind of return that turns heads. With a total supply capped at 173 billion coins, BTFD’s scarcity aligns perfectly with its goal: to reward early believers. Plus, its upcoming P2E game and staking rewards, offering up to 90% APY, make this token more than just a meme—it’s a movement. If you’re on the hunt for the best meme coins to join today, BTFD is leading the charge. Goatseus Maximus: The Underdog Defying Market Trends While the broader crypto market wavers, Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is defying the odds. After hitting an all-time high (ATH) of $1.22 on November 17, GOAT entered a consolidation phase, only to surge by 15% in the last 24 hours. It’s now trading at $0.8612, with a market cap of $861.09M. What’s driving this rally? For starters, GOAT has ties to the AI sector, particularly through its connection to the Truth Terminal bot. With AI cryptos rallying thanks to a $1.5 billion investment in OpenAI, GOAT is riding the coattails of this trend, even if it’s not a full-fledged AI token. Add to that a 34% increase in trading volume, and it’s clear that investor interest is heating up. However, technical indicators show selling pressure could lead to price consolidation. If GOAT surpasses its $0.93878 resistance, it could challenge its ATH once again. But failure to maintain momentum might see the price dip to $0.5. Still, for those looking for meme coins with staying power, GOAT’s strong community and bullish sentiment (with 77% of CoinMarketCap voters optimistic) make it a project to watch. Pepe Coin: The OG Meme Token Making a Comeback Pepe Coin (PEPE) needs no introduction. Born from one of the internet’s most iconic memes, PEPE has carved out a niche in the crypto world. Currently, analysts predict a massive 225.86% price surge, pushing it to $0.00006430 by December 27, 2024. Why the optimism? PEPE has recorded a solid 40% green days over the last 30 days, despite a 36.26% price volatility. On-chain metrics show bullish sentiment, with a Fear & Greed Index score of 75 (Greed) reflecting high investor confidence. This resurgence places PEPE in direct competition with heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. With its legacy as one of the best-known meme tokens and the current bullish wave, PEPE is firmly among the best meme coins to join today. Why BTFD Is the Top Pick Among the Best Meme Coins to Join Today While GOAT and PEPE have strong cases, BTFD Coin stands out for its presale ROI potential, innovative ecosystem, and community-driven ethos. Whether it’s the upcoming P2E game or staking rewards, BTFD offers multiple ways to grow your investment. The presale’s structured stages, with escalating prices, reward early investors with the best rates. Missed out on Dogecoin or Shiba Inu in their early days? Don’t make the same mistake—BTFD is your ticket to the next big thing. Conclusion: Secure Your Spot in the Meme Coin Boom The meme coin market is thriving, and projects like BTFD , Goatseus Maximus, and Pepe Coin are proof that there’s still plenty of room for growth. But timing is everything. With BTFD’s presale offering a 15x ROI, now is the perfect time to act. Don’t wait for the bull run to take off without you. Dive into the best meme coins to join today and secure your stake in the future of crypto. Join the BTFD Coin presale now—because the dip is yours to own.

Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion Has Just Registered A Spike In a new post on X, Glassnode has shared an update on the Seller Exhaustion Composite for the Weekly-Monthly Bitcoin traders. The “Seller Exhaustion Composite” here refers to an indicator that basically identifies whether selling on the network has reached a state of exhaustion or not. The metric bases itself on a few on-chain indicators, with perhaps the most notable being the Realized Loss , which measures the total amount of loss that the BTC investors are locking in. Historically, the cryptocurrency’s price has tended to form bottoms whenever holder capitulation has reached a high. In such loss-taking events, coins transfer from the weak hands to the resolute entities, so the risk of further selling reduces, allowing for the asset to find a rebound. In the context of the current topic, the Seller Exhaustion Composite of only the Weekly-Monthly BTC traders is of interest. These are the investors who purchased their coins between one day and one month ago. The reason Glassnode has picked this specific cohort is that there is a statistical relationship between holding time and the tendency to sell. The HODLers of the market carry their coins for long periods and, therefore, aren’t very likely to participate in selling at any point. The only times that these diamond hands are forced into capitulation are the major cyclical downturns. On the other hand, the investors who are relatively fresh buyers can be prone to panic selling, so loss taking from them can appear in all phases of the cycle, even the bull market. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion Composite for new buyers in the market: As displayed in the above graph, the Seller Exhaustion Composite has just flashed a signal for the Bitcoin Weekly-Monthly traders. “This reflects high locked-in losses from BTC traders active in the last month,” notes Glassnode. The latest round of capitulation from these recent buyers has come as the cryptocurrency’s price has seen a tumble after its all-time high (ATH) above the $99,000 level. From the chart, it’s visible that the instances of high loss taking from this cohort all coincided with some sort of bottom in the price during the past year. Given this pattern, it’s possible that Bitcoin may be able to find another bottom off the back of the capitulation this time as well. BTC Price Bitcoin had slipped all the way down towards $90,000 a couple of days back, but the coin seems to have made some recovery as it’s now floating around $95,400.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Bottom|Bitcoin Seller Exhaustion|bitcoin signal|btc|BTCUSDT|glassnode,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-11-29 02:30:41
