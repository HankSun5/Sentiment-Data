Recapturing 2017 BTC Peak,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/analyst-sees-double-digit-xrp-price-the-catch-recapturing-2017-btc-peak/,"Experts are thrilled about the chances that XRP, the cryptocurrency linked to Ripple, will hit new heights. Recent trends show that it could reach $20 if it can regain its 2017 high against Bitcoin. This hopeful prediction is based on the fact that the altcoin has shown strong signs of recovery, having come back from a low point of $1.28 earlier this week. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes Explosive Growth: Over 200% Surge Ahead, Analyst Says XRP’s Most Recent Performance XRP swiftly recovered from that low point, surpassing critical psychological levels at $1.3 and $1.4, and is currently pursuing a stable position above $1.5. The current market rally has led analysts to believe that the crypto asset may outperform Bitcoin due to its upward momentum. Crypto analyst CryptoBull has been particularly vocal about this potential, stating that if XRP can reclaim its 2017 peak against Bitcoin, the price could skyrocket to $20. Analyzing the #XRP price in Dollars vs Bitcoin shows us how early we are in this bullrun. We are still 1,500% behind in Bitcoin value compared to early 2017. If we meet the same Bitcoin value $XRP price will be around $20. pic.twitter.com/ofxd6Izv5g — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) November 26, 2024 XRP has faced great difficulties in its competitiveness with Bitcoin since its all-time top of $3.31 in January 2018. The value of the cryptocurrency in respect to BTC has been dropping over recent months. Still, new data shows XRP has surged by an amazing 111% against Bitcoin this month, implying a possible breakout is about ready. Resistance Levels Broken In order for XRP to maintain its upward trajectory, it must overcome substantial resistance levels. In an effort to conclude the month above the descending trendline that has plagued XRP since July of last year, analysts are closely monitoring the price action. If successful, this could presage additional gains and corroborate a bullish breakout. The current trading value of the altcoin against Bitcoin stands at about 0.00001544 BTC and still remains much lower than it reached at its historical high. CryptoBull still sees hope, though, and believes a similar rally to that of the early 2017 market might send XRP right back into double digits. XRP: Predictions And Market Sentiment The broader cryptocurrency industry is also seeing a comeback while Bitcoin tries to break past the $95,000 level. Analysts believe that if XRP can turn the important $2 resistance level into support, then a fast climb towards $20 might be started. Related Reading: Critical XRP Warning: Analyst Flags Biggest Reason To Sell Apart from these technical factors, regulatory optimism also plays a role in how the market shapes its sentiment. The upcoming resignation of the SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, can lead to better regulatory conditions for cryptocurrencies like XRP, which further boosts the euphoria surrounding Ripple’s prospect. XRP is currently trading at approximately $1.47, which represents a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Many investors are closely monitoring the altcoin as it navigates this critical phase of its market voyage, as analysts anticipate that bullish momentum will persist.

36974283,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=655407,1732836654,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Analyst Maps Out Dogecoin Price Arc To $3 Using A Logarithmic Scale,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-arc-to-3/,"Crypto analyst KrissPax has predicted that the Dogecoin price can rally to as high as $3 in this market cycle. The analyst further explained how the foremost meme coin will reach this price target using the Logarithmic scale. Dogecoin Price To Reach $3 In an X post, KrissPax highlighted a path for the Dogecoin price to reach $3. He drew attention to a Dogecoin chart that connects the monthly tops of 2017 and 2021, with an arc representing diminishing returns with a larger market cap, using a logarithmic scale. He suggested that the first step to reaching this $3 target will be for Dogecoin to reach $1. However, the analyst is convinced that the meme coin can reach $3 in this cycle. Based on crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade’s recent analysis, this Dogecoin price rally to $1 could happen soon, putting the rally to $3 in motion. In an X post, the analyst said the Dogecoin Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been bouncing up from the oversold zone on a 4-hour chart. The recent RSI bounces from the same zone caused Dogecoin to surge 40% and 200%. The crypto analyst added that the pump intensity is even getting stronger. In line with this, he remarked that it won’t be surprising if the Dogecoin price spikes beyond the 200% level and rallies above $1.15. Trader Tardigrade also recently predicted that Dogecoin could rise as high as $3.52. This came as he noted how the meme coin always enjoys a 2x increase from previous local tops. Meanwhile, as these crypto analysts have suggested, this $3 target might not be the market top for the Dogecoin price in this market cycle. Crypto analyst Philip recently predicted that Dogecoin could at least reach a conservative target of $5. The analyst made this prediction in relation to DOGE’s performance in previous cycles. Anything Above $5 Is Unrealistic In an X post, crypto analyst Master Kenobi asserted that any chart projecting the Dogecoin price above $5 in this market cycle is unrealistic. He made this claim in relation to what Dogecoin’s market cap would be if it were to reach targets above $5, which he believes cannot happen in this bull run. Master Kenobi warned investors about looking forward to these price targets above $5 as they risk becoming bagholders for another four years. As to how high he believes the Dogecoin price can rise in this cycle, the analyst predicts that the range between $1 and $2 is realistic. He is confident that the rally to $1 could mirror Bitcoin’s rally from $1,000 to $10,000, and the rally to $2 could happen the same way BTC rallied$10,000 to $20,000 in just two weeks. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.4, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

He added that the recent court decision was a victory for the crypto sector and those supporting freedom. Privacy wins. Today the Fifth Circuit held that @USTreasury’s sanctions against Tornado Cash smart contracts are unlawful. This is a historic win for crypto and all who cares about defending liberty. @coinbase is proud to have helped lead this important challenge. 1/6 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) November 26, 2024 Tornado Cash’s victory is the latest in a string of wins for the crypto industry, which has helped push Bitcoin’s price up. The crypto sector is also anticipating the next moves of incoming US President Donald Trump, who is expected to adopt crypto-friendly policies. Hoskinson Remains Bullish On BTC For some analysts and observers, Bitcoin’s recent losses were just a retracement, and the bullish sentiment remains. For Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, Bitcoin remains on the bullish trend, and he thinks that the asset’s price can increase to $250k and $500k in 12 to 24 months. According to Hoskinson, a few factors help boost Bitcoin’s price stability. He mentioned that there is still a growing interest in Bitcoin as an asset. For example, MicroStrategy has been increasing its Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s company currently holds $32 billion worth of BTC, and its market cap now exceeds $70 billion. Other countries are also interested in Bitcoin, with El Salvador being the top country outside the US in harnessing the asset.
