Or grab Snek before it made millionaires overnight? The next big crypto opportunities are happening now with the top new meme coins to join today and those who hesitate risk being left behind. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Snek (SNEK) have already made their mark, but a new beast is entering the ring— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With its presale in the final stretch and an insane 3650% ROI potential, there’s a reason investors are piling in before it’s too late. BTFD Coin has captured the hearts of over 11,100 holders and sold more than 70 billion coins, raising a staggering $6.21 million so far. With a referral program that rewards users for spreading the word and staking rewards as high as 90% APY, this is more than just another meme coin—it’s a revolution. The 14th stage of the presale is already 98.50% complete, and at just $0.00016 per token, the window to claim massive returns is closing fast. Those who wait might have to pay a premium later—or miss out entirely. BTFD Coin: 3650% ROI Potential and the Most Rewarding Referral Program in Crypto BTFD isn’t just a meme—it’s a battle cry. Buying the dip is more than a strategy; it’s a mindset that has built fortunes in the crypto world. BTFD Coin embodies that philosophy perfectly, offering early investors a shot at incredible gains before the bull market kicks into overdrive. The presale is structured in 16 stages, with each phase pushing the price higher. Right now, in Stage 14, you can secure BTFD at $0.00016. Once the presale ends, the price is set to hit $0.0006, delivering a 275% return immediately. But that’s just the beginning. Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, which translates to a jaw-dropping 3650% ROI for those who get in now. Let’s break it down. If you invest $3,750 at the current price of $0.00016, you’ll receive 23.4 million BTFD tokens. At the presale’s closing price of $0.0006, your holdings would already be worth $14,040. But if BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006, that same investment could balloon to an astonishing $140,400. And that’s not all—BTFD Coin rewards you just for bringing others in. Their referral program lets you earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens when your code is used. If your referrals purchase at least $50, they get an extra 10% in tokens, making this one of the most rewarding referral programs in crypto. Add in the staking program—where holders can earn a massive 90% APY—and BTFD isn’t just another hype among the top new meme coins to join today. It’s a wealth-building machine designed for those who know how to seize opportunities before they explode. Pudgy Penguins: The NFT Sensation Expanding Beyond the Blockchain Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) started as an NFT project but has since evolved into something much bigger. With an army of loyal holders and a strong brand, PENGU has become one of the most recognizable names in the meme and NFT space. Its recent expansions into merchandise and physical collectibles have driven renewed interest, proving that this isn’t just a fleeting trend—it’s a cultural movement. As Pudgy Penguins continue to dominate the NFT world, investors are taking notice. While it may not have the same explosive ROI potential as a presale like BTFD, PENGU remains a powerhouse in the crypto space, particularly for those who believe in the long-term future of digital collectibles. Snek: Cardano’s Meme Coin King Snek (SNEK) has established itself as the go-to meme coin on the Cardano network. Unlike other meme tokens that exist purely for the hype, SNEK has built a dedicated community and a solid foundation, making it one of the most talked-about projects on Cardano. What makes Snek stand out? Its strong grassroots movement and focus on decentralization have made it a favorite among crypto purists. While it may not promise the 3650% ROI potential of BTFD, its track record of growth and resilience in the market makes it an attractive choice for those who believe in Cardano’s long-term vision. Final Thoughts Timing is everything in crypto, and right now, BTFD Coin is in the sweet spot. The presale is almost over, the price is still at an entry-level discount, and the community is growing by the day. Unlike established meme coins like Pudgy Penguins and Snek, BTFD offers a chance to get in before the hype fully takes off. Based on market trends and our research, early-stage investments in presales have historically outperformed later-stage buys. Those who recognized Dogecoin’s potential early turned small investments into fortunes. The same goes for Shiba Inu. BTFD Coin is shaping up to be the next big success story—but only for those who act fast on the top new meme coins to join today. Join the BTFD presale before it’s too late. Visit the BTFD website , connect your wallet, and secure your tokens today. The 14th stage is almost full, and this price won’t last much longer.

He argues that the cryptoverse is in safe hands as key players brace for sweeping regulations and policy changes. Cardano Founder Douses Speculation For Crypto Role By US Government As the US crypto regulatory landscape braces for changes, insiders say Hoskinson is in the offing for a White House crypto role by community members. A meeting with an unnamed VIP in Florida has sent tongues wagging that the Cardano founder could be in the thick of things in shaping US crypto policy. However, Hoskinson has refuted speculation that he could be appointed to a crypto role, adding that “meetings do not imply endorsement. Hoskinson’s X post confirmed that a crypto role in the White House is not within reach at the moment. Hoskinson added that he will not be making any comments on the topic of a crypto appointment unless he obtains new relevant information. Citing the cross-agency collaboration for crypto regulations , the Cardano founder argues that the industry has proper representation from experts and enthusiasts. “At this juncture, further comments and speculation are both counterproductive and unnecessary,” said Hoskinson. The Cardano founder is in pole position to attend the inaugural White House Crypto Summit on Friday but details are still sparse. Stepping Up To Defend XRP Following Inclusion In Strategic Reserve Cardano’s community is still buzzing from President Trump’s decision to include ADA in the Crypto Strategic Reserve . Amid the hype, the Cardano founder has waded in to defend XRP’s inclusion in the Strategic Reserve in the face of criticisms. Hoskinson argues that the underlying technology of XRP is “great” and points to its community resilience in the face of a lengthy regulatory witchhunt. His comments come on the heels of scathing criticisms by Peter Schiff with XRP’s community expressing gratitude to Hoskinson for stepping up. “XRP is great technology, a global standard, survived a decade through many harsh cycles, and has one of the strongest communities,” said Hoskinson.

41074739,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=241890,1740956261,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ethereum Price Gains 15% in 1 Hour as Trump Finally Confirms ETH for Crypto Strategic Reserve,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-forecast-trump-confirms-eth-sol-ada-xrp-btc-us-crypto-strategic-reserve/,"Ethereum price surged 15%, climbing from $2,200 to $2,550 within a frenetic one-hour period on Sunday, March 2, after Trump confirmed ETH’s inclusion in the official Crypto Strategic Reserve. Ethereum (ETH) Price Soars 15% as Trump Confirms ETH Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Ethereum price action came under intense scrutiny over the weekend as markets reacted to Trump’s official confirmation of the much-anticipated Crypto Strategic Reserve. Notably, Trump had initially omitted ETH from the list of altcoins to be included in the strategic reserve bucket of assets. The announcement, which came around noon in the U.S. trading session, had featured only SOL, ADA, and XRP, sparking concerns that ETH was excluded due to recent network update squabbles and changes in leadership. “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum! – Donald Trump, via Truth Social, March 2, 2025 Within an hour, SOL, XRP, ADA, and Bitcoin prices all rose by double digits , while ETH remained rooted at the $2,200 level. However, nearly two hours after the initial announcement, Trump issued another post clarifying that both ETH and BTC were also included on the list of assets to be acquired by the United States Treasury. US President Donald Trump Confirms ETH Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Following this clarification, ETH price promptly joined the rally. Within one hour of Trump’s second post, Ethereum surged 15%, moving from $2,200 to reclaim territory above the $2,550 level. Bulls Establish 80% Dominance in ETH Derivatives Market Considering that XRP and Cardano have now recorded gains exceeding 20% at press time, ETH could potentially witness further upside, especially as U.S.-based investors holding ETH ETFs could mount major buy orders when markets reopen on Monday, March 3. Movements observed in the derivatives market show that some strategic traders deployed massive leverage on Sunday in hopes of booking amplified profits if the trading week begins on a positive note, as widely anticipated after Trump included ETH in the Crypto Strategic Reserve. Coinglass Liquidation Map data, which measures the real-time balance of leverage deployed on active long futures contracts against shorts, shows bulls established significant dominance on Sunday, hinting that the majority of traders are betting on further gains when markets reopen for the week. Ethereum Liquidation Map data, March 2, 2025 | Coinglass The ETH liquidation map chart above shows that bulls mounted a total of $1.14 billion at press time on Sunday, while short leverage has dwindled to just $333 million. This reflects that bulls now dominate the ETH market, with long leverage exceeding shorts by approximately 70%. Aligning with the trending news events, it appears short traders are opting to close out their positions early rather than risk bigger losses, as the current ETH price rally has the backing of the United States government. With the U.S. government set to begin the official process of purchasing ETH, BTC, SOL, and ADA, the current bullish setup in the derivatives market could persist. Unless another comparable bearish catalyst arises, ETH is poised to face weakened resistance levels as it approaches the $3,000 mark in the week ahead, as implied by the dwindling short positions in the derivatives market. Ethereum Foundation’s Leadership Shuffle also Lifted Market Sentiment Another key factor contributing to the positive swing in Ethereum’s market momentum was the leadership change announced by the Ethereum Foundation on Saturday, March 1. The Foundation appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher with seven years of experience, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, as co-Executive Directors. This leadership restructuring aims to enhance technical expertise and improve communication within the Ethereum ecosystem. Following recent controversies surrounding network updates, this leadership shuffle has lifted investor sentiment ahead of President Trump’s major announcement on Sunday. ETH Price Forecast: Falling Wedge Pattern Hints $4K Rally Ahead After intraday 15.72% gains, Ethereum price forecast charts continue to flash bullish signals for a potential rally towards $4,000 as March 2025 kicks off on a positive note. As seen below, the ETHUSDT 12-hour chart reveals a textbook falling wedge breakout, a historically strong reversal pattern. If confirmed by a decisive close above the upper trendline near $2,500, ETH price could advance further towards $3,000 mark, especially as the 70% bullish dominance in the derivatives market hints weaker resistance clusters at key price levels ahead. Typically, the falling wedge pattern projects a measured move equal to the height of the formation, with the current target signaling a potential ETH price rally toward $4,000 in the coming weeks. ETH Price Forecast The strong bullish candle on the breakout signals robust buying interest, reinforced by increasing volume, confirming the validity of the trend reversal. The price currently hovers around $2,514, with the next key resistance zone near $2,800, which previously acted as a supply zone. If Ethereum clears this level, momentum could accelerate toward the $3,200-$3,400 range, aligning with the upper bound of historical resistance. A sustained move above this threshold would validate the full breakout target near $4,000. On the flip side, failure to hold above $2,500 could invite selling pressure, potentially retesting the former resistance-turned-support level at $2,300. A break below this threshold might invalidate the bullish setup, opening the door for a deeper pullback. However, given the strength of the breakout, Ethereum bulls appear poised for further gains in the near term.

Based on historical data DOGECAPITAL predicts Dogecoin’s value will reach $10 during 2025 following support line retracements before price explosions. Dogecoin’s annual value increase during 2024 outperformed both 2016 and 2020 since it reached 3.5 times its initial value but surpassed the 1.5x increase from 2016 and 2.5x growth from 2020. Analysts predict that Dogecoin could rise beyond $1.70 after institutions started buying more than 530 million units within 72 hours and continued this trend. As this happens, a newer crypto project is stealthily positioning itself with superior prospects: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dogecoin price predictions Dogecoin needs to follow its historical patterns to reach the $10 milestone. The weekly price movements of Dogecoin match historical bull hierarchies as analyzed by DOGECAPITAL. The support level once located near $0.20 currently undergoes retesting as liquidation phase prior to recent parabolic increases. Two significant consolidations during 2017 and 2021 triggered DOGE to start its multi-year price surge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows historical triggering points for market rallies which both analyst communities and Trader Tardigrade agree demonstrate a bullish pattern in Dogecoin structure. Skeptics warn about the impact of speculative trading and meme-aged hype for sustaining Dogecoin’s expansion despite forecasts that it will reach $1 after its current surge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully brought in large capital sums during its second token presale period as Dogecoin moves towards record-breaking prices. Token holders have accumulated tokens worth over $2 million at the beginning of the two presale stages when prices started at $0.015. The innovative lending model together with tokenomics system creates an immediate opportunity for presale investors because they will experience a 33.3% profit increase when prices reach $0.02 at the next stage. The MUTM cryptocurrency launch price will start at $0.06 following its launch therefore providing a 300% value increase above its present presale value of $0.015. After launch there is a strong prediction that MUTM tokens will rise to $10 through a buy-and-distribute system that supports continued token ownership. Mutuum Finance stands apart because of integrated demand systems that operate within its framework. The mtTokens system in Mutuum Finance grows in value due to their functioning as interest-generating assets. Users who deposit ETH or DAI tokens receive equivalent mtETH or mtDAI tokens that generate yields while enabling smooth operations between DeFi platforms. The system provides passive income and complete liquidity features which resolve an important shortfall in decentralized lending systems. The platform allocates 20 percent of its revenue toward MUTM token repurchases to cause permanent market demand. Users who receive distributed tokens after repurchases have the ability to prevent token sell-offs thus stabilizing the long-term value. A considerable $100,000 prize giveaway program drives the protocol’s rapid expansion of loyal users. Presale Momentum Highlights Limited-Time Opportunity The initial pre-sale stage for Mutuum Finance achieved a total sellout within short time because investors showed significant interest in practical decentralized finance options. The price during Phase 2 stands at $0.015 as one of the last available buying opportunities before Mutuum Finance goes public on exchanges. Investors participating at present have the potential to achieve returns of above 300% when the project goes live while long-term targets point toward a probable $10 value. Although MUTM demonstrates structured growth through its planned rise it falls behind Dogecoin’s 3.5x annual gain performance point. The real-world financial applications Mutuum Finance utilizes make it delegate the volatile meme-driven performance of Dogecoin due to analyst predictions of sustained higher returns. Dogecoin’s potential ascent to $10 hinges on historical trends and speculative fervor, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a concrete alternative rooted in DeFi innovation. With its presale advancing rapidly and mechanisms designed to sustain demand, MUTM presents a time-sensitive opportunity for exponential gains. As the crypto market shifts toward utility-driven projects, early investors in Mutuum Finance may well eclipse those waiting for Dogecoin’s next meme-fueled peak.

Dogecoin Holders Pay Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/is-rcof-going-to-1-from-0-1-by-march-2025-dogecoin-holders-pay-attention/,"Dogecoin has dropped below $0.20 for the first time since November 2024, right before Trump’s re-election. Now, the memecoin is tumbling, leaving investors wondering how low the beloved memecoin can go. As whales rush to buy the dip, other investors are looking elsewhere for projects with real utility and high growth potential. Dogecoin holders are paying attention to RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin that analysts predict could soar from $0.1 to $1 by March 2025. With its cutting-edge trading tools and groundbreaking features, RCOF will be a game changer in crypto. Dogecoin (DOGE) Plunges 10%: How Low can the Memecoin go? At press time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing bearing momentum having dropped by 9.9% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.1882. In the past three days, Dogecoin (DOGE) whales have bought the dip, accumulating about 530 million tokens. From technical analysis, Dogecoin appears bearish but has been consolidating in a tight range near its crucial support of $0.175. Based on historical patterns, Dogecoin is still bearish and could drop further by 15%. The king of memecoins is trading below 200 EMA in the daily timeframe indicating a downtrend. Again, on-chain data shows that intraday derivatives signal traders have abandoned Dogecoin, witnessed by its dropping open interest. Since January 2025, Dogecoin’s open interest has fallen from $5.25 billion to $1.79 billion. This signals fading investor interest due to declining momentum and market volatility. With bearish momentum, Dogecoin holders are shifting focus to a utility altcoin, RCOF, which provides groundbreaking innovations. Similarly, analysts predict that the crypto could rise from its current price of $0.10 to $1 by March 2025. The rise of RCOF: Web3 project Attracting Dogecoin Holders As Dogecoin experiences bearish momentum, RCOF is drawing in traders to its presale at an astonishing rate. The altcoin offers real utility through its integration of AI and blockchain technology. As a result, analysts predict that the altcoin could surge from $0.1 to $1 in the next month. RCOF’s AI-powered Robo-advisor is its crown jewel. This smart tool crafts personalized investment strategies based on their unique profiles, giving them a great advantage in the financial markets. The Robo-advisor eliminates emotional bias by understanding market trends through data-driven insights. This smart tool helps investors properly control their investments in both TradFi and DeFi markets.

The Robo-advisor analyzes everything from on-chain analytics, whale activity, social sentiments, and real-time data to detect tokens about to skyrocket or crash. For instance, the LIBRA token went viral and pumped overnight, but as quickly as it rose, it plummeted, leading to a loss of $4.4 billion in investor funds. If investors had access to RCOF’s Robo-advisor, they would have caught in the bullish signals in advance and been able to exit before losing their funds. Unlike Dogecoin, RCOF offers investors over 120,000 tradable assets, including traditional, digital, and tokenized assets. With a leverage option of up to 1,000x on select assets, investors can reap big rewards from a small stake, enabling them to maximize returns.

The token now has a $166.49 billion market cap, more than 14% of Tether’s at $142.43 billion. XRP has surged by over 30% following President Donald Trump’s post on his social media platform, Truth Social. In his post, Trump claimed he directed the inclusion of the XRP token in the Crypto Strategic Reserve. The president‘s message seems to have ignited investor confidence in the token, driving buying activity. Source: Cryptorank Donald Trump says he directed the inclusion of XRP, SOL and ADA tokens in the Crypto Strategic Reserve As part of his plan to make the US the crypto capital of the world, Trump had previously suggested the institution of a national crypto reserve. This Sunday, Trump made further comments on his reserve plans on Truth Social, saying: A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. President Donald Trump Following his post, XRP jumped 32%, ADA grew 62%, and SOL rose by almost 25%. Meanwhile, BTC climbed 10% in the last 24 hours, trading above $91,000, breaking past $80,000 to the $84,000 range. ETH also crossed $2,400, increasing by 13%. Aside from these crypto gains, analysts believe Trump’s decision will continue to drive more bullish momentum in the market. Some have even suggested it could spur institutional and government adoption. Digital asset prices first started picking up on Friday when Trump announced the March 7 crypto summit. XRP could trade as high as $3.40 if its bullish rally persists The Price DAA Divergence metric suggests a buy on the XRP token as the asset price has risen along with investor participation. Moreover, the number of active addresses is up, which means that new traders are engaging with the asset. All of these point to growing investor confidence in XRP, which in turn could help drive its prices higher. In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator shows that investors are still buying XRP, which could signal further price increases in the next few weeks. XRP is currently trading at $2.85 , poised to break through the $2.95 resistance and move further up to $3.00. Furthermore, analysts expect that if XRP is able to move above its resistance levels, it could trade as high as $3.40, which could attract more investors and buying pressure. However, if investors begin to cash out their gains early and the token’s momentum slows, the asset may fail to surpass its $2.95 resistance and dip to $2.70. If this happens, it may end its bullish rally temporarily before any more price movements surface. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Right now, SUI is facing a crucial moment as its price teeters on key resistance levels, while Astra is making waves with its explosive presale, securing over $1 million in its first day alone. These two projects are catching the eyes of community members, but the real star of the show might just be Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS) is shaping up to be one of the top crypto coins to buy now , thanks to its game-changing Web3 aggregator technology, non-custodial multi-chain wallet, and high-profile CertiK audit. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is built for real-world adoption, making cross-chain transactions seamless, secure, and efficient. With over 21,900 token holders already on board and a presale that has pulled in more than $14.4 million, Qubetics is proving it’s not just another hyped-up project—it’s a serious contender for the next breakout crypto. Qubetics: The Future of Secure and Interoperable Blockchain Transactions Blockchain fragmentation is a nightmare. Imagine trying to transfer assets across multiple blockchains, only to get hit with sky-high fees, slow transactions, and compatibility headaches. This is where Qubetics steps in, revolutionizing the industry as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. Qubetics’ interoperability features allow users to seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains without friction. It provides real-time asset transfers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. Whether you’re a developer building dApps, a business looking for secure cross-border transactions, or an individual managing multiple crypto assets, Qubetics simplifies the entire process. One of the major highlights of the Qubetics ecosystem is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. Unlike traditional wallets, which rely on centralized entities for asset storage, Qubetics gives users full control over their funds. It supports multiple blockchains, allowing users to manage assets across various networks without relying on third-party services. Think of it as the ultimate Web3 wallet—secure, decentralized, and built for the future. Qubetics Wallet and Blockchain Audit: A Game-Changer for Security Security is everything in crypto. Hacks, exploits, and rug pulls have left countless early buyers burned. This is why Qubetics has taken a proactive step by undergoing a comprehensive blockchain audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted security firms in the space. CertiK has audited some of the biggest projects in the industry, including Binance, Aave, Polygon, and PancakeSwap. Their deep-dive analysis of Qubetics’ smart contracts and wallet infrastructure ensures that the project meets the highest security standards. This not only boosts credibility but also instills confidence in the growing Qubetics community. With the audit nearing completion, analysts predict an even bigger surge in adoption as new participants recognize Qubetics as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics has also partnered with 1inch, a leading DeFi aggregator, to optimize decentralized trading for users. This integration connects Qubetics Wallet users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), providing the best possible rates, optimized liquidity, and seamless transactions. This partnership transforms Qubetics into more than just a wallet—it becomes a full-fledged trading hub for DeFi enthusiasts. Qubetics Presale: Limited-Time Opportunity for Exponential Gains With Stage 23 in full swing, the Qubetics presale has already raised $14.4 million, attracting over 21,900 holders and selling 493 million $TICS tokens. The current presale price is locked at $0.0888, but not for long—prices surge by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM as each presale stage lasts only 7 days. Those who move fast will secure the best possible entry price before Qubetics explodes onto the scene. Analyst predictions are fueling FOMO, with $0.25 expected by presale’s end (181.52% ROI). But the real action starts post-presale, with forecasts of $1 (1,026.09% ROI), $5 (5,530.44% ROI), and an astronomical $15 (16,791.32% ROI) after mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment now at $0.0888 could soar to $168,000 if TICS hits $15. Time is running out—will you be part of the next crypto giant? With a Q2 2025 mainnet launch already confirmed, this crypto presale is picking up serious momentum. The window to join one of the top crypto coins to buy now is closing fast. Astra Secures Over $1 Million in First 24 Hours of Presale Astra is making some serious noise in the crypto space, especially after securing over $1 million within the first 24 hours of its presale. As a project focused on decentralized applications and next-gen blockchain solutions, Astra is quickly positioning itself as a competitor in the race for Web3 dominance. The excitement surrounding Astra comes from its scalability and efficiency. The network is built to handle high transaction volumes without the congestion issues that plague older blockchains. Early buyers are eyeing Astra as a long-term hold, particularly as demand for scalable blockchain solutions grows. With the presale already gaining massive traction, Astra is proving to be a formidable player in the crypto market. However, its long-term success will depend on how well it delivers on its promises of scalability and decentralization. SUI Faces Critical Resistance as Market Uncertainty Grows SUI is at a crucial juncture as technical indicators show a struggle to maintain its current price levels. Recent chart patterns indicate a potential head-and-shoulders formation, which could signal a downturn if support levels don’t hold. Despite the volatility, SUI’s blockchain technology continues to attract attention. Designed for high-speed transactions and low fees, SUI aims to be one of the most scalable networks in the industry. But with uncertainty looming in the market, analysts are watching closely to see whether SUI can break past resistance or if it will experience further retracements. While the SUI ecosystem remains promising, short-term price action suggests caution. Some community members are holding strong, hoping for a breakout, but others are looking at alternatives like Qubetics, which offers real-world utility and lower risk of price instability. Conclusion: Is Qubetics the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now? The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities—Astra is crushing its presale, SUI is battling key resistance levels, but Qubetics stands out as one of the top crypto coins to buy now . Its CertiK audit, 1inch partnership, and multi-chain interoperability make it a strong contender for long-term adoption. With its Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon and a crypto presale that’s gaining serious momentum, Qubetics offers a rare chance to get in early on a project with sky-high potential. If you’re looking for a crypto presale with massive upside, join the Qubetics presale today before the next price jump.

Per the media outlet El Colombiano , Senator Gustavo Moreno and Congress Representative Julián López have rolled out a bill seeking to create a legal framework that “protects” the country’s crypto users. Colombia: Crypto Regulations ‘Urgently Needed,’ Say Lawmakers Moreno noted that the lack of regulation means that crypto exchanges and other firms operate in a rules-free space that “generates uncertainty and risk for customers.” Colombian senators meet in the nation’s senate in 2024. The Senator added that the “lack of regulation” means there are no “protection mechanisms for consumers.” Moreno added that Colombia does not have any “control to prevent the misuse of cryptoassets.” Blockchain analysts claim that over five million Colombians now use crypto. They say that during 2024, citizens and residents of the country transacted some $6.7 billion worth of tokens. But critics claim that adoption has been soured by a rise in crypto scams and crypto-related pyramid schemes. Others claim that some Colombians are using the largely unregulated crypto industry to launder illicit funds. The nation’s top financial regulator, the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (lit: Colombian Financial Superintendence), has been working on crypto-related pilots since 2021. However, the same media outlet noted that the Superintendencia’s pilots have not yet produced a “specific regulatory framework.” Such a framework would allow the Colombian crypto sector to “integrate with the national financial system,” the outlet wrote. The Colombian parliament building in Bogotá, Colombia. (Source: Bernard Gagnon [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Regulatory ‘Framework’ Bill The bill contains 16 clauses that cover monitoring, rules on marketing, education, crypto tax , and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures (AML/CFT). The lawmakers say that by “protecting users,” the law could also “encourage [crypto] investment” in the long term. “Colombia has fallen behind the rest of the world . While other countries are moving forward, [the industry here] remains unregulated. Our bill seeks to establish clear rules of the game. We want to generate a reliable and more attractive ecosystem for investment with built-in guarantees for this emerging industry.” Colombian lawmaker Julián López By appointing two trusted — but controversial — top aides to key cabinet posts, Gustavo Petro is trying a new tack to leave his mark on Colombia in the last 18 months of his presidency https://t.co/Fsntkmwbs4 — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) March 1, 2025 VASP Operating Permit System The bill seeks to introduce a licensing system for crypto operators, who would need to register as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). In other nations, VASP licensing systems are usually designed to force crypto exchanges and wallet firms to comply with AML/CFT protocols. The media outlet quoted the financial analyst Gregorio Gandini as stating that it was “important to regulate cryptocurrencies” because “they are becoming increasingly popular” in Colombia. He added: “If crypto is not regulated, [Colombians] will adopt them in an irregular manner.” Colombia's Petro to name Edwin Palma as new energy minister, source says https://t.co/SO2XPP52HR pic.twitter.com/3MODPLqnh1 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 27, 2025 However, the Colombian crypto investor Daniel Aguilar was quoted as stating that while it was important to provide a “safe framework” where firms could “grow and consolidate,” it was important “not to kill innovation with overly strict rules.” Aguilar said: “If regulation is too rigid, crypto companies and entrepreneurs could be forced to operate from other countries that have more flexible regulations. We need a legal framework that protects users without stifling the growth of the sector.” The investor also said that it was “important that cryptoassets are taxed reasonably.” Aguilar said lawmakers should avoid “creating tax burdens that discourage” crypto adoption in Colombia.

As new opportunities emerge, investors are keeping an eye on promising meme coins. With trends shifting fast, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. One of the most anticipated launches is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a meme coin presale unlike any other. Meanwhile, Peanut the Squirrel and Dog (Bitcoin) are also making waves in the market. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins. Token Burns: How Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) Maximizes Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has integrated an aggressive burn mechanism to enhance scarcity and drive long-term value. Every week, unsold tokens from the ongoing meme coin presale are permanently removed from circulation. But the burning doesn’t stop there—any remaining tokens post-presale will also be eliminated, ensuring a deflationary environment that benefits early adopters. This process, recorded transparently on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), increases the coin’s desirability by reducing supply. The continuous token burns create an ever-dwindling supply, driving demand and potentially amplifying future returns. With a strategic and verifiable burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself as one of the best new meme coin to join now. Penguinopolis Beckons – Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Is Moving Fast! Arctic Pablo Coin is unlike any other meme coin presale—it follows an adventurous storyline where each presale phase represents a new location. Currently, Arctic Pablo has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th stop on its journey. Investors are racing to get in at the current price of just $0.000067, as this phase offers a jaw-dropping potential ROI of 11,844.78% from now until the launch price of $0.008. Previously, Arctic Pablo Coin stormed through Blizzard Bay in under six days, finishing all ten prior locations ahead of schedule. With over $1.69 million already raised, demand is soaring, and each new location sees prices climb. This could be the last chance to enter at a bargain before the next milestone! Peanut the Squirrel’s Big Move – Latest Developments Peanut the Squirrel has taken center stage after securing a major exchange listing that catapulted its trading volume overnight. With increased liquidity and broader accessibility, investors are flocking to this quirky yet high-potential meme coin. Adding to the excitement, Peanut the Squirrel announced a new staking program, offering double-digit APYs for long-term holders. The project’s innovative approach and strong community backing continue to fuel speculation about its future price trajectory. Dog (Bitcoin) – A New Surge in Activity Dog (Bitcoin) has seen a remarkable resurgence as whale transactions hit record levels. Analysts suggest that this heightened activity could be linked to rumors of an upcoming partnership with a major blockchain platform. Meanwhile, the team behind Dog (Bitcoin) has been teasing an exclusive NFT drop, sparking excitement among collectors and traders alike. As momentum builds, many are watching closely to see if Dog (Bitcoin) can sustain this newfound traction. Final Thoughts – Which Coin Stands Out? With meme coins dominating the market, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) stands out as the most thrilling investment right now. Its deflationary burn mechanism, innovative presale structure, and rapidly increasing price make it a strong contender for high returns. Peanut the Squirrel and Dog (Bitcoin) are also making headlines, but Arctic Pablo’s journey through Penguinopolis is drawing the most attention. As prices continue to rise, now is the perfect moment to secure a spot in this groundbreaking meme coin presale.

Web3Bay, Helium, or Dogecoin?",https://thecoinrise.com/which-is-the-best-crypto-investment-for-2025-web3bay-helium-or-dogecoin/,"The crypto market is continuously transforming, drawing investors towards the best crypto investment in 2025. While the well-established Dogecoin (DOGE) and Helium (HNT) have secured dedicated user bases, Web3Bay (3BAY) is quickly rising as the leading candidate with its innovative decentralized e-commerce framework and a striking 3,633% ROI possibility. While Dogecoin is known for its memetic charm and Helium specializes in decentralized connectivity, Web3Bay is innovating e-commerce with actual applicability, governed by its community, and propelled by investor incentives. Its presale has already amassed over $1.60 million, with more than 390 million tokens distributed, signaling Web3Bay as a burgeoning high-growth investment. Let’s explore how these three cryptocurrencies compare, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and why Web3Bay presents the best blend of immediate and long-term growth prospects. Dogecoin (DOGE): Widely Used, but Functionally Limited Originating as a playful meme, Dogecoin swiftly climbed the ranks to become a globally recognized cryptocurrency, bolstered by community support and celebrity endorsements, including Elon Musk. It is popularly used for tipping and smaller transactions, even accepted by companies like Tesla and AMC for payments. Strengths of Dogecoin: Broad Adoption: Accepted widely, including by significant retailers for transactions. Economical Transactions: Faster and more cost-effective than transactions with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Vigorous Community: Continues to be highly engaged within the crypto community. Weaknesses of Dogecoin: Limited Technological Advancement: Lacks functionalities like smart contracts, remaining a simple transactional token. Market-Driven Volatility: Its value is heavily influenced by social media and celebrity commentary. Sparse Institutional Interest: It doesn’t attract institutional investors like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Dogecoin, despite its popularity, remains an asset driven more by speculation than utility, with no significant tech advancements on the horizon. Helium (HNT): Innovative Technology Facing Adoption Challenges Helium has introduced a decentralized network providing connectivity for IoT devices, where users earn HNT tokens by operating Hotspots. However, its value has significantly dropped, now trading more than 90% below its peak as it transitions its blockchain base to Solana. Strengths of Helium: Practical Application: Provides decentralized connectivity, a significant technical leap forward. Corporate Partnerships: Collaborates with major firms like T-Mobile to broaden its 5G network. Income Through Participation: Owners of Hotspots earn by expanding network coverage. Weaknesses of Helium: Falling Demand: Struggles with network expansion and user adoption. Initial Setup Investment: High costs associated with starting a Helium Hotspot. Blockchain Transition Concerns: Its move to Solana has stirred stability and reliability worries. Although Helium’s concept is pioneering, its slow adoption rate and declining price point to a higher-risk investment scenario compared to alternatives like Web3Bay. Web3Bay (3BAY): The Best Crypto Investment for 2025 Presale Raised: $1.60M+ | Tokens Sold: 390M+ | Current Price: $0.0052 In contrast to Dogecoin and Helium, Web3Bay addresses the trillion-dollar inefficiency in traditional e-commerce. By cutting out intermediaries, Web3Bay establishes a fully decentralized online marketplace, enhancing user control over transactions, pricing, and governance of the platform. Why Web3Bay is the Best Crypto Investment Opportunity: Unprecedented Presale Success Web3Bay has already amassed over $1.60 million and distributed over 390 million tokens. Each stage of the presale quickly sells out, with imminent price increases. Early investors are in a prime position for potential returns of up to 3,633% following the launch. Tangible Real-World Application Web3Bay transcends the typical speculative token by offering a practical utility. Participants can engage in buying and selling digital assets free from excessive platform fees or corporate meddling. Its decentralized market structure promotes equitable and transparent transactions. Governance Powered by the Community Distinct from Helium and Dogecoin, Web3Bay grants its token holders the right to influence platform decisions. Following the distribution of all non-team tokens, Web3Bay intends to transfer ownership of the contract, achieving complete decentralization. Token holders do more than invest; they play an integral role in steering the platform’s future. Rewards Through Staking and Incentives Web3Bay compensates its token holders with earnings from staking, discounts on transactions, and exclusive benefits on the platform. 3BAY tokens offer a means to earn passive income, contributing to the ecosystem’s expansion and robustness. Identifying the Best Crypto Investment? The comparison underscores Web3Bay as a standout for 2025. Dogecoin, while popular, is limited by its speculative nature and lack of functional utility. Helium faces hurdles with its ecosystem’s growth and a concerning blockchain transition. In contrast, Web3Bay’s robust presale success, tangible e-commerce utility, and participatory governance framework highlight it as the best crypto investment right now . Investors aiming for both immediate returns and sustained growth should consider Web3Bay’s upcoming presale stages. With over $1.60 million already secured and a potential 3,633% ROI, missing out on this opportunity could be a significant oversight.

While making the announcement, the President said the Crypto Strategic Reserve is meant to strengthen the crypto industry, which he claims was weakened under the previous administration. Upon announcement, XRP, SOL, and ADA steamed to impressive price pulls, which triggered direct market reciprocations. XRP is up 37%, SOL has increased by 23%, and ADA has soared 68%. Bitcoin Advocates are not happy with the reserve’s composition Samson Mow wrote on his X that Bitcoin might be up, but it’s a sad day for America if they actually shitcoin at a nation-state level. He added that he wasn’t surprised, though, with Trump having launched a meme coin. Critics accused Trump of being swayed by some corporate-backed cryptocurrencies, which they claim oppose the spirit of decentralization. The list of those cryptocurrencies, which includes XRP, Solana, and Cardano, was called misleading. They cautioned that it could mislead investors and that this counsel could divert their focus from Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. Some financial analysts said that a national crypto reserve could become an indicator of skepticism about the long-term viability of the U.S. dollar. The rationale is that the government would inadvertently endanger faith in the real financial system by having a basket of digital assets in the national reserves. Others cautioned that targeting specific cryptocurrencies could create legal and regulatory migraines for the FTX Group, particularly since many digital assets have been the subject of debate about whether they should be classified as securities. However, as complaints mounted, the reserve advocates defended their action, arguing that support for and inclusion of a diverse set of cryptocurrencies would stimulate greater innovation across the blockchain ecosystem. They said that while Bitcoin dominated, it was not exclusive, and a broader variety of tokens could facilitate a more dynamic and adaptable future of finance. Trump’s announcement might be more political than economic Beyond its economic implications, several political analysts view Trump’s announcement as a bid to court crypto investors, developers, and entrepreneurs as part of a broader campaign plan. They said that as the crypto industry matures and grows into a powerful political and financial bloc, opposition to the rising tide of crypto is alienating voters on some level. If Trump can convince voters that he is a pro-crypto leader, he will garner votes from a base group frustrated by and fighting against recent regulatory action targeting digital assets. Yet, Bitcoin community members were not convinced by the political motives of what they considered a grassroots initiative. They argued that the reserve’s structure looked less like a carefully constructed economic policy and more like it was trying to buy certain blockchain communities’ goodwill. Others see the move as improving the options for Treasury Reserves and point out that Texas is one of the states most active with Bitcoin at the level of the states, so it shouldn’t be a stretch to make the case that Bitcoin should be the closer target cryptocurrency to be included in Treasury holdings. The contrast between the multi-asset approach of the federal government and the Bitcoin-only strategy embraced by certain states reflects deeper ideological divinations in the U.S. cryptocurrency space. In working to propose the White House Crypto Summit, the Trump administration has expressed interest in discussing digital asset national financial policy with leading policymakers and industry figures. Whether the Crypto Strategic Reserve is a permanent policy or a political manoeuvre relative to the current political moment remains unclear. The plan has provoked strong sentiment from other parts of the financial community — Bitcoin maximalists don’t like it, advocates of so-called altcoins embrace it, and critics say it’s a terrible idea whose long-term fatigue will eventually become apparent. While debate rages, one thing is sure: the role of cryptocurrency in U.S. financial policy is changing quickly. Whether the Crypto Strategic Reserve is a laudable leap toward innovation or a harebrained economic experiment will take some time to determine; how the fund is implemented, regulated, and welcomed by the marketplace and lawmakers will be a deciding factor.

However, several bottlenecks stand in the way of a swift resolution for the Ripple SEC Case but there appears a way out for both parties. An Injunction By Judge Torres Complicates Matters For Both Parties According to a post by Attorney Jeremy Hogan, the delay in bringing the Ripple SEC case to a close lies with an injunction imposed by Judge Analisa Torres. In her landmark judgment, District Judge Torres previously restrained Ripple Labs from selling securities to the public subject to certain conditions. The presence of the injunction could hurt Ripple Lab’s chances of proceeding with an IPO in the future, a position that appears unacceptable to the firm. Hogan says Ripple Labs’ attempt to ask the court to disregard the injunction is the primary source of delay for a dismissal. “How do you dissolve an injunction?” read Hogan’s X post. “It’s not simple, which is why I think the case doesn’t resolve until April-May whereas all these other cases have already been dismissed.” The Commission’s dismissals of Coinbase’s case and shuttering enforcement action against Gemini have triggered speculation that the end is in sight for the Ripple SEC case. A Way Out For The Ripple SEC Case Asking the court to ignore its injunction because the parties have settled is an uphill task in the Ripple SEC Case. Rule 60 of the Federal Rules makes provision for relief for a judgment in special circumstances in light of new facts or errors. However, the injunction hinges on the Howey test, a longstanding US Supreme Court Law, making it difficult for the court to set aside the injunction. Hogan notes that if Ripple Labs can present a powerful argument for the court, the judge may use her discretion to set aside the injunction. Following a closed-door meeting with the SEC , Ripple Labs is in the endgame of its legal battle with the security watchdog. “Ripple only has one shot at getting the injunction dissolved with the trial court so it will have to draft a very carefully worded motion,” said Hogan. “That takes time and the SEC will basically have to sign off on it – more complication. Hogan predicts that parties will dismiss their appeals in April, effectively bringing an end to the drawn-out legal saga in May.

Enter Web3Bay —a pioneering decentralized e-commerce platform that has quickly garnered investor interest with its $1.58 million presale achievement, selling 390 million tokens, and creating an ecosystem aimed at addressing real-world challenges. While many projects momentarily capture public interest, Web3Bay remains dedicated to a more sustainable objective: transforming the dynamics of digital buying, selling, and interaction. By removing intermediaries, boosting transaction transparency, and empowering its user community, Web3Bay distinguishes itself not merely as another digital currency, but as a revolutionary solution within the blockchain domain. What Is Web3Bay? Crafting the Marketplace of Tomorrow Web3Bay is more than just another crypto project; it is a decentralized e-commerce platform, rooted in blockchain technology, that seeks to rectify the inefficiencies and privacy issues prevalent in conventional online marketplaces. In typical centralized platforms, intermediaries hold sway over user data, levy substantial transaction fees, and often expose buyers and sellers to fraud. Web3Bay offers a new narrative. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized data storage, it enables users to conduct transactions directly, ensuring both security and privacy. Buyers benefit from clear transaction histories, while sellers enjoy quicker payment processes and reduced fees—a critical advantage in a digital economy where trust and operational efficiency are key. Why It Matters With global e-commerce expected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030, there is a pressing need for platforms that emphasize transparency, user control, and cost-effectiveness. Web3Bay is strategically positioning itself at the nexus of these requirements, providing a marketplace that appeals to both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and the general market. Presale Success: Over $1.58 Million Raised and Counting In the crypto world, tangible results speak volumes, and Web3Bay’s presale figures are particularly telling. The project has swiftly raised over $1.58 million and sold more than 390 million tokens, signaling strong investor confidence and endorsement of its vision. Spread across 28 stages, the presale offers escalating token prices to early supporters. With several stages already completed, the demand for Web3Bay continues to grow. This enthusiasm is not merely about potential—it’s a clear indicator of the platform’s practical applicability and the market’s appetite for decentralized solutions. Why Investors Are Excited Those who join early are not merely purchasing a token; they are investing in a thriving ecosystem. With an anticipated ROI of 4,200% at launch, Web3Bay presents a unique blend of speculative potential and tangible application, a combination seldom seen in the current market landscape. Key Features That Distinguish Web3Bay Decentralized Governance A key aspect of Web3Bay is its dedication to community-led governance. Token holders actively participate in key decision-making processes, influencing everything from transaction fees to new feature implementations. This model isn’t just about embracing decentralization; it’s about fostering a marketplace that evolves to meet the actual needs of its users, free from centralized control. Real-World Utility Beyond Speculation While numerous crypto projects are primarily concerned with market speculation, Web3Bay provides concrete benefits: Reduced Transaction Fees : Traditional marketplace fees are a thing of the past. Accelerated Payments : Sellers receive funds promptly. Enhanced Privacy : Users maintain ownership of their data thanks to decentralized storage. Staking & User Incentives Web3Bay extends beyond mere transactions. By staking their tokens, users can generate passive income, enhancing the value proposition for long-term holders. Additionally, those who use Web3Bay’s token for purchases receive discounts, further promoting platform adoption. Commitment to Full Decentralization Unlike some platforms that maintain some degree of control, Web3Bay commits to full decentralization by relinquishing control of its smart contract post-presale, ensuring no single party can alter the system, thereby bolstering trust and decentralization. Why Web3Bay Could Dominate in 2025 While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum often steal the spotlight, Web3Bay is securing its niche by addressing a specific, pressing need—secure, efficient, and user-friendly e-commerce. Its practical utility, coupled with robust presale performance and a dedicated community, positions it as a project with both immediate impact potential and sustainable viability. For investors scouting for the top cryptocurrency to watch, factors like utility, potential for adoption, and community involvement are paramount—and Web3Bay meets all these criteria. As e-commerce continues to grow and consumer preferences increasingly lean towards platforms that offer privacy and cost reductions, Web3Bay is not just capitalizing on current trends—it’s laying the groundwork for the future of online commerce. Which Is the Top Cryptocurrency to Watch? Web3Bay’s $1.58 million presale success, the sale of 390 million tokens, and the projected 4,200% ROI at launch, underscore a well-founded investor enthusiasm. But the real appeal lies beyond impressive metrics. By addressing the fundamental flaws of centralized e-commerce systems and returning control to users, Web3Bay is redefining the standards for decentralized marketplaces. Whether you’re an experienced investor chasing high-growth prospects or a newcomer eager to engage with a project of genuine relevance, Web3Bay stands out as a top cryptocurrency to watch —and invest in—this year. With presale stages rapidly selling out and market momentum escalating, the opportunity to get involved early is swiftly narrowing.

While mainstream crypto assets dominate the headlines, market analysts have identified a handful of hidden altcoins as the best cryptos to buy in the US. These under-the-radar digital assets boast strong fundamentals, innovative use cases, and increasing adoption, positioning them as the best cryptos to buy in the US for explosive gains in 2025. In this article, we’ll reveal three under-the-radar altcoins that are set to be the best cryptos to buy in the US in 2025. With unique technology, solid development teams, and strong market potential, these digital assets are PropiChain (PCHAIN), Solaxy (SOLX), and Meme Index (MIND). Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started, these best cryptos to buy in the US could be your next big win in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. 3 Best Cryotos To Buy In The US In 2025 This list of best cryptos to buy in the US has been carefully researched based on their solid fundamentals, unique value proposition, and high-growth potential. 3. Meme Index ($MIND): Innovating Meme-Based Investments Occupying the number 3 spot on our list of best cryptos to buy in the US is the Meme Index ($MIND). The token introduces a novel approach to the meme coin phenomenon by creating a decentralized index that tracks the performance of various meme-based crypto assets. The Meme Index value proposition allows investors to gain diversified exposure to the over $120 billion meme coin market without individually managing multiple assets. The Meme Index operates through a smart contract that automatically adjusts the index composition based on the performance and volatility of the included tokens. This dynamic rebalancing ensures that the index remains representative of the current memecoin landscape, providing investors an efficient way to participate in this high-risk, high-reward sector. The $MIND token is positioned to capture a significant share of the memecoin market, a good buy for early investors. 2. Solaxy (SOLX): Revolutionizing Blockchain Efficiency Taking the number 2 spot on this list of best cryptos to buy in the US is Solaxy (SOLX), an emerging altcoin designed to address the scalability challenges faced by existing blockchain networks. Solaxy implements advanced consensus algorithms and optimizes data structures to enhance transaction speeds and reduce network congestion. This focus on efficiency positions Solaxy as a viable solution for decentralized applications (dApps) requiring high throughput and low latency. The network employs energy-efficient protocols that minimize environmental impact, aligning with the growing demand for eco-friendly blockchain solutions. Additionally, Solaxy’s developer-friendly environment encourages innovation, attracting projects that contribute to a robust and diverse ecosystem. 1. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Powering the Future of the $600 Trillion Global Real Estate The number one on our list of best cryptos to buy in the US is PropiChain, a blockchain-based real-estate tokenization platform that bridges the gap between the $600 trillion global real estate market and blockchain technology. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, an altcoin designed to give investors early access to the future of the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market. PropiChain is poised to capture 1% of the global real estate market share, a staggering $6 trillion, positioning the altcoin for a massive rally in the coming months. Leading market analysts strongly believe that PropiChain will outperform other assets on this list of best cryptos to buy in the US. Its value proposition to revolutionize the global real estate market is set to spark a chain reaction that could propel the token to historic heights in the coming months. Why PropiChain Leads The List of Best Cryptos To Buy In The US PropiChain is transforming real estate investment using innovative technologies such as the Metaverse, blockchain smart contracts, artificial intelligence, and real-world asset tokenization. By integrating the Metaverse technology, the platform enables investors to bypass traditional barriers like logistical challenges and high travel costs associated with property visits. With immersive 3D technology, users can explore properties worldwide from the comfort of their homes. For example, a potential investor in Singapore can virtually walk through a luxury beachfront villa in the Maldives or inspect a high-rise building in Kuala Lumpur without leaving home. Beyond virtual property tours, the Metaverse enhances global real estate transactions by facilitating seamless interactions between buyers and sellers. Additionally, PropiChain harnesses smart contracts to automate essential real estate processes such as lease agreements and rental payments. This approach eliminates reliance on middlemen like brokers and agents. The automation reduces costs while ensuring transparency, efficiency, and security for investors and property owners alike. PropiChain also integrates AI-powered tools, including virtual assistants and chatbots, to provide real-time support for real estate investors. These AI solutions help investors navigate the complex real estate market. Additionally, PropiChain employs predictive analytics to identify emerging opportunities, allowing investors to stay ahead of market shifts and optimize their portfolios for maximum returns. One of the platform’s most groundbreaking features is blockchain-based real estate tokenization. By converting real estate assets into digital tokens, PropiChain enables fractional property ownership, making high-value real estate investments more accessible to a broader audience. This approach disrupts traditional investment models, democratizing access to lucrative opportunities and fostering a more inclusive, decentralized, and dynamic real estate market. Pchain Presale: A Life-Changing Opportunity For Early Investors As the crypto market matures, hidden gems like PropiChain, Solaxy, and Meme Index offer unique value propositions that set them apart as the best cryptos to buy in the US. However, market experts have singled out the ongoing PCHAIN presale as the ideal opportunity for massive gains, linking its trajectory to the early days of Dogecoin. The presale is already in its second stage and has raised over $2.5 million cumulatively. Priced at $0.01, the token price will rise to $0.023 for the next presale round. Market experts say your $1000 investment in the presale could yield over $487,600 by the end of Q2 2025. Join the presale now to enjoy massive gains. The PCHAIN token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a bold move by the project to increase its accessibility and visibility to potential investors. Additionally, BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and found no vulnerability.

The news sent the bears packing, liquidating $160 million in Bitcoin shorts in the process, per data from Coinglass. In his announcement, which was made via Truth Social as usual, president Trump said: “My Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” Trump first shared the idea for a Bitcoin national reserve at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July 2024, though at the time, he only mentioned Bitcoin. It was also during this conference that he started calling himself the ‘crypto president.’ Bitcoin hits $94K, and altcoins get a bump too After the announcement, Bitcoin’s price surged by over 10% in 24 hours, reclaiming $94,000. Ethereum followed with an 11% spike, reaching $2,500. Solana saw an increase of 20% to $169, while XRP surged by 30% to $2.80. Cardano saw the biggest increase, rallying 60% to $1.02, per data from CoinGecko. This rally comes after weeks of losses. Bitcoin, which started the year at $109,000, had dropped below $80,000 last week after a wave of risk asset selloffs and a security breach at Bybit that saw nearly $1.5 billion stolen. Meanwhile, Trump has announced that he is gonna host the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, with a mission to bring together top executives, investors, and blockchain founders like Gemini’s Winklevoss twins, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, and Cardano’s Charlie Hoskinson. The event comes as investors and analysts speculate how the US Crypto Reserve will be funded. One option is using the government’s massive Bitcoin stash—more than 180,000 BTC worth $18 billion—seized from cybercriminals and darknet markets. Historically, these assets have been auctioned off, with proceeds going to victims and government expenses. It remains unclear if the administration will hold onto these coins or accumulate more. After the Sunday announcement, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks (who has been investing in Bitcoin since 2011), shared that: “President Trump has announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve consisting of Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies. This is consistent with his week-one E.O. 14178. President Trump is keeping his promise to make the U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the World.” More to come at the Summit.” Arthur Hyayes, BitMEX’s infamous founder (who has been trading crypto since 2009), commented on David’s statement to say : “Nothing new here. Just words. Lmk when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that they have no money to buy Bitcoin and shitcoins.” Peter Schiff, a longtime Bitcoin critic, questioned why altcoins are even included at all. “I get the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve,” Peter wrote. “I don’t agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold. So let’s create a Bitcoin reserve too. But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

From dog-themed legends to frog-fuelled riches, these coins prove that community hype and viral appeal can send prices sky-high. But if you missed out on some of the biggest meme coin explosions of the past, don’t sweat it. Today, three top contenders could be the next big thing: BTFD Coin, Sudeng, and Cheems. Whether you’re into play-to-earn (P2E) rewards, quirky branding, or just want to ride the next hilarious wave, these meme coins offer something special. Right now, BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale, having already raised over $6.21 million. This article will break down why its P2E game is drawing major attention, alongside Sudeng’s unique appeal and Cheems’ unbeatable meme energy. Here’s a pro tip before you go any further: every BTFD Coin purchase during Stage 14 is DOUBLED if you use the bonus code LAUNCH100 . That’s right—double your tokens instantly. With that out of the way, read on to find out why these are the best new meme coins to join now! BTFD Coin: A P2E Beast Preparing for Takeoff! Gaming + Memes + Rewards = A Winning Combo. That’s the formula behind BTFD Coin’s explosive success. At its core, BTFD is an ecosystem built to reward players and investors alike. With its P2E game, users can earn BTFD tokens just by playing, making every game session potentially profitable. Imagine this: You’re grinding through an epic boss battle in the BTFD P2E game . Your character has just collected 100,000 in-game coins. You exchange them for BTFD tokens and bam! You’ve just stacked up your crypto portfolio without even checking the charts. Now, say those tokens hit their predicted post-listing price of $0.0006 or even a moonshot of $0.006. That’s potentially 3650% ROI on coins you earned while gaming! On top of that, BTFD Coin’s presale is moving fast. It’s currently in Stage 14, and with only two stages left, the clock is ticking.

Ethereum-Based Security: Built on the Ethereum blockchain for scalability and security. Sudeng: The Sui-Based Meme Coin Backed by an Internet-Famous Baby Hippo Sudeng (HIPPO) is a meme coin on the Sui blockchain, inspired by Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippo born on July 10, 2024, at Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo. With Sudeng’s official partnership with the zoo, a portion of its profits supports wildlife conservation, making it more than just another meme coin. Unlike similar tokens like MOODENG on Solana, Sudeng leverages Sui’s ultra-fast, low-cost transactions, powered by its Narwhal-Bullshark consensus mechanism. This makes trading HIPPO cheaper and more efficient compared to Ethereum-based meme coins. Launched in October 2024, Sudeng has quickly gained traction, securing listings on Bybit and DEX Screener, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. By October 30, it had a market cap of $85.56 million, ranking as the fifth-largest Sui-based crypto, proving that Moo Deng’s charm extends far beyond viral videos. Cheems: The Meme Legend Making a Comeback If you’ve been around meme coin culture, you already know Cheems. This lovable dog with his signature speech style has been a staple in internet culture for years, and now, his token is making a serious comeback. What makes Cheems stand out? It’s pure, unfiltered meme magic. The coin’s branding leans into nostalgia, attracting both seasoned crypto traders and newer investors who just want to be part of the next hilarious pump. Key Features of Cheems Massive Social Engagement: One of the most active meme communities online. Cross-Chain Compatibility: Expanding beyond Ethereum for multi-chain access.

With a presale drive that exceeds the pace of mainstream altcoin drops, MUTM is currently trading at $0. 015. With a roadmap that sees a 33. 3% increase to $0. 02 in the next presale phase, a return is immediate for those who invest now. Analysts predict a 300% return at its $0. 06 exchange listing—not speculative mania but transparent tokenomics. Post-launch, estimates put MUTM at $8 to $12 by 2025, fueled by its utility-based lending platform and its buy-back strategies. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating toward the end of its second presale stage amid growing demand. With more than $2 million raised in the first phase, investors clearly trust the decentralized lending platform. It trades now at $0. 015, the lowest level before the next stage drives the token to $0. 02—a 33.3% increase that early investors will surely profit from in plenty. With less than 20% of tokens left in this stage, time to secure MUTM at basement prices is running out. The tokenomics of the project is based on exponential growth. Scarcity is created by limited supply and buy-and-distribute mechanism on time, and profits from the platforms recycle back into buying MUTM from open markets. This creates constant buying pressure, protecting the token from sudden sell-offs. MUTM’s launch price of $0. 06 will guarantee presale investors a 4x return, but analysts who have followed its peer-to-peer lending adoption and mtToken adoption predict it to reach $9. 50 by mid-2025, a sharp increase from current prices. Customers deposit ETH, stablecoins or other funds and receive interest-bearing mtTokens whose value appreciates over time and are easily transferable between DeFi platforms. Loaners receive liquidity in the form of overcollateralized borrowing that secures lenders. The two-way system also generates a steady stream of platform revenue that goes straight into MUTM’s buy-back reserve. Unlike Dogecoin’s community-powered surge, MUTM growth is accompanied by user activity—a self-sustaining dynamic that meme coins lack. Mutuum Finance Edge Since SOL and ADA can’t be used in advanced dApps, MUTM’s niche in the expert market makes it eligible to target serious users who need passive gains and liquidity. The numbers speak for themselves: if MUTM reaches $9. 50, an investment of $500 today could grow to $31, 500—a life-changing return that’s far greater than typical SOL or ADA gains. With presale demand catapulting the project into rapid phase shifts, MUTM appears poised to follow the trajectory of early Ethereum (ETH) or Binance Coin breakouts before their multi-thousand percent surges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seeks to redefine DeFi’s utility by combining lending utility with investor incentives. Signs of its presale success—$2 million raised, 3800 holders, and a pending 33. 3% price increase—point to a project poised for vertical ascent. While Dogecoin chases its speculative highs and Solana struggles with technical glitches, MUTM’s disciplined approach gives you a linear path to 31268% gains.

Inside the Crypto Upstart’s Trillion-Dollar Quest!,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-next-amazon-inside-the-crypto-upstarts-trillion-dollar-quest/,"The next online revolution isn’t waiting in the wings—it’s happening now with Web3Bay, the crypto initiative taking the $8 trillion e-commerce industry by storm. With a $1.58 million presale record and $200K from whale investments in just a day, Web3Bay is more than just a trend—it’s a transformative force ready to reshape how we shop online. Web3Bay introduces a groundbreaking approach: decentralizing e-commerce. Imagine a platform that merges Amazon’s extensive market with Bitcoin’s decentralized spirit, offering lower fees, quicker transactions, and no invasive data collection. With growing distrust in traditional platforms, Web3Bay isn’t just a fresh option—it’s the obvious next step for online commerce. Legacy Giants: High Profits, High Costs? For years, platforms like Amazon and eBay have dominated online shopping, securing trillions in revenue at the cost of high fees, privacy breaches, and limited market diversity. Sellers forfeit up to 15% on sales, buyers deal with hidden fees, and everyone grapples with unclear policies. However, history is littered with disruptors: Uber revolutionized the taxi industry with a decentralized network of drivers. Airbnb transformed hospitality by empowering homeowners and providing travelers with affordable accommodations. Spotify reshaped music distribution , phasing out traditional CD sales. Each of these innovators democratized access to their services, and now, Web3Bay aims to democratize e-commerce using blockchain technology. Why Web3Bay’s Timing Is Impeccable The timing is critical, and Web3Bay’s launch aligns perfectly with several global trends: Relentless growth in e-commerce, expected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030. Heightened data privacy concerns, with users wary of being exploited. Increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Couple rising transaction fees and the centralized control of conventional platforms, and it’s clear the market is ripe for an alternative. Web3Bay enters at the perfect moment, promising direct transactions, community-led governance, and no middleman interference. Investors Are Taking Notice—And You Should Too Here’s the exciting part: Web3Bay tokens are currently priced at just $0.005247. By launch, they’re projected to soar to $0.1959, delivering a staggering 3,633% ROI for those who get in early. Invest $1,000 now for about 190,560 tokens. At launch: these tokens could be worth up to $37,336.64. That’s a 36x return, potentially outperforming Bitcoin’s early days or Ethereum’s epic rise in 2017. And if Web3Bay grabs even a slice of the trillion-dollar e-commerce market, these gains could just be the beginning. Why Whales Are Going All-In Crypto whales are strategic investors, not gamblers. Their $200K investment in 24 hours signals a calculated move for huge potential returns. They’re positioning themselves for the expected explosive growth, setting the stage for massive gains. Web3Bay stands out not just for its impressive presale but for its sustainable model: Real utility : Addressing genuine inefficiencies in online shopping. Community governance : Investors have a real say in the platform’s direction. Passive income through staking : More than just holding a token, it’s earning from it. A privacy-first model : Ending the era of selling user data to marketers. Long-Term ROI: Sky-High Potential or Just Hype? Let’s speculate: if Web3Bay captures just 0.01% of the global e-commerce market, that equates to $800 million in transactions. This demand could push the token price well beyond the initial projections. Conservative 2-year estimate : $0.50 per token, nearly 95x ROI from the presale. Optimistic 5-year forecast : $2 per token, around 381x ROI—turning $1,000 into $381,000. Ambitious? Certainly. Unachievable? Far from it, especially when considering whale strategies and the looming retail investor FOMO as the media spotlight intensifies. Redefining Online Shopping With Web3Bay Envision accessing Web3Bay to purchase digital art, concert tickets, or even tangible items—without hefty fees or privacy concerns. Transactions are lightning-fast. No intermediaries. No data breaches. Simply pure, decentralized commerce. As its use expands, so do the opportunities: 💳 Global merchant adoption—from solo artists to major commercial enterprises. 🎟️ Revolutionizing event ticketing—minimizing fraud and eliminating scalping. 🏠 Peer-to-peer rentals and services—challenging established platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr. Web3Bay isn’t merely entering the e-commerce field—it’s charging through the gates with blockchain technology and a commitment to prioritizing users. Web3Bay: The Next Amazon of Web3? E-commerce transformed retail by offering unparalleled convenience. Web3Bay aims to transform trust in online transactions. With its robust presale, significant whale backing, and a platform that prioritizes user interests, Web3Bay is not just participating in the e-commerce market—it’s leading a charge. Is there risk? Inevitably. But in the world of crypto, where risk parallels reward, Web3Bay represents a compelling opportunity—especially for those poised to invest before the broader market catches on. Will Web3Bay fulfill its promise? The signs are promising, and the investment community believes it will.

Qubetics is the Next Big Crypto to Explode—Here’s Why You Can’t Afford to Overlook It,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-vechain-qubetics-is-the-next-big-crypto-to-explode-heres-why-you-cant-afford-to-overlook-it/,"The crypto world moves fast—blink, and an opportunity is gone. Anyone who’s been around long enough remembers when Bitcoin was just a couple of bucks or when Ethereum was considered an experimental project. Vechain? That ship has sailed. While it remains a strong contender in blockchain supply chain solutions, the days of life-changing gains from early investment are over. But here’s the kicker—there’s another project still under the radar, and it’s got all the right ingredients to be the next big crypto to explode. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another name in the sea of blockchain startups. It’s tackling real-world financial inefficiencies head-on, especially in cross-border transactions. With its presale in the 24th stage and over 493 million tokens already sold to 21,900+ holders, raising over $14.4 million, it’s clear that momentum is building. At just $0.0976 per token, this is a rare chance to get in before the world catches on. Vechain Was Game-Changer – But It’s Too Late Now Vechain made waves in the crypto space by revolutionizing supply chain management. By integrating blockchain technology with real-world logistics, it provided an unparalleled level of transparency and security. Major companies jumped on board, and its ecosystem expanded rapidly. Partnerships with brands like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC cemented its status as a serious player. Those who recognized Vechain’s potential early on saw massive gains. When it first hit the market, it was trading at fractions of a cent. Fast forward to the 2021 bull run, and its price soared past $0.25, rewarding early believers handsomely. But that was then—this is now. Vechain has already had its moment in the spotlight. The current price movements suggest that while it remains a solid long-term project, the explosive, moonshot-like returns are in the rearview mirror. The market has priced in its growth, and the chance to ride the wave from the ground floor is long gone. The real question now is: what’s next? Where’s the next big crypto to explode? Qubetics: The Ultimate Crypto for Cross-Border Transactions The answer is simple: Qubetics. While Vechain revolutionized supply chains, Qubetics is disrupting cross-border finance. Here’s a reality check—traditional banking systems make international transactions a nightmare. High fees, slow processing times, and endless red tape make sending money across borders a frustrating experience. Now imagine a world where businesses and individuals could send money across the globe in seconds, without the hassle of banks, hidden fees, or waiting days for transfers to clear. That’s exactly what Qubetics is bringing to the table. With its lightning-fast blockchain network and decentralized framework, Qubetics makes cross-border transactions seamless and cost-effective. Think about it—freelancers working for clients overseas, businesses paying suppliers in different countries, or even someone sending money to family back home. Each of these situations becomes infinitely easier and cheaper with Qubetics. No more waiting for SWIFT transfers, no more unnecessary middlemen, just instant, low-cost transactions. And here’s where it gets really interesting. The Qubetics crypto presale is still active, meaning there’s a real chance to get in at the ground level. With $TICS tokens currently priced at $0.0976 and analysts predicting major gains post-presale, this could be one of the last chances to buy before it skyrockets. Qubetics Presale: The Opportunity That Can’t Be Missed The numbers don’t lie. Qubetics has already sold over 493 million tokens, drawing in more than 21,900 holders and raising over $14.4 million. That’s not just hype—it’s a sign that people are recognizing its potential. Price predictions for $TICS are turning heads. Analysts are projecting a price of $0.25 by the end of the crypto presale, which would mean a 155% ROI for those who jump in now. But that’s just the beginning. Once the presale ends, experts expect $TICS to hit $1—an insane 923% ROI. Looking further ahead, post-mainnet launch estimates go as high as $15 per token, marking a mind-blowing 15,255% return. It’s rare to see an opportunity like this in crypto, especially with a project that actually solves real-world problems. Vechain was a missed opportunity, but Qubetics is still in the early stages, and there’s still time to act before it takes off. The Bottom Line: Don’t Sleep on Qubetics Every cycle, there’s a handful of projects that explode, leaving latecomers kicking themselves for not getting in earlier. Vechain was one of them, and now its major growth phase is behind it. Qubetics , on the other hand, is still a hidden gem, and everything about it screams potential. With its game-changing cross-border transaction capabilities, a growing community, and an ongoing presale that’s gaining serious traction, Qubetics is shaping up to be the next big crypto to explode. The window of opportunity is still open—but not for long. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered the next big crypto to explode? Qubetics is tackling a real-world problem—cross-border transactions—with a fast, cost-effective blockchain solution. Its presale success and strong analyst predictions indicate massive growth potential. Is it too late to invest in Vechain? Vechain remains a solid project, but the opportunity for massive early-stage gains has passed. The next big crypto to explode is more likely to be an emerging project like Qubetics. How can Qubetics improve cross-border payments? By eliminating middlemen, cutting fees, and reducing transaction times from days to seconds, Qubetics is revolutionizing the way businesses and individuals send money internationally. How much has Qubetics raised in its presale? So far, Qubetics has raised over $14.2 million, selling more than 491 million tokens to 21,600+ holders. What price predictions do analysts have for $TICS? Analysts estimate $TICS could reach $0.25 at the end of the presale, $1 post-presale, and as high as $15 after the mainnet launch.

Cardano CEO Shutdown Peter Schiff’s ‘Bitcoiner’ Campaign against Ripple’s Strategic Reserve Inclusion,https://coingape.com/markets/xrp-price-forecast-cardano-ceo-peter-schiff-bitcoiner-campaign-against-ripple-crypto-strategic-reserve/,"Ripple (XRP) price rose 40% on Sunday March 2, grazing the $3 mark in reaction to US President Donald Trump’s decision to include XRP in a newly-established crypto strategic reserve. Ripple (XRP) Delivers 40% Gains after Trump’s Executive Order on Crypto Strategic Reserve Ripple (XRP) has dominated crypto media headlines in recent weeks, thanks to events surrounding a new stablecoin launch, the SEC dropping multi-year-long charges against Ripple, and speculations around ETF filing progress. However, US President Donald Trump introduced fresh bullish impetus on Sunday after announcing an executive order to include XRP, along with Bitcoin ( BTC ), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) , in the newly established US Crypto Strategic Reserve. Ripple (XRP) Price Action, March 2, 2025 As expected, the news boosted demand for XRP as traders moved swiftly to bolster their holdings to front-run gains, anticipating that the US Treasury—managing the world’s second-largest economy—would begin making spot XRP purchases for its strategic reserve. Within hours of Trump’s posts on Truth Social, Ripple price rose by a remarkable 40%, surging from an opening price of $2.14 to graze the $3 mark before the close of trading on Sunday. Notably, XRP delivered the second-highest price gains among the five assets mentioned in Trump’s US Crypto Strategic Reserve pool, behind Cardano, which surged by more than 100%, moving from $0.60 to a peak of $1.20 at press time. Cardano CEO Responds as Peter Schiff Leads Bitcoiners’ Campaign Against Ripple’s Inclusion Trump’s inclusion of XRP in the Crypto Strategic Reserve follows a public appeal from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on February 28. Garlinghouse urged the administration to adopt a more holistic approach rather than solely endorsing Bitcoin for the U.S. Treasury. However, XRP’s inclusion has sparked backlash from Bitcoin enthusiasts and maximalists who argue that only BTC should be adopted, citing operational risks associated with altcoins. Economist Peter Schiff voiced strong opposition, questioning why the U.S. needs an XRP reserve. Despite widespread industry support, Schiff challeged President Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve that includes XRP alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). While acknowledging the logic behind a Bitcoin reserve—comparing it to the U.S. gold reserve—Schiff appeared baffled by the choice to include XRP, writing that: “I get the rationale for a bitcoin reserve. I don’t agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. So let’s create a bitcoin reserve too. But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” – Peter Schiff, March 2, 2025 His post quickly drew responses from the global “XRP Army” crypto community, who defended the decision, pointing to Trump’s pledge to make the United States a global leader in cryptocurrency. Cardano founder and CEO Charles Hoskinson was among those who responded, backing XRP’s inclusion. “Because XRP is great technology, a global standard, survived for a decade through many harsh cycles, and has one of the strongest communities. I think the president made the right decision,” – Charles Hoskinson, Cardano Founder and CEO, March 2, 2025 . By spreading capital across four altcoins, Bitcoin is expected to see less upside than if it were the sole asset. As US Treasury funds begin flowing into XRP, ADA, SOL and ETH could potentially encroach on Bitcoin’s market dominance in the near-term, it strengthens the mainstream appeal of the crypto industry globally. XRP Price Forecast: Multi-day closes above $3 could see bulls set sights on $5 rally XRP price action has seen a dramatic surge, gaining nearly 40% in two days before facing resistance near the $3 psychological level. The daily chart reflects strong bullish momentum, with XRP breaking above its Bollinger Band midline ($2.53) and nearing the upper band ($2.99). However, the rejection at $2.99 signals an overheated market, and bulls must secure multi-day closes above this threshold to confirm continuation toward $5. XRP Price Forecast The MACD indicator further supports bullish momentum, with the MACD line (blue) crossing above the signal line (orange) and histogram bars flipping green. A continued expansion in the histogram would validate sustained buying pressure. Still, failure to hold current levels could see prices retracing to the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $2.53 or even the lower band at $2.07, where dip buyers may step in. For now, bulls must defend $2.80 as support while pushing for a decisive close above $3. If successful, momentum could propel XRP price towards $3.50, followed by the $5 psychological mark. Conversely, rejection at resistance and a bearish MACD crossover would expose XRP to deeper correction risks, potentially revisiting $2.50 in the short term The post Will XRP Price Rally Hit $5 ?

XRP, SOL ADA In Crypto Reserve! On Sunday, Trump took to social media to announce that he had signed an order which “directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA”. Bitcoin dominance dropped from 55.4% to under 50% after President Trump initially announced that XRP, Solana, and Cardano would be part of the Reserve. About an hour later, he revealed that BTC and ETH would also be key players in the reserve. The price of ADA soared by more than 63% within two hours after the president’s post, while SOL increased by 23% and XRP by 32%. Massive Gains in the Market Notably, President Trump’s news of a Crypto Strategic Reserve holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, and potentially more coins triggered massive gains across the crypto market. Bitcoin jumped 7.5%, Ethereum rose 10.2%, Solana surged 18.8%, Cardano skyrocketed 61.7%, and XRP soared 24.5%. Notably, the top four performers in the last 24 hours (with a market cap over $1 billion) were Cardano, XRP, the Official Trump memecoin, and Solana. BNB had the smallest gain among the top 10 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins), but still rose by 2.55%. Analyst’s POV On chain analyst Ali Martinez shared that the whales bought over 270 million XRP in the last 48 hours, further cementing bullish sentiments. He also predicts that Ethereum is about to skyrocket. While BTC also recorded gains, he shared that Bitcoin could be rebounding like it usually does when it hits the 200-day MA, only to face a rejection later and break through it. Nevertheless, Trump’s posts gave crypto prices a boost, reversing the sharp drop seen after his election surge. Over the weekend, Ether climbed 20% to $2,482, XRP jumped 38%, Solana rose 20%, and Cardano soared 78%. Furthermore, the rally could keep going right into Trump’s first White House Crypto Summit on Friday. The White House Summit, Next David Sacks shared in an X post that Trump’s move aligns with his earlier executive order (E.O. 14178) from his first week in office, reinforcing his commitment to making the U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the World.” More details are expected to be revealed during the upcoming summit.

Investors are rushing in, not just because of its unique presale journey but also due to its aggressive token burn mechanism. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently removed, reducing supply and increasing value. After the presale, any leftover tokens will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary model that could lead to serious price surges post-launch. The transparency of Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn process is backed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), making every transaction publicly verifiable. With the current price at just $0.000067, the opportunity to lock in a prime entry before the price skyrockets is now. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Hits Penguinopolis—12th Phase Offers a Jaw-Dropping 11,844% ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin’s meme coin presale journey has now reached Penguinopolis, its 12th location, after completing expeditions in 11 different locations within just 45 days.

At $0.000067 per APC, investors at this phase are staring at a staggering 11,844% ROI potential leading up to the launch price of $0.008. But as Arctic Pablo moves forward, so does the price. Those who wait too long could end up paying much more. The window to secure a low entry point is closing fast. Broccoli’s Latest Upgrade Aims to Boost DeFi Functionality Broccoli is making waves in the crypto world with its latest protocol upgrade, designed to enhance DeFi interactions and smart contract efficiency. The team has announced that their new staking pools will offer higher yields, attracting more investors to their ecosystem. With a growing community and increased adoption, Broccoli continues to solidify its position as a major player in the DeFi and meme coin space. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Surges—What This Means for Investors Shiba Inu has once again caught the market’s attention as its burn rate spikes by over 500% in the last 24 hours. With millions of SHIB tokens permanently removed from circulation, speculation is growing about a potential price breakout. As Shiba Inu continues to focus on reducing supply and increasing utility through its Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, investors are closely watching its next move. Final Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge Among the Best New Meme Coins to Buy Now The meme coin market is brimming with potential, but Arctic Pablo Coin ’s unique presale model and aggressive token burn strategy set it apart. While Broccoli and Shiba Inu continue making impressive strides, the massive 11,844% ROI potential of Arctic Pablo Coin makes it a standout choice for investors looking for explosive gains.

The market reaction came after Trump took to Truth Social on Mar. 2, reaffirming his commitment to making the U.S. “the Crypto Capital of the World.” His latest executive order directs the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets to move forward with establishing a national crypto reserve, which will include Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). Bitcoin surged 8% in the last 24 hours, breaking above $93,000, while Ethereum jumped 11%. The gains in other altcoins were much greater, with Cardano surging 66% surge, Solana up 20%, and XRP soaring 28%. At $163.9 billion in market capitalization, XRP surpassed USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency, according to crypto.news price tracker . Trump’s plan differs from his earlier notion of a Bitcoin stockpile, in which the US would merely keep its current Bitcoin holdings. On the other hand, a strategic reserve implies a proactive cryptocurrency accumulation. The crypto community is divided about the move. Because of its security and decentralization, some contend that Bitcoin ought to be the only asset in the reserve. Some worry that a government-controlled cryptocurrency reserve may weaken the dollar and be susceptible to future political changes.

The market’s reaction suggests that traders are weighing the long-term effects of government involvement in cryptocurrency ownership with both excitement and caution. Investors are looking forward to the forthcoming crypto summit , where more details will be revealed, as well as potential policy revisions, regulatory updates, and a clearer framework for the reserve.

Despite this, certain projects emerge that radiate undeniable promise. Investing early in presale tokens presents a unique opportunity to tap into significant growth potential before they hit broader markets and see price surges. So, which projects are the best long-term crypto to buy now? We highlight five exciting initiatives, each with robust use cases, strong community support, and the potential for substantial returns. Notably, Web3Bay is garnering significant interest with its revolutionary approach to decentralized e-commerce and its standout presale achievements. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY): Decentralized E-Commerce with Practical Solutions Web3Bay confronts the real challenges of traditional e-commerce platforms—excessive transaction fees, slow processing, and privacy issues. Its decentralized model facilitates direct peer-to-peer interactions, slashing costs and enhancing user data control. Why Web3Bay Stands Out: Successfully raised over $1.58 million with 390 million tokens sold during its presale. Current presale price: $0.005247 per token (Stage 5). Anticipated launch price: $0.1959, translating to a potential 3,633% ROI for early backers. Notable utility: Provides transaction discounts, staking rewards, and decentralized governance. The robust presale performance is a testament not merely to market hype but to investor confidence in Web3Bay’s approach to tackling the $8 trillion global e-commerce sector by removing intermediaries and enhancing transparency. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND): Combining AI & Meme Culture for Strategic Investing Mind of Pepe integrates AI with the playful nature of meme coins to offer real-time market analysis and actionable insights for its holders. Key Highlights: Over $6.4 million raised in its ongoing presale. Current price: $0.0033454, with staking options available. Unique feature: Provides continuous, autonomous market analysis. Investors attracted to cutting-edge technology and meme coin allure find Mind of Pepe an engaging portfolio addition. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Streamlining Crypto Asset Management Best Wallet addresses the complexity of managing assets across various blockchains with a unified platform that offers easy token swaps, access to DEXs, and the Best Card for straightforward purchases. Investor Attraction Points: More than $10 million raised in the presale. Rapidly growing user base exceeding 500,000. Benefits include reduced transaction fees and early access to new features. With its comprehensive functionality and expanding user base, Best Wallet is becoming an essential tool for crypto enthusiasts. 4. Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL): Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s Ascendancy As Bitcoin approaches new peaks, Bitcoin Bull Token enables investors to share in the excitement with additional benefits like BTC airdrops and high-yield staking options. Essential Stats: Raised over $2 million in the first week of its presale. Current price: $0.00237, with upcoming increases. BTC rewards triggered at specific Bitcoin price milestones. For those optimistic about Bitcoin’s future but seeking extra earnings, $BTCBULL presents an enticing option. 5. Meme Index ($MEMEX): Intelligent Investment in Meme Coins Navigating the meme coin market is risky—Meme Index offers a strategic tool by assessing trends and risks, providing investors with essential insights. Distinctive Features: $3.7 million raised since its launch in December 2024. Community-driven governance model promoting transparency and fairness. Provides risk metrics for both established and emerging meme tokens. Investors eager to explore the dynamic meme coin market will find Meme Index an invaluable guide. Key Highlights! While all five tokens offer unique advantages, Web3Bay’s innovative disruption of the e-commerce space, coupled with its significant early-stage interest, highlights its potential as a market leader. Its $1.58 million presale success and extensive token distribution reflect genuine market confidence. However, diversifying investments remains wise. Combining Web3Bay with established projects like Best Wallet or high-reward options like $BTCBULL could optimize returns while balancing risks. For those aiming to seize the best long-term crypto to buy now , engaging early in these presales could mark the difference between moderate returns and transformative financial outcomes.

These involve BTFD Coin, the Bulls Squad-powered presale sensation, Moo Deng, the cute baby hippo, and SPX6900, the science-based meme token with a cult following. Each brings something fresh to the table, and you won’t want to miss what’s in store! Here’s a quick heads-up: BTFD Coin is running an insane promo right now. Every token you buy in Stage 14 will be DOUBLED with the bonus code LAUNCH100—but only if you act fast before the presale sells out! BTFD Coin – Bulls, Bonuses, and a Breakout Moment Ever wished you had a crew to guide you through the chaotic meme coin jungle? Enter the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin’s mascots and the ultimate hype team designed to keep investors engaged and thriving. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull represent different investment styles, community personalities, and a roadmap to navigating crypto’s highs and lows. Imagine investing with the wisdom of a Wall Street veteran (Nerdy Bull) and the sheer conviction of a diamond-handed degenerate (Raging Bull)—you get the best of both worlds. BTFD Coin’s presale is already in its 14th stage, with over $6.21 million raised and 70 billion coins sold. The hype is real, and with just two stages left before exchange listings, analysts are eyeing $0.0006 post-launch, with an optimistic moonshot projection of $0.006—a 3650% ROI from today’s presale price of $0.00016. That’s not just growth; that’s the kind of play that turns an entry-level investment into a life-changing moon mission. Oh, and don’t forget: Using the LAUNCH100 code will double the number of tokens you purchase in Stage 14, making this one of the most bullish presales of the year! Moo Deng – A Long-Term Play Worth Waiting for Named after the two-month-old pygmy hippo from Thailand who stole the internet’s heart with her playful antics, Moo Deng has taken meme coin investors on a wild ride. This coin became an overnight success after a crypto trader turned a modest investment of $1,300 into over $12 million in just 17 days. The claim, shared by the blockchain analysis account Lookonchain on X, showed that the investor bought Moo Deng coins on September 10 and saw their value skyrocket by more than 9,000x within weeks. With stories like this, it’s no wonder Moo Deng has caught the attention of traders worldwide. These days, its price action is pretty low, but long-term traders are still bullish about a comeback soon. SPX6900 – The Wild Card of Meme Coins SPX6900 (SPX) is a wild ride of a meme coin built on Ethereum, with a supply of 1 billion tokens and about 930 million in circulation. It’s been making moves on DEXs like Uniswap V2 and Aerodrome, with a market cap of around $10 million. Volatile? Absolutely. But for traders who love the thrill, that’s part of the fun. SPX6900 is all about trading—buy low, sell high, and (hopefully) cash in. You’ll need a crypto wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask, some ETH, and access to a DEX like 1inch to start swapping. While spot trading is the safest play, leveraged or perpetual trading? Probably not a great idea unless you enjoy stress. Bottom line: SPX6900 is for those who love chasing pumps and don’t mind the occasional dip. Feeling lucky? How to Redeem the LAUNCH100 Bonus Code for 2X $BTFD Here’s how to double your BTFD Coin tokens before Stage 14 sells out: Go to the BTFD presale page . Connect Your Wallet – Click “Connect Wallet” and select MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or another supported wallet. Enter the Bonus Code – Locate the bonus field, type LAUNCH100 in ALL CAPS, click Apply, and confirm. Enter Purchase Details – Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy.

ETH is now back above $2,400 and facing hurdles near the $2,550 level. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,350 resistance zone. The price is trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels to continue higher. Ethereum Price Rallies 10% Ethereum price extended losses below $2,200 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,080 zone and recently started a strong increase. There was a move above the $2,200 and $2,320 resistance levels. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even surged above the $2,500 resistance level. A high was formed at $2,550 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,173 swing low to the $2,550 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,520 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,550. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,780 resistance zone or even $2,850 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,400 level. The first major support sits near the $2,360 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,173 swing low to the $2,550 high. A clear move below the $2,360 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,080. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

However, one legal battle continues to unfold—the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple (XRP). While cases involving companies like OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap (UNI), Gemini, MetaMask, and Coinbase are being dismissed, Ripple’s case remains unresolved. Meanwhile, President Trump’s recent announcement about a U.S. cryptocurrency strategic reserve, which includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), has added fuel to market speculation. Investors are now wondering if XRP’s inclusion in the reserve could lead to a swift resolution of the ongoing case, with many believing the SEC may soon drop its lawsuit. What’s Next For Ripple Lawsuit? Legal expert Jeremy Hogan recently opened up about the delay in settling the Ripple case, pointing to a significant injunction in Judge Torres’ judgment that prevents Ripple from directly selling to customers. Hogan explained that although there are workarounds, Ripple is reluctant to violate the injunction. Once a court issues such an order, the parties involved cannot simply agree to disregard it, making it a challenging obstacle to overcome. To dissolve the injunction, Ripple would need to seek “relief from a judgment” under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, it’s not a simple process, and changes in the crypto regulations by the SEC won’t automatically nullify the court’s decision. The court’s judgment, based on the Howey test, stands independent of any rule changes the SEC might implement. https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1896232607592902957 Still, there is a possibility that Ripple could resolve this issue, but it would require careful legal maneuvering. Hogan said that the court would need to exercise discretion, and if both Ripple and the SEC agree to request the dissolution of the injunction, it could be a strong argument. Ripple’s case could be resolved by late April or early May.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|FIAT|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 03:35:34

Responding to White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks on X, Armstrong outlined two potential strategies for structuring the reserve. The first strategy would treat Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the modern equivalent of gold, focusing solely on it. Excited to learn more. Still forming an opinion on asset allocation, but my current thinking is: 1. Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold 2. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto… https://t.co/jv8Gcn8N2S — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 3, 2025 This would minimize government interference in the larger cryptocurrency market and strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a store of value, offering stability, transparency, and simplicity. The second approach would distribute assets based on the respective market sizes of each coin using a market cap-weighted index. For example, if Bitcoin makes up 50% of the total crypto market and Ethereum ( ETH ) 20%, then the reserve would allocate its assets in proportion to these figures. Favoritism would be avoided, and the reserve may eventually reflect changes in the market. Armstrong did, however, suggest that a Bitcoin-only approach might be more feasible and consistent with the reserve’s objective.

The decision has sparked debate among the financial and cryptocurrency communities, with differing views on its ramifications. Some crypto advocates have praised the reserve as a landmark move toward widespread adoption, arguing that it will boost investment and establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets worldwide. Others, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, remain skeptical. Hayes dismissed the announcement as political posturing, stating that without congressional approval or a revaluation of gold, the government has no way to fund large-scale crypto purchases. Nothing new here. Just words. Lmk when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that they have no money to buy #bitcoin and #shitcoins . https://t.co/Q06cDtL6h7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 3, 2025 As Trump gets ready to host the White House Crypto Summit, the debate over the structure of the reserve is growing more intense.

While the valuation is elevated, technical support is in play as bitcoin's price rallies of last week's low under $80,000. Despite its high volatility and poor ETF Grade, BITQ's concentrated portfolio and potential for new highs make it a compelling investment. Technical indicators suggest a bottom may be in place, with support near $14 and bullish seasonality expected to drive gains through mid-year. It has been a dramatic handful of days in the crypto markets. Bitcoin plunged from the mid-$90,000s to below $80,000 for a moment last Friday morning. It was a classic high-volatility correction in the world’s most valuable digital currency, but bitcoin snapped back sharply on February’s final day. Another upward jolt came about last Sunday when it was announced that President Trump called for the creation of a crypto strategic reserve. After being up 16% year-to-date on Trump’s first day in office and then plunging to a –16% YTD return last week, bitcoin is now flat in 2025 as of this writing. It’s been a roller coaster ride to say the least. Today, I’m analyzing a somewhat new ETF focused on crypto-related stocks. The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is a small fund, and it has been volatile just like the entire crypto market in recent months. I have a buy rating on the product as I see last Friday’s bitcoin price action as a washout, setting the stage for new highs in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin: Retraces Half the January-February Plunge StockCharts.com Chances of a Bitcoin Reserve Rising Kalshi Trump Comes to Crypto's Rescue? Truth Social According to the issuer , BITQ provides focused exposure to the crypto economy without the complications of holding crypto assets directly. It’s a traditional, regulated ETF, giving holders simplicity and ease of use. Bitwise is one of the largest crypto asset managers. The index leverages Bitwise’s industry expertise to identify what they believe are the right companies in the space. BITQ is a small ETF with just $173.5 million in assets under management as of February 28, 2025. It carries a high annual expense ratio of 0.85% while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is low at just 1.0%. Share-price momentum has been weak since January 20, back when bitcoin notched its all-time high. BITQ shares actually peaked in advance of Trump being sworn into office. December 5, 2024, was its cycle high, just shy of $23. The fund fell 38% to its low last week near $14, successfully holding the pre-election nadir of $14.07. As you might suspect, BITQ is a highly volatile product , and that’s seen in its very poor F ETF Grade per Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. The annualized volatility is sky-high at 65%, so I underscore that using a small position size with this crypto equity fund is important when it comes to risk management. What’s more, liquidity metrics are sketchy since average daily volume is under 200,000 shares while the 30-day median bid/ask spread is high at 28 basis points, so using limit orders during the trading day, particularly around the market’s open, is prudent. Looking closer at the portfolio, BITQ has mixed exposure across the style box. A plurality of its holdings is found in the risk-on small-cap growth area, which underscores the ETF being a high-volatility product. The 36-holding allocation was created in 2021, and it sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2x, per Morningstar, with a long-term EPS growth rate of 10%. The PEG ratio of nearly 3 is no bargain, but with bitcoin potentially back in bull-market mode, the valuation is not a primary concern today. BITQ: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar BITQ is primarily a fintech fund. Sixty-eight percent of the portfolio is invested in the Financials sector with another 29% allocated to Information Technology. I would also call out that there is international exposure—25% of BITQ is invested in non-US stocks. The concentrated portfolio shows a high 58% of assets allocated to the top 10 positions, so monitoring both fundamental and technical developments in names like Strategy (MicroStrategy) ( MSTR ), Coinbase ( COIN ), and MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is a sound strategy. BITQ: Sector and Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Also catching my eye is bullish bitcoin seasonality. While the cryptocurrency was down big in February—its worst month since June 2022—the March through July period has been strong when analyzing historical trends. More recently, since 2019, bitcoin has a mean March return of 9%, up 5 of 6 times with gains often extending through mid-year. Bitcoin: Bullish Seasonal Stretch Through July Barchart Strong Bitcoin Returns March-May Since 2019 StockCharts.com The Technical Take With high volatility in the crypto universe as we enter March, BITQ’s chart has interesting features if you’re a bitcoin bull. Notice in the graph below that the fund tagged its long-term 200-day moving average, briefly dipping below that mark, in late February. It has a history of pulling back to the 200dma before rallying sharply ever since the fund notched its all-time low of $3.20 in December 2022. Marking the top last year was a bearish RSI momentum divergence. Price hit a new high, but the RSI indicator at the top of the chart made a lower high, a telltale bearish clue. Now, after hitting technical oversold conditions last week, I see signs of capitulation washout. The weak momentum tally was paired with a volume spike, lending further evidence to a potential bottom being in place. I see support near $14 with the high $9s being another downside point of interest. On the upside, BITQ paused at its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the November 2021 all-time high to the December 22 low. That is a longer-term resistance point, while the mid-$16s is near-term resistance. BITQ: Shares Fall To Trendline Support On Oversold Conditions StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on BITQ. With signs of a bitcoin recovery, the sharp 37% fall in this crypto equity ETF may be done. With bullish seasonality on tap, I expect BITQ to catch a bid in the months ahead.",BTC-USD|BITQ,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-03 03:50:27

For investors eager to get ahead, jumping into high-potential projects early can be crucial. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum often steal the spotlight, the real opportunities frequently lie with lesser-known, emerging projects that boast solid fundamentals and innovative use cases. Curious about the top crypto gainers to buy now? We’ve scoped out four promising projects that could potentially skyrocket by 2025. From revolutionizing decentralized e-commerce to enhancing blockchain scalability, here’s why these tokens are worth your attention. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY): Redefining E-Commerce Through Decentralization Fed up with hefty fees on platforms like Amazon or eBay? Web3Bay is set to turn the e-commerce industry upside down with its peer-to-peer marketplace that cuts out middlemen, slashes transaction fees, and puts control back into users’ hands. Leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay guarantees secure, transparent, and exceptionally fast transactions. Why You Should Watch Web3Bay: Raised $1.58 million and sold over 390 million tokens during its presale. Current presale price: $0.005247 (Stage 5). Projected launch price: $0.1959, which could yield a 3,633% ROI for early investors. Standout features include staking rewards, transaction discounts, and community governance. With the global e-commerce market projected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030, Web3Bay’s innovative platform arrives at a perfect time. Its successful presale and practical utility make it one of the top crypto gainers to buy now for those looking for significant gains and sustainable value. 2. Story (IP): Securing Intellectual Property in the Digital Age As digital content continues to proliferate, protecting intellectual property (IP) becomes increasingly crucial—particularly with the advent of AI-generated content. Story Protocol addresses this need with a blockchain-based system for creators to register, track, and monetize their creations securely. Key Highlights: Uses the native token (IP) for network transactions and licensing. Recent surge: Up 165% this past week, now trading at $5.06. Offers tangible solutions for artists and tech creators. With AI reshaping content ownership, Story Protocol’s forward-thinking solution positions it as an intriguing investment for those focused on utility-driven tokens with long-term growth prospects. 3. Solana (SOL): Speed, Scalability, & Adoption While many blockchains buckle under the pressure of their growth, Solana stands out with unmatched transaction speeds and minimal fees. Thanks to its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, it can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it an ideal platform for decentralized apps, NFTs, and DeFi projects. Why Solana is a Must-Buy: Current price: $171.00 as of February 2025. Analysts predict a potential rise to $500 by the end of 2025. It hosts a robust ecosystem attracting major projects and partnerships. Offers scalability solutions superior to competitors like Ethereum. With its growing developer engagement and increasing institutional interest, Solana not only offers stability but also strong growth potential, making it a top crypto gainer to buy this week for those wanting a mix of security and upward mobility. 4. Sonic (S): A New Era of Fast, Scalable, Developer-Friendly Previously known as Fantom, Sonic has rebranded and relaunched to prioritize ultra-fast transactions and a robust developer ecosystem. Its mainnet aims to process up to 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant confirmation times. Why Sonic is Attracting Attention: Transitioned from FTM to S token with a 1:1 swap. Offers lucrative developer incentives, retaining up to 90% of generated fees. Seen a 64% increase in market interest over the past week. Focusing on speed and developer benefits, Sonic is poised for success, making it a compelling choice among emerging low-cap cryptocurrencies. Choosing the Top Crypto Gainer! While all four projects offer substantial potential, Web3Bay’s standout presale success and its disruptive approach to e-commerce make it one of the top crypto gainers to buy now . Its combination of a low entry price, enthusiastic investor base, and high ROI projection sets it apart. However, Solana’s proven track record and scalability make it a solid choice for those seeking a balanced crypto portfolio. Meanwhile, Story and Sonic introduce fresh opportunities in managing intellectual property and enhancing transaction speeds, respectively, appealing to niche investors and tech enthusiasts alike.

The price is now trading above $2.750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.40 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Despite the market’s optimism, fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “strategic national Bitcoin reserve” and the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Pi Coin has dropped 50% in the past four days, falling from $3 to $1.50. Bitcoin’s recent surge comes after a tough February, during which it dropped 25% from its all-time high of $107,791. The rally has driven other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) to gains between 12% and 50%. However, Pi Coin’s decline stands in contrast, despite the overall strength of the crypto market. However, analyst Kim Wong said that $1.50 is considered a strong support level for Pi Coin, making it a potentially attractive buy for investors anticipating good news and positive market sentiment in the near future. With Pi Coin’s current price and the general strength of the crypto market, this might be an ideal time to consider an entry point. Important Resistance and Support Levels The first level to watch is $2, followed by $2.20 as the next major resistance. An extended bullish target could push the price above $2.50. The market shows signs of momentum with a bullish MACD crossover and a Stochastic RSI moving out of oversold territory. With increasing volume near the breakout, there is potential for a bullish move, making this a setup to monitor closely.

The company, listed on Nasdaq, reported $376.7 million in total revenue in 2024, which was up over 34% from 2023’s $280 million, despite challenges in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Meanwhile, net income during the same period reached $109.4 million. This figure is a sharp turnaround from a net loss of $49.4 million the previous year. Record Year For Riot The revenue boost was primarily attributed to Bitcoin mining operations, which generated $321 million—nearly double the $189 million recorded in 2023—benefitting from higher Bitcoin prices alongside an increased operational hash rate. Despite this, the company produced fewer Bitcoin in 2024 as it mined 4,828 BTC compared to 6,626 BTC in 2023. According to this week’s press release , the reduction was a result of rising mining costs, the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, and a 67% increase in the global network hash rate. Riot noted that the average cost to mine each Bitcoin rose to $32,216 in 2024, a significant increase from $3,831 in 2023 due to reduced power credits and the more competitive mining environment. The company also revealed that its “unique” power strategy helped reduce some of the cost pressures and achieve an all-in power cost of 3.4 cents per kilowatt hour across its facilities. The company earned $33.7 million in power credits during the year, though this was down from $71.2 million in 2023. A key highlight of 2024 was Riot’s expansion through acquisitions. For instance, the purchase of Block Mining in July expanded its mining operations. Additionally, the acquisition of E4A Solutions strengthened its engineering business and operational capabilities. The Corsicana Facility was energized during the year, which is being deemed a milestone in Riot’s growth initiatives. AI and HPC Focus for 2025 To further boost its Bitcoin yield strategy, Riot raised $579 million through its inaugural convertible senior notes offering in December. The proceeds were used to acquire an additional 5,784 BTC, which increased the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 17,722 BTC by the end of 2024, which was a 141% rise year-over-year. This accumulation brought the company’s Bitcoin treasury to approximately $1.65 billion based on year-end market prices. Going forward, Riot said that it plans to capitalize on emerging opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), particularly at its Corsicana Facility.

Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Mechanism: Enhancing Scarcity and Value Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) introduces a deflationary mechanism designed to increase token scarcity and value. During the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation every week. Additionally, any tokens remaining after the presale will be burned, creating a deflationary environment that aims to enhance investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. These token burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust within the community.

To date, the project has successfully raised over $1.67 million, reflecting strong community support and confidence in Arctic Pablo Coin’s vision. As the presale progresses through various phases, the token price is poised to increase, making now an ideal time to participate at this advantageous entry point.

Official Melania Meme Coin: A Political Meme Coin on the Rise The Official Melania Meme Coin has captured the crypto community’s attention with its unique blend of politics and humor. Inspired by former First Lady Melania Trump, this meme coin is gaining traction as a culturally relevant digital asset. Recent surges in trading volume suggest increasing investor interest, fueled by speculation and the broader meme coin hype.

On March 2, Trump announced an executive order establishing a national crypto reserve, marking a major shift in the government’s stance on digital currencies . The reserve, which includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), triggered a sharp rally across the crypto market, with some altcoins posting double-digit gains. Bitcoin surged 8% to surpass $93,000, while Ethereum jumped 11%. Cardano led the altcoin rally, skyrocketing 66%, followed by XRP with a 28% increase and Solana gaining 20%. XRP’s surge propelled its market capitalization to $163.9 billion, overtaking USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency. The market’s reaction underscored investor optimism, yet debates have emerged regarding the potential implications of a government-controlled crypto reserve. Bitcoin stockpile vs. reserve Trump’s latest plan represents a shift from his earlier proposal of merely stockpiling Bitcoin, where the US government would hold but not actively accumulate additional cryptocurrency. Instead, the new approach involves a strategic reserve that includes proactive acquisitions of various digital assets. This distinction has divided the crypto community, with some supporting the move as a step toward mainstream adoption, while others fear potential risks. Bitcoin proponents argue that only BTC should be included due to its security, decentralization, and proven track record. The inclusion of altcoins such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano has raised concerns that the government could unfairly influence the crypto market by favouring certain assets over others. Critics also warn that a future administration could liquidate the reserve, undermining its intended long-term benefits. US crypto reserve: political and financial impact Trump’s initiative has been widely supported by Republican lawmakers, who view it as a strategic move to strengthen the US position in the evolving financial landscape. With China accelerating its push for digital yuan dominance, policymakers see the crypto reserve as a counterbalance to Beijing’s influence. The initiative also aligns with broader efforts to integrate blockchain technology into the financial system, potentially setting the stage for a more regulated and government-backed digital economy. The move has triggered scepticism among some market analysts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in the ‘Fear’ zone at 33, reflecting uncertainty over the long-term impact of government involvement in digital assets. While the crypto market has reacted positively to Trump’s announcement, concerns persist about potential regulatory overreach and the risk of political interference in crypto markets. Crypto summit ahead The upcoming White House Crypto Summit, set for later this week, is expected to provide further details on the reserve’s structure, policy framework, and regulatory outlook. Investors are closely monitoring the event for insights into the government’s long-term crypto strategy, particularly regarding taxation, security measures, and the role of centralised oversight. Trump’s announcement marks a significant milestone in the government’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency. While the market has responded with enthusiasm, the broader debate over the implications of state-controlled crypto holdings continues to unfold. As details emerge, investors will be watching for potential regulatory shifts that could shape the future of digital assets in the US and beyond.

ADA is up over 60% and now consolidates near the $1.050 support zone. ADA price started a fresh surge above the $0.70 and $0.90 levels. The price is trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1450 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.150 resistance zone. Cardano Price Skyrockets After a major decline, Cardano found support near the $0.580 zone. ADA formed a base and recently started a fresh surge after Trump’s announcement of the crypto reserve. It rallied over 60%, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move above the $0.70 and $0.90 levels. The bulls even pumped the price above the $1.0 resistance. A high was formed at $1.1577 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $1.10 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6446 swing low to the $1.1577 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.10 zone. The first resistance is near $1.1450. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1450 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The next key resistance might be $1.150. If there is a close above the $1.150 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.220 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.150 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.040 level. The next major support is near the $1.00 level. A downside break below the $1.00 level could open the doors for a test of $0.90. The next major support is near the $0.80 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

The announcement has already triggered solid gains in Bitcoin and altcoins over the last 24 hours. While BTC price is up 8%, the Ripple cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) are up by 25-60%. Just Bitcoin Is Ok, Do We Need XRP Reserves? Some of the veteran crypto industry players have voiced their concerns regarding the XRP reserves. Bitcoin critic and popular economist Peter Schiff noted: “I get the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve. I don’t agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. So let’s create a Bitcoin reserve too. But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” Addressing the Trump administration, Schiff further noted: “America will never be great again so long as you can create worthless crypto tokens, then pay off government officials to declare them valuable and use taxpayer money to buy them”. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson gave a quick response to Schiff adding that “XRP is great technology, a global standard, survived for a decade through many harsh cycles, and has one of the strongest communities. I think the president made the right decision”. Industry Leaders Back BTC Hunter Horsely, the CEO of crypto asset management firm Bitwise also shared a similar view on the matter. He stated that having just the Bitcoin strategic reserve would make the most sense to him considering that it’s a digital store of value. “Many crypto assets have merits, but what we’re talking about here isn’t a US investment portfolio — we’re talking about a reserve, and BTC is the undisputed store of value for the digital age,” wrote Horsely . Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also shared his opinion and added, “Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto assets to keep it unbiased”. Community Members Defend The Decision Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has backed the community, stating why it was important to have a Ripple altcoin. JP Richardson, CEO of crypto wallet Exodus stated that it’s a “terrible news” for the US, adding that Americans only need a BTC reserve and nothing more. Responding to him, Morgan said: “Does anyone care about Exodus. You stay with your Bitcoin customers. Everyone else should run a mile from a business that hates most of crypto. Seriously who would use Exodus wallet other than Bitcoin maxis with such thinking from a CEO”. Furthermore, other Ripple critics also asked why the US government would care about having a crypto reserve wherein the parent firm controls 50% of the total. Bill Moirgan called it an attempt to spread FUD stating: “XRP in escrow is now down to 37.62 % and the circulating supply is 62.33%. Ripple has a small % of the 62.33% circulating supply. Stop lying”. Ripple Lawsuit Outcome Coming Soon? As President Donald Trump announces Ripple cryptocurrency to be part of the US strategic reserves, all eyes will be on how soon the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ends the Ripple lawsuit moving ahead. Attorney Jeremy Hogan has highlighted a key factor delaying the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit —an injunction imposed by Judge Analisa Torres. Hogan noted that the injunction could hinder Ripple Labs’ ability to move forward with a potential IPO. He also stated that Ripple Labs’ efforts to persuade the court to set aside the injunction are the main cause of the delay in reaching a resolution. He anticipates that both parties will likely withdraw their appeals by April, paving the way for the legal battle to conclude in May.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President confirmed the creation of a U.S. “crypto strategic reserve,” sparking a massive rally in major digital assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP , Solana, and Cardano all saw major price increases following this announcement, which mentioned these cryptocurrencies as part of the reserve. Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve Plan In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump confirmed that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be the core of this crypto reserve , alongside other major assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This move is seen as highly bullish for the crypto market, as it signals the U.S. government’s involvement in holding and possibly purchasing these cryptocurrencies as reserve assets. The announcement has already had a noticeable impact on market prices, with XRP seeing a sharp price surge of around 35%. XRP Price Analysis: A Strong Breakout XRP’s price has experienced a significant jump since Trump’s announcement. The cryptocurrency, which was priced at approximately $2.20 before the news, has surged past $2.80, breaking through key resistance levels. If XRP continues to hold above the $2.80 level and closes with a daily candle, it could confirm a bullish breakout, possibly pushing the price toward $3 and beyond. Market Outlook: Continued Bullish Momentum? While the recent rally is promising, it’s essential to be cautious. The current price movements have been volatile, and after a major pump, some caution is advised. If XRP maintains its upward momentum and continues to break key resistance levels, it could be headed toward new highs, potentially revisiting its all-time highs near $3.40. At press time, XRP is up by more than 24% and is trading at $2.80.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|FIAT|ADA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 05:10:45

In the UK, Olumide Osunkoya received a four-year prison sentence for operating unregistered crypto ATMs, which was the country's first criminal conviction for this kind of offense. Vitalik Buterin Supports Roger Ver Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed his support for Roger Ver, the early crypto investor and entrepreneur that is currently entangled in a legal battle with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) over alleged tax evasion. Ver was arrested in Spain and faces extradition to the US. Since then, he has attracted a lot of backing from various figures in the crypto community, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Buterin reposted Ulbricht’s message calling for the charges against Ver to be dropped and described the case as ”absurd” and ”politically motivated.” He criticized the US tax system, particularly its taxation of citizens regardless of residence and its stringent exit tax, and pointed out that very few other countries impose similar regulations. Ver’s legal troubles began when the DOJ announced tax evasion charges against him on April 30 of 2024. He was subsequently arrested in Spain and spent several weeks in prison before posting a $163,000 bail on May 17, 2024. (Source: DOJ ) The bail conditions required him to stay in Spain, surrender his passport, and report to court officials every two days. In a legal filing that was submitted on Dec. 3 of 2024, Ver’s attorneys argued that the case was unconstitutional and sought to have the charges dismissed . They said that the US exit tax law for citizens with more than $2 million in investable assets was vague and violated the Apportionment Clause and the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution. The case against Ver also reignited debates over US tax policies , particularly as lawmakers and citizens push for comprehensive tax reform. Many in the crypto community see the charges as part of a broader crackdown by the Biden administration on the industry. Critics even accused the DOJ of unfairly targeting Ver because of his outspoken support for cryptocurrency rather than for genuine tax violations. Ver himself held firm that his prosecution is politically motivated , and alleged that the US government is using the case to suppress crypto advocacy. Judge Dismisses SEC Case Against Richard Heart A US district court judge also recently dismissed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SECs) lawsuit against Hex founder Richard Heart, which accused him of raising more than $1 billion through unregistered crypto offerings and defrauding investors of $12.1 million. Heart’s real name is Richard Schueler. He was also alleged to have spent misappropriated funds on luxury items, including the world’s largest black diamond. However, Judge Carol Bagley Amon ruled that the SEC failed to establish US jurisdiction over Heart’s crypto activities, and stated that his alleged actions were global in scope and not specifically targeted at US investors. In the court ruling that was issued on Feb. 28, Amon noted that the alleged misappropriation took place through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms that had no connection to the United States. She also stated that if Heart misused investor funds through deceptive mixer transactions, those actions took place entirely outside of US jurisdiction. The tokens at the center of the SEC’s allegations—PulseChain (PLS), PulseX (PLSX), and HEX (HEX)—have seen big price increases since the verdict, rising close to 30%, 60%, and 70%, respectively. After the ruling, Heart shared his relief at the outcome by stating that winning a securities-related case against the SEC was rare. He pointed out that HEX has been operating flawlessly for over five years and that the decision provided some very welcome relief and opportunity for the broader cryptocurrency industry. Despite the dismissal, Amon granted the SEC an opportunity to amend its complaint and refile the case in 20 days, leaving the possibility of future legal action open. Beyond the SEC lawsuit, Heart is facing additional legal troubles in Finland. On Sept. 13, 2024, Finnish authorities took him into custody over allegations of tax fraud and assault, but he has since gone missing. On Dec. 22, Interpol issued a Red Notice for his arrest based on these allegations. Although authorities have been unable to locate him, they still managed to seize approximately $2.6 million worth of watches that he is believed to have abandoned. Heart’s Interpol Red Notice While he is still out of reach for authorities, Heart is very active on social media, and regularly uses platforms like X and YouTube to promote his cryptos and engage with his followers. UK Sentences First Illegal Crypto ATM Operator Roger Ver and Richard Heart are not the only people in the crypto space facing legal issues. Olumide Osunkoya was sentenced to four years in prison for operating an illegal network of cryptocurrency ATMs. This was the UK’s first criminal sentencing for unregistered crypto activity. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the ruling on Feb. 28, and believes that the case sends a strong message to those who try to evade regulations and engage in illicit financial activities. Osunkoya was charged on Sept. 10 for running crypto ATMs without the required registration at 28 locations through his company, GidiPlus Ltd, from December of 2021 to March of 2022. During that period, his ATMs processed transactions totaling 2.6 million British pounds ($3.14 million). To avoid detection, he later transferred the ATMs from GidiPlus and continued operating up to 12 machines under a fake name and company. The FCA stated that he failed to implement measures to prevent money laundering through these machines. In addition to being the first individual charged in the UK for running an illegal crypto ATM network, Osunkoya pleaded guilty to five charges on Sept. 30. He was also convicted of forgery after creating four fraudulent bank statements to pass a source of wealth check at a crypto exchange. Other charges included using a fake identity to establish a company and possessing criminal property, with authorities seizing 19,540 British pounds ($24,567) in cash obtained through his illegal operations. During sentencing at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Gregory Perrins condemned Osunkoya’s actions as a deliberate and calculated attempt to defy regulators. He stressed that the case was not a simple regulatory breach but an intentional effort to circumvent financial laws. This case took place after a 2023 crackdown by the FCA and local police agencies aimed at shutting down illegal crypto ATMs. The regulator reported visiting 38 locations and dismantling 30 machines, which led to a decline in the number of crypto ATMs listed on Coin ATM Radar from 80 in 2022 to zero this year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-03 05:20:35

While President Donald Trump has moved to establish a national crypto reserve—including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano—regulatory uncertainty remains a key challenge. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long recently criticized the administration for failing to address crypto debanking issues, arguing that financial institutions still face restrictions when engaging with digital assets. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken steps toward a more crypto-friendly stance, leaving industry stakeholders eager to see if banking regulators will follow suit. With a White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7, discussions around regulation, financial inclusion, and the role of digital assets in the US economy are set to take center stage. Trump Expands US Crypto Reserve to Include XRP, Solana, and Cardano—Bitcoin and Ethereum Added as Core Holdings President Donald Trump has directed the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets to include XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) in the country’s strategic crypto reserve. The announcement marks a pivotal moment in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as the United States seeks to solidify its position in the evolving global digital economy. Trump later expanded the list to include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), declaring that these two cryptocurrencies would form the ”heart of the reserve.” This move aligns with his previously stated ambitions to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile, a promise he made during the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee. During his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to Bitcoin. His announcement initially resonated strongly with Bitcoin supporters, who saw it as a validation of the cryptocurrency’s role in the global financial system. However, the subsequent inclusion of XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Ethereum has sparked debate among crypto purists, particularly Bitcoin maximalists, who argue that only Bitcoin should be considered a national asset. The inclusion of multiple cryptocurrencies in the national reserve represents a significant policy shift in how the US government views digital assets. While Bitcoin remains at the forefront of Trump’s strategy, the addition of XRP, Solana, and Cardano suggests a broader vision for the country's engagement with blockchain technologies. XRP: Known for its fast transaction speeds and focus on cross-border payments, XRP's inclusion could indicate that the US sees value in leveraging blockchain for global financial transactions. Solana (SOL): With its high throughput and low fees, Solana has been increasingly positioned as a scalable solution for decentralized applications (dApps) and finance. Cardano (ADA): Cardano’s emphasis on security, sustainability, and formal verification may have played a role in its selection for the reserve. Ethereum (ETH): As the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT industries, Ethereum’s inclusion signals an acknowledgment of its crucial role in digital asset ecosystems. The decision to create a diversified digital asset stockpile also raises questions about future regulatory frameworks. The President’s Working Group on Digital Assets is now tasked with determining how these assets will be acquired, stored, and managed. Bitcoin Maximalists React to Trump’s Broader Crypto Strategy While Trump’s Bitcoin -centric narrative previously garnered strong support from Bitcoin-only advocates, his latest executive order has triggered disappointment among hardcore maximalists. The Jan. 23 order, which directed the establishment of a ”digital asset stockpile” rather than a strictly Bitcoin-only reserve, led some in the community to voice concerns over dilution of Bitcoin’s primacy. Bitcoin-focused commentators quickly took to social media to express their discontent. Walker, host of THE Bitcoin podcast, criticized the move. Similarly, Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, pointed out that Trump’s order diverged from earlier promises made to Bitcoiners. Despite the backlash, some industry leaders view the expanded reserve as a pragmatic decision that acknowledges the diversity of use cases within the crypto sector. By incorporating multiple cryptocurrencies, the US government is hedging against reliance on a single blockchain network. Trump’s decision to include a range of cryptocurrencies in the national reserve also coincides with his ban on research and development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States. His executive order explicitly prevents US agencies from pursuing CBDC initiatives, aligning with the Republican party’s broader skepticism toward central bank-backed digital currencies. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have announced the formation of a bicameral crypto working group, which will work alongside Trump’s administration to craft policy measures that favor private-sector blockchain development while limiting government control over digital assets. Trump’s move to build a multi-crypto reserve has significant economic and political ramifications. While it positions the United States as an aggressive player in digital asset accumulation, it also raises concerns over regulatory clarity, potential volatility, and the challenge of managing a diverse set of digital assets at the government level. Caitlin Long Blasts US Government for Inaction on Crypto Debanking, Calls for Regulatory Overhaul Despite a shift in tone from the US SEC since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the federal government has done little to address the issue of crypto debanking, according to Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long. Speaking at ETHDenver on Feb. 28, Long criticized federal banking agencies for maintaining restrictive policies toward cryptocurrency firms, arguing that no substantial changes have been made to ease the financial sector's stance on digital assets. The crypto-friendly banking executive added that, while she believes regulatory change is inevitable, Trump has yet to propose a clear path forward for digital assets within the US banking system. Long’s comments highlight an ongoing struggle between crypto firms and traditional banks, as US regulators have historically viewed the industry as a high-risk sector. Since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, crypto advocates had hoped for a more lenient banking environment, especially given the President’s vocal support for Bitcoin and other digital assets. However, according to Long, the federal regulatory landscape remains largely unchanged. The lack of movement has frustrated many within the blockchain industry, particularly in the wake of Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a federal effort under former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Martin Gruenberg, which allegedly sought to debank crypto-related businesses. Gruenberg, a longtime opponent of cryptocurrency banking integration, stepped down as FDIC Chair earlier this year. His replacement, Acting Chair Travis Hill, has yet to signal a definitive policy shift, leaving crypto banking regulations in limbo. While banking agencies have resisted change, the SEC has made a dramatic pivot in its crypto policy under Trump’s administration. Just one day after Trump’s inauguration, the SEC established a Crypto Task Force, led by commissioner Hester Peirce, to reframe the agency’s stance on digital assets. One of its first actions was rescinding Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121)—a controversial rule that required financial firms to record crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. The repeal of SAB 121 was widely celebrated within the crypto industry, as it had previously discouraged banks from offering custodial services for digital assets. Long acknowledged this ”massive 180” in policy, stating that she hopes a similar shift will soon follow in banking regulations. Beyond banking access, Long emphasized the urgent need for stablecoin regulation. While she believes new legislation is on the horizon, she warned that stronger consumer protections are necessary—particularly in how banks hold cash reserves. Long cited the collapse of Silvergate Bank, a once-prominent crypto-friendly institution, as evidence that poor banking practices can destabilize even the most promising financial models. To protect consumers and ensure the stability of digital assets, Long called for stablecoin issuers to be required to hold cash reserves equal to their outstanding liabilities. What’s Next for Crypto Banking Under Trump? While Trump has vocally supported Bitcoin and other digital assets, his administration’s lack of movement on crypto banking policy remains a key concern. If the White House fails to address these regulatory hurdles, it could undermine America’s ability to remain competitive in the global blockchain sector. With the first-ever White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7, industry leaders and policymakers will have an opportunity to discuss the future of digital asset regulation. Long and other crypto executives will likely push for: Overturning restrictive banking policies to allow financial institutions to safely engage with digital assets. A clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, ensuring they are backed by adequate reserves. Leadership changes at key financial agencies, such as the FDIC, to encourage innovation rather than suppression of digital finance. As the Trump administration continues to shape its approach to crypto regulation, the industry is watching closely to see whether banking access will finally open up to digital asset businesses—or if anti-crypto policies will persist. Caitlin Long’s criticisms shed light on the ongoing tension between crypto innovators and traditional financial regulators. While the SEC’s policy shift offers a glimmer of hope, banking restrictions remain a significant barrier for crypto businesses in the United States. With Trump’s administration still formulating its approach, the industry will be looking to the March 7 White House Crypto Summit for concrete action on crypto banking reform. Until then, Long’s message is clear—the government has done nothing yet, and time is running out for meaningful change.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-03 05:30:00

Investor sentiment remains weak, with many fearing a further dip toward $70,000. However, analysts believe Bitcoin will likely stabilize in the $72,000–$80,000 range before making a comeback. Despite the correction, optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains strong , with Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research, Geoffrey Kendrick, predicting a massive rally in the coming years. A Tough Market, But a Bright Future In a CNBC interview , Kendrick acknowledged the challenges Bitcoin is currently facing, attributing its decline to increasing market uncertainty and regulatory pressures . However, he sees this as just a temporary setback. He remains confident that Bitcoin will climb to $200,000 by the end of this year and could even reach $500,000 before early 2029. While these figures may seem ambitious, Kendrick believes that key market shifts and increasing institutional interest will drive Bitcoin to new heights. Key Catalysts That Could Fuel the Rally One of the biggest factors, according to Kendrick, is regulatory clarity. He expects new regulations surrounding stablecoins and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance to provide the legitimacy that institutional investors have been waiting for. As the crypto space becomes more structured and compliant, major financial institutions in the US will start taking crypto as a serious business opportunity . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Up Today? 3rd March : Truth Social Donald Trump , Cardano News , XRP Price , Trump Crypto Reserve , Next up are Bitcoin ETFs , which have already sparked a wave of interest, but Kendrick believes this is just the beginning. Large US pension funds, managing a staggering $40 trillion in assets, currently have minimal exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. As regulatory clarity improves, these massive funds could start investing heavily, pushing Bitcoin’s demand to new levels. While he believes that the real game-changer could be sovereign wealth funds. Abu Dhabi’s Sovereign Wealth Fund has already stepped into the Bitcoin ETF space , and Kendrick expects more governments and large-scale funds to follow. This institutional adoption could act as a major catalyst, fueling Bitcoin’s climb to new highs. The Road to $500K While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook remains volatile, Kendrick’s long-term vision suggests that the right mix of regulatory changes, institutional involvement, and ETF growth could propel Bitcoin to half a million dollars. Though challenges still exist, the growing adoption of Bitcoin by major financial players and governments could set the stage for one of the biggest bull runs in crypto history. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One of the primary catalysts for the current surge is likely US President Donald Trump’s recent hint towards a US XRP Reserve. However, amid this, a top market pundit predicts the asset’s value to soar past the $70 mark with a potential timeline. XRP Price Soars 25% As US Crypto Reserve Gains Momentum XRP price jumped nearly 25% today and exchanged hands at $2.79, while its one-day trading volume skyrocketed $19.09 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.97 and $2.23, respectively. Furthermore, XRP Futures Open Interest rose about 40% to $4.33 billion, its highest level since early February, indicating the regaining confidence of the traders. Meanwhile, the rally comes against the backdrop of the latest US Crypto Reserve comment by Donald Trump . Notably, the social media war between the Bitcoin and Ripple community has recently gained traction, especially amid rumors of XRP Reserve in the US instead of only BTC-focused Reserve. However, Trump said in his Truth Social platform that the US is considering adding XRP, ADA, and SOL to the US Crypto Reserve alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, what lies ahead for Ripple’s native asset? Here we cover how bullish the experts are on the future trajectory of the coin. Ripple Coin Targets $70 Rally, Here’s When In a recent X post, renowned market expert Dark Defender has made a bold prediction for XRP price ahead, setting a short-midterm target of $77.7. In a recent X post, Dark Defender outlined a possible scenario where the crypto could extend toward $18 “with the third wave”. The expert identified key supports at $2.60 and $2.77, and resistances at $5.85, $8.03, and $18.22. According to Dark Defender’s analysis, XRP could reach the $77.7 mark by 2027, as indicated in a shared price chart. Meanwhile, this prediction has generated significant interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who are eagerly watching the asset’s price movements. While market predictions can be uncertain, Dark Defender’s expertise and track record make this forecast worth considering. Source: Dark Defender, X Levels To Watch For Short-term Echoing bullish sentiments, other market experts also remained bullish on the future trajectory of the coin. For context, in a recent analysis CasiTrades said that if the XRP price holds the $2.92 support, it is likely to continue its rally ahead to a new high. Source: CasiTrades, X Simultaneously, another expert Rose Premium Signals also echoed a similar sentiment. According to the expert, the next targets for Ripple’s coin sit at $3, $4.2, and finally $5. Having said that, if the XRP price breaks past the initial two targets, it could rally to $5 in the near term. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Besides, the market trends also indicate a bullish market sentiment that is currently hovering. For context, renowned market expert Ali Martinez highlighted the massive buying pressure from the XRP whales recently. In a recent X post, Martinez said that large investors have purchased 270 million coins over the weekend.

However, it’s worth noting that an expert has recently refuted claims over the Ripple SEC case’s impact on the crypto’s price ahead.

On Sunday, while traditional finance was off the clock, president Donald Trump announced the creation of a Strategic Crypto Reserve (SCR) for the United States, sending Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies soaring. Eric called the timing “genius” and took a shot at legacy finance. “Traditional finance better catch up, or it will quickly become extinct,” he said . “The world no longer runs on a Mon-Friday, 9 to 5.” Eric Trump speaking at the Student Action Summit, at Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. Markets reacted instantly. Bitcoin (BTC) surged 10% to $94,343.82, recovering from a three-month low under $80,000 on Friday. Ethereum (ETH) gained 13%. The biggest gainer was Cardano’s ADA, which skyrocketed over 60%. XRP jumped 33%, while Solana’s SOL climbed 25%. The announcement came directly from Donald Trump on Truth Social, where he confirmed that the U.S. government would establish a national reserve holding BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump confirms U.S. crypto reserve, market reacts Trump’s post made it clear—this wasn’t just talk. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” Trump said. He followed up with another post, explicitly including BTC and ETH in the reserve. “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,” he wrote. “I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” This marks the first time Trump has publicly differentiated between a “crypto reserve” and a “stockpile.” A reserve implies active purchasing of crypto over time, while a stockpile would mean simply holding onto existing crypto seized by the U.S. government through law enforcement actions. Trump first introduced the idea of a Bitcoin stockpile last summer at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee. It was at that event that Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also pushed for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. The concept gained traction after Trump’s re-election in November, as Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs on speculation about U.S. government adoption. Trump speaking at Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee But things slowed down when Trump’s executive order on digital assets in late January raised more questions than answers. The order directed the President’s Working Group on Crypto to study “the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.” The wording of “digital asset stockpile” instead of “crypto reserve” left many investors uncertain about what exactly was coming. Crypto community divided on Trump’s reserve plan Reactions from the crypto industry were split. Many saw the SCR as a bullish move, while others questioned what it would mean long term. One of the biggest debates is which cryptocurrencies belong in the reserve. Some argue that Bitcoin should be the only asset held, as it is the most decentralized and secure. Others disagree with the government picking winners and losers by including XRP, SOL, and ADA alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Another group completely opposes the idea of a U.S. crypto reserve. They warn that it could destabilize the U.S. dollar or be liquidated by a future administration. “The next election could see a new administration come in and need to find money to pay debt, social security, etc. They could sell the reserve,” said Adam Blumberg, vice president of Enclave Group. Blumberg also questioned whether the U.S. government should be holding crypto at all. “I just don’t like the idea of the U.S. government, or any government, owning the most decentralized asset ever,” he said. “That’s not what it was created for [and puts] too much power in the hands of the federal government, which is always in a 4-year, or even 2-year, cycle.” Bitcoin had been struggling since Trump’s executive order, closing out its worst month since 2022. But with this Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement, everything has changed. The next big moment comes Friday, when Trump hosts the first-ever White House Crypto Summit. Investors will be watching for more details on how the reserve will operate and whether traditional finance finally wakes up. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

41087447,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103054,1740981078,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Aya Miyaguchi is Ethereum Foundation’s New President,https://zycrypto.com/aya-miyaguchi-is-ethereum-foundations-new-president/,"Aya Miyaguchi, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation since 2018, stepped up to the role of president, promising to boost institutional relationships and expand Ethereum’s use. “This new opportunity”, wrote Miyaguchi, “will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly”. Miyaguchi spent 10 years as a high school teacher before joining the crypto exchange Kraken, where she became managing director of the Japanese office. She later became executive director of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) in 2018. During her stay at EF, Miyaguchi helped the crypto transition to proof-of-stake, prioritised decentralisation, and promoted her concept of “subtraction,” which means a more hands-off approach to allowing developers more freedom. In 2022, Under Miyaguchi, Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake, reducing its carbon footprint by 99%. Miyaguchi further focused on layer 2 technologies, expanding the coin’s scaling capabilities. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, supports Miyaguchi and claims she creates an environment conducive to innovations. “As I see it, the role of an ED is to create an environment where others can shine and do their best work, and so every success of the EF – the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum’s culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more – is in part a result of Aya’s stewardship”. However, some Ethereum community members oppose Miyaguchi, claiming that she is not an effective leader and does not attract new developers to the project, losing talent to rival coins like Solana. Some even blame Miyaguchi for the lagging Ethereum price, even though she has only just become president. Others welcome a leadership change because a new direction may help the project rebound. A restructuring of the EF may also help address issues related to the treasury and the spending of funds on new projects. The Ethereum faction that calls for Miyaguchi’s resignation also wants Danny Ryan to replace her. Ryan is an Ethereum researcher and developer. Although, despite being a developer, Ryan may lack Miyaguchi’s leadership skills, having technical skills but possibly lacking in management skills, a common issue with developer leaders, focusing too much on the trees and not focusing on the larger forest (i.e. big picture, company vision, business scaling). There have also been toxic attacks on Miyaguchi, prompting Buterin to condemn these actions and to remind the community that he still has a lot of say regarding the foundation’s decisions. Miyaguchi has further claimed that the move to place her as President fits in with the Ethereum Foundation’s broader strategy, which includes other issues concerning sustainability and a long-term vision for the project. One of those issues, as highlighted by Miyaguchi, involves the project’s decentralized design, which separates the foundation from other projects with special interests. “We must avoid evolving like a traditional corporation”, wrote Miyaguchi, “because our goal isn’t for EF to ‘win’-it is for Ethereum to win over the long term while staying true to its core values. Ethereum doesn’t grow like a machine; it grows like a garden, strengthened by its biodiversity”. Miyaguchi further references Stewart Brand’s “pace layering” framework to explain Ethereum’s different levels of growth and sustainability. From this perspective, cryptocurrency makes a lot of sense when applied to real-world problems like poverty, access to banking, pollution, and financial security. Like a garden providing relief from an urban environment, cryptocurrency offers relief from corrupt governments. Several controversies within the Ethereum Foundation have negatively affected mainstream adoption. One such prominent case was when EF researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist took paid for advisory roles from the EigenLayer Foundation. Such conflicts of interest have angered community members. A lack of transparency regarding funds has exacerbated the problem. Buterin has stepped in to provide interim leadership until someone can be found to manage the EF treasury properly.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-03 05:51:18

Armstrong has suggested that the US should adopt a Bitcoin-only approach when establishing a national crypto reserve, confirming his stand and support for Bitcoin over the years. Armstrong was reacting to President Trump’s suggestion that the national crypto reserve hold several altcoins. The CEO has joined several Bitcoiners in condemning the idea of having anything other than Bitcoin in the reserve. Most people who believe in Bitcoin have said it is the only cryptocurrency worth hosting in the crypto reserve due to its performance over time. Armstrong’s position has received different feedback, with some users on X bashing his open love for Bitcoin at the expense of other crypto. However, a number of comments have also supported his idea, stating that only Bitcoin can be characterized as a store of value. Coinbase CEO champions Bitcoin as the superior reserve asset Armstrong has openly shown his faith in Bitcoin for a long time. He holds that Bitcoin has unique properties that make it better than other cryptos. For instance, he said Bitcoin scarcity is a strength that can only be compared to Gold. Yet, its portability and divisibility outdo Gold; therefore, it’s best for reserve. At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, the CEO expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to surpass Gold in market capitalization. He is also confident that other countries, including the G20 members, would follow suit if the US Bitcoin were a national reserve. However, his position contradicts Trump’s broader approach, which aims to support the entire cryptocurrency industry by including a range of digital assets in the reserve. Following Trump’s announcement , Bitcoin’s price surged past $94,000, while Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano also saw significant gains. People hold different perspectives on a Bitcoin-only reserve The debate on Bitcoin-only reserve is not as light as it appears. There are accusations that the government is accommodating altcoins to please institutions that advocate for them. Some people read political undertones on the decision. Bitcoiners are adamant that there are pointers that make Bitcoin the only worthy crypto. Analysts have predicted Bitcoin to hit $300,000 in 2025, which is enough to have it as a national reserve. Despite the justifications, people are criticizing having Bitcoin alone in reserve. They argue that having one digital asset, especially Bitcoin, is a big risk due to its volatility. They say that overlooking altcoins will mean losing a big opportunity. One of the social media users responding to Armstrong’s comments reportedly asked whether it had been a sensible strategy to put all reserves into a single digital asset and pointed out that while Bitcoin dominates the space, diversification is always a key strategy in finance. Another criticized the creation of a reserve with cryptocurrencies that have proven to be speculative and could jeopardize a country’s financial stability and insisted that Bitcoin is the only viable instrument to enforce monetary sovereignty. The controversy surrounding the establishment of a US crypto reserve underlines the political economy challenges of incorporating digital assets into national policy in general. Proponents of a total Bitcoin reserve assert its performance, security, and decentralized nature; others warn that a diversified cache would better reflect and account for digital assets’ simmering volatility and evolving utility. With Trump’s endorsement of a multi-asset crypto reserve and Armstrong’s call to focus solely on Bitcoin, the US government must make a critical decision. Should it make one bet on Bitcoin or hedge that position with other cryptocurrencies? Policymakers will need to weigh the long-term economic impact of their decisions as regulatory frameworks come online. Whether Bitcoin is on its own or alongside altcoins, one thing we are sure of is that the debate on crypto reserves has just begun. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While the Bitcoin price experienced a rapid recovery from its low point, the increases in the altcoins in question were even more dramatic. The Ice Is Melting Between Cardano and XRP One of those most surprised by this development was economist Peter Schiff, known for his hostility towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Schiff criticized the XRP front by saying that he understood the idea of a Bitcoin reserve to some extent, but could not make sense of the idea of an XRP reserve.

Hoskinson, in response to Schiff's statements, said that the reason for adding XRP to the strategic reserve is that the coin has great technology, has become a global standard, has survived many tough cycles and has one of the strongest communities. In addition, he added that the US President made the right decision by adding XRP to the reserve. Hoskinson’s response surprised even Ripple’s chief technology officer, David Schwartz, who responded to Hoskinson on X by saying, “Am I dreaming?” *This is not investment advice.

Caroline Crenshaw, SEC Commissioner and Democrat, disagreed with the conclusion, claiming that the agency is overstepping its jurisdiction and should not exclude meme coins from SEC oversight. Crenshaw further argues that the SEC has not provided an adequate definition of a meme coin, let alone made an argument for rejecting them as securities. “The guidance offers no clear definition”, said Crenshaw, “from law or even a basic dictionary. It generally describes a meme coin as an asset reflective of online or social trends, of speculative value, that tends to experience high volatility. But these are near universal hallmarks of crypto assets”. The Division of Corporate Finance reasoned that meme coins are mainly driven by speculation, trends, and social media promotion, whereas traditional securities like stocks and bonds are driven by part ownership in a company and income derived from dividends. The division also concerned itself with the criminal element surrounding meme coins, requiring other agencies, rather than the SEC, to monitor such issues. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies created as internet memes or jokes. They are often spread through social media as trends, but they fundamentally hold no real world value. Owners typically buy meme coins for fun or speculation. “In this regard, meme coins are akin to collectibles,” said the SEC division, having “limited or no use or functionality”. “Given the speculative nature of meme coins, they tend to experience significant market price volatility, and often are accompanied by statements regarding their risks and lack of utility, other than for entertainment or other non-functional purposes”. Recent examples of meme coins include $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens, inspired by the Trump presidential campaign. These tokens hope to take advantage of the recent hype surrounding U.S. politics, but they only reinforce how absurd the concept has become, holding no intrinsic value at all. Since the concept started, there has been an explosion of meme coins. The tokens often have no underlying value and are of little use as cryptocurrencies. In this respect, they do seem to resemble trading cards or other types of collectibles. The SEC’s announcement comes as politicians are trying to introduce regulations against creating meme coins. Californian politician Sam Liccardo aims to prevent elected officials from launching or promoting meme coins. The move comes in response to the Trump token, which oscillated wildly and could be used by politicians to enrich themselves and defraud the public.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|SHIB|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-03 06:05:12

If you’re following the progress of Ethereum and its ongoing upgrades, you’ll want to pay close attention to this update. Over the weekend, plans for mass slashing of inactive validators on the Holesky testnet were put on hold. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters for the future of Ethereum. What’s the Latest on the Ethereum Testnet and Validator Slashing? According to Christine Kim, Vice President at Galaxy Research, reporting on X , Ethereum developers have postponed the much-anticipated mass slashing of inactive validators on the Holesky testnet. This decision wasn’t made lightly; it followed a crucial Ethereum All Core Developers (ACDE) conference call. The core reason for this delay? A simple, yet critical, issue: there weren’t enough active validators currently participating in the Holesky testnet to proceed with the slashing event. To put it simply, slashing inactive validators is a necessary process to maintain the health and security of the network. However, performing a mass slashing event when the active validator pool is already thin could potentially destabilize the testnet further. Ethereum developers, prioritizing network stability, opted for a more cautious approach. They decided to grant additional time to allow more active validators to join the Holesky testnet before re-evaluating the validator slashing schedule. Why is Validator Slashing Important for Ethereum Testnets Like Holesky? To understand the significance of this delay, it’s important to grasp why validator slashing is a necessary mechanism in proof-of-stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum. Think of validators as the guardians of the blockchain. They are responsible for verifying transactions and maintaining the network’s integrity. In return for their services, they earn rewards. However, if validators fail to perform their duties, either by being offline for extended periods or by acting maliciously, they face penalties. One such penalty is ‘slashing’, where a portion of their staked ETH is taken away. Here’s a breakdown of why validator slashing is crucial: Network Security: Slashing acts as a deterrent against malicious behavior. Validators are incentivized to act honestly and diligently to protect their staked assets. Network Liveness: By penalizing inactive validators, the network encourages participation and ensures there are enough active validators to process transactions and keep the blockchain running smoothly. Resource Optimization: Slashing helps to remove resources tied up in inactive validators, allowing the network to operate more efficiently. For testnets like Holesky, which are designed to mimic the main Ethereum network but in a testing environment, validator slashing is equally important. It helps to simulate real-world conditions and test the network’s resilience under various scenarios, including validator inactivity. Holesky Testnet’s Recent Challenges: The Pectra Upgrade Bug and Network Performance The decision to delay validator slashing on the Holesky testnet also comes in the wake of recent challenges faced by the network. At the end of last month, Holesky experienced significant chain splits and network performance issues. The culprit? A bug that surfaced after the activation of the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade is an upcoming major upgrade for Ethereum, aimed at enhancing the network’s capabilities and efficiency. Testnets like Holesky play a vital role in rigorously testing these upgrades before they are deployed on the main Ethereum network. The bug encountered after the Pectra upgrade activation highlights the importance of these testnets in identifying and resolving issues in a controlled environment, preventing potential disruptions on the mainnet. These recent network performance issues likely contributed to the developers’ cautious approach regarding validator slashing. Introducing mass slashing on a testnet already grappling with stability issues could have potentially exacerbated the situation. Instead, prioritizing network stability and allowing more validators to join appears to be a sensible and strategic move. Who are Ethereum Developers and What’s Their Role in Testnet Decisions? When we talk about “Ethereum developers,” we’re referring to a diverse and distributed community of individuals and teams who contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem. These developers work on various aspects of Ethereum, from core protocol development to client implementations and tooling. The Ethereum All Core Developers (ACDE) conference calls are a key forum where these developers convene to discuss and make critical decisions about the future of Ethereum. In the context of testnets like Holesky, Ethereum developers play a crucial role in: Implementing Upgrades: They are responsible for coding and deploying upgrades like Pectra on testnets to evaluate their performance and identify bugs. Monitoring Network Health: Developers constantly monitor the health and performance of testnets, analyzing metrics and identifying potential issues like chain splits or low validator participation. Making Strategic Decisions: As seen in the case of the validator slashing delay, developers make informed decisions based on the current state of the testnet, prioritizing stability and progress. Community Communication: Developers often communicate updates and decisions to the wider Ethereum community through platforms like X, blog posts, and community forums, ensuring transparency and keeping stakeholders informed. The Significance of Testnets Like Holesky in Ethereum’s Ecosystem Ethereum testnets, such as Holesky, Goerli, and Sepolia, are indispensable components of the Ethereum ecosystem. They serve as crucial proving grounds for new features and upgrades before they are rolled out to the mainnet, where billions of dollars in value are transacted and stored. Think of them as sandboxes where developers can experiment, break things, and fix them without risking the integrity of the main Ethereum network. Here’s why Ethereum testnets are so vital: Risk Mitigation: Testnets allow for the identification and resolution of bugs and vulnerabilities in a safe environment, preventing costly and potentially catastrophic issues on the mainnet. Innovation and Experimentation: Developers can freely experiment with new ideas and technologies on testnets, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with Ethereum. Community Feedback: Testnets provide a platform for the wider Ethereum community, including developers, users, and node operators, to test new features and provide valuable feedback before mainnet deployment. Preparation for Upgrades: By thoroughly testing upgrades on testnets, the Ethereum ecosystem ensures a smoother and more secure transition when these upgrades are eventually implemented on the main network. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Holesky and Validator Slashing? The delay in validator slashing on the Holesky testnet is a temporary measure. Ethereum developers are expected to closely monitor the situation and reassess the timing of the slashing event as more validators join the network. This cautious approach underscores the commitment of Ethereum developers to maintaining a robust and stable testing environment. For those involved in the Ethereum ecosystem, particularly validators and developers working on testnets, staying informed about these developments is crucial. Monitoring official Ethereum communication channels and community forums will provide the latest updates on the Holesky testnet and the rescheduled validator slashing. In conclusion, the postponement of validator slashing on the Holesky testnet, while seemingly a minor setback, is a significant indicator of the Ethereum development team’s dedication to careful and considered progress. By prioritizing network stability and addressing challenges proactively, they are ensuring the long-term health and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. This reveals a mature and responsible approach to blockchain development, emphasizing robustness over rushed deployments.

For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding market cycles is crucial. The CoinMarketCap (CMC) Altcoin Season Index provides a fascinating glimpse into this dynamic, and the latest reading points towards a clear trend: we’re currently navigating a Bitcoin Season . Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 14 Really Mean? The Altcoin Season Index , a tool meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap, offers a numerical representation of the prevailing market sentiment. As of 00:35 UTC on March 3rd, the index registered a score of 14, holding steady from the previous day. But what exactly does this seemingly low number signify? In essence, a score of 14 firmly places us in Bitcoin Season . Let’s break down how this index works: Scope: The index analyzes the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure reflection of market dynamics. Performance Window: It assesses the performance of these altcoins against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This 90-day window offers a significant timeframe to gauge market trends, smoothing out short-term volatility. The 75% Threshold: The core principle of the index revolves around a 75% benchmark. Altcoin Season: If 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the last 90 days, the market is considered to be in ‘Altcoin Season’. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, if 75% or more of these altcoins *underperform* Bitcoin (meaning 25% or fewer outperform), we are in ‘Bitcoin Season’. Index Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a granular view of the market’s lean towards either Bitcoin or altcoins. A lower score, like 14, indicates a stronger Bitcoin dominance. Why Does the Altcoin Season Index Matter for Crypto Investors? Understanding whether we’re in Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season is more than just market trivia; it’s a critical piece of information for strategic crypto investing. Here’s why: Portfolio Allocation: Knowing the prevailing market season can guide your portfolio adjustments. During Bitcoin Season , it might be prudent to increase your Bitcoin holdings or focus on Bitcoin-related investments. In contrast, Altcoin Season might present opportunities to diversify into select altcoins showing strong momentum. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally considered riskier than Bitcoin due to their higher volatility and smaller market capitalization. A Bitcoin Season often signals a flight to safety, suggesting potentially higher risk in holding a large altcoin portfolio. Trading Strategies: Traders can tailor their strategies based on the season. Bitcoin Season might favor Bitcoin-focused trading pairs, while Altcoin Season could open up opportunities in altcoin-to-Bitcoin or altcoin-to-fiat pairs. Market Sentiment Analysis: The Altcoin Season Index serves as a broader indicator of market sentiment. A strong Bitcoin Season might reflect investor caution or a belief in Bitcoin’s continued dominance as a store of value. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: What’s Driving It? With the Altcoin Season Index firmly in Bitcoin territory, it’s natural to wonder what factors are contributing to this market phase. While pinpointing exact causes is complex, several potential drivers could be at play: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, inflation concerns, and geopolitical events often drive investors towards perceived safe-haven assets. In the crypto world, Bitcoin is frequently viewed as the safest bet amidst broader market uncertainty. Institutional Investment Flow: Large institutional investors often favor Bitcoin due to its established track record, regulatory clarity (relative to altcoins), and deeper liquidity. Increased institutional inflows into Bitcoin can strengthen its dominance. Bitcoin Narrative Strength: Positive narratives around Bitcoin, such as its role as digital gold, inflation hedge, or store of value, can bolster its appeal and lead to outperformance against altcoins. Developments like ETF approvals or positive regulatory updates can further strengthen this narrative. Altcoin Market Corrections: After periods of significant altcoin rallies, corrections are natural. Profit-taking in altcoins and a rotation back to Bitcoin can contribute to a Bitcoin Season. Actionable Insights for a Bitcoin Season: Strategies to Consider So, how should crypto investors and traders navigate the current Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Portfolio Allocation: Assess your current crypto portfolio. Is it heavily weighted in altcoins? Consider rebalancing to increase your Bitcoin allocation if you anticipate the Bitcoin Season to persist. Focus on Bitcoin Trading Pairs: For active traders, exploring Bitcoin trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USD, BTC/ETH) might offer more consistent opportunities during a Bitcoin Season. Research Resilient Altcoins: Not all altcoins underperform during Bitcoin Season. Identify altcoins with strong fundamentals, active development, and growing adoption that might weather the Bitcoin dominance and potentially outperform when market sentiment shifts. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: If you believe in the long-term potential of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin through DCA strategies. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto market is incredibly dynamic. Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index , market news, and fundamental developments to adapt your strategies as market conditions evolve. Challenges and Considerations When Using the Altcoin Season Index While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it’s essential to acknowledge its limitations and use it as one data point among many: Lagging Indicator: The index is based on 90-day performance, meaning it reflects past market movements. It’s not a predictive tool for future market direction. Top 100 Focus: The index only considers the top 100 coins. Performance outside this range is not captured, potentially missing emerging altcoin trends. Market Manipulation: Like any metric, the index can be influenced by market manipulation, although the 90-day window and broad scope mitigate this risk to some extent. Oversimplification: Reducing market dynamics to a single index score is an oversimplification. It’s crucial to consider other factors like market volume, news events, and on-chain metrics alongside the Altcoin Season Index . Conclusion: Embracing the Bitcoin Season and Preparing for What’s Next The Altcoin Season Index at 14 clearly signals that we are currently in a Bitcoin Season . This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal for the broader crypto market, but rather a reflection of current market dynamics where Bitcoin is leading the charge. By understanding the nuances of this index, recognizing the factors driving market seasons, and adopting adaptable strategies, crypto investors can navigate these phases effectively.

A significant shift in governance is on the horizon for the Cronos network. A bold new proposal has been unveiled that could reshape the future of the chain and its native CRO token. If you’re invested in the Cronos ecosystem, or simply watching the evolution of EVM chains, this is news you can’t afford to miss. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What is the Cronos Strategic Reserve and Why Does it Matter? The core of this announcement revolves around the establishment of a Cronos Strategic Reserve . But what exactly is this reserve, and why is it being proposed now? In essence, the Cronos Strategic Reserve is envisioned as a dedicated pool of CRO tokens intended to bolster the long-term growth and sustainability of the Cronos ecosystem. Think of it as a war chest, strategically deployed to fuel innovation, incentivize development, and enhance the overall robustness of the network. This reserve is not just about hoarding tokens; it’s about actively using them to propel Cronos forward. Here’s a breakdown of why a strategic reserve is crucial for Cronos: Ecosystem Growth: A strategic reserve can provide funding for new projects, grants for developers, and initiatives that expand the Cronos ecosystem. This fosters innovation and attracts more users and builders to the chain. Network Security & Stability: Funds from the reserve could be allocated to enhance network security, infrastructure upgrades, and ensure the long-term stability of the Cronos chain. Community Incentives: The reserve can be used to reward active community members, incentivize participation in governance, and foster a stronger, more engaged community. Strategic Partnerships: Having a reserve allows Cronos to pursue strategic partnerships and collaborations that can expand its reach and influence within the broader crypto space. The proposal highlights a proactive approach by the Cronos team to ensure the network remains competitive and continues to grow in the dynamic landscape of blockchain technology. Decoding the CRO Governance Proposal: Voting and Token Reissuance The path to establishing the Cronos Strategic Reserve involves a crucial step: a CRO governance proposal . This isn’t just a top-down decision; it’s a community-driven process where CRO token holders have the power to shape the future direction of the network. The proposal, slated for launch on March 3rd, will be put to a vote, allowing the Cronos community to collectively decide on its merits. Voting is scheduled to conclude on March 17th, giving ample time for token holders to understand the implications and cast their votes. The most striking aspect of this governance proposal is the plan to reissue 70 billion previously burned CRO tokens. Let’s unpack what this means: Token Burning: Token burning is a mechanism often used in cryptocurrency to reduce the total supply of tokens, potentially increasing scarcity and value over time. Cronos, like many other projects, has previously burned a significant amount of CRO tokens. Reissuance for Strategic Reserve: This proposal suggests reissuing a portion of these burned tokens – a substantial 70 billion – to populate the newly proposed Strategic Reserve. Five-Year Lock-Up: To ensure responsible and strategic deployment, these reissued tokens will be subject to a five-year lock-up period. This prevents immediate market flooding and signals a long-term commitment to the reserve’s purpose. This approach is designed to balance the benefits of a strategic reserve with concerns about token supply and potential inflationary pressures. The lock-up period is a key element in mitigating these concerns and ensuring the reissued tokens are used judiciously over time. Why a Crypto Token Reissue? Examining the Rationale Behind the 70 Billion CRO The question on many minds is likely: why choose a crypto token reissue , specifically of burned tokens, to fund the Strategic Reserve? Why not use existing treasury funds or other mechanisms? There are several compelling reasons why this approach might be considered strategic: Capitalizing on Burned Tokens: Burned tokens are essentially ‘out of circulation’. Reissuing them provides a source of capital without directly impacting the currently circulating supply (at least initially, given the lock-up). Community Alignment: By reissuing previously burned tokens, the proposal could be seen as a way to ‘reinvest’ value back into the community and the ecosystem, aligning with the initial purpose of token burning – to enhance token value for holders. Avoiding Immediate Market Impact: Compared to selling existing treasury holdings, reissuing locked-up tokens is less likely to create immediate selling pressure in the market, especially with the five-year lock-up in place. Transparency and Governance: Putting this decision to a governance vote emphasizes the decentralized nature of Cronos and allows the community to directly participate in a significant financial decision. However, it’s also crucial to acknowledge potential concerns. Some might argue that reissuing burned tokens could dilute the intended scarcity created by the initial burn. Open discussion and careful consideration of these viewpoints within the community are essential during the voting period. Understanding Cronos Burned Tokens: Context and Implications To fully grasp the significance of this proposal, it’s important to understand the history of Cronos burned tokens . Token burning is a common practice in the crypto world, often employed for various reasons, including: Reducing Supply: The primary goal is usually to reduce the total supply of a cryptocurrency. By permanently removing tokens from circulation, the remaining tokens may become more scarce, potentially increasing their value over time (assuming demand remains constant or increases). Deflationary Mechanism: Burning can introduce a deflationary aspect to a token’s economics, which can be attractive to holders in the long run. Proof-of-Burn: In some cases, burning tokens is used as a consensus mechanism (Proof-of-Burn), though this is not the primary reason for Cronos’s past burns. Cronos has engaged in token burning in the past as part of its tokenomics strategy. Reissuing these previously burned tokens for a strategic reserve represents a shift in approach. It suggests a prioritization of ecosystem development and strategic growth at this stage in Cronos’s lifecycle. The community needs to weigh the potential benefits of a well-funded strategic reserve against any perceived dilution of scarcity from reissuing burned tokens. The Impact on EVM Chain Governance: Cronos Leading the Way? As an EVM chain governance participant, Cronos is operating within a competitive ecosystem of smart contract platforms. This proposal can be viewed as a significant step in enhancing its governance model and strategic positioning within the broader crypto landscape. By implementing a community-voted Strategic Reserve funded by reissued tokens, Cronos could be setting a precedent for other EVM chains. Here’s how this proposal could impact Cronos’s standing as an EVM chain: Enhanced Decentralization: The governance vote empowers CRO holders and reinforces the decentralized ethos of blockchain. Strategic Resource Allocation: A dedicated Strategic Reserve allows for more proactive and strategic allocation of resources compared to relying solely on organic growth or external funding. Attracting Developers and Projects: The promise of funding and support from the Strategic Reserve can make Cronos a more attractive platform for developers and new projects seeking a robust and well-resourced ecosystem. Competitive Advantage: By proactively addressing long-term sustainability and growth through governance and strategic reserves, Cronos can differentiate itself from other EVM chains. The success of this proposal and the subsequent implementation of the Strategic Reserve could serve as a case study for other EVM chains looking to strengthen their governance and ensure long-term ecosystem health. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Cronos and its Community The Cronos governance proposal to establish a Strategic Reserve and reissue 70 billion CRO tokens marks a pivotal moment for the network. It’s a bold move that reflects a forward-thinking approach to ecosystem development and long-term sustainability. The community now holds the power to shape this future through the upcoming vote. Understanding the nuances of the proposal, engaging in constructive discussions, and casting informed votes are crucial steps for all CRO token holders. The outcome of this vote will not only determine the immediate future of the Strategic Reserve but also set the tone for Cronos governance and strategic direction for years to come. Stay tuned for updates as the voting progresses and the Cronos community embarks on this exciting new chapter.

The legendary Ronaldinho Gaúcho, a name synonymous with breathtaking football artistry, has just stepped into the exhilarating world of cryptocurrency. In a move that’s sending ripples across both the sports and digital asset spheres, Ronaldinho has announced the launch of his very own memecoin: STAR10 . But what exactly does this mean? Is it just another celebrity cash grab, or is there something more to this digital venture? Let’s dive deep into the exciting details and explore what STAR10 could mean for you, the fans, and the broader crypto landscape. What is Ronaldinho’s STAR10 Crypto Memecoin All About? In a succinct yet impactful announcement on X (formerly Twitter), Ronaldinho unveiled STAR10 crypto to the world. While details are still emerging, the core concept is clear: a memecoin officially endorsed by a global icon. For those unfamiliar, memecoins are cryptocurrencies that often gain traction through internet memes and viral social media trends. They are known for their community-driven nature and, at times, explosive price volatility. The fusion of Ronaldinho’s immense global popularity with the memecoin phenomenon is a potentially powerful cocktail. But what are the underlying motivations and mechanics? While concrete details are scarce at this early stage, we can speculate on the potential aims: Fan Engagement: This is perhaps the most obvious angle. STAR10 could be designed to enhance fan interaction, offering exclusive perks, access to events, or even a digital currency to use within a Ronaldinho ecosystem. Brand Building: In today’s digital age, personal branding is paramount. Launching a memecoin can be seen as a modern, tech-savvy way for Ronaldinho to further solidify his brand and connect with a younger, digitally native audience. Community Building: Memecoins thrive on community. STAR10 could foster a dedicated community around Ronaldinho, uniting fans from all corners of the globe under a shared digital banner. Financial Venture: Let’s be realistic, there’s a financial aspect to this. If STAR10 gains traction, it could become a lucrative venture for Ronaldinho and potentially for early adopters. The Allure of Celebrity Crypto Tokens: Why Ronaldinho is Not Alone Ronaldinho is not the first celebrity to venture into the crypto space, and certainly won’t be the last. The allure of celebrity crypto tokens is multifaceted. For celebrities, it offers a new avenue for monetization, fan engagement, and brand expansion. For fans, it presents an opportunity to connect with their idols on a deeper level and potentially benefit financially from the token’s success. We’ve seen examples across various industries: Celebrity Token/Project Industry Purpose Paris Hilton Various NFT projects Entertainment/Socialite NFT Art, Community Building Snoop Dogg NFTs, Crypto investments Music NFT collectibles, metaverse presence Floyd Mayweather Jr. Various crypto endorsements Sports (Boxing) Brand promotion, crypto projects Lionel Messi Socios Fan Tokens Sports (Football) Fan engagement, club tokens However, the celebrity crypto token landscape is not without its complexities. It’s crucial to remember that celebrity endorsement does not equate to financial success or legitimacy. Investors should always conduct thorough research and understand the risks involved before diving into any crypto project, celebrity-backed or otherwise. Navigating the Risks and Rewards of Football Memecoin Investments Investing in any cryptocurrency, especially a football memecoin like STAR10, comes with inherent risks and potential rewards. It’s vital to approach this with a balanced perspective and understand what you’re getting into. Let’s break down some key considerations: Potential Rewards: Community Growth: If STAR10 taps into Ronaldinho’s massive fanbase and builds a strong community, the token’s value could appreciate significantly. Exclusive Access: STAR10 holders might gain access to exclusive Ronaldinho content, events, merchandise, or even virtual experiences. Financial Gains: Like any cryptocurrency, early investors in STAR10 could potentially see substantial returns if the memecoin gains popularity and adoption. Fan Engagement: For die-hard Ronaldinho fans, owning STAR10 could be a unique way to support their idol and feel more connected to his brand. Potential Risks: Volatility: Memecoins are notoriously volatile. Their prices can fluctuate wildly based on hype and social media sentiment. Investing in STAR10 carries a high degree of risk of losing capital. Lack of Utility: The long-term utility of STAR10 is still unclear. If it lacks real-world applications or tangible benefits beyond hype, its value could plummet. Rug Pull Potential: While less likely with a celebrity-backed project, the risk of a “rug pull” (where developers abandon the project and take investor funds) always exists in the crypto space. Regulatory Scrutiny: Celebrity crypto endorsements are increasingly facing regulatory scrutiny. Changes in regulations could impact the value and viability of STAR10. Hype-Driven Investment: Memecoin prices are often driven by hype and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Investing based solely on hype without understanding the underlying project is a dangerous game. Actionable Insights for Fans and Potential STAR10 memecoin Investors So, you’re intrigued by Ronaldinho memecoin STAR10? Here’s a dose of actionable insights to help you navigate this exciting but risky landscape: Do Your Research: Don’t invest blindly based on celebrity endorsement. Look for official information about STAR10, its whitepaper (if available), its tokenomics, and its roadmap. Understand the project beyond the hype. Start Small: If you decide to invest, start with a small amount that you can afford to lose. Memecoins are high-risk investments, so never put in more than you’re comfortable potentially losing. Join the Community: Engage with the STAR10 community on social media platforms like X, Telegram, or Discord (if available). Gauge the community sentiment and stay updated on project developments. Understand the Utility: Try to understand the intended utility of STAR10. Will it offer real-world benefits, exclusive access, or just be a speculative asset? Utility can contribute to long-term value. Be Cautious of Hype: While hype can drive short-term gains, it’s not a sustainable foundation for long-term investment. Be wary of excessive hype and FOMO. Consider Long-Term Vision: Think about the long-term vision for STAR10. Is it just a fleeting trend, or does it have the potential to evolve into something more substantial within the Ronaldinho brand ecosystem? The Future of Football and Crypto: A New Era? Ronaldinho’s foray into the crypto world with STAR10 is more than just a celebrity memecoin launch. It signifies a potential convergence of football, celebrity culture, and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Whether STAR10 becomes a resounding success or a fleeting fad remains to be seen. However, it undeniably highlights the growing trend of celebrities leveraging crypto to connect with fans and explore new digital frontiers. For football fans, this could be the beginning of a new era where digital tokens enhance fan experiences, unlock exclusive content, and even offer a stake in the brands they love. For the crypto market, it’s another example of how celebrity endorsements can bring mainstream attention and potentially drive adoption, albeit with inherent risks that must be carefully considered. Ultimately, the success of STAR10, and indeed the broader trend of celebrity crypto tokens, will depend on genuine utility, strong community building, and responsible investor behavior. As always in the crypto world, proceed with caution, do your own research, and only invest what you can afford to lose. But keep your eyes peeled – this could be an explosive development in the ever-evolving landscape of crypto and sports.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-is-skeptical-of-us-crypto-reserve-announcement-heres-why/,"BitMEX co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes has expressed skepticism over US President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, describing it as “nothing new” and questioning its viability. Arthur Hayes Slams Trump's Crypto Reserve Plan as 'Just Talk' “Nothing new here just words,” Hayes wrote on X in response to Trump’s post. “Let me know when they get congressional approval to borrow money or push the price of gold even higher. Without that, they don’t have the money to buy Bitcoin and altcoins,” he added. Market Optimism vs. Skepticism Trump’s statement suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) could be included in a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve sparked a market rally, with Bitcoin rising over 8% and altcoins posting double-digit gains. However, Hayes remains cautious, reaffirming his long-term bullish outlook while stating that he will not be increasing his crypto holdings at this time. “I’m still bullish,” Hayes added, “but I’m not going to buy any more tokens at this point.” Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) took a more optimistic stance, stating that more valuable crypto assets could be added over time and urged the community to remain positive. *This is not investment advice.

Pi Coin was also among the few altcoins that failed to register strong gains over the weekend after US President Donald Trump announced a crypto strategic reserve. As Pi Network tumbles, let us explore three main factors fuelling the downtrend. Top 3 Reasons Why Pi Network Price is Crashing Today Pi Network token today trades at $1.67 after a 7% drop in 24 hours. Pi Coin reached an all-time high of $2.98 last week, but it has since dropped by 43%. Below are the top 3 reasons why the Pi Network price is crashing. Delayed Binance Listing One of the factors that have been driving gains for Pi Network price since its launch is the hype around exchange listings . However, the token’s listing on Binance is taking longer than expected, causing buyer exhaustion. Binance conducted a community vote between February 17 and February 27 asking its users to vote on whether to list Pi Coin. The vote closed with 86% of Binance users being in favor of the listing. However, nearly one week since the vote closed, the Pi Network token has yet to debut trading on Binance. Binance Voting Poll If Binance fails to list Pi Coin, it could dim investor confidence and fuel more declines for the token. Whales Are Likely Selling Pi Coin Amid Slow Adoption Pi Network may also be crashing because of whale manipulation. This is according to analyst Dr Picoin who stated that the current volatility is caused by a pump-and-dump scheme by whales. In his analysis, Dr Picoin noted that Pi Network price would likely stabilize if decentralized applications (dApps) were launched on Open Network. “Once a majority of Pi DApps are deployed, they will significantly reduce pump-and-dump cycles by increasing utility-based demand and stabilizing liquidity,” he stated. Recently, Florida-based real estate company Zito Realty announced that it would accept Pi Coin as a means of payment for real estate transactions. If this continues, it could detach PiCoin from the meme coin market and drive a strong uptrend. Pi Network Price Succumbs to Rising Bearish Pressure The Pi Network token hourly chart shows that the bearish momentum depicted in the descending parallel channel is gaining strength. The RSI is below 50, indicating that bears are in control. At the same time, the RSI has been making lower lows, meaning that selling pressure is increasing. The Awesome Oscillator also shows rising bearish momentum, which may fuel the downtrend in Pi Network price in the near term. The RSI and the AO show that sellers have overpowered buyers, causing the Pi Network token to drop in value. If these bearish trends continue, PI Coin may breach support at $1.49. Dropping below this level will cause Pi Network price to breach the lower trendline and accelerate the downtrend. Failure to defend this support will push Pi Coin below $1 to $0.70. PI/USDT: 1-hour Chart Bottom Line The Pi Network token is dropping because of several factors. These include the delayed listing of Pi Coin on the Binance exchange. Whales are also likely selling Pi Coin, which is driving the bearish momentum. As bears gain control, Pi Network price could drop below $1 to find support at $0.70 The post Why Is Pi Network Price Crashing? appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|Pi Coin|Pi Network Price|Pi Network Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-03 07:26:04

This unprecedented action marks the first time the UK has imposed a criminal penalty on an unregistered cryptocurrency platform, signaling a significant escalation in the nation’s approach to crypto ATM regulation UK . Are you ready to delve into the details of this groundbreaking case and understand its wider implications? Why is UK Crypto ATM Regulation Suddenly So Strict? The UK, like many jurisdictions globally, is grappling with the burgeoning cryptocurrency market and the need for robust regulatory frameworks. The case of GidiPlus highlights the UK’s increasingly firm stance on crypto ATM regulation . Operating without proper registration is not just a procedural oversight anymore; it’s now a serious criminal offense. This case underscores several key aspects of the UK’s regulatory approach: Enforcement is a Priority: The four-year jail term is a clear message that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is serious about enforcing UK crypto regulation . They are moving beyond warnings and fines to criminal prosecution for non-compliance. Consumer Protection: Unregistered platforms pose risks to consumers. By cracking down on unregistered crypto ATMs , the UK aims to protect citizens from potential scams and financial crimes often associated with unregulated crypto activities. Anti-Money Laundering (AML): Crypto ATMs , in particular, have been flagged as potential conduits for money laundering due to their cash-to-crypto conversion capabilities. Regulation seeks to mitigate these risks and ensure compliance with AML standards. Setting a Precedent: This case sets a significant precedent. It demonstrates that operating a cryptocurrency business, including crypto ATMs , without proper authorization in the UK will be met with severe consequences, including imprisonment. GidiPlus and the Case of the Unregistered Crypto ATMs GidiPlus, the company at the heart of this case, had been operating crypto ATMs in the UK since 2021. Despite processing transactions worth $3.14 million, the company failed to register with the FCA, a mandatory requirement for businesses dealing with cryptocurrency exchange services. Let’s break down the key facts surrounding GidiPlus’s operations and the legal proceedings: Aspect Details Company GidiPlus Business Crypto ATM operator Operating Period Since 2021 Transaction Volume $3.14 million Regulatory Failure Unregistered with FCA Penalty Four-year jail sentence for executive Olumide Osunkoya Significance First criminal penalty in the UK for an unregistered crypto platform The court’s decision to impose a jail sentence, rather than just a fine, underscores the gravity with which the UK authorities view violations of crypto regulation enforcement . It’s a clear signal that simply ignoring registration requirements is no longer an option for cryptocurrency businesses operating in the UK. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Regulation in the UK? The GidiPlus case is likely to have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency landscape in the UK and potentially beyond. Here’s what industry stakeholders and observers are watching closely: Increased Scrutiny: Expect heightened scrutiny of all cryptocurrency businesses operating in the UK, particularly those involved with crypto ATMs and similar cash-to-crypto services. The FCA will likely ramp up its monitoring and enforcement activities. Greater Compliance: This ruling should incentivize cryptocurrency businesses to prioritize compliance with UK crypto regulation . The threat of jail time is a powerful deterrent and will likely lead to increased registration and adherence to regulatory guidelines. Investor Confidence: While stricter regulation might seem restrictive, in the long run, it can boost investor confidence. A regulated environment provides a safer and more transparent market, attracting institutional and retail investors who are wary of unregulated spaces. Global Impact: The UK’s tough stance could influence other countries considering or implementing their own crypto regulation enforcement frameworks. It sets a benchmark for serious penalties for non-compliance. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Crypto Regulation For businesses operating in the cryptocurrency sector, particularly in the UK, the message is loud and clear: compliance is non-negotiable. Here are some actionable insights for navigating this evolving regulatory landscape: Prioritize Registration: If you are operating a cryptocurrency business in the UK, ensure you are registered with the FCA. Understand the specific requirements for your business model and take immediate steps to comply. Seek Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in crypto regulation to ensure your operations are fully compliant and to stay updated on any changes in the regulatory framework. Transparency is Key: Operate with transparency in your dealings. Be upfront about your business practices and cooperate fully with regulatory inquiries. Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify potential areas of non-compliance and implement robust controls to mitigate these risks. Stay Informed: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Stay informed about the latest developments in UK crypto regulation and adapt your operations accordingly. A Turning Point for Crypto Regulation? The jailing of the unregistered crypto ATM operator in the UK is more than just a single case; it’s a potential turning point for crypto regulation globally. It signifies a move towards stricter enforcement and a zero-tolerance approach to non-compliance. As the cryptocurrency industry matures, robust regulation is essential for fostering trust, protecting consumers, and preventing illicit activities. The UK’s decisive action serves as a powerful reminder that the era of operating in the shadows is rapidly coming to an end for cryptocurrency businesses. The spotlight is now firmly on compliance, and those who fail to heed the warning risk facing severe consequences.

According to a recent statement , authorities have asked the court to officially seize roughly $8.2 million USDT held in three cryptocurrency wallets. The assets in question include funds directly tied to victims’ losses. The funds were seized from scammers who ran a fake crypto investment scheme by tricking victims through “wrong number” text messages and fraudulent trading platforms. At least 33 people across the U.S. lost a combined $4.9 million, while five more victims, still unidentified, lost an additional $1 million. The scam kicks off with scammers sending “wrong number” texts to random people on their phones, dating applications and professional meet-up groups to strike up conversations. Subsequently, they try to befriend the victim before slowly reeling them into a dubious crypto investment, a tactic typically referred to as pig butchering . Victims are then guided step-by-step on how to open legitimate accounts on platforms like Crypto.com and Coinbase. Once their accounts are funded, the scammers convince them to move the money to what looks like a professional investment site, which, in reality, is a malicious platform controlled by the scammers. You might also like: $87M crypto scam uncovered in Norway, four individuals indicted Notably, some victims were even allowed to withdraw small amounts early on to make the scheme seem real. Eventually, their funds were completely blocked, and when they tried to cash out, the scammers demanded additional payment in the name of tax requirements. “Knowing that the scam would run its course soon, the fraudsters used last-ditch efforts to lie to victims that they had to pay a tax. Ultimately, victims were locked out of their accounts on the investment platform and lost their funds,” authorities said. One victim, a woman from Lake County, Ohio, reportedly lost her entire life savings of $663,000, including funds from her Roth IRA. She reported the scam to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center in June 2024, prompting an investigation. Following a blockchain analysis, authorities traced the stolen crypto to three wallets. The FBI executed a seizure warrant, and with Tether’s assistance, the funds were frozen and transferred to a law-enforcement-controlled wallet. In a Feb. 27 forfeiture complaint , U.S. Attorney Carol Skutnik and Assistant U.S. Attorney James Morford asked the court to formally seize the recovered crypto, adding that the accounts also contained additional funds beyond what victims lost, which were allegedly tied to money laundering and wire fraud. As previously reported by crypto.news, pig butchering scams accounted for 33.2% of scam-related crypto inflows in 2024. According to Chainalysis, deposits to these scams surged 210% year-over-year.

41090373,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136028,1740986929,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Metaplanet’s Bold Bitcoin Boost: Japanese Firm Adds 156 BTC in Strategic Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-boosts-bitcoin-holdings/,"In a move that’s sending ripples through the cryptocurrency market, Metaplanet, a publicly traded company based in Japan, has just announced a significant expansion of its digital asset portfolio. The company, known for its proactive stance on Bitcoin adoption, revealed via X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 156 BTC. This latest purchase further solidifies Metaplanet’s position as a pioneering corporate entity embracing Bitcoin as a core part of its financial strategy. But what exactly does this mean for the company, the broader market, and the future of corporate Bitcoin adoption? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. Why is Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Investment Grabbing Headlines? Metaplanet isn’t just dipping its toes into the crypto waters; they’re diving headfirst! This recent acquisition of 156 BTC is a clear signal of their conviction in Bitcoin as a valuable asset. But why is this particular Bitcoin investment making waves? Here are a few key reasons: Publicly Listed Commitment: Metaplanet is a publicly listed company, making its corporate Bitcoin strategy highly visible and subject to market scrutiny. Their continued investment sends a strong message to traditional finance and other corporations. Significant Quantity: Adding 156 BTC is not a trivial amount. At current market prices, this represents a substantial financial commitment, indicating serious intent. Japanese Market Leadership: As a Japanese company, Metaplanet’s actions are closely watched within the Asian market, potentially influencing other businesses in the region to consider similar BTC investment strategies. Transparency and Disclosure: Announcing the purchase publicly on social media showcases a level of transparency that resonates with the crypto community and builds trust. This bold move raises several interesting questions. Is Metaplanet setting a new trend for publicly listed companies? What are the underlying motivations driving this corporate Bitcoin strategy ? And how will this impact the overall perception and adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors? Deep Dive into Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Holdings To truly understand the magnitude of this announcement, let’s take a closer look at Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings and their overall approach to cryptocurrency. Aspect Details Company Type Publicly Listed (Japan) Industry Varied (Previously focused on other sectors, now pivoting to Bitcoin) Current Bitcoin Holdings Increased by 156 BTC (Total undisclosed, but growing significantly) Investment Strategy Long-term accumulation of Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset Motivation Potentially hedging against economic uncertainty, seeking higher returns than traditional assets, belief in Bitcoin’s future value Metaplanet’s shift towards becoming a Japanese Bitcoin company is noteworthy. Unlike some companies that might allocate a small percentage to crypto as a speculative venture, Metaplanet appears to be making Bitcoin a central pillar of its financial strategy. This level of commitment is relatively rare among publicly listed firms and positions them as a leader in this emerging space. The Strategic Rationale Behind Metaplanet’s BTC Investment Why are companies like Metaplanet increasingly turning to Bitcoin? The reasons are multifaceted and reflect a changing global economic landscape. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often touted as a hedge against inflation. As traditional currencies face potential devaluation, Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive alternative store of value. Diversification: Allocating a portion of corporate treasury to Bitcoin can diversify risk away from traditional assets like stocks and bonds, potentially enhancing portfolio resilience. Higher Potential Returns: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant growth potential, offering the prospect of higher returns compared to conventional investments in the long run. Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets like Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning companies at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. For a Japanese Bitcoin company like Metaplanet, these factors are likely amplified by the specific economic conditions and investment climate in Japan and globally. Their BTC investment is not just a speculative bet; it’s a calculated strategic move with long-term implications. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the potential benefits of a corporate Bitcoin strategy are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations involved. It’s not all smooth sailing when it comes to corporate crypto adoption. Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern for corporate treasuries. Managing risk associated with price swings requires robust strategies and potentially hedging mechanisms. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to navigate complex and often unclear regulations in different jurisdictions. Accounting and Tax Implications: Accounting for and taxing Bitcoin holdings can be complex and varies across jurisdictions. Clear guidelines and expertise are essential. Security and Custody: Safeguarding substantial Bitcoin holdings requires robust security measures and secure custody solutions to prevent theft or loss. Market Perception: While acceptance is growing, some stakeholders may still view Bitcoin investments with skepticism or concern, requiring effective communication and education. Metaplanet, as a pioneer in this space, is likely navigating these challenges head-on, setting precedents and best practices for other companies considering a similar path. Their journey as a Japanese Bitcoin company will be closely watched by the corporate world. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors and Businesses Metaplanet’s increased Bitcoin holdings offer valuable insights for both individual crypto investors and businesses contemplating a foray into digital assets. For Crypto Investors: Corporate Adoption is Growing: Metaplanet’s move is another data point confirming the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin by corporations, potentially signaling further institutional adoption. Focus on Long-Term Value: Metaplanet’s strategy appears to be focused on long-term value accumulation rather than short-term trading, aligning with a common Bitcoin investment thesis. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on how regulations evolve around corporate crypto holdings, as this will significantly impact the landscape. For Businesses: Explore Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: Consider the potential benefits of allocating a portion of your treasury to Bitcoin for diversification, inflation hedging, and potential returns. Develop a Clear Strategy: A successful corporate Bitcoin strategy requires careful planning, risk management, and a clear understanding of your objectives. Seek Expert Guidance: Navigating the complexities of crypto requires expertise in areas like custody, security, accounting, and regulation. Partner with experienced professionals to ensure compliance and best practices. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet – A Sign of Things to Come? Metaplanet’s latest purchase of 156 BTC is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the growing role of Bitcoin in the corporate world. As a publicly listed Japanese Bitcoin company , their bold Bitcoin investment strategy is capturing attention and sparking conversations about the future of corporate finance. While challenges remain, the potential benefits of embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset are becoming increasingly apparent. Metaplanet’s move could very well be a harbinger of a new era where corporate balance sheets include digital gold, and corporate Bitcoin strategy becomes a mainstream practice. The crypto world, and indeed the financial world at large, will be watching Metaplanet’s journey with keen interest.

That has revived investor interest in the Deribit-listed call options or bullish bets at the $100,000 level, according to data source Amberdata. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has gained nearly 10% in 24 hours, reaching a high of over $95,000 at one point, CoinDesk data show. Other tokens that Trump named – ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA – chalked out more significant gains. On Sunday, Trump announced on Truth Social that he has directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL and ADA, with bitcoin and ether at the heart of the reserve. The market welcomed this news with enthusiasm, especially given the disappointment among industry players due to the lack of swift action on the promised reserve since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Now, this whole episode is being seen as evidence of the ""Trump put"" on crypto, suggesting that the Trump administration will intervene to support the market in turbulent times, much like the Fed is known to do for stock markets. ""Today Trump signaled there is a Trump put on crypto. This is good enough for a trend change, particularly given how BTC blasted through resitance with sentiment among many at all time lows,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger said on X. Kruger said that BTC has re-established $89,000 and $92,000 as key support level and traders can ""long support confidently with clear invalidation levels below."" Josh Gilbert, market analyst at eToro, shared a similar view in an email to CoinDesk, saying, ""Given the President's vested interests, it feels like this is something investors may need to get used to; sell-offs of this nature could continue to be supported moving forward."" Against this backdrop, there has been renewed activity in the $100K strike call, signaling that traders are betting on further price gains despite ongoing volatility. A call option gives the purchaser the right to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date, thus offering the buyer an asymmetric upside exposure. Data tracked by Amberdata show open interest or the number of active positions in the $100K call has increased by 1,163 contracts (worth over $100 million), the most among all options listed on Deribit. ""$100k will be the level everyone is looking at intra-week,"" Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said in an email. ""This upcoming [week][ will have interesting “Buy the rumor / Sell the news” dynamics around the March 7th crypto summit. The renewed bias for calls, in general, is also evident from the recovery in the short-term skews, which measure the implied volatility premium (demand) for calls relative to puts. The seven-, 30- and 60-day skews have bounced to zero and higher, up significantly from the deep negative readings since Friday when traders chased protective put options. ""People like to buy calls and sell puts when the market bounces,"" Deribit's Asia Business Development Head, Lin Chen, told CoinDesk. Challenges still exist Some observers are worried that the progress on crypto reserve could be slower-than-expected. ""Nothing new here. Just words. Lmk when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that, they have no money to buy bitcoin and shitcoins,"" Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer and co-founder of Maelstrom Fund, said on X , reacting to Trump's announcement. Several others, including Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou , share a similar view. ""The sentiment we're seeing in the wake of the U.S. federal crypto reserve announcement is largely bullish, with expectations of institutional inflows and global competition for crypto reserves. Scepticism remains, however, with specific concerns over execution, Congressional approval, and potential long-term risks like government intervention,"" Mark Hiriart, Head of Sales at digital asset trading firm Zerocap, said in an email to CoinDesk. ""While institutions may rush in, unclear regulations and macroeconomic conditions could determine whether this rally sticks,"" Hiriart noted, adding the focus now will be on the White House Crypto Summit on March 7, which could provide more details about the crypto reserve.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Options|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-03 07:29:14

Bitcoin accumulation comes days after Metaplanet announced a non-traditional funding strategy to expand its digital asset portfolio. The company revealed issuance of $13.6 million in Zero-Interest bonds to fund Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet Explores Listing Outside Japan The company’s recent Bitcoin purchases come after Gerovich met with officials at the New York Stock Exchange last week. “Metaplanet, as a future-oriented company built on the Bitcoin Standard, continues to grow steadily day-by-day,” he wrote on X. 先週はニューヨークで非常に実りの多い時間を過ごしました。メタプラネットは、ビットコイン・スタンダードを基盤にした未来の企業として、日々着実に成長を続けています。 先週の主なハイライトは以下のとおりです： … pic.twitter.com/OrnK6RRk5R — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) March 2, 2025 Further, he presented Metaplanet’s “platforms and functions” to NYSE and Nasdaq, revealing plans to expand its base outside Japan. “We are exploring the best ways to make Metaplanet’s stock more accessible to investors worldwide.” Gerovich added that Metaplanet will set as an example to prove that “Japanese companies can stand at the forefront of financial innovation and long-term value creation.” Corporates’ Bitcoin Holdings – What is Driving This Adoption? Recently, smaller companies are imitating the Bitcoin accumulation plan, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Crypto security company Coinkite revealed that 78 companies globally hold the crypto in their corporate treasuries. Dom Harz, co-founder of BOB, a build-on-Bitcoin project, says that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have a lot to do with corporates’ Bitcoin adoption. “The idea of staking Bitcoin, which is putting your Bitcoin to work to earn rewards on a blockchain network, is still a novel idea but one that is gaining traction,” he told Cryptonews over mail. “The idea of it becoming a corporate strategy isn’t far-fetched – it’s inevitable.” He emphasized that the possibilities of corporations holding Bitcoin are that they’ll start to integrate digital assets into their core operations. “That brings in room for them to start putting their bitcoin to work, through the likes of staking,” Harz added. “The moment institutions see a viable yield-generating mechanism that aligns with Bitcoin’s security model, we’ll see major players exploring it – and fast.” The post Metaplanet Continues Accumulating Bitcoins, Adds 156 BTC appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve|Metaplanet,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-03-03 07:30:31

41090488,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136029,1740987189,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Insightful Take: Eric Trump Declares Sunday Crypto Reserves Announcement a ‘Genius’ Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eric-trump-crypto-genius-move/,"In a bold statement that’s rippled through both the crypto and traditional finance worlds, Eric Trump, son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has ignited a fresh debate. His recent remarks on social media platform X lauded the announcement of a “crypto strategic reserve” on a Sunday as a “genius” move. But what’s behind this seemingly simple statement, and why is it causing such a stir? Let’s dive deep into the implications of Eric Trump’s perspective and what it means for the future of finance. Why ‘Genius’? Unpacking Eric Trump’s Crypto Reserves Announcement Praise Eric Trump’s praise hinges on a critical difference between the crypto sphere and traditional financial markets: operating hours. Traditional markets, like Wall Street, adhere to a Monday-to-Friday, 9-to-5 schedule. However, the 24/7 crypto market never sleeps. By announcing a significant development like a “crypto strategic reserve” on a Sunday, when Wall Street is “asleep,” Eric Trump suggests a strategic advantage was gained. Let’s break down the potential reasons behind this perceived ‘genius’ move: Retail Investor Empowerment: As Eric Trump pointed out, this Sunday announcement allowed retail investors, who are often more attuned to the always-on nature of crypto, to react and potentially benefit first. This could be seen as a win for the everyday investor, bypassing the institutional gatekeepers who are typically active during weekday trading hours. Market Disruption: Announcing outside traditional market hours can create a shockwave. It forces traditional finance to play catch-up, highlighting the agile and disruptive nature of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Global Reach Advantage: The 24/7 crypto market is inherently global. A Sunday announcement in the US is still active trading time in many parts of the world, maximizing immediate global impact and reaction within the crypto community. The 24/7 Crypto Market Reality: A Paradigm Shift Eric Trump’s statement underscores a fundamental truth about the digital asset landscape: it operates around the clock. This 24/7 crypto market is a stark contrast to the structured hours of traditional exchanges. This always-on nature has profound implications: Feature Traditional Finance Cryptocurrency Operating Hours Monday-Friday, 9-5 (varies by exchange) 24/7, 365 days a year Market Access Primarily weekdays Anytime, anywhere with internet access Response Time Delayed reaction to weekend news Immediate reaction to news, regardless of day or time Investor Base Predominantly institutional during trading hours Mix of retail and institutional, always active This continuous operation presents both opportunities and challenges. For investors, it means the ability to react to market movements at any time. For institutions, it demands a shift in operational thinking to accommodate this always-on environment. Traditional Finance vs Crypto: A Race to Adapt? Eric Trump’s assertion that traditional finance must “catch up with crypto or face extinction” is a strong indictment. It highlights the growing pressure on legacy financial systems to adapt to the speed and accessibility of the digital age, embodied by the 24/7 crypto market . What are the key areas where traditional finance needs to evolve? Embracing Digital Assets: Traditional institutions are increasingly exploring and integrating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This includes offering crypto investment products and exploring blockchain for settlement and efficiency. Operational Flexibility: Adapting to a 24/7 global market requires operational changes. This might involve extended trading hours, automated systems, and a more globalized approach to staffing and operations. Technological Innovation: Traditional finance needs to accelerate its adoption of technology to compete with the agile and tech-driven crypto space. This includes improving digital infrastructure, cybersecurity, and data analytics capabilities. Regulatory Adaptation: Clear and adaptable regulations are crucial for both traditional finance embracing crypto and for the continued growth of the crypto market itself. This includes regulations that address investor protection, market integrity, and innovation. The Impact of Sunday Crypto Announcement: A Case Study While the specifics of the “crypto strategic reserve” announcement mentioned by Eric Trump are not detailed in the provided context, the concept of a Sunday crypto announcement itself is noteworthy. Imagine a hypothetical scenario: A major cryptocurrency project announces a groundbreaking technological upgrade or a significant partnership on a Sunday. Potential Impacts: Immediate Price Volatility: The Sunday crypto announcement could trigger immediate price movements in the related cryptocurrency, as the 24/7 crypto market reacts instantly. Social Media Buzz: Social media platforms, particularly crypto-centric communities, would be abuzz with discussion and analysis of the news. Monday Morning Catch-Up for Traditional Finance: When traditional markets open on Monday, they would need to quickly assess and react to the crypto news that broke over the weekend, potentially leading to ripple effects in related traditional assets. Increased Retail Participation: The accessibility of information and immediate trading in the 24/7 crypto market could encourage more retail investors to participate based on the Sunday announcement. Actionable Insights: Navigating the 24/7 Crypto World So, what are the key takeaways and actionable insights for navigating this always-on crypto landscape? Stay Informed, Stay Alert: In the 24/7 crypto market , news can break at any time. Utilize real-time news sources, social media, and market analysis tools to stay informed. Understand Market Cycles: While crypto is 24/7, trading volume and volatility can fluctuate. Be aware of typical patterns and adjust your strategies accordingly.

The scam, which tricked individuals into sending money under false pretenses, primarily relied on deceptive messages and social engineering tactics to lure victims into fake crypto investments. According to a statement from the Ohio District Attorney’s office on February 28 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has identified 33 victims who collectively lost $6 million to the scheme, with five additional victims yet to be confirmed. Scammers Use ‘Wrong Number’ Messages to Lure Victims on Texts and Apps The fraudsters initiated contact through seemingly innocuous “wrong number” messages sent via text, dating apps, and professional networking groups. Once a victim responded, the scammers built trust by engaging in friendly conversations over time. Using manipulative tactics, the criminals would convince their targets of lucrative investment opportunities in cryptocurrency, often claiming they or someone they knew had seen great success in the market. Victims were then guided through the process of opening accounts on legitimate crypto exchanges, only to be tricked into transferring funds to fraudulent platforms controlled by the scammers. The FBI launched an investigation after a victim filed a complaint with the agency’s Internet Crime Complaint Center in June 2023. A blockchain analysis revealed that a portion of the stolen funds had been converted into Tether (USDT) and transferred to three specific cryptocurrency addresses. Following the issuance of a federal seizure warrant, authorities froze the funds with the help of Tether, which moved them into a law-enforcement-controlled wallet. Since then, the funds have remained secured as legal proceedings unfold. On February 27, acting U.S. Attorney for Ohio Carol Skutnik and Assistant U.S. Attorney James Morford filed a forfeiture complaint in an Ohio District Court. The motion requests that all funds in the three implicated crypto addresses be officially forfeited, enabling their return to the victims. According to the complaint, the scam accounts held funds exceeding the directly traceable losses of the victims, with the total amount reaching $8.2 million. Authorities believe these additional funds were acquired through money laundering and wire fraud. Source: US Department of Justice Devastating Impact on Victims One notable case involved an Ohio woman who lost her life savings of $663,000 to the scam. After being convinced to send her funds, the fraudsters demanded additional payments, claiming they were necessary to release her initial investment. When she was unable to comply, the scammers allegedly threatened harm to her friends and family. In February 2025, losses in the crypto ecosystem increased by 20x month-over-month compared with January 2025, according to the latest report by major blockchain security platform Immunefi . In January, registered losses stood at $73,915,700. Just a month later, this figure jumped to $1,528,342,400. The latter was the result of nine hacks. Additionally, the February number is an 18x increase from the same time a year prior. In February 2024, registered losses were $81,603,400.

On-chain data suggests that this whale thereby redirected its investments into another token, ONDO. In response, market participants are now speculating over relatively lesser returns via the frog-themed meme token, whilst the DAO crypto remains bullish. Pepe Coin Whale Offloads 262B PEPE Incurring Loss According to an X post by Lookonchain on March 3, a Pepe Coin whale sold 261.8 billion tokens worth $2.12 million, marking an alarming loss of $7.05 million. Notably, data signals that the accumulation was made for $9.18 million. The alarming loss has raised severe investor concerns about meme crypto market volatility. Prior to today’s pump, PEPE, alongside other tokens, witnessed a bloodbath due to macroeconomic developments and liquidity hurdles. Nevertheless, crypto prices recovered, with PEPE also gaining nearly 10% intraday. The whale’s decision to sell amid this upswing may be to mitigate further losses. Another Selloff Recorded Subsequently, data indicated the Pepe Coin whale also sold 531.7 billion BEAM for $4.1 million. This trade maneuver further marked an alarming loss of $7.01 million. Altogether, the whale appears to have used the funds with these selloffs to buy ONDO. ONDO Accumulation Sparks Buzz Amid 10% Gains Per the data, this whale thereby moved on to buy 5.25 million ONDO tokens with 6.26 million DAI. Meanwhile, the DAO crypto’s price was up nearly 10% today, closing in at $1.12. This upswing primarily falls in line with a broader crypto market surge. Bitcoin price briefly re-entered a $95K price level in the past 24 hours. Altcoins also followed a pumping action, mirroring optimism amid broader trends. Notably, U.S. President Donald Trump recently announced plans to forge ahead with a strategic crypto reserve for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). This news appears to have fueled a positive investor sentiment globally. How Is PEPE Price Performing? Despite the massive whale selloff, Pepe Coin price visited the crypto market party, surging 7% to $0.000008282. Its intraday low and high were $0.000007569 and $0.000008932, respectively. Notably, market analyst ‘Crypto-Zeus’ further took X amid the rising action, stating, ‘Good time to be a PEPE holder.’ This optimism is primarily attributed to Trump’s green signal into the crypto market, as mentioned above. Crypto market participants continue to eye both the tokens for further price action shifts.

41090636,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136031,1740987449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alert: Asia FX Markets Edge Higher as Dollar Weakens Amid Trump Tariff Jitters,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-tariff-jitters-2/,"Are you keeping a close watch on the pulse of the global financial markets? The cryptocurrency world is intrinsically linked to traditional finance, and understanding shifts in Forex markets can provide crucial insights. Recently, Asia FX markets have shown a subtle yet noteworthy upward trend. Why is this happening, and what does it mean for the broader economic landscape, including the crypto sphere? What’s Driving the Cautious Optimism in Asia FX? Across Asia, currencies have been demonstrating a cautious climb, inching upwards against the US dollar. This movement isn’t a dramatic surge, but rather a steady creep, suggesting a tentative shift in market sentiment. Several factors are contributing to this nuanced dynamic in the currency markets : Dollar’s Retreat: The US dollar, a global reserve currency and often seen as a safe-haven asset, has been giving up some of its recent gains. This softening of the dollar provides breathing room for other currencies, including those in Asia. Anticipation of Trump’s Tariff Decision: The shadow of potential tariff decisions by former President Trump is looming large. Markets are in a state of anticipation, bracing for possible announcements that could significantly impact global trade and currency valuations. This uncertainty is causing some investors to reassess their dollar holdings. Regional Economic Factors: Individual Asian economies are also playing a role. Positive economic data releases from some countries, coupled with expectations of steady or improving economic conditions, are lending support to their respective currencies. The Dollar’s Dilemma: Why is it Losing Ground? The strength of the US dollar is often seen as a barometer of global economic confidence and stability. However, lately, it’s shown signs of vulnerability. What’s causing this slight pullback? Profit-Taking: After a period of sustained strength, some investors are taking profits on their dollar positions. This is a natural market correction and can lead to a temporary weakening of the currency. Uncertainty Surrounding US Economic Policy: Beyond tariffs, broader questions about future US economic policies are creating a degree of uncertainty. This hesitancy can weigh on the dollar as investors seek clarity. Global Economic Interdependence: In today’s interconnected world, the dollar’s performance is not isolated. Developments in other major economies and regions also influence its trajectory. If other economies show signs of robust growth, it can reduce the relative appeal of the dollar. Trump Tariff Threat: A Dark Cloud Over Emerging Markets? The potential for new tariffs under a possible Trump administration is a significant concern for global trade, and especially for emerging markets in Asia. Why does this prospect create such unease? Trade Wars and Economic Disruption: Tariffs can ignite trade wars, disrupting established trade flows and supply chains. This can negatively impact export-oriented economies in Asia that rely heavily on international trade. Currency Volatility: Tariff announcements and the ensuing trade tensions can trigger significant volatility in currency markets. Asian currencies could experience sharp fluctuations as investors react to the evolving trade landscape. Impact on Growth: Increased tariffs can lead to higher import costs, potentially dampening economic growth in both the tariff-imposing country and its trading partners. For Asian economies, heavily reliant on exports, this poses a direct threat to their growth prospects. Asia FX Performance: A Mixed Bag Across the Region While the general trend in Asia FX is upward, it’s important to note that performance varies across different countries and currencies. Let’s take a quick look at some examples: Currency Factors Influencing Movement Outlook Korean Won (KRW) Strong export data, tech sector performance, sensitivity to global trade Potentially further gains if global trade sentiment improves Singapore Dollar (SGD) Sound economic fundamentals, safe-haven appeal within Asia, monetary policy Expected to remain stable to slightly stronger Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) Commodity prices, domestic demand, central bank policy Vulnerable to global risk sentiment, but supported by domestic factors Indian Rupee (INR) Strong domestic growth, foreign investment inflows, oil prices Positive outlook, but susceptible to global oil price volatility This table provides a simplified overview. The actual movements of these and other Asian currencies are influenced by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. Navigating Currency Markets in Uncertain Times: Actionable Insights For those involved in cryptocurrency trading or investment, understanding currency markets is increasingly relevant. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed on Macroeconomic Events: Keep abreast of major economic announcements, policy decisions, and geopolitical developments, particularly those related to trade and tariffs. These events can significantly impact currency valuations and, indirectly, the crypto market. Monitor Dollar Strength: Pay attention to the US dollar index (DXY). A weakening dollar can sometimes create a more favorable environment for alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Diversify Your Portfolio: Just as diversification is crucial in crypto, it’s also a sound strategy in broader financial markets. Understanding FX movements can inform your diversification strategies across different asset classes. Consider Emerging Market Currencies: While emerging markets can be more volatile, they also offer potential for higher growth. Keep an eye on Asian currencies and economies, as they can present unique opportunities and risks. The Crypto Connection: Why FX Markets Matter for Digital Assets You might be wondering, how does all of this relate to cryptocurrencies? The connection is more profound than you might initially think. Here’s why: Global Liquidity and Risk Sentiment: FX markets are a massive indicator of global liquidity and risk appetite. When there’s uncertainty in traditional markets, it can spill over into the crypto space. Conversely, positive sentiment can boost both. Trading Pairs and Stablecoins: Many cryptocurrency trading pairs involve fiat currencies, particularly the US dollar. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies, are directly influenced by the stability and value of those currencies. Fluctuations in FX markets can impact the perceived value and stability of stablecoins. Economic Outlook and Investment Flows: The overall economic outlook, reflected in FX movements, can influence investment flows into and out of different asset classes, including crypto. A weaker dollar, for instance, might make dollar-denominated cryptocurrencies relatively more attractive to investors in other regions. Conclusion: Cautious Optimism Amidst Lingering Uncertainty The current scenario in Asia FX markets reflects a delicate balance of cautious optimism and underlying uncertainty. While Asian currencies are showing signs of strength against a slightly softer dollar, the shadow of potential Trump tariff decisions continues to loom. For those navigating the world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these dynamics in traditional financial markets is increasingly crucial. By staying informed, monitoring key indicators like dollar strength, and recognizing the interconnectedness of global finance, you can make more informed decisions in both the crypto and broader investment landscapes. The subtle movements in Asia’s currency markets are a reminder that in the world of finance, change is the only constant, and vigilance is key.

Crypto industry executives and analysts were quick to react but not all were in favor of altcoins being included. Why The Shitcoins? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said he was “excited to learn more” and is still forming an opinion on asset allocation. “Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest and clear story as successor to gold. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap-weighted index of crypto assets to keep it unbiased. But probably option #1 is easiest.” Excited to learn more.

If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto… https://t.co/jv8Gcn8N2S — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 3, 2025 Real Vision founder and CEO Raoul Pal agreed , stating that “It is possible that they just use an index of US-based crypto by market cap plus BTC and ETH to be neutral and let the market decide.” Bitcoin maximalist Samson Mow said it was a sad day for America because Trump mentioned altcoins. “Bitcoin might be up, but it’s a sad day for America if they actually shitcoin at a nation-state level. I can’t really say I’m surprised though, with Trump having launched a meme coin.” Meanwhile, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes was unimpressed, claiming there was nothing new here and it was “just words.” “Let me know when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that, they have no money to buy Bitcoin and shitcoins,” he added. Trader and analyst “DonAlt” opined that “the risk that Trump f**ks this up and it gets shot down is quite present.” He added that the inclusion of “shitcoins in his proposed strategic reserve opens up the possibility for the altcoins he mentioned to gain at least 3 to 4 times,” but they could tank 25% if it fails. I think the risk that Trump fucks this up and it gets shot down is quite present But him including shitcoins in his proposed strategic reserve opens up the possibility for the alts he mentioned to at least 3-4x If it fails, down 25%+ immediately if it goes through 3-4x Gud odds — DonAlt (@CryptoDonAlt) March 2, 2025 Bitcoin Dominance Dumps Those altcoins mentioned have already skyrocketed by double digits over the past few hours, and this has resulted in a decline in Bitcoin dominance. BTC dominance fell to just over 60% on Sunday following the massive market pump that primarily benefitted XRP, SOL, and ADA . It has now fallen from a 4-year high of over 64% earlier this month, according to Tradingview. Either way, Trump’s crypto reserve would still be dependent on Congressional voting, so it is a long way from reality.

This includes prominent digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Sacks took to social media platform X to share this news, emphasizing his commitment to ethical conduct and transparency as he steps into his influential role within the administration. But what does this decision really mean for the future of crypto regulation and the perception of digital assets in the halls of power? Let’s dive into the details. Why Did the White House Crypto Czar Sell His Crypto Holdings? The primary reason behind David Sacks’s decision to sell his crypto holdings is to preemptively address any potential conflicts of interest. When individuals transition from the private sector, especially one as dynamic and often scrutinized as the cryptocurrency industry, to public service, they are expected to uphold the highest standards of impartiality. Holding significant investments in sectors directly related to their governmental responsibilities can raise eyebrows and fuel concerns about biased decision-making. Sacks, by selling his crypto holdings , is making a clear statement about his dedication to unbiased public service. This action can be viewed as a proactive measure to build trust and demonstrate his commitment to serving the public interest without any perceived or real financial influence from his past crypto investments. What Does This Mean for the White House and Cryptocurrency? The appointment of a White House crypto czar itself signals a growing recognition within the US government of the importance of cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. President Biden’s administration is increasingly engaging with these technological frontiers, understanding their potential impact on the economy, national security, and society at large. David Sacks, in this role, is expected to be a key figure in shaping the administration’s policies and strategies concerning both AI and cryptocurrency. His decision to sell his crypto holdings sets a precedent for ethical conduct within this emerging regulatory space. It suggests that the White House is serious about approaching cryptocurrency regulation with integrity and without undue influence from individuals’ personal financial interests in the digital asset market. Who is David Sacks, the New Crypto Czar? While the title “ White House crypto czar ” is widely used, David Sacks’s official designation is related to both AI and crypto, reflecting the interconnectedness of these technologies in the modern world. Sacks is not new to the world of technology and policy. His background likely encompasses experience in technology, business, or potentially even government advisory roles. While the specific details of his expertise in crypto are still emerging in the public discourse, his appointment indicates the administration is seeking individuals with a nuanced understanding of the tech landscape. His decision to divest from crypto holdings is a significant early indicator of his approach to the role – prioritizing ethical considerations and public trust. Further information about his specific background and qualifications will likely become more readily available as he settles into his position. Understanding the Nuances of Crypto Holdings and Conflict of Interest The concept of crypto holdings is broad and encompasses a wide range of digital assets, from established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to newer altcoins and tokens. For a government official, holding these assets can present unique conflict of interest challenges. Consider these points: Market Sensitivity: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility and sensitivity to regulatory news. A White House official involved in crypto policy could inadvertently (or intentionally) influence market movements through their actions or statements. Policy Influence: Personal crypto holdings could create the perception that policy decisions are being made to benefit the official’s portfolio rather than the broader public interest. Transparency Concerns: Even if no actual conflict exists, the mere appearance of a conflict can erode public trust. Transparency, like divesting assets, is crucial in maintaining confidence. David Sacks’s preemptive sale of his crypto holdings directly addresses these potential concerns, demonstrating a commitment to transparency and ethical governance in the burgeoning field of cryptocurrency regulation. Is Selling Crypto Holdings Enough for Ethical Governance? While selling crypto holdings is a significant step towards ethical governance, it’s part of a broader picture. True ethical conduct involves ongoing transparency, adherence to conflict of interest rules, and a commitment to making decisions based on public interest, not personal gain. Here are some additional factors to consider: Aspect Importance for Ethical Governance Disclosure: Beyond divestment, full disclosure of past and present financial interests, including any remaining connections to the crypto industry, is vital. Recusal: In situations where a potential conflict of interest might still arise, even after divestment, recusal from specific decisions or discussions is a necessary ethical practice. Ethical Guidelines: Clear ethical guidelines and oversight mechanisms within the White House are essential to ensure accountability and prevent conflicts of interest across all policy areas, including crypto. Public Scrutiny: A free press and active public discourse play a crucial role in holding officials accountable and ensuring ethical conduct in public service. David Sacks’s action is a commendable start, signaling a seriousness about ethical considerations in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrency regulation. It sets a positive tone for his tenure as White House crypto czar and underscores the importance of integrity as governments worldwide grapple with the challenges and opportunities presented by digital assets. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Trust in Crypto Regulation David Sacks’s decision to sell his cryptocurrency portfolio before assuming his role as White House crypto czar is more than just a personal financial move; it’s a powerful statement about the importance of ethical conduct and transparency in the realm of cryptocurrency regulation. In an industry often perceived as opaque and sometimes even associated with illicit activities, this act of divestment offers a beacon of integrity. It demonstrates a commitment to unbiased policymaking and aims to build public trust in the government’s approach to digital assets. As the world watches how the US navigates the complexities of crypto regulation, actions like these are crucial in fostering confidence and ensuring that the future of cryptocurrency is shaped by thoughtful, ethical, and publicly-minded leadership.

Recently, whispers circulated about a significant BERA unlock event within the Berachain ecosystem, specifically a hefty 10 million token release. This sparked concerns among community members and investors alike. But fear not, crypto enthusiasts! Berachain’s Asia-Pacific (APAC) representative has stepped in to set the record straight, quashing these rumors and bringing much-needed clarity to the situation. What’s the Buzz Around Berachain BERA Unlock Rumors? The rumor mill started churning with claims of a massive 10 million BERA unlock scheduled for this week. For those unfamiliar, BERA is the native token of Berachain, a Layer 1 blockchain known for its innovative Proof-of-Liquidity consensus mechanism. A large, sudden unlock can sometimes trigger market volatility, leading to understandable apprehension within the community. These rumors, often amplified on social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), can quickly escalate, creating uncertainty and potentially impacting investor sentiment. To put it into perspective, 10 million BERA tokens represent a substantial amount, and the crypto community is always vigilant about token unlocks due to their potential market influence. However, in this case, it appears the rumors were unfounded, or at least, misconstrued. Let’s delve into how Berachain addressed this. APAC Rep Steps In: How Did Berachain Debunk the Rumors? Enter Nezha (@leslienomad), Berachain’s APAC representative. Recognizing the growing unease within the community, Nezha took to X to directly address the circulating rumors. In a decisive move, Nezha clearly stated that the claims of a 10 million BERA unlock were simply not true. This proactive communication is crucial in the crypto space, where transparency and direct engagement with the community can make all the difference in managing narratives and maintaining trust. Nezha’s swift response highlights Berachain’s commitment to open communication and its understanding of the importance of dispelling misinformation quickly. By directly engaging with the community on social media, Berachain effectively cut through the noise and provided a credible source of truth, directly from their APAC representative. Boyco and BERA Distribution: What’s the Real Deal? So, if it’s not a random 10 million BERA unlock , what’s actually happening? Nezha clarified that there is indeed a token distribution planned, but it’s tied to a specific purpose and a much smaller scale than the rumored 10 million. The tokens in question, accounting for 2% of the total BERA supply, are earmarked for distribution to depositors in Boyco. What exactly is Boyco? Boyco is Berachain’s liquidity acquisition marketplace. Think of it as a platform designed to bootstrap liquidity for the Berachain ecosystem. By rewarding depositors with BERA tokens, Boyco incentivizes users to contribute to the platform’s liquidity, which is vital for the smooth functioning and growth of any decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This strategic distribution is a far cry from a general 10 million token dump; instead, it’s a calculated move to strengthen the Berachain network. Let’s break down the key takeaways about this BERA distribution: Purpose-Driven: The token distribution is specifically for rewarding users participating in Boyco, Berachain’s liquidity marketplace. Limited Scope: The amount is 2% of the total BERA supply, significantly less than the rumored 10 million tokens. Strategic Initiative: This distribution is part of a broader strategy to enhance liquidity within the Berachain ecosystem, benefiting all users in the long run. Community Benefit: It rewards early participants and contributors to the Boyco platform, fostering a healthy and engaged community. Why is Berachain and Token Distribution Transparency Important in Cryptocurrency? Transparency is paramount in the cryptocurrency world. Projects that are open and honest about their operations, especially tokenomics and distribution, build stronger trust with their communities. Rumors and misinformation can easily erode this trust, leading to market instability and hindering project growth. Berachain’s quick and clear response to the BERA unlock rumors demonstrates their understanding of this critical aspect. Here’s why transparency in token distribution is crucial: Builds Trust: Open communication fosters trust within the community and among investors. Reduces Uncertainty: Clarity on token unlocks and distributions minimizes speculation and fear. Prevents Market Manipulation: Transparency can help deter market manipulation attempts based on false information. Encourages Healthy Growth: A well-informed community is more likely to support the project’s long-term vision and contribute positively to its growth. Berachain in Focus: What Does This Mean for the Future of Berachain? Berachain’s proactive approach in addressing the BERA unlock rumors is a positive sign. It indicates a project that values its community and is committed to maintaining open communication channels. Nezha’s role as the APAC representative in clarifying this situation also highlights Berachain’s global outreach and localized community engagement efforts. By swiftly debunking the misinformation and providing accurate details about the token distribution for Boyco, Berachain has reinforced its commitment to transparency and community engagement. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of verifying information in the crypto space and relying on official sources for accurate news. For Berachain, this episode strengthens its position as a project that prioritizes its community and operates with integrity. In conclusion, the rumors of a 10 million BERA unlock were indeed just rumors, effectively debunked by Berachain’s APAC representative. The actual token distribution is a planned event, much smaller in scale, and strategically designed to incentivize liquidity provision on Boyco. This episode underscores the importance of clear communication and transparency in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, qualities that Berachain seems to be actively cultivating.

Interestingly, the sell-off and the recent upswing were both triggered by the U.S. President, Donald Trump. With the imposition of tariffs, the crypto markets plunged, with the BTC price marking fresh bottoms below $79,000, while with the announcement of a crypto strategic reserve, the price surged back above $95,000. With a momental shift from being bearish to somewhat bullish, the market participants now see some hope ahead of the first quarterly close. President Trump announced the set-up of a crypto strategic reserve with Bitcoin, Cardano, XRP, & Solana, which is believed to start a global FOMO soon. As rightly stated by Senator Lummis, the crypto war could begin. China is reportedly holding a secret, closed-door meeting discussing the same. However, this move appears to be more to bolster the economy of the U.S., which is now carrying a national debt of over $36.2 trillion. The announcement seems to have followed an analysis that the crypto is a magnet for investors. As per some reports, more than $300 billion has flown into the markets following the announcement. Moreover, the claim of making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world is expected to attract the crypto investors who could invest $5 million to get U.S. citizenship as the craze for the memcoin launched by the President himself validated the growing crypto adoption across the globe. What’s Next with the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally? The Bitcoin price witnessed a magnificent jump during the past weekend as it surged above $95,000 from the local bottoms. The present price action did close the CME gap between $80,670 and $$78,000 to a large extent but, in turn, has created a major gap instead. The start of the monthly trade was with a bullish rebound, which was followed by a 12% jump. Unfortunately, this 12% has formed a huge gap on the CME, and hence, the price is now expected to correct to fill the gap. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price faced a pullback and is entering the CME gap range between $85,720 and $91,630. The price is known to have filled the nearest gaps in previous times, as it did in July- August 2024. Even if the price drops to fill the gap, the crypto will remain within the bullish range between the 50-day & 200-day MA, which are acting as strong resistance and support levels. Hence, breaking either of the levels may validate the direction of the next price action. The Bitcoin price started the February trade on a bearish note and maintained a strong descending trend throughout the month. Hence, the price is now believed to fill the gap and rebound to reach $100K as the monthly start has been extremely bullish. However, the uncertainty over the crypto markets continues to prevail as the sentiments remain fearful.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 07:44:17

Benefits of Tokenizing Music Rights: A Win-Win for Artists and Fans? The buzz around tokenized music rights is growing, but what are the tangible benefits? Is it truly a win-win scenario for both artists and their devoted fans? Let’s break down the advantages: For Artists: Direct Fan Engagement and Community Building: Tokenization allows artists to build stronger communities by offering fans a stake in their work. This fosters loyalty and creates a sense of shared ownership and success. New Funding and Revenue Models: Artists can raise funds directly by selling tokens representing partial rights, bypassing traditional intermediaries and potentially securing better financial terms. Greater Control Over Their Music: Tokenization can empower artists to regain more control over their music rights and distribution, reducing reliance on traditional labels and publishers. Transparency in Royalty Distribution: Blockchain-based systems ensure transparent and efficient royalty distribution, reducing disputes and ensuring fairer compensation. For Fans: Directly Support Favorite Artists: Fans can directly invest in and support their favorite artists by purchasing tokens, fostering a more direct and impactful relationship. Potential for Financial Returns: As rights holders, fans can potentially benefit financially from the success of the music they own a part of, aligning their interests with the artist’s success. Exclusive Access and Experiences: Token holders could gain access to exclusive content, events, and experiences, deepening their engagement with the artist and their music. Participate in the Music Ecosystem: Tokenization empowers fans to become active participants in the music ecosystem, rather than just passive consumers. While the benefits of tokenizing music rights are compelling, it’s important to also consider the challenges and complexities involved. Challenges and Considerations in Music Rights Tokenization: Navigating the Road Ahead Like any emerging technology, music rights tokenization faces certain challenges and considerations that need to be addressed for widespread adoption. What are these hurdles, and how can the industry navigate them effectively? Key challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets and tokenization is still evolving globally.

The move, outlined in an executive order, signals the government’s intent to accumulate digital assets, reinforcing the US’s position in the global crypto landscape. Trump’s announcement, made via Truth Social on March 2, emphasized his vision of making the US the “Crypto Capital of the World.” The executive order directs the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets to advance plans for a federally managed crypto reserve, which will include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). In response, Bitcoin surged 8% in 24 hours, surpassing $93,000, while Ethereum gained 11%. Among altcoins, Cardano saw the biggest jump, soaring 66%, followed by Solana at 20% and XRP at 28%. With a market capitalization of $163.9 billion, XRP overtook Tether (USDT) to become the third-largest cryptocurrency. The concept of a US crypto reserve marks a shift from Trump’s earlier proposal of merely holding Bitcoin. Instead, the plan suggests a proactive strategy of accumulating multiple digital assets. The announcement has sparked debate within the crypto community. Some argue that Bitcoin alone should be prioritized due to its security and decentralization, while others express concerns about government control over a crypto reserve, fearing potential impacts on the US dollar and regulatory shifts. The initiative has received backing from Republican senators, who view it as a step toward strengthening the US’s financial standing in an evolving digital economy while countering China’s dominance with the digital yuan. Despite the surge in market value, investor sentiment remains cautious. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, while improving by seven points since March 1, remains in the ‘Fear’ zone at 33. Market participants are assessing the long-term implications of federal involvement in cryptocurrency management. Investors now await further developments at an upcoming crypto summit, where officials are expected to provide more details on the reserve’s structure, regulatory considerations, and future policy direction.

In a significant move signaling the growing convergence of AI and Web3, Trusta Labs, a prominent decentralized identity infrastructure provider, has announced its rebranding to Trusta.AI . This isn’t just a name change; it’s a strategic pivot that underscores the company’s commitment to leveraging artificial intelligence to revolutionize digital identity within the decentralized space. Let’s dive into what this exciting transformation means for the future of crypto and beyond. Why the Rebrand to Trusta.AI and What’s the Buzz? The rebranding to Trusta.AI is more than just a cosmetic update; it’s a declaration of intent. Trusta Labs, now Trusta.AI, is doubling down on its vision of creating a robust and versatile AI Agent Identity Framework . This framework is designed to empower AI agents to participate seamlessly and securely within the decentralized ecosystem. But why is this important, and what does it actually mean? Think about the current landscape of AI and blockchain. While both technologies are transformative in their own right, their intersection is still in its nascent stages. Trusta.AI aims to bridge this gap by providing a crucial missing piece: identity for AI agents. In their announcement on X, Trusta.AI highlighted that this framework will enable AI agents to engage in a range of on-chain activities, opening up exciting new possibilities. Unpacking the AI Agent Identity Framework At the heart of Trusta.AI’s rebranding lies its groundbreaking AI Agent Identity Framework . But what exactly is an AI Agent Identity Framework, and why should you care? In simple terms, it’s a system that gives AI agents a verifiable and secure digital identity within a decentralized network. This identity allows these agents to interact with blockchain applications and services in a trusted and auditable manner. Imagine AI agents operating within the crypto space. Without a proper identity framework, these agents would lack a crucial element of trust and verification. Trusta.AI’s framework provides this essential layer, enabling AI agents to perform actions that require identity and reputation, much like human users do in the Web3 world. Key Components of the AI Agent Identity Framework: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Providing AI agents with unique and self-sovereign identities on the blockchain. Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Allowing AI agents to prove specific attributes or capabilities in a cryptographically secure way.

Secure Key Management: Ensuring the secure management of cryptographic keys associated with AI agent identities. Revolutionizing Crypto Airdrops with AI Agents One of the immediate applications highlighted by Trusta.AI is the involvement of AI agents in crypto airdrops . Airdrops are a common marketing strategy in the crypto world, where projects distribute free tokens to users to increase awareness and adoption. However, airdrops are often plagued by issues like bot participation and Sybil attacks, where individuals create multiple fake accounts to claim more tokens than they are entitled to. Trusta.AI’s framework offers a potential solution to these challenges. By providing AI agents with verifiable identities, airdrop organizers can implement more sophisticated distribution mechanisms. AI agents can be programmed to perform specific tasks or meet certain criteria to qualify for airdrops, ensuring fairer and more targeted distribution. Benefits of AI Agents in Crypto Airdrops: Reduced Bot Participation: Verifiable identities make it harder for bots to impersonate legitimate users. Targeted Distribution: Airdrops can be designed to reward agents based on specific on-chain behaviors or contributions. Increased Efficiency: AI agents can automate the airdrop claiming process for legitimate participants, streamlining the overall experience. Enhanced Security: Decentralized identities and verifiable credentials add a layer of security and transparency to airdrop campaigns. Transforming Crypto Lending with Trustworthy AI Agents Beyond airdrops, Trusta.AI’s framework is set to make waves in crypto lending . Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms rely heavily on trust and risk assessment. Currently, these platforms primarily assess risk based on collateralization and on-chain history of human users. However, as AI agents become more involved in financial activities, a robust identity and reputation system becomes crucial for their participation in lending protocols. With Trusta.AI’s decentralized identity solutions, AI agents can establish a credit history and reputation within the DeFi ecosystem. This opens the door for AI agents to both borrow and lend crypto assets, potentially revolutionizing how lending platforms operate and assess risk. Imagine AI-powered trading bots borrowing funds to execute complex strategies or AI-driven market makers providing liquidity to lending pools, all while operating with verifiable identities and reputations. Impact on Crypto Lending: New Lending Participants: AI agents can become active participants in lending markets, increasing liquidity and efficiency. Advanced Risk Assessment: AI-driven risk models can leverage agent identities and reputations for more accurate credit scoring. Automated Lending Processes: AI agents can automate various aspects of the lending process, from loan origination to repayment management. Increased Transparency and Trust: Decentralized identities enhance transparency and trust in AI agent participation within lending protocols. The Broader Implications of Decentralized Identity for AI While airdrops and lending are immediate use cases, the implications of Trusta.AI’s decentralized identity framework extend far beyond these applications. The ability to provide verifiable and secure identities to AI agents unlocks a plethora of possibilities across various industries. From supply chain management and IoT to decentralized governance and autonomous organizations, the potential is immense. Consider these broader implications: Autonomous AI Agents: Enabling the development of truly autonomous AI agents that can operate independently and securely in decentralized environments. Interoperability: Facilitating seamless interaction between AI agents and various blockchain networks and applications.

When pressed for evidence that El Salvador’s holdings are American in origin, Trump cited an expert report claiming that a handful of UTXOs within the fund can be traced back to Silk Road, whose recently pardoned founder, Ross Ulbricht, is a US citizen. Blockchain Battlelines Are Drawn The next phase of the ambitious annexation plan, codenamed Operation Anschluss, will see the US Department of Defense deploying cyber units to “secure Bitcoin’s magical borders,” before repatriating the coins. According to one senior official, a new federal agency, the Bureau of Blockchain Boundaries, will also be established to research potential claims to other digital assets. “Think of it as mapping uncharted digital territory,” the official said, “Only instead of discovering a new continent, we’re discovering, well, some very old Bitcoin transactions.” To reinforce its claim to El Salvador’s digital reserves, Trump’s team is now proposing to mint a series of commemorative “Made in America” physical Bitcoins. Each coin will bear an encrypted signature attesting to its “patriotic provenance.” Meanwhile, government officials in El Salvador appear taken aback by the sudden move by President Trump. “What next?” pondered a spokesman for President Bukele. “Annexing our memes?” Legal experts have been equally animated. “We’re witnessing a collision of 18th-century territorial doctrine with 21st-century blockchain technology,” noted a constitutional law professor from Georgetown. “In practical terms, it’s as if someone tried to apply maritime law to Wi-Fi signals.” The professor continued, “While blockchain’s immutable ledger might record every transaction with near-perfect fidelity, it doesn’t exactly come with a zip code. The argument that some coins are ‘American-made’ because of their digital breadcrumbs is both innovative and, frankly, a little absurd.” Digital Dystopia As the political and legal debates ramp up, industry insiders are speculating about the long-term implications of this trend. Some futurists envision a world where blockchain assets come with their own citizenship status – a kind of digital passport for UTXOs. “Imagine logging into your bank account and being asked for your crypto citizenship ID,” mused one tech analyst. “If Trump’s annexation of Bitcoin is a rehearsal, then the real spectacle might be when states start bidding for digital territory on the metaverse. It’s borderless, yet even more contentious.” “We’re sleepwalking into a dystopian future in which everyone’s avatar could be drafted to defend their virtual homeland,” they added. “I fear for the current generation. If Trump’s warmongering continues, we’re looking at a cyberspace massacre that’ll rival anything the 20th century produced.”",Crypto Parody,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-03 07:52:02

Initially, he supported the idea, countering Donald Trump’s proposal to include XRP as a reserve asset alongside other cryptocurrencies. However, in a surprising reversal, Schiff has now renounced his BTC reserve endorsement. In his latest comments, Schiff accused Bitcoin promoters of fraudulent behavior, claiming they manipulated information to boost the BTC price. Peter Schiff Reverses His Approach To Bitcoin Reserve In a bizarre turn, Peter Schiff, a renowned economist and financial analyst, has renounced his support for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Schiff shared an X post today, addressing “Bitcoin pumpers” fraud and criticizing them for spreading misinformation to manipulate BTC price. Schiff’s reversal comes on the heels of reports suggesting he had backed a strategic Bitcoin reserve, particularly as an alternative to XRP. However, he has now dismissed these claims, emphasizing that he never supported a Bitcoin reserve. Instead, Schiff criticizes the reports, alleging that Bitcoin promoters manipulate information to boost the cryptocurrency’s value. He added, “This type of fraud is common in Bitcoin.” Did Peter Schiff Actually Support Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? In response to President Donald Trump’s decision to establish a US crypto reserve that includes Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, Peter Schiff shared his perspectives . While Schiff wrote on X that he understood “the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve,” he strongly opposed the idea of an XRP reserve. He posited, “But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” While the XRP community countered Peter Schiff’s comments by highlighting the cryptocurrency’s potential, Bitcoin enthusiasts assumed his remarks signaled support for a BTC reserve. The enthusiasts celebrated his words, “Bitcoin is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. So let’s create a Bitcoin reserve too.” However, via his latest post, he questioned the BTC supporters for misinterpreting his comments. Market Explodes Post Donald Trump’s Crypto Reserve Strategy “A US Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” stated Donald Trump via X post. Following Donald Trump’s announcement of the crypto reserves plan , the market explodes, with the total market cap reaching $3.03 trillion, up 6.47%. Bitcoin, which hovered around the $85k mark, skyrocketed to $94,810, possibly triggered by Trump’s move and Peter Schiff’s statement.

Elon Musk Reacts,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-to-join-trump-crypto-reserve-elon-musk-reacts/,"Yesterday, March 2, US President Donald Trump announced the establishment of a US “strategic crypto reserve” designed to bolster America’s position in the crypto sector. The reserve will initially include major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) – not Dogecoin (DOGE). In the wake of this announcement, the broader cryptocurrency market surged by over $300 billion in market capitalization, reflecting significant investor enthusiasm for Trump’s crypto endorsement. Does Dogecoin Have A Chance? Despite the wide-ranging support for digital assets, Dogecoin was conspicuously absent from Trump’s initial list of reserve currencies. Nonetheless, Dogecoin experienced a robust rally, spiking by as much as 16% at one point before settling at a 7.5% increase over the past 24 hours as of press time. Adding a touch of levity to the discussion, Shibetoshi Nakamoto (@BillyM2k), also known as Billy Markus and co-creator of Dogecoin, highlighted the domestic origins of the cryptocurrency. He jokingly tweeted: “I just wanna reiterate that dogecoin was created in the USA, in Portland Oregon. Source: me”. Related Reading: Dogecoin Cup And Handle Taking Shape – Big Move Incoming? The official Dogecoin account on X responded succinctly to the unfolding debate with a terse message: “@realDonaldTrump, bruh.” Within 15 minutes of these exchanges, Elon Musk, known for his influential presence in the crypto space, reacted with the “Face with Tears of Joy” emoji. It remains unclear whether Musk genuinely supports the idea behind DOGE being included in the crypto reserve or if he is simply amused by the meme aspect. 😂 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 2, 2025 Further commentary from the crypto community has added layers to the conversation. X user Antonio Zamudio remarked on the situation, drawing parallels with other industry figures like Ripple and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson who have lobbied for their projects’ inclusion in the crypto reserve. “I think Trump doesn’t know about the existence of Dogecoin, many Crypto CEOs have approached Trump, but although Elon is close to Trump, no one has really talked to Trump about the Dogecoin crypto, he only knows about DOGE the department of gov,” he stated and added “the irony is that we need a dogecoin representative to talk about dogecoin with Trump. Elon is there, but I don’t think he talked to Trump about crypto Dogecoin, because Elon only makes fun of Dogecoin. We need someone else close Trump talks about how good is Dogecoin. IMO” Related Reading: Long-Term Dogecoin Holders Are In “Denial” – On-Chain Metrics Expose Weakness In a related perspective, renowned crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) expressed more optimism on X: “With Elon being best buddies with Trump and them working hand over first to Make America Great Again I have no doubt in my mind that Dogecoin will be in the strategic reserve at some point. Also DOGE Payments likely coming soon on X.” Notably, Trump’s announcement on Truth Social hinted that additional “valuable cryptocurrencies” could eventually be incorporated into the reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, writing under his secondary X account, Kate The Alt (@kate_young_ju), questioned: “What are the ‘other valuable cryptocurrencies’ in the US crypto reserve?” What are the ‘other valuable cryptocurrencies’ in the U.S. crypto reserve? pic.twitter.com/nKSoop45eb — Kate The Alt (@kate_young_ju) March 2, 2025 Trump’s own words in the announcement were unambiguous regarding the core components: “Obviously, Bitcoin and Ethereum, as other valuable cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum.” From a technical analysis standpoint, the market reaction to the news appears to have altered Dogecoin’s chart dynamics. Prior to the announcement, DOGE had fallen out of a descending trend channel on the daily chart. However, following the revelation of the crypto reserve, Dogecoin rebounded into the channel and is currently testing the lower trend line—a critical support level. A daily close above this line will be essential to confirm the bullish momentum. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.219.

Still, traders express caution until plans are more concrete. “The current upward momentum might see a correction in the short term, as investors price in the crypto reserve announcement and determine the legal viability for Trump to create the reserve,” Kevin Guo, director of HashKey Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message Monday. “Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that the US central bank is not allowed to hold a reserve of Bitcoin, so there are still technical hurdles in front of Trump's plans.” “The President's crypto summit may follow up with more details or other possible announcements that can further the crypto market's recovery from recent lows,” Guo added. Trump is scheduled to hold the first Crypto Summit at the White House on Mar.7, where he is expected to share further plans on how crypto regulations and businesses will be supported in the country. Trump announced on Truth Social late Sunday that XRP, SOL and ADA would be included in a U.S. strategic crypto reserve. He later added Bitcoin and Ethereum to the list of assets composing the reserve, and has been discussing the idea of a strategic crypto reserve since his 2024 presidential campaign. That sent markets higher almost instantly, with bitcoin up 6.5% to over $93,000 on Monday and the broader market tracked by the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) up 7%. Elsewhere, tokens Chainlink’s LINK, Uniswap’s UNI and Movement’s MOVE are up 8% in the past 24 hours — mainly on their closeness to the Trump-family backed World Liberty Financial. Still, some said there’s more work ahead before the current rally can be considered sustained. “We expect more volatility until further details can solidify the creation of the strategy reserve, but the crypto market sentiment has swiftly changed, signaling a potential continuation of the bull market,” Chris Yu, CEO of SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Yu anticipates investors will keep an eye on inflows to U.S.-traded ETF products after they registered record outflows last week, where an increase could give cues on signs of a bottom and the possible continuation of the bull market.",Markets|ADA|SOL|XRP|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,FIAT|ADA|TRADING|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-03 08:01:16

Citing data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve, Henrik Zeberg tells his 175,200 followers on the social media platform X that the US GDP is projected to contract by 1.5% in Q1 of 2025. According to Zeberg, the contraction may force Fed Chair Jerome Powell to abruptly pivot and start printing US dollars to shore up the economy. “But…. the economy is strong, right Powell…? The economy is not strong – it is setting up for the worst recession and bear market since 1929. But first blow-off top as liquidity now will come flushing in.” Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Looking at Bitcoin, Zeberg says that its recent collapse to $78,000 is a necessary move to wipe out excessive leverage, making the BTC uptrend more sustainable. “Fear has been dominating in crypto-land. BTC declined fast to ~$78,000 – just surpassing the daily 200 simple moving average a bit. This is a healthy test area in a larger BULL MARKET. In fact, with this updated knowledge of the structure of BTC, it seems like we could witness a strong reversal in BTC setting in soon.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $92,597, up nearly 9% on the day. Zeberg adds that stocks and altcoins will also witness blow-off top rallies. However, he warns that a recession is waiting in the wings. “Unpopular perspectives: 1. BTC is about to soar. 2. Nasdaq and S&P500 will rally strongly. 3. Amazing Altseason about to set in. Above constitutes the blow-off top.

She explained that pilot testing has been successful, with 1,700 people, 15 banks, and 30 companies participating. However, she concedes that more consultation must occur with banks to find the best economic model to fit with customers before a rollout can occur. The Bank of Russia started this project because banks showed a keen interest in smart contracts, providing an apparent reason to make smart contracts a central component of the Central Bank Digital Currency project. Nabiullina announced the delay to the Association of Russian Banks (ASROS) and updated the attendees on the positive results achieved thus far with the pilot test. “Therefore, our intention”, said Nabiullina, “is to move to the mass introduction of the digital ruble a little later than originally planned, namely after we work out all the details in the pilot and consult with banks on the economic model, which is most attractive to their customers – for business, for people”. The digital ruble was designed to be a fully functioning Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), operating alongside cash and digital payments, providing reliable services without the need for interest or lending rates. The Banking Association estimated that a bank’s adoption of the digital currency would cost $1.1 million. The central bank will provide extra support for smaller banks, including free technical support. “For those components that are mandatory”, wrote Deputy Governor of the Bank of Russia, Zulfiya Kakhrumanova, “from the point of view of information security, we provide these solutions to banks free of charge. This software module for embedding is created and transferred to organizations, and in three different forms, so that banks can choose the most optimal one for their landscape”. “We provide free cryptographic information protection tools for subordinate certification centers deployed by banks, and this is also a significant cost aspect for banks”. The digital ruble further allows Russia to make international payments, relying less on Western infrastructure. It provides an alternative to the SWIFT payment system, allowing Russia and other countries to continue operating businesses regardless of Western sanctions. Given Russia’s high priority for SWIFT alternatives and BRICS business, one can only wonder why the digital ruble has been postponed. The proliferation of CBDCs would allow for bypassing the SWIFT international standard, displacing the dollar as an accepted medium of exchange. Currently, SWIFT is used to sanction entire states, having very little competition. The economic alliance of Brazil , Russia , India , China , and South Africa (BRICS), including Egypt, Iran, Indonesia, and Ethiopia, with additional right partner countries, has sought more reliable forms of payment that do not overly rely on American-dominated standards. BRICS has created a BRICS Pay Consortium, using QR codes to organise payments. The system is referred to as a decentralized automated organization (DAO). Although the system is not explicitly a blockchain, the consortium has been upfront about its intentions to explore blockchain solutions. Olga Goncharova, a financial consultant, claims that a digital central bank is not appropriate because digital currencies are programmable and have security concerns. She further says consumers may not prefer a digital currency, limiting its ability to roll out across Russia. Goncharova concedes that smart contracts could speed up loan processing and limit government spending, but she argues that these processes could be completed with traditional means.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bank Of Russia|Cryptocurrency News|Russia,EN,0,0,FIAT|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-03 08:09:35

This event includes key industry figures, like founders, CEOs, and investors, along with government officials. As excitement builds, investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy before the summit to gain maximum profits. Here are the top 5 altcoins to keep an eye on before the big event. Ethereum (ETH): Aiming for a Major Breakout? Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin, one of the prominent figures in the crypto industry, is expected to attend the upcoming crypto summit, possibly as a speaker. After the recent surge in the crypto market, Ether’s price has recently recovered from a drop of $2200, pushing the price past the key resistance level of $2,500 before settling at $2,377 . If this upward trend continues, ETH could soon test the $3,000 resistance level, making it a strong pick before the summit. Ripple (XRP): Strategic Choice for Investors Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is expected to be at the summit, which could bring fresh attention to XRP. Garlinghouse has previously met with President Donald Trump and has even proposed adding XRP to the U.S. strategic reserves. Recently, XRP surged 17.5% in a day, bouncing from $2 to its current price of $2.66. If momentum holds, XRP could break through resistance at $2.95 and $3.40, offering solid potential for gains. Solana (SOL): Reflecting Strong Growth U.S. President Trump’s announcement of adding select cryptos, including Solana, to the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserves has pushed SOL higher. As of now, Solana is trading at $160, marking a 13% gain in 24 hours despite concerns about an upcoming $1.8 billion SOL unlock. If Solana keeps its momentum, the next major resistance is at $200, making it one of the top cryptos to watch before the summit. Cardano (ADA): Bullish Signs Ahead? Cardano price has seen significant movement following its possible inclusion in the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserves. Apart from that founder Charles Hoskinson might also be attending the summit. Meanwhile, Cardano ADA has seen a jump of 50%, rising from $0.64 to $1.14. If its uptrend continues, ADA could reach the Fibonacci resistance level of $2, making it a solid pick ahead of the event. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin with Big Potential Dogecoin, the most popular meme coin, has been on the rise, now trading at $0.22 after an 8% jump. The recent SEC ruling that meme coins are collectibles, not securities, has boosted confidence in DOGE. If Dogecoin holds above the key resistance zone of $0.26 to $0.29, analysts predict a breakout toward $4, making it a high-risk, high-reward option.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|ADA,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 08:12:01

Many traders note that the network’s speed and capacity have been the major catalysts behind its recovery. The community continues to work on new projects, which may help boost the network when market conditions improve. SOL is predicted to rise slowly and steadily and might go up by about 9.77% to $161.74 by March 30. XRP: A key player in global transfers On February 26, Ripple, the parent company behind XRP , announced that DekaBank has picked Ripple Custody as the platform for its digital asset trading and custody services. Some market experts predict that with developments like this, XRP can hold its ground despite the current dip. The token has solid use in bridging traditional finance and crypto, and many banks still rely on it for cross-border transactions. Analysts point out that XRP’s stable performance, when backed by real financial use, keeps it relevant. XRP is predicted to rise by 31.59% and reach $ 2.83 by May 29. Remittix: An altcoin with real-world solutions Remittix is turning heads with its fresh approach to solving problems in global payments. Remittix aims to cut out extra steps that slow down traditional transfers. It offers a system called PayFi that lets users send crypto directly to bank accounts without much hassle. Think of a person with no bank account; they can get crypto in a wallet, send it to a money transfer service and then pick up cash to spend on daily needs. This is a real solution for many who face delays and high fees with regular banking. The project has sold over 508 million tokens during its ongoing ICO, showing that early backers believe in its mission. Its current DeFi coin price sits around $0.0694. Remittix not only cuts transaction costs but also takes a careful approach to risk. It stops reversals by locking transactions in the system so funds reach the recipient with little chance of being inadvertently sent back. Remittix is built on strong security and decentralization. The team has conducted several contract tests to check its safety. They also locked liquidity pools and team tokens for three years, which builds trust among investors. Remittix shoots for the moon While Solana and XRP have strong roots and clear uses in digital finance, many investors now look to Remittix for its practical solutions. It not only cuts down on costs and speeds up international transfers but also helps people keep control over their own money with true cryptography. Its low DeFi coin price and solid early returns make it a promising pick. With a clear plan to fix everyday payment issues, Remittix could change how money moves worldwide. Investors who seek both long-term growth and real-world value may find Remittix to be a game changer in modern finance. To learn more about Remittix, visit the website and socials .

According to local media , police in the northeastern Indian state of Assam have cracked down on the RSN Crypto scam, an elaborate scheme that deceived investors with misleading profit guarantees and a bogus online platform. While active, the operators allegedly duped over 2,000 victims and managed to amass between inr 10-20 crore ($1.14-2.29 million). Scammers advertised the RSN crypto token as a promising investment that would offer a 2% daily return. However, the investigation revealed that the investments accrued were quickly converted into Tether-issued stablecoin USDT using crypto exchanges like Binance. The Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) was brought in to track the operation. Investigators found that the website was hosted on an Amazon server and had alleged ties to entities in China. Police have arrested three suspects who admitted to manipulating crypto values and coercing victims into investing. Another key suspect, believed to be the head of the operation, remained at large when writing.

In another major case, the Enforcement Directorate charged 299 Chinese entities last year for operating the HPZ Token fraud, a crypto mining scam. Illicit crypto activity in India has surged alongside the country’s growing appetite for digital assets. With crypto trading volumes jumping to nearly $2 billion in late 2024, many small-city investors are reportedly turning to crypto in search of new income streams.

Before this, DigiFT was already approved to operate a trading platform for security tokens and offer financial services. Now, with this new license, it can also offer custody services for capital market products. This means that DifiFT can now handle everything in one place—that is, issuing, trading, and storing of blockchain-based security tokens—without relying on outside partners. “Obtaining the custodial license under our CMS framework is a key step in DigiFT’s mission to build a robust and fully compliant digital asset ecosystem. By integrating custody services into our existing regulated framework, we are enhancing both security and efficiency for issuers and investors while paving the way for broader institutional adoption of tokenized assets, ” said Henry Zhang, Founder & CEO at DigiFT.

Ronaldinho’s past crypto controversies Back in June 2024, Ronaldinho had hinted at a possible return to the crypto space. He posted that he believed it was time for crypto to “go mainstream” and asked his followers to join him. This declaration was met with skepticism from crypto sleuth ZachXBT . At the time, Zach brought up the former football star’s past involvement in controversial crypto project which resulted in multiple pump-and-dump schemes. In the past, Ronaldinho had promoted various crypto projects such as World Cup Inu, Atari Chain, Lord Society NFT and well-known meme coins WATER and Baby Doge. Fellow football legend Lionel Messi also joined Ronaldinho in promoting WATER. In September 2023, Ronaldinho’s name was embroiled in scandal after he was accused of being linked to a crypto project called “18kRonaldinho,” which allegedly involved a $61 million pyramid scheme. The athlete immediately denied those accusations, firmly asserting that his likeness was used without his permission to promote the coins. The project falsely advertised daily returns of 2% on crypto investments, using the football star’s name and image to bolster credibility.

Today, ABC Labs , the team behind Reserve , launches their Reserve Index Protocol, which offers a first-of-its-kind, build-your-own ETF-like experience to crypto. The Index Protocol’s Decentralized Token Folios (DTFs) bring everyday investors and institutions the one-click, easy-to-use experience they’ve become accustomed to since the S&P 500 ETF revolutionized the investing world in 1992. Starting today, 12 index-based DTFs are available, including the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, CoinDesk DeFi Select Index, and MarketVector Token Terminal Fundamental Index by Re7 Labs; the Virtuals Index by Virtuals Protocol; the RWA Index and Large Cap DeFi Index by MEV Capital; and the Alpha Base Index by Altcoinist.com; and more. With over 50,000 new tokens launching daily, DTFs simplify the process of investing in crypto by bundling tokens into broad, diversified crypto indexes or emerging thematic narratives that empower investors to tap into sectors like DeFi, real-world assets (RWA), AI, and memes without the guesswork. Anyone can create a new DTF, and anyone can mint or redeem its tokens 24/7 in a single click. “Our mission is to fight inflation and expand access to better financial products, and we firmly believe that crypto will be an integral part of the future financial landscape.” says Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs. “We built the Reserve Index Protocol to become a ‘decentralized BlackRock,’ which we believe will open up the floodgates of creativity. Plus, by partnering with some of the premier index creators in the world, people can now easily get one-click exposure to this growing industry alongside trusted brand names.” “The integration of the MarketVector’s indexes into Reserve’s DTF platform through our partnership with Re7 Labs is an exciting moment for institutional-grade crypto indexing. By combining MarketVector’s proven methodology with Reserve’s trusted, permissionless infrastructure, we’re making regulated, professional-grade indexes more accessible while maintaining the transparency that institutional and retail investors demand,” says Martin Leinweber, Director of Digital Asset Research & Strategy at MarketVector Indexes. Like an ETF, each DTF unit is redeemable 1:1 for its underlying basket of assets. However, redemption happens via a smart contract, so anyone—not just authorized participants & market makers—can redeem. The underlying tokens remain in this contract, eliminating the need for a centralized custodian. Because DTFs operate on smart contracts, they can be governed by a decentralized body instead of a centralized investment company. The Reserve Index Protocol also adds a powerful new incentive mechanism where creators are given more control over how fees from native tokens launched on the Reserve Index Protocol are divided up. This incentive approach allows DTF creators to form teams, raise capital, offer liquidity incentives, and so on. “While ETFs revolutionized thematic investing, DTFs are completely redefining it. We’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible with onchain indexes, unlocking potential that was previously unimaginable. With Reserve’s Index Protocol, this is just the beginning,” says Connor Milner, Partnerships at Re7 Labs.

41093893,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136078,1740993398,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Seeking Clarity: Polygon Co-founder Questions the Definition of a US Crypto Company,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-company-regulation/,"The crypto world is buzzing after Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal raised a crucial question that’s been lingering in the minds of many: what exactly defines a U.S. crypto company? In a recent post on X, Nailwal highlighted that Polygon Labs operates significantly within the U.S., with key leadership roles – CEO, CLO, COO, and CPO – all filled by Americans based in the country. This prompted him to ask, “What’s the criteria really to be a US crypto company?” His query shines a spotlight on the often murky and evolving landscape of US crypto regulation and what it truly means for businesses operating in this space. Let’s dive deeper into this fascinating debate and explore the nuances of defining a crypto company US . Decoding US Crypto Regulation: What’s the Definition? Nailwal’s question hits at the heart of a significant challenge within the cryptocurrency industry – regulatory ambiguity, especially in the United States. While the U.S. has been a hub for crypto innovation, the regulatory framework surrounding digital assets remains a patchwork of different interpretations and enforcement approaches. This lack of crypto regulation clarity can create confusion and uncertainty for businesses trying to navigate the legal landscape. So, what are some of the factors that might contribute to defining a “US crypto company”? It’s not as straightforward as it seems and likely involves a combination of elements: Location of Incorporation: Is the company legally incorporated within the United States? This is a fundamental aspect of legal jurisdiction. Principal Place of Business: Where is the company’s main operational headquarters located? If key decisions and business activities occur in the U.S., it strengthens the connection. Executive Leadership Location: As Nailwal pointed out, the location of key executives plays a role. Having top management based in the U.S. suggests a significant operational presence. Customer Base: Does the company primarily serve U.S. customers? A large U.S. customer base can bring a company under greater scrutiny from U.S. regulators. Technology Infrastructure: Where are the servers and technological infrastructure located? While less definitive, it can be a factor. Compliance with US Laws: Is the company actively complying with U.S. regulations, such as securities laws, money transmission laws, and KYC/AML requirements? It’s important to note that no single factor is likely to be definitive. Instead, regulators and legal experts likely consider a holistic view, weighing these factors to determine the extent to which a crypto company falls under U.S. jurisdiction. This complexity is precisely what Nailwal’s question highlights. Polygon’s US Presence: A Case Study in Crypto Complexity Polygon, while globally recognized, has a substantial footprint within the United States. Sandeep Nailwal Polygon co-founded this leading scaling solution for Ethereum, and its operational arm, Polygon Labs, is deeply rooted in the U.S. Nailwal’s tweet wasn’t just a hypothetical question; it stemmed from the reality of Polygon’s operations. Consider these points about Polygon’s U.S. connection: US-Based Leadership: As mentioned, Polygon Labs’ CEO, CLO, COO, and CPO are all American and operate from within the United States. This signifies a strong commitment and operational base in the country. Active Engagement with US Market: Polygon has been actively engaging with the U.S. market, forging partnerships and building its ecosystem within the country. Navigating US Regulations: Polygon, like other crypto entities, must navigate the intricate web of US crypto regulation to ensure compliance and sustainable growth. Polygon’s situation exemplifies the broader challenge for many crypto companies operating globally. They often have a distributed workforce and user base, making geographical definitions and regulatory jurisdiction complex. Nailwal’s question is particularly relevant for projects like Polygon that have a significant U.S. presence but operate in a decentralized and globalized industry. Benefits of Clarity in Crypto Regulation for US Companies Why does defining a “ crypto company US ” and achieving crypto regulation clarity matter so much? Clear regulations bring numerous benefits, not just for companies but for the entire crypto ecosystem and the U.S. economy: Benefit Description Reduced Uncertainty: Clear rules of the road reduce legal ambiguity, allowing companies to operate with greater confidence and plan for the future. Attracting Investment: Regulatory clarity can attract more institutional and retail investment into the crypto space. Investors prefer markets with well-defined rules. Fostering Innovation: When companies understand the regulatory boundaries, they can innovate more freely within those parameters, leading to growth and development. Protecting Consumers: Clear regulations can establish consumer protection standards, safeguarding users from fraud and illicit activities within the crypto market. Promoting US Competitiveness: A clear and sensible regulatory framework can make the U.S. a more attractive destination for crypto businesses, fostering job creation and economic growth. The lack of crypto regulation clarity , conversely, can stifle innovation, drive businesses to seek more favorable jurisdictions, and create a less secure environment for consumers. Nailwal’s raising of this question is a timely reminder of the urgent need for clearer guidelines. Challenges in Defining a US Crypto Company Defining a “ crypto company US ” isn’t a simple task due to the inherent nature of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Several challenges contribute to this complexity: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralized, operating across borders and without central control. This clashes with traditional geographical-based regulatory frameworks. Global Operations: Many crypto companies operate globally, with teams and users distributed across multiple countries. Pinpointing a single national identity becomes difficult. Evolving Technology: The crypto space is rapidly evolving, with new technologies and business models emerging constantly. Regulations need to be adaptable to keep pace. Jurisdictional Overlap: Multiple U.S. regulatory agencies (SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, etc.) may have overlapping jurisdiction over crypto activities, leading to potential conflicts and confusion. Lack of Precedent: Crypto is a relatively new asset class, and there’s limited legal precedent to guide regulatory interpretations, especially compared to traditional finance. These challenges underscore why crypto regulation clarity requires careful consideration and collaboration between industry stakeholders, regulators, and policymakers. A one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective. Instead, a nuanced and adaptable framework is needed to foster innovation while mitigating risks. Seeking Regulatory Clarity: The Path Forward for US Crypto So, what’s the path forward to achieve greater crypto regulation clarity and better define a “ crypto company US “? Here are some potential steps: Congressional Action: Clear and comprehensive legislation from the U.S. Congress is crucial to establish a consistent regulatory framework for digital assets. Inter-Agency Coordination: Improved coordination and communication among U.S. regulatory agencies are needed to avoid conflicting interpretations and provide unified guidance. Industry Dialogue: Ongoing dialogue between regulators and the crypto industry is essential to ensure regulations are practical, effective, and don’t stifle innovation. Rulemaking and Guidance: Regulatory agencies should issue clear rules, guidelines, and FAQs to provide companies with concrete direction on compliance. International Cooperation: Given the global nature of crypto, international cooperation and harmonization of regulations can help create a more consistent and predictable global landscape. Sandeep Nailwal Polygon co-founder’s simple question has opened up a vital conversation. Achieving crypto regulation clarity in the U.S. is not just about defining companies; it’s about fostering a healthy, innovative, and responsible crypto ecosystem that benefits both businesses and consumers. The industry awaits clearer signals from Washington to unlock its full potential within the U.S. In conclusion, Nailwal’s query highlights the pressing need for well-defined regulations in the US crypto space. The ambiguity surrounding what constitutes a “US crypto company” creates uncertainty and hinders growth. Clarity is paramount – for attracting investment, fostering innovation, protecting consumers, and ensuring the US remains competitive in the global crypto landscape. The path forward requires collaboration, clear legislation, and a commitment to creating a regulatory environment that supports responsible innovation. The question is posed, and now the industry, regulators, and policymakers must work together to find the answers and build a more certain future for crypto in the United States.

With so many choices, investors can spread their money across different types of investments. One of its standout features that make RCO Finance one of the top altcoins to watch is the AI Robo Advisor, a smart tool that scans the market all day and night. It looks for profitable trades and helps users spot the best crypto to buy at any moment. Instead of guessing, traders get data-backed suggestions that can make a big difference. The AI Robo Advisor also creates personalized strategies based on what the user wants. It considers factors like risk level and market trends, then pulls data from reliable sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters. This way, investors don’t have to figure everything out on their own. By using real-time updates, traders can react quickly to market changes. Whether prices rise or fall, they have the insights needed to make smart moves. Watching DeFi coin prices becomes easier, and users can make decisions with more confidence. RCO Finance is also offering early access to its AI tools through a Beta Platform . This allows users to test everything before the full launch. Security is a major focus, with audits from SolidProof to protect investors. With thousands already interested, this platform is worth watching for anyone searching for the best crypto to buy. XRP Ripple’s XRP is in a tight spot, hanging near the $2.20 support level, a 14.40% decline from last week . A recent market drop shook the crypto world, leading to two opposite reactions. Small investors rushed to sell and avoid further losses, while whales took the chance to buy more. This pattern is common when prices swing wildly. Data shows that short-term holders, who kept XRP for only a few weeks or months, led the sell-off. Their panic selling flooded the market. Meanwhile, whales with deep pockets moved in, grabbing nearly $1 billion worth of XRP. Instead of fearing the drop, they saw an opportunity to build their holdings. Looking at the charts, XRP is stuck in a downward trend that started in January. Bears want to push the price down to $1.96, but some traders believe a rebound could be near because XRP has established itself as one of the top altcoins to watch. Hedera Hedera has a system that can handle thousands of transactions every second. Many people like it because sending money on the network costs very little. It also doesn’t use much power, which makes it different from some other blockchains. The HBAR token is at the center of Hedera’s system. People use it to pay for transactions. It also plays a role in voting on important changes to the platform. Some holders even stake it to earn rewards. Right now, HBAR is trading at $0.20 . Its price has traded along the same range since last week. It has gained attention from investors watching market trends. Today, HBAR is ranked 18th on Coinmarketcap. Its total market value stands at $8.3 billion. This makes it one of the top altcoins to watch in the crypto space. Some crypto whales have been showing interest in HBAR because they believe it is one of the top altcoins to watch. Many believe it could be one of the best crypto to buy, depending on market movements.

41094035,https://coinpedia.org/?p=426988,1740993646,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"XRP News Today: Shocking Theory Predicts XRP Price at $10,000 – Here’s How",https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-today-is-the-us-government-planning-a-massive-xrp-acquisition/,"The post XRP News Today: Shocking Theory Predicts XRP Price at $10,000 – Here’s How appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new theory, proposed by AI expert Vincent Van Code using ChatGPT, suggests that the US government could buy XRP at a fixed price of $10,000 per token using Treasury Bills. If true, this move could reset the entire financial system as we know it. But how exactly would this work? Could XRP really replace the US dollar? And why would the government make such a bold move? The idea may sound far-fetched, but history has shown that big financial shifts often start as radical theories. Let’s break it down. How Would the US Government Buy XRP? According to the theory, the US government could negotiate directly with Ripple to purchase XRP held in escrow at a fixed price of $10,000 per token. In return, they would issue Treasury Bills—government-backed IOUs—to Ripple. Ripple could then hold these T-Bills, use them as collateral, or sell them for liquidity. What Is XRP Escrow? Ripple has locked up billions of XRP in escrow accounts on the XRP Ledger to control its supply and release into the market. These escrowed funds are gradually unlocked over time, ensuring a controlled distribution of XRP. If the US were to buy XRP at this fixed price, it could set a new market standard. Other governments and financial institutions might have to follow, especially if major entities like the IMF, BIS, or Federal Reserve back the move. Why Would the US Do This? The theory suggests three key reasons: Prevent Market Manipulation – A fixed XRP price could protect the US from financial manipulation by countries like China. Maintain Financial Dominance – If global finance shifts away from the US dollar, the US could secure its position by controlling XRP. Build the Future of Digital Finance – XRP could become the backbone of a new financial system, enabling smart contracts and instant settlements worldwide. However, this would require support from institutions like the IMF and Federal Reserve. Nations that refuse to adopt XRP could face economic instability. What Would This Mean for XRP Holders? If XRP were suddenly priced at $10,000, current holders would become instant millionaires. However, governments could introduce regulations on private XRP ownership or force conversions into digital currencies. Meanwhile, banks and corporations would likely rush to acquire XRP before it becomes fully controlled. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.64, with a 329.2% increase over the past year. In just the last 24 hours, XRP surged by 16.3%, reflecting strong market interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP ETF Approval: Ripple’s Lawsuit with SEC May Lead to Settlement Before ETF Launch , A $10,000 XRP may sound far-fetched today, but so did Bitcoin at $100,000 not long ago. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Amid this backdrop, Solana and Dogecoin whales are maintaining a bullish outlook, not on traditional assets, but on an emerging XRP rival Remittix With 4x gains already fueling early portfolios, this altcoin is making waves. Here’s the latest breakdown. Solana Price Stance Amid Market Volatility And Shifting Trends Solana continues to anchor the altcoin market alongside Ethereum with an impressive $73 billion market cap. The Solana price gained 14% in the past 24 hours, reflecting investors’ switch from cautious trading. Recent on-chain activity shows strength, with $10.1 billion in February transactions. Solana supports 6.3 million daily users, cementing its DeFi dominance. Yet, a scandal tied to Argentina’s LIBRA token has clouded the Solana price outlook, pushing some whales elsewhere. Institutional moves add intrigue. Wintermute recently pulled $40 million in SOL from Binance, hinting at strategic repositioning. The Solana price may face a test near $145 resistance, with analysts eyeing a potential increase to $180 if it breaks through. Despite this, optimism persists among some. Bitwise predicts a $551 Solana price by year-end if adoption spikes. For now, whales maintain a bullish stance, diverting attention to emerging tokens like Remittix, which promises steadier gains. The Solana price may not breach $200 soon , per Coincodex analysts forecasts. While meme coin’s rally hinges on social buzz, a shaky foundation. Remittix, with its 4x gains, offers a surer footing, aligning with a trend toward utility-driven investments. Dogecoin’s Resilience and Whale Activity Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.20 as of today, with a $31 billion market cap. It’s up 9.5% in 24 hours , bucking a broader altcoin dip. The meme coin’s trading volume surpassed $2 billion in a day, signaling active interest. Yet, a death cross on Dogecoin’s chart spooks some traders. Analysts warn DOGE could slide to $0.15 if Bitcoin drops below $70,000. Social sentiment on platforms shows cautious hope. In November 2024, a whale moved 50 million DOGE off exchanges, hinting at accumulation. Dogecoin’s volatility ties to Bitcoin’s fate, now at $85,000 after a 12% weekly fall. This uncertainty nudges big players toward altcoins with utility. Remittix, with its payment focus, emerges as a portfolio springboard for these savvy investors. Remittix: The XRP Rival Is Catching Up to Top Altcoins Remittix , an Ethereum-based PayFi token, has captivated whales with its practical edge. Analysts forecast a 100x rally for Remittix post-launch. Its capped supply fuels scarcity, a draw for investors fleeing uncertain giants. While Solana and Dogecoin whales diversify, Remittix’s 500 million tokens sold signal strong demand. Security is a standout feature. Institutional-grade protections on Remittix wallet with audits from BlockSAFU shield users, unlike some hacked exchanges. Remittix’s focus on real-world payments like supporting unbanked regions sets it apart. Whales see it as a stable bet amid choppy markets. Businesses can tap Remittix’s Pay API for seamless crypto settlements. This bridges digital assets to fiat effortlessly, boosting adoption. As the Dogecoin and Solana price face headwinds, Remittix’s early success hints at a breakout star. Investor chatter on social platforms highlights Remittix’s rise. Its $13 million presale dwarfs many peers, signaling trust showing that Remittix’s payment innovation positions it as a portfolio booster for 2025. With 4x gains already, it’s the Defi coin whales trust to soar in 2025.

The chatter around PEPE Price Prediction, which used to be at almost every opportunity, is starting to quiet down as a new contender, with its panda-powered flair steps into the ring of top altcoins. Investors who once rode the frog-fueled hype are now turning their gaze elsewhere, drawn by whispers of a token with 100x potential that’s shaking up the game. It’s not just a passing trend; it feels like the dawn of something bigger. PEPE: A Frog’s Fight Against Fading Glory As of late March 2025, PEPE sits at a fragile $0.00000775 , reeling from a brutal 40% drop over the past one month. The current PEPE price is a far cry from its November 2024 peak of $0.00002828, with a $5 billion market cap wipeout leaving it at $3.25 billion today. Analysts from Crypto Daily aren’t mincing words – they see a crash looming within 30 days, blaming big holders cashing out and the once-electric buzz fizzling out. Sure, some optimists like analysts at Coincodex hold out hope for a bounce past $0.000023 if the market turns, but most agree PEPE’s lack of real utility is a heavy anchor. The ecosystem around PEPE has had its moments – brief flares of excitement lighting up social media feeds. Yet, that spark seems to be dimming. Without fresh upgrades or a jolt of promotional energy, the lofty forecasts tied to PEPE Price Prediction feel more like wishful thinking than a solid bet. Traders are starting to whisper about volatility as PEPE’s defining trait, not its strength. In a market craving substance over hype, this frog-themed veteran risks being left behind, pushing restless investors to hunt for tokens like SHIBI built to last long. Panshibi: The Panda Charging Toward a 100x Leap While PEPE’s star dims, Panshibi (SHIBI) is lighting up the horizon with a bold, panda-driven vision. This isn’t just another meme coin – it’s a movement. Now in Stage 4 of its presale, tokens are going for $0.005 and the project’s already pulled in over $1.2 million. Analysts peering beyond PEPE Price Prediction are throwing out jaw-dropping numbers for SHIBI: a listing at $0.026 could spark 20x to 50x gains, with wilder voices hinting at a 145,000% surge post-launch. Panshibi’s ecosystem isn’t built on empty promises. It’s got this clever Social-Fi setup, powered by AI, that pulls you in with quests and contests. A lot of experts are backing Panshibi for its cultural edge, bringing an addictive meme to Asia’s growing crypto scene. For investors, it’s less about chasing a quick pump and more about backing a token that’s currently the best crypto to buy in 2025. Why Panshibi’s Stealing the Spotlight The meme coin arena has reached a turning point and current PEPE Price Predictions offer more skepticism than bullish optimism. Frogs might’ve ruled the swamp for a while, but pandas are taking over with a roar. Panshibi’s presale success, staking infused ecosystem and sky-high potential are flipping the script on what a meme coin can be. As PEPE stumbles, caught in a cycle of hype and hard landings, Panshibi’s offering a lifeline – a chance at explosive growth rooted in something real. That’s why PEPE holders are jumping ship, diversifying into Panshibi to chase the kind of 100,000% dreams their frog once promised but can’t deliver anymore.

41094127,https://nulltx.com/?p=146198,1740993815,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP Price Forecast: $2.85 Predicted Upswing Could Entice Yet 15x Tipped Panshibi (SHIBI) Gains Take The Lead,https://nulltx.com/xrp-price-forecast-2-85-predicted-upswing-could-entice-yet-15x-tipped-panshibi-shibi-gains-take-the-lead/,"Experts are eyeing a potential climb to $2.85 for XRP, a forecast that’s turning heads among those who’ve long watched Ripple’s steady upward growth. But just as analysts’ XRP price predictions settle in, Panshibi (SHIBI) bursts onto the scene, dangling the promise of a 15x surge – or more – that’s got investors rethinking their next move. It’s a tale of two tokens fighting for a spot in analysts’ best crypto to buy in 2025: one rooted in resilience, the other racing toward revolution. Ripple: Fresh Winds and Market Moves In 2025 Ripple’s XRP is holding its ground at around $2.3 as of March 2nd 2025, with a market cap hovering near $130 billion, reflecting its heavyweight status. The past month has been a whirlwind – numbers show a 300% spike since Trump’s November 2024 win, fueled by hopes of a crypto-friendly administration. Now, the chatter’s hotter than ever: Grayscale’s XRP ETF filing hit the Federal Register on February 21, with an 81% approval odds for Ripple on Polymarket. This has led some analysts to speculate a Ripple-Elon Musk tie-up could push $147 billion into XRP, though that’s still unconfirmed chatter. This isn’t just noise – Ripple’s ecosystem is flexing some muscle. T he XRP Ledger’s pivot to institutional DeFi, promises a permissioned DEX and credit-based lending, cementing its appeal to big players. Analysts pegging Ripple (XRP) at $2.85 by June see these moves as a catalyst toward broader relevance. Still current XRP price predictions feel measured – solid, yes, but not the wild ride some crave in this unpredictable market. Panshibi: The Panda-Powered Breakout Star Panshibi (SHIBI) isn’t your average meme coin – it’s a panda-charged rocket that’s already raised $1.2 million in its presale, now at Stage 4 with tokens priced at $0.005. That’s right, a low cost entry point for a token analysts say could hit $0.026 on listing, delivering a tidy 400% jump before the real magic starts. Whispers of 15x gains are conservative – some bold voices toss out 100x or even 145,000% potential, fueled by a presale that’s outpacing expectations. For investors hunting for the next best crypto to buy in 2025, Panshibi’s calling your name. What sets Panshibi apart? It is a viral meme with addictive potential and a unique utility. Imagine a Social-Fi ecosystem where AI hands out rewards for quests and community vibes, paired with staking that promises up to 1,200% APY – numbers that make your head spin. Security’s no afterthought either: a 10-year liquidity lock, a two-year team token freeze and a Coinsult audit give the ERC20 coin a rock-solid foundation. Twitter users are excited about SHIBI, praising its “cultural roots” and “next-gen vibe.” Unlike Ripple’s slow-and-steady climb, Panshibi’s built for speed – a rocket ship for investors tired of waiting around. With influencer hype and viral campaigns lighting the fuse, this panda’s primed to roar onto major exchanges and rewrite the meme coin rulebook. XRP’s Steady Glow Meets Panshibi’s Explosive Spark The crypto market is humming with anticipation of the next top altcoins that will usher in a bullish wave and there are also whispers of a Ripple (XRP) comeback this year. While the most recent XRP price predictions capture the interest of investors, Panshibi is stealing the shine from many other top altcoins today. With its presale numbers surging by every metric and a 15x upside dangling like low-hanging fruit, it’s no wonder investors are piling in. Analysts don’t want savvy investors missing out.

41094128,https://nulltx.com/?p=146200,1740993888,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Dogecoin Price Prediction: SHIBI & DOGE Are Best Choice Gainers For Next 2 Weeks Top Analysts Suggest,https://nulltx.com/dogecoin-price-prediction-shibi-doge-are-best-choice-gainers-for-next-2-weeks-top-analysts-suggest/,"The recent Dogecoin Price Prediction signals a turbulent short-term outlook, as market analysts identify key support levels and potential short targets. Despite bearish indicators, some traders remain optimistic about dog-themed assets, while others pivot to Panshibi (SHIBI) . It is a meme coin priced at $0.005 with over $1.2 million raised in its presale. Whether Dogecoin stabilizes or Panshibi captures newfound meme enthusiasm, both tokens could see action in the upcoming weeks. Dogecoin (DOGE) Short Targets and Market Sentiment Dogecoin is currently valued around $0.2262 but has lost 40% in the past month, hovering near $0.20 in recent sessions. Technical analysts foresee potential profit-taking levels at $0.179, $0.163 and $0.144, with a stop-loss near $0.217. Key indicators such as Fibonacci retracements and Ichimoku cloud data reinforce the bearish view, suggesting short positions might pay off if DOGE fails to maintain support. Although year-over-year gains still please long-term holders, short-term traders watch for a pivot around $0.20 to avoid deeper losses. Additionally, futures open interest for Dogecoin has plummeted 67% in three months, down from $4.07 billion to $1.33 billion. This decline signals waning confidence among leveraged traders. Coupled with subdued volume, it indicates weaker market sentiment for DOGE’s immediate recovery. Nonetheless, some optimists argue that once volatility normalizes, dog-themed assets could bounce back quickly. Traders remain divided on whether increased external uncertainty could push DOGE under $0.179 or if an unexpected catalyst might reignite a rally. Panshibi (SHIBI): A Meme Coin Alternative While Dogecoin flirts with further downside, Panshibi (SHIBI) has caught the attention of meme coin aficionados. Priced at $0.005, the project leverages a panda motif alongside AI-driven “social-fi” features, inviting users to stake and participate in quests. Locked liquidity for ten years and a two-year lock on team tokens aim to reduce the sudden dumps that often mar meme coin launches. An audit further adds trust – starkly contrasting meme coins that are reliant solely on hype. As older dog-themed tokens face market weariness, Panshibi’s structured approach might appeal to those seeking a fresh meme coin narrative. Some watchers foresee the token’s presale success translating into rapid post-launch growth if mainstream meme enthusiasm revives. $SHIBI stands out by blending playful branding with tangible safety measures. This formula could resonate with a market exhausted by fleeting mania. Conclusion Though the Dogecoin Price Prediction warns of downward targets, the meme coin sphere remains lively as new contenders vie for attention. DOGE still claims brand recognition, but it faces technical headwinds unless momentum shifts soon. Meanwhile, Panshibi (SHIBI) draws meme coin fans, exemplifying a novelty-based approach with locked liquidity and community-driven engagement. Traders eye both tokens for potential gains in the coming weeks, leaving them to gauge risk tolerance in a highly emotional market.

SHIB soared to astronomical heights in 2021 when it was the biggest gainer in one of the most memorable bull runs ever. But speculators looking to buy Shiba Inu now are already four years too late. Even if it continues to trade 83% below its all-time high, the window for gains it offers is no longer worth the outlay. Despite being established as one of the top meme coins by market cap, the smart money invests in new meme coins more likely to explode. Buyers like what's new and trendy. Not only in crypto but also in tech, fashion, culture, etc. The same can be said for potential blue-chip meme coins with a potential of 100x in no time. We’ve compiled a list of the top meme coins poised for a pump this March 2025. 5 best new meme coins to buy in March 2025 Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) iDEGEN (IDGN) Gigachad Popcat Pudgy Penguins Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Best meme ICO on the board There’s no question that Bitcoin is the king of crypto. No other blockchain is as established, well-regarded, and proven to be an entire industry's “gold” standard as Bitcoin is for crypto. However, Bitcoin is losing mindshare among newer generations of crypto speculators. But all that’s about to change with the arrival of Bitcoin Pepe —a game-changing meme and L2 scalability platform that combines the best of both worlds. If you’ve ever imagined what it’s like to have Solana's speed and cheap fees on top of the unmatched security of Bitcoin, say hello to Solana on Bitcoin. With its new PEP-20 token standard, Bitcoin Pepe is bringing the frenetic energy of the memes straight to the “granddaddy of them all.” The implications are massive. Can you imagine how crazy it would be when Bitcoin Pepe paves the way for meme coins, DeFi, and NFTs on the OG blockchain? That’s a powder keg of liquidity just waiting to go BOOM! Pick-and-shovel plays have always been where the smart money has gone, and Bitcoin Pepe is the ultimate pick-and-shovel play on the board in March 2025. The best part? Bitcoin Pepe is still in its presale phase at a price of just $0.0255—and if Solana’s trajectory is any indication, its native token BPEP could be in for a 1000x R.O.I. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website . iDEGEN: AI agent packed with potent meme virality Success in crypto depends on investing in the right narratives—AI and meme coins are chief among them. Those narratives are still present, but we have only had mini runs of them. AI agents had a crazy run in December and will dominate the crypto narrative once liquidity returns. Here’s the deal: crypto has no shortage of AI agents, but none have the balls like iDEGEN . This AI doesn’t just play by the rules—it breaks them. Built by the degen community, for the degen community, it’s loud, unfiltered, and untouchable. X bans it three times? Yet it bounces back stronger and pumps harder . Controversy creates cash and iDEGEN is proof of that after raising a staggering $25M during its presale. iDEGEN has since expanded to Telegram, RedNote, and get this—another parallel iteration of its wildly popular X agent running solely on disruptive AI model DeepSeek, sparking an East vs. West proxy war for AI supremacy that will keep it at the forefront of the crypto meta. You’re still unbelievably early to iDEGEN too—its native token, IDGN, launched on 27th February. If you’re betting on AI, iDEGEN could be your golden ticket. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. Gigachad: The real man’s meme coin Gigachad is a character everyone will be familiar with and is one of the most recognizable memes of all time. Unsurprisingly, its transition into the meme coin space has gained serious traction. Gigachad, also known by its native token GIGA, is proof positive that meme coins don’t have to follow the cute animal format that’s been all the rage throughout its existence. Gigachad’s alignment with masculinity in pop culture has seen it turn in legendary numbers. At its lowest, GIGA was priced as low as $0.00001244 last February 2024 to almost break $0.10 at its peak last January. Popcat: Banking on first-mover status in the cat coin sector As we have seen with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin, being the first on the scene can translate into eye-watering gains. That’s what Popcat brings to the meme coin sector as the first cat-themed meme coin to gain serious traction. Popcat was one of the best performers of Solana’s frenzied meme coin sector in 2024, rising to all-time highs of $2.05 at its ATH last November. And while Popcat has since fallen around the $0.25 mark, investors betting on a bounce can buy into this blue-chip cat coin at a discount. Pudgy Penguins: Iconic NFT collection cashes in on meme coin magic Pudgy Penguins may be cute, but the gains of its native token, PENGU, are no laughing matter. This is the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, a powerhouse in the Web3 space and among its most recognizable NFT projects. Launched just last December, and boom—$1 billion in trading volume on day one. By the end of the month, it was outpacing BONK by market cap and putting Pudgy Penguins NFTs front and center. Fast forward to January 2025, and PENGU’s already the second-largest meme coin on Solana. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Trump’s Crypto Plan Fuels Rally,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-xrp-is-going-up-today-trumps-crypto-plan-fuels-rally/,"The post Why XRP Is Going Up Today? Trump’s Crypto Plan Fuels Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP has surged 30% following a groundbreaking announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President regarding a “ US Crypto Reserve .” The inclusion of XRP in this proposed reserve has triggered a wave of investor confidence, driving up both price and market participation. Investors Flock to XRP Amid Growing Optimism After Trump’s push, XRP is seeing strong buying momentum as more investors jump in. XRP suffered a lot due to tariff policies and a lawsuit, but XRP made some positive moves in down market showcasing XRP community faith. Technically, the Price DAA Divergence (PDA) signals a clear upward sky, with a jump in active addresses showing rising investor interest. At the same time, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicates heavy inflows, meaning more money is pouring into XRP than leaving. This suggests that buyers are in control, pushing the price higher. With both retail and institutional demand growing, XRP seems set for more gains ahead. However, the MACD indicator is losing momentum, hinting at slowing bullish pressure, though the RSI remains above 50, keeping hopes alive for another push higher. If buyers regain control, a breakout past $3.00 could fuel another leg up, but failure to hold current levels might trigger a short-term correction. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News Today: Shocking Theory Predicts XRP Price at $10,000 – Here’s How , XRP Current Sentiment At $2.79, XRP is approaching a crucial resistance level at $2.95. If bulls maintain control and push beyond this barrier, the token could rally toward $3.00, setting its sights on the all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. A decisive breakout above this level could spark a fresh wave of interest, potentially driving XRP to new record highs. Having said that, with a short halt, XRP could retreat below $2.70 before attempting another push higher. Whether the current momentum sustains or a brief consolidation follows, XRP’s inclusion in Trump’s crypto reserve has undoubtedly given a new market hope, positioning the altcoin for further upside. Not Everyone is Happy with Trump’s Choice But many, including Coinbase CEO brian armstrong brian armstrong Brian Armstrong is one of the most well-known figures in the crypto industry today. He is an American investor, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CEO of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform. He is also a sought-after crypto expert and is often invited to speak at conferences all over the globe.Details:Organization: CoinbaseLocation: United StatesEducation: Master’s Degree in Computer Science from Rice University and Bachelor’s Degree in Computer science and economics from Rice UniversitySkills: Ruby and JavascriptExperience:CEO & Co-Founder of Coinbase from Jun 2012 to PresentTechnical Product Manager at Airbnb from May 2011 to Jun 2012CEO and Cofounder of UniversityTutor.com from Aug 2003 to May 2012FAQ's1.What is the net worth of Armstrong?Armstrong has a net worth of $2.4B Entrepreneur Investor Developer/Programmer Crypto and Blockchain Expert and Bitwise’s Jeff Park, argue that Bitcoin should be the sole reserve asset for clarity and legitimacy. Excited to learn more. Still forming an opinion on asset allocation, but my current thinking is: 1. Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold 2. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto… https://t.co/jv8Gcn8N2S — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 3, 2025 Others, like Fred Krueger, propose a market-weighted index. Critics, including Arthur Hayes, dismiss the plan as mere rhetoric, questioning its feasibility without congressional approval. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff, a longtime Bitcoin skeptic, likened BTC to gold but criticized XRP’s inclusion. The controversy highlights the broader debate over crypto’s role in national reserves. Though till now, all this is in words a concrete action on the field is what everyone is waiting for. Trump’s open support of XRP is giving a vibe that the year 2025 will create a new history for XRP. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, the market quickly recovered following President Trump’s announcement that he plans to establish a U.S. strategic crypto reserve, including Bitcoin and select altcoins like XRP, SOL, ADA, and ETH. This statement injected confidence back into the market, fueling Bitcoin’s rebound. Related Reading: Dogecoin Will Start A Move To $4 If Current Demand Holds – Can Bulls Step In? Despite this recovery, the road ahead remains uncertain as Bitcoin faces key technical levels that could define the next move. According to top analyst Axel Adler’s data on X, Bitcoin is currently trading at $92K, with support levels resting around the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $82,314 and the realized price for short-term holders in the 3-to-6-month range at $79,290. On the resistance side, Bitcoin must break through the realized price for short-term holders in the 1-week-to-1-month range at $97,478 and the 1-month-to-3-month range at $99,395. As Bitcoin continues to stabilize above $90K, analysts believe a breakout above $100K could trigger renewed bullish momentum, while failing to hold above key support levels could result in another wave of selling pressure. The next few days will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s next major move. Bitcoin Price Action Remains Uncertain Bitcoin is about to enter a critical phase as the market shifts from fear to excitement following President Trump’s announcement of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve. The announcement has ignited bullish sentiment across the market, with Bitcoin surging over 12% since the news broke. Just three days ago, Bitcoin was breaking down below key demand levels, and now, speculation is growing about the potential for a massive bull run. Market sentiment flipped from extremely bearish to bullish in a matter of hours, reinforcing the argument that Bitcoin remains in a strong uptrend. Analysts are watching key levels closely to determine if BTC can sustain this momentum. Adler’s insights on X reveal that Bitcoin is currently trading at $92K, with critical support resting around the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $82,314 and the realized price for short-term holders in the 3-to-6-month range at $79,290. On the resistance side, Bitcoin must break through the realized price for short-term holders in the 1-week-to-1-month range at $97,478 and the 1-month-to-3-month range at $99,395. Additionally, the short-term holder realized price at $91,096K could act as a local support level. While the price action has improved significantly, some analysts warn that BTC needs to hold above $90K to maintain bullish momentum. The futures market also remains stable, with no significant leverage buildup, reducing the chances of sudden liquidations. Investors are closely monitoring the $97K–$100K range, as breaking above it could trigger an explosive rally.

With renewed optimism and rising speculation, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s next move. Price Action Details: Holding Key Levels Bitcoin is trading at $91,800, holding above the key $90K mark after experiencing a sharp recovery from last week’s extreme selling pressure. The price struggled below this level for several days, dropping as low as $78K, fueling speculation that Bitcoin could be entering a bear market. However, bulls have regained some control, and Bitcoin has managed to stabilize above this crucial demand zone. This recovery has shifted market sentiment, with many analysts now considering the possibility of a renewed bullish phase. If BTC continues to hold above $90K and pushes toward $95K in the coming days, it could set the stage for an attempt to reclaim the psychological $100K level. Breaking above this milestone would likely confirm a full recovery and signal the continuation of Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend.

The bullish news has led to positive market sentiment, with traders now speculating about whether Ripple price can sustain the momentum or a bearish reversal will happen. As Trump’s endorsement fuels the rally, is the XRP price prediction for March 3 bullish or bearish? XRP price today trades at $2.58 after a staggering 15% gain in 24 hours. Ripple has once again flipped Tether (USDT) by market cap to become the third-largest crypto. XRP Price Prediction for March 3 – Reversal or More Upside? XRP price is likely poised for more upside today as traders continue to react to the bullish news of Ripple being included in the US crypto strategic reserve . The development saw the odds of an XRP national reserve increase by more than 20% Polymarket. Polymarket Moreover, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has confirmed his attendance at the White House Crypto Summit later this week. Due to this upcoming summit, XRP price will likely sustain its gains today, March 3, and possibly rally past $3 as traders frontrun the impact that it will have on the altcoin’s performance. The derivatives market also supports this bullish hypothesis. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, XRP had the third-highest amount of short liquidations after Bitcoin and Ethereum. Short liquidations reached $45M, which was the highest in six months. XRP Liquidations If these short liquidations continue throughout the day, the likelihood of XRP price gaining today and possibly reaching $3 remains high. Can Ripple Price Reach an ATH Today? XRP price is on a bullish trajectory according to analyst Carl Moon. In his analysis, he noted that Ripple had broken the upper resistance line of the descending triangle pattern. This breakout indicates that bears are no longer in control. If the XRP price sustains this trajectory, it could register an over 47% rise to the target price of $3.80. If buyers chasing profits from the recent rally continue adding to the buying pressure, XRP could hit this price today. At its current price, Ripple is only 30% shy of its record highs. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Key Levels to Watch XRP, like many US altcoins , has staged a strong comeback, surging from the $2.15 support level to flip the crucial $2.58 resistance, aligning with the 50% Fibonacci level. The rally has cooled after potential profit-taking by traders, but the RSI above 50 suggests that buyers still have the upper hand. One of the key levels to watch is the 50-day SMA of $2.72. XRP price needs to regain above this level for further upside. Another decisive close above the 50-day SMA could strengthen the bullish momentum, with $3.40 and $4.40 being the next major targets. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart As the first crypto summit draws near, traders should expect more upside from XRP price today and throughout the week. However, Bitcoin’s price action is crucial to sustaining a rally. If BTC price shows weakness, it may derail XRP’s price recovery.

While Shiba Inu has captured the spotlight as one of the top meme coins, I’ve found that relying solely on the hype can be risky. From my personal experience, Dawgz AI stands out as a smarter choice for long-term growth. Powered by Ethereum and advanced trading bots, Dawgz AI offers a strategic and stable investment option that doesn’t rely on trends or social media buzz. If you're looking to outpace traditional investments and earn consistent ROI, Dawgz AI might be the best bet for your crypto portfolio. Shiba Inu’s Explosive Growth and Its Role in the Crypto Market Shiba Inu’s rise from a meme to one of the top crypto coins is nothing short of remarkable. But what does the Shiba Inu price prediction hold for the future? Let’s dive into the Shiba Inu market and what factors are shaping its current price trajectory. The Early Days of Shiba Inu’s Price Surge Shiba Inu was created as a fun, community-driven cryptocurrency, often compared to Dogecoin due to its meme origins. Shiba Inu price movements were initially driven by social media buzz, with investors flocking to buy Shiba Inu in the hopes of striking gold. In the 2021 bull run, Shiba Inu’s price skyrocketed, reaching new heights that surprised even the most experienced traders. This rise was propelled by a combination of Shiba Inu’s rise in popularity, strong community support, and celebrity endorsements. The price of Shiba Inu hit its peak price during this time, and it became one of the largest meme coins in terms of market cap. Shiba Inu’s Price Forecast and Market Sentiment Today, Shiba Inu’s price is facing some fluctuations, driven by market sentiment and speculation. The Shiba Inu price forecast suggests some potential for further growth, but how much can it really go up? Investors need to look beyond the hype to determine whether Shiba Inu’s price can keep climbing. Many market analysts predict moderate growth in the future, but Shiba Inu price prediction remains uncertain. Shiba Inu’s price has been heavily influenced by social media buzz and Shiba Inu’s price action. However, this dependency on external factors makes it unpredictable. Even with a large community backing it, Shiba Inu must overcome significant hurdles to ensure long-term sustainability. The Emergence of New Competitors: Can They Outpace SHIB? While Shiba Inu has had its moment in the sun, it now faces fresh competition. One of the most promising new coins that could rival Shiba Inu’s rise is Pepe Coin. But there’s another investment opportunity worth exploring. Pepe Coin – A Rising Meme Coin Pepe Coin has quickly gained traction in the crypto market, drawing attention due to its connection to the popular meme culture. If Pepe Coin can maintain its growth trajectory and capture even more attention, it could challenge Shiba Inu’s market cap.

The Shiba Inu price in 2025 depends on several factors, including market sentiment, community growth, and adoption. While predictions suggest a potential ROI, it's crucial to factor in its volatile price action. Shiba Inu might see significant growth if the crypto market continues to expand, but a massive surge will likely require sustained interest. With Shiba Inu’s resistance to meme coin trends, it’s a risky bet for long-term gains. Will Shiba Inu coins reach 25 cents? Reaching 25 cents for Shiba Inu seems unlikely in the near future due to its massive supply and current price. The price needed to reach that level is simply too high given its market capitalization and meme coin status. However, it could see price action and moving average fluctuations based on market trends, but predicting such an explosive growth is uncertain. Will Shiba hit $1 in 2040? Hitting $1 for Shiba Inu by 2040 is highly improbable, considering its current price and token supply. While it could experience significant growth, achieving such a high value would require extraordinary demand, major decentralized exchange integrations, and a strong crypto market. The potential ROI for Shiba’s future is uncertain and depends heavily on market conditions. Will Shiba Inu coins reach $1? The chances of Shiba Inu reaching $1 are slim. With its massive supply and the resistance in its price action, the value required for such a surge would be immense. The crypto market would need to witness massive gains for Shiba to overcome its meme coin status and achieve that level, but it remains speculative.

Thanks to the integration, Memhash can reinforce its in-game economy, boost engagement, and simplify future token distribution and rewards. 👥 Airdrops in Action: Memhash & the TON Ecosystem @memhash_app is the first project to use TONAPI Airdrop to boost engagement and simplify token rewards. As Web3 adoption grows, TONAPI empowers projects to reach their community. 🔗 Learn more: https://t.co/WigaevEiI6 — Tonkeeper (@tonkeeper) February 28, 2025 The TONAPI Airdrop on Memhash Designed in-house by the Tonkeeper team, the TONAPI Airdrop is an independent airdrop platform supporting up to 10 million claims and helping projects issue and distribute Jettons, TON’s native token standard. Jettons allow for large-scale, non-custodial airdrops while removing the need for traditional minting processes, which ensures scalability and lower execution costs. As of now, over 80% of projects in the TON ecosystem leverage TONAPI, and the platform has an extensive list of external partners, including Bitget , CoinGeko, and Trustwallet ( TWT ). Nikolai, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Memhash, also commented on TONAPI’s automation features, stating: Adopting the Jetton Airdrop feature aligns with our vision for a seamless, user-driven in-game economy. Eliminating manual distribution hurdles will make it easier than ever for players to engage with Memhash and claim their token rewards. As such, the TONAPI Airdrop is particularly appealing to projects looking for minimal friction onboarding solutions that do not incur additional costs in addition to initial deployment fees. Web3 gaming on Memhash As an early TONAPI Airdrop adopter, Memhash is also pioneering Web3 gaming on TON. With TONAPI’s reward systems integrated into Memhash’s mining app, players can easily claim tokens and boost ecosystem engagement even if they are unfamiliar with the ins and outs of the technology behind the platform. This not only simplifies decentralized application (dApp) deployment but also allows projects to launch native tokens earlier.

Attorney Jeremy Hogan recently provided insight into the case’s delay, citing complications surrounding the court’s injunction against Ripple’s direct sales of XRP to customers. His comments came in response to legal analyst MetaLawMan, who theorized that Ripple might push for a better settlement deal with the SEC to vacate Judge Torres’s decision. These legal developments unfolded just as former President Donald Trump made a groundbreaking announcement, establishing a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve featuring Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. The revelation triggered a market rally, with XRP surging over 24%. Ripple Lawsuit: The Legal Hurdles and Possible Outcomes Attorney Jeremy Hogan outlined the complexities of resolving Ripple’s case, pointing to Judge Torres’s injunction as the primary hurdle. The delay in settling Ripple's case (as pointed out by James below), is likely the injunction in Judge Torres' judgment. The court enjoined Ripple from (basically) making sales directly to customers. There are workarounds for that, but obviously Ripple would rather not have the… https://t.co/pNAlIasEQM pic.twitter.com/WuN5micdtF — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) March 2, 2025 This injunction prohibits Ripple from directly selling XRP to customers, creating a significant challenge in negotiating a settlement. Hogan explained that while the SEC and Ripple might reach a mutual agreement, dissolving a court-issued injunction is not a straightforward process. He cited Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states that a court cannot simply overturn its judgment unless new legal circumstances emerge. The Federal Rules have Rule 60 which talks about getting ""relief from a judgment"" and that's where you start. As you can see from the Rule, it's not easy. Basically, you can't come back and ask the Court to change a judgment unless some ""thing"" has changed. Obviously, the… pic.twitter.com/vFOxFw6xwx — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) March 2, 2025 Ripple’s challenge is to persuade Judge Torres to lift the injunction despite her ruling being based on the longstanding Howey test rather than SEC regulatory policies. One potential path forward involves Ripple and the SEC petitioning the court to vacate the injunction. If Judge Torres finds the reasoning compelling, she could grant the request, allowing Ripple to resume direct XRP sales without legal restrictions. However, this approach requires careful legal maneuvering, as the judge makes the final decision. As Hogan claimed, Ripple only has one chance to file this motion, so it must be meticulously crafted and include SEC approval for the best chance of success. Legal analyst MetaLawMan speculated that Ripple might be pushing for a deal that removes the injunction and any “bad boy” provisions from Judge Torres’s ruling. I have a Theory about the SEC’s unexplained delay in dismissing the @Ripple case. It might not be the SEC. It could be that @Ripple is negotiating hard to get the SEC to agree to vacate some or all of Judge Torres’ decision. The Torres decision was unquestionably GREAT for… — MetaLawMan (@MetaLawMan) March 1, 2025 He suggested that the SEC would likely have agreed to a simple $125 million settlement and dismissal of the case, but Ripple appears to be holding out for more favorable terms. If Ripple succeeds, it could lead to future securities offerings or even an IPO, solidifying its standing in the financial sector. Trump’s Crypto Reserve Sparks Market Surge The legal battle surrounding Ripple coincided with former President Donald Trump’s decision to form a U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve , which will include Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. Trump’s announcement led to a sharp rally in the crypto market. Bitcoin jumped 8% to $93,007, while Ether surged 9.7% to $2,438. XRP, which was directly impacted by the news, skyrocketed 24.5% to $2.80. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (+18.7%), Cardano (+58.8%), and Dogecoin (+10.7%), also saw substantial gains. Despite the market optimism, Trump’s policy has sparked debate among financial experts. While some, including Eric Trump, hailed the initiative as a genius move that favors retail investors over traditional financial institutions, critics warned of potential volatility. I love the genius of announcing a strategic reserve on a Sunday, when traditional markets are closed and Wall Street sleeps. For the first time, retail investors win. Traditional finance better catch up, or it will quickly become extinct. The world no longer runs on a Mon-Friday,… pic.twitter.com/EPtbEisbdI — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) March 3, 2025 Some argue that diversifying the reserve across multiple cryptocurrencies, rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin, could introduce unnecessary risks, just like Brian Armstrong advised . Excited to learn more. Still forming an opinion on asset allocation, but my current thinking is: 1. Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold 2. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto… https://t.co/jv8Gcn8N2S — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 3, 2025 What Comes Next for Ripple and XRP? With Ripple negotiating a potential settlement and Trump’s pro-crypto policies bringing back optimism, the coming months will be crucial for XRP’s trajectory. If Ripple successfully lifts the injunction, it could restore investor confidence and open new business opportunities, possibly even positioning the company for an IPO. However, if the court maintains the restriction, Ripple’s ability to conduct direct sales will remain limited, affecting its long-term growth.

However, in the Financial Times article quoted by Hammond, an inside source claimed that the crypto czar and his investment firm Craft Ventures, have sold their direct crypto holdings not long after President Trump’s inauguration.

By letting go of his crypto holdings before stepping into his role as crypto czar, Sacks is declaring that he has no direct financial stake in crypto assets, therefore he has no bias towards any particular token.

However, it rejected a daily high with a slight bounce. Link’s market structure remains bearish on the micro-level as it follows a lower low and lower high movement on the daily chart. The ongoing impulsive phase looks strong but will likely end any time soon. Compared to last month, it is yet to see a major retracement move this month due to low volume inflow. Instead, the asset consolidated for days and resumed selling pressure at full speed. Breaking below $17 on Monday, it tested $15 and traded calmly around it for three days before dipping to a daily low of $13.45. This marked its lowest trading level in the last three months. But from the look of things, more drops are expected as it is yet to reach an oversold condition. The $11 level is considered the main target for the bears. Once selling reaches this level, we can expect an interception from the bulls’ side before recovering. A continuous push from there could lead to a trend shift. Currently, it trades at $14.6. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The closest support level right now is $12.8. Extending bearish towards the $11 level, we can anticipate a quick buyback. Failure to hold above this level could result in a dip to $10. Below this key support lies $9. If the daily low holds as support, a bounce above $15.4 could bring a retest at $17.1 A climb above the $19.8 resistance could activate a new bullish move to $22.3 and $27. Key Resistance Levels: $15.4, $17.1, $19.8 Key Support Levels: $12.8, $11, $10 Spot Price: $14.6 Trend: Bearish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that select cryptocurrencies, including XRP, were added to the new U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserves. Following this news, XRP, the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, surged 30% in a day, reaching a market cap of $150 billion.

Many believe adding XRP to the U.S. Crypto Reserve could attract more big investors and increase its price. Ripple Locks Back 700 Million XRP Despite unlocking 1 billion XRP, Ripple did not release all of it into the market. Instead, 700 million tokens were locked back into escrow. Here’s the breakdown: The first wallet that got 500 million XRP but hasn’t moved it yet. Before this, it sent 300 million to another wallet on March 1 and locked 200 million back. The second wallet that got 500 million XRP had already moved the same amount to another Ripple wallet, which locked it back in escrow. If Ripple follows its usual monthly locking pattern, it might lock another 100 million more, leaving only 200 million XRP in circulation. XRP Price Recored 30% Gain Following these events, XRP’s price saw a sharp rise, climbing 17% , as of now to reach $2.60. Over the past 24 hours, its overall gains have hit 30%, pushing its market cap to $150 billion.

With the crypto market buzzing with fresh opportunities, early investors are always on the lookout for the next moonshot. This week, two major meme coins have been making waves, but one name stands out from the rest: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With an unprecedented presale model and a jaw-dropping ROI potential, Arctic Pablo Coin is stealing the spotlight. Meanwhile, Pepe Coin and Neiro are also bringing in some exciting developments. This article will cover the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin, Pepe Coin, and Neiro. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Heats Up in Penguinopolis – Best New Meme Coins to Invest in for Short Term Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale is unlike anything the crypto space has seen before. The project’s location-based presale model is redefining how meme coins launch, and the current phase, Penguinopolis, is attracting serious attention. With the price currently at $0.000067, early investors are already looking at an estimated 11,844% ROI from this phase to the launch price of $0.008. Investors aren’t just buying into a meme coin; they’re diving into a high-reward ecosystem. Arctic Pablo Coin offers staking rewards with an APY of 66% during presale, lucrative referral incentives, and community competitions where holders can win rewards in APC tokens or USD. With over $1.69 million already raised, this presale is on fire, and once Arctic Pablo moves past Penguinopolis, the price will climb. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Token Burn Strategy – Best New Meme Coins to Invest in for Short Term Arctic Pablo Coin is doing more than just raising funds; it’s ensuring long-term value through an aggressive burn mechanism. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation, fueling scarcity. Plus, any remaining tokens post-presale will also be burned. This deflationary model is designed to drive up demand and limit supply, creating a strong foundation for price appreciation. Token burn transactions are all recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for full transparency, adding another layer of trust to the project. With a model like this, it’s no surprise why Arctic Pablo Coin is a top pick among the top new cryptos for short term. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale Surge in Penguinopolis – Best New Meme Coins to Invest in for Short Term After completing 11 locations, Arctic Pablo Coin has arrived in Penguinopolis, marking its 12th phase of the presale journey. Each phase brings a price increase, meaning right now is the last chance to secure APC at just $0.000067. Once Arctic Pablo moves on, the price will rise, and so will the potential gains. Investors who locked in their tokens at earlier phases are already seeing strong paper profits. But the real play? Getting in before the final presale stages and riding the wave to the launch price of $0.008. With such a unique presale structure and over $1.69 million already secured, the demand for APC is heating up. Miss this phase, and the next buy-in will cost you more! Pepe Coin’s Latest Update: Whale Movements Shake the Market Pepe Coin is back in the spotlight after a major whale accumulation was detected. A recent transaction saw a single entity scoop up millions of PEPE tokens, sparking speculation of an incoming price surge. Analysts believe this whale activity could be a precursor to a breakout, especially with meme coins gaining renewed interest. The community is watching closely, as a bullish push could send PEPE soaring in the coming days. Neiro’s Big Move: AI-Powered Trading Gains Momentum Neiro is making headlines as its AI-driven trading platform gains traction.

While this has caused lack of interest in the market, the price may explode massively when the volatility expands. From a local peak of $1.23 in December, ARB saw a lot of clampdowns and slipped to $0.345. This marked the assets lowest price level ever but has managed to recover well for a couple of days. It tried to resume bearishness this week but the $0.38 level provided support and the price climbed back to where it calmly traded for almost a week. These choppy price actions indicate an extreme volatility contraction on the daily chart. An expansion of the volatility could cause a serious havoc if the price continues to move in favour of the bears. It may revisit the monthly low or even break lower to a new low. As the volatility expands to the upside, ARB may recover some lost grounds and later resume bearishness. A continuous surge in the volatility could lead to a trend shift if the momentum gets stronger. So far, it has lost over 60% of its price from the local peak. A further collapse could cause more pain in the market as it loses momentum. Right now, there’s no sign of the bulls. ARB’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview There’s a pullback level at $0.427. Losing $0.384 could roll the price back to the monthly low with a potential breakdown. The key level to consider for such a break would be $0.345. An increase from the current trading level could signal a recovery to $0.516. If the price increases above this level, the next line of resistance to keep in mind is $0.613 and may be $0.75 in the future. Key Resistance Levels: $0.516, $0.613, $0.75 Key Support Levels: $0.427, $0.384, $0.345 Spot Price: $0.463 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

According to a March 3 X post , Cronos, the Layer 1 blockchain associated with crypto exchange Crypto.com, is considering a proposal to establish a Cronos Strategic Reserve wallet that will be made by reissuing the 70 billion CRO tokens that were burned in 2021. The burning event hailed as one of the largest in crypto history, reduced the supply from 100 billion to 30 billion CRO tokens to support decentralization efforts ahead of Cronos’ mainnet launch. Through the Cronos reserve, which will be subject to a new 5-year vesting period, the project will fund its roadmap, which includes plans to pursue a spot ETF launch by the end of 2025. While voting for the proposal will end on March 17, it has already garnered over 99.76% of votes favouring the move that would restore the total token supply to its original 100 billion CRO. You might also like: Crypto.com’s Cronos ETF and stablecoin launch on the horizon Cronos ( CRO ) rallied to an intraday high of $0.101 today, marking a 46% surge from its weekly low, while its market cap was seated at $2.5 billion as of press time. Its daily trading volume also skyrocketed 773% over the period to over $164 million. Another key reason for the hype around the token was Cronos’ announcement that the Cronos Strategic Reserve would support “America’s ambition to become the World Capital of Crypto.” The statement likely caught traders’ attention, especially as the overall crypto market was already surging, fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a strategic crypto reserve for the nation, which would include a basket of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. https://twitter.com/kris/status/1896359966442938599 However, the proposal has also sparked criticism from several community members on X, who believe the increased supply could lead to a price dilution. CRO price analysis Technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook for CRO in the short term. On the 1-day CRO/USDT price chart, CRO has broken up above the descending trendline that has been formed since Dec. 17 after it formed a head and shoulders pattern, leading to a bearish momentum. CRO price, 50-day and 200-day MA — March 3 | crypto.news Despite this, the 200-day moving average remains above the 50-day MA, signalling that recent price action has been weak and that bearish pressure is still strong, with buyers showing little interest. CRO Supertrend and RSI chart — March 3 | Source: crypto.news Meanwhile, the Supertrend Indicator is in the red, and the Relative Strength Index sits at a neutral 42, putting CRO in a tough position. These indicators suggest that momentum is not strong enough to reverse the prevailing bearish trend. At press time, CRO was exchanging hands at $0.084 per coin, while its social sentiment was positive per Santiment data. However, the price action could switch back to its bearish trend in the coming days if the current hype fades.

It has shown signs of strength for some days and now looks poised for a bullish move. After the early month recovery, WIF initiated drops this week and resumed bearish, but the $0.5 level provided support, and the price slowly increased. This has brought a slight recovery and the asset is now trading well above $0.7 on a daily scale. Technically, the meme coin’s selling phase appeared to have reached an exhaustion point as trading enters an extreme oversold condition on the daily chart. Buyers have been showing interest for some days, but their commitment is not yet strong. But adjusting to the 4-hour timeframe, it is stylishly forming a double bottom above the aforementioned support level. The slow-and-steady movement is reaching a breakpoint in the same timeframe. A weekly close above the $0.8 level could fuel a major increase. If the selling pressure resumes due to increasing supply, the price may plunge to a new low before picking up. Regardless, the trend is still in a downward range on the daily chart. While the trend is showing signs of a reversal, the bears are still in control. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Today, WIF is showing signs of strength following a small increase. The close resistance level for a test right now is $0.8. If the price increases, the higher price level to watch is $1.11, followed by $1.75. Holding the $0.58 and $0.5 levels as support for the past few days, a drop off could slide the price to $0.48 and potentially $0.334.

According to the Ohio District Attorney’s office, scammers used deceptive messages to build relationships with unsuspecting victims before convincing them to invest in fraudulent crypto schemes. The FBI has identified 33 victims so far, with five more yet to be identified. Total losses stand at $6 million, with some victims losing their entire life savings. The funds were traced through blockchain analysis after a complaint was filed with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center in June. A portion of the stolen funds had been converted to Tether (USDT) and transferred to three cryptocurrency addresses. Once investigators secured a federal seizure warrant, Tether froze the funds and moved them to a law enforcement-controlled wallet. The authorities have since filed a forfeiture complaint in an Ohio District Court, seeking approval to return the recovered assets to victims. How Scammers Exploited Victims’ Trust Court documents reveal that fraudsters contacted victims through text messages, dating apps, and networking platforms, pretending they had mistakenly messaged the wrong person. From there, they built trust and emotional connections through ongoing conversations, eventually steering victims toward a supposed investment opportunity. “The fraudster gained the victim’s trust using various manipulative tactics,” U.S. Attorneys Carol Skutnik and James Morford stated in their complaint. “Once trust was established, they shared fabricated success stories about cryptocurrency investments.” To appear legitimate, scammers guided victims through opening accounts on real crypto exchanges but directed them to deposit funds into fake investment platforms they controlled. These fraudulent platforms displayed fake profits, encouraging victims to invest more. In one case, an Ohio woman lost $663,000—her entire savings . When she was unable to send more money, the scammers threatened harm to her family and friends unless she made additional payments. Crypto Scam Cases Evolving with AI The rise of generative AI is making fraud more scalable and deceptive , according to a February Chainalysis report. Meanwhile, on-chain security firm Cyvers warns that “pig butchering” scams—where victims are manipulated over long periods—are among the biggest threats to crypto investors. So far in 2024, over 200,000 cases have been identified, with billions lost to scams. As crypto scams become more sophisticated, authorities are ramping up efforts to trace and recover stolen assets—offering a glimmer of hope to those who have fallen victim to digital fraud.

Yet, despite its exceptional fundamentals, TON’s DeFi ecosystem remains underdeveloped. This is a gap Elluminex aims to fill. As Elluminex, an all-in-one DeFi hub, prepares to launch on TON, many feel this could take Toncoin to even greater heights. TON’s Journey Like Solana before its DeFi boom, TON excels in scalability and user acquisition but lacks the liquidity and tools to retain them. To solve these problems, Elluminex brings several DeFi functionalities that can use TON’s untapped potential to replicate the success story of Solana. Elluminex is a platform designed to replicate the transformative impact of Uniswap (Ethereum) and Jupiter (Solana) by unifying trading, staking, and cross-chain interoperability. Elluminex Can Be a Catalyst for TON’s Success Elluminex isn’t just another DEX. Its integration with TON addresses three critical bottlenecks in the industry: Cross-Chain Liquidity Injection Elluminex’s bridge connects TON to Ethereum, Solana, and BSC, enabling projects to tap into external liquidity pools. For context, Solana’s price jumped 190% after Jupiter’s launch. If Elluminex attracts similar inflows, TON’s TVL and prices are also expected to skyrocket. Ton Coin On-Chain Data Reasons For the Optimism Around Elluminex Elluminex has a lot of features to offer that are developed to solve certain specific problems in the blockchain industry: Pre-Market for TON Tokens Elluminex’s OTC platform allows users to trade TON-based tokens before they hit centralized exchanges. This feature allows investors to gain early access to altcoins at low prices. For TON, pre-market access could incentivize projects to launch natively, driving demand for Toncoin as a base gas token. Credits: Elluminex Website AI-Powered Portfolio Tracker Elluminex’s AI portfolio tracker analyzes cross-chain trends, helping users optimize yields on TON-based assets. Such tools that use technology and data could reduce volatility risks and attract institutional interest. Toncoin Price Forecast: How Elluminex Matters Toncoin’s price has closely tracked TON’s ecosystem growth. Right now, trading at $3.77, TON can easily go up to $20 by the end of the year, with DeFi hubs like Elluminex gearing up to launch pretty soon. If the platform captures even 10% of Telegram’s user base, daily transactions could triple, which will further help in price growth. Can Elluminex Deliver? TON isn’t the only chain vying for DeFi dominance. Sui and Aptos have gained traction in 2025, while Solana continues to innovate with its growing ecosystem. However, TON’s unique advantages could tip the scales: Telegram Integration : Direct access to 950M users dwarfs rivals’ outreach capabilities. Moreover, Elluminex’s success could do wonders for TON. Elluminex has what it takes to be a long-term bet. Security audits, user education (via its DeFi Academy), and partnerships. Early traction and the execution of its roadmap will be critical. Conclusion Elluminex’s integration could completely redefine TON’s trajectory, much like Uniswap did for Ethereum. Solving liquidity problems and democratizing early-stage investments positions Elluminex as more than just another token on TON. It becomes an important part of a DeFi ecosystem ready to scale. For investors, the Elluminex presale can be a great option to choose right now. The project has its basics right, and a growing DeFi economy also ensures its long-term demand in the industry.

41095243,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=135928,1740995944,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,The Rise of Layer-3s: Creating Blockchain Apps of the Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/the-rise-of-layer-3s-creating-blockchain-apps-of-the-future/,"The scene of the blockchain is changing continuously. Layer-3 (L3) is a new layer developing as Layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum and Layer-2 (L2) scaling solutions like Lightning Network and rollups receive most of the focus. These are not only little changes; they also mark a basic change in our perspective on blockchain uses, opening opportunities once judged unworkable or unachievable. Examining their possibilities, difficulties, and future orientation, this paper explores the realm of L3s and how they can influence distributed apps going forward. Understanding the Layers One must first grasp L1 and L2 roles before delving into L3s. Foundational blockchains, L1s, handle security, consensus, and simple transaction processing. 1 1 They become slow and costly to use as network activity rises, though, and they frequently suffer with scalability problems. L2s handle transactions off-chain, then bundle them and present them to the L1 for ultimate settlement, therefore addressing these constraints. 2. This lowers costs and greatly increases transaction speed. L3s expand from this basis. Sitting on top of either L1 or L2, these application-specific layers offer tailored features and enable difficult use cases. Triple L1 is the highway system; L2 is the fast lanes; and L3 is the specialized delivery paths for particular items. Every layer contributes differently to the whole blockchain ecosystem. The Strength of Specialization L3s are distinguished primarily from others by their specificity. They let developers maximize for performance, privacy, or other important criteria since they are meant to meet the particular requirements of different applications. Four This focus creates a great spectrum of opportunities: Customized Information Storage Various uses call for varied data storage needs. Customized storage options let L3s maximize for data capacity, retrieval speed, or particular kinds of data. A supply chain L3 might stress safe and unchangeable record-keeping, whereas a gaming L3 might give quick data access for real-time games top priority. Improved Restricted Privacy Customized to the particular privacy requirements of the application, L3s can employ cutting-edge privacy technologies such as homomorphic encryption or zero-knowledge proofs. Applications managing sensitive data, such as finance or healthcare, depend especially on this. Communication and Interoperability Between several blockchains and even conventional systems, L3s can help to enable data flow and communication. Five Building linked distributed apps that can interact with one another effortlessly depends on this. Tokens and Microeconomies L3s let apps honour user involvement, govern internal transactions, and promote participation by means of their own token economies. This allows one to run dispersed communities, respect content creators, or create distributed markets. Blockchain-based platforms, for instance, can leverage L3s in the online casino sector to improve in-game awards, loyalty programs, and even enable casino bonuses in India by means of safe and verifiable smart contracts. Finding the appropriate platform is essential, though, since not all online casinos run honest or open specials. Finding dependable online casinos that really offer the best bonuses and a safe gaming experience may be achieved by players by reading trustworthy websites and reviewing several platforms. Idealized Systems of Operation L3s can offer personalized execution settings fit for the particular requirements of the application. This can include support for particular programming languages, virtual machines, or hardware acceleration, therefore enhancing performance and efficiency. L3 Use Case Illustrations L3s have several somewhat different possible uses. These are some illustrations: An L3 might offer the foundation for a distributed social media network , enabling users to manage their data, profit from their content, and engage in community governance. L3s can allow intricate, scalable blockchain games with in-game economies, original NFTs, and engaging gameplay experiences—all of which combine with each other. Six Decentralized Supply Chain Management: An L3 might offer a safe and open system for monitoring products all across the supply chain, therefore enhancing efficiency and lowering fraud. L3s can provide safe and privacy-preserving digital identification solutions, therefore empowering consumers to manage their personal data. Blockchain Applications: Looking Forward In the development of blockchain technology, L3s mark a notable advancement. Seventh, they are releasing a fresh wave of distributed apps that are more powerful, efficient, and user-friendly by allowing specialization and customizing. Although obstacles still exist, L3s have unquestionably the ability to revolutionize many sectors and open new opportunities.

Binance encourages EEA users to convert their non-compliant stablecoin holdings to USDC, EURI, or EUR before the deadline.

Binance advises users to take action early to avoid any disruptions to their trading activities. Türkiye is not expected to be affected by Binance’s recent stablecoin delistings, as it is not a member of the European Economic Area.

The token, named Ronaldinho Coin (Star10) price surged more than 80% following the official launch but also sparked discussions in the broader crypto market. Amid this, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has issued a stark warning for investors amid growing crypto scams and rug pull events. Ronaldinho Token Launch: Star10 Price Rockets Football icon Ronaldinho took to social media platform X to celebrate the token’s rapid success, stating that Star10 had reached the top position on DEX Screener. Encouraging fans to join the movement, he declared that “the ball is rolling” and invited them to invest. However, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has highlighted his post while issuing a cautionary statement for traders. Notably, the official contract address for the token was also shared in Ronaldinho’s post to ensure investors were buying the authentic Star10 on the BNB Chain. Notably, the football icon’s entry into the crypto space follows a growing trend of celebrities launching personal tokens. Meanwhile, investors rushed to buy Star10, causing its price to surge within hours of its release. During writing, Star10 price rocketed more than 80% to $0.37, with its market cap soaring past the $31 million mark. Ronaldinho Coin (Star10) Price Binance Founder Changpeng Zhao Issues Security Alert Despite the excitement, Binance’s founder Changpeng Zhao stepped in with a clear warning. He clarified that Binance and its affiliates had no commercial ties with Ronaldinho or Star10, emphasizing the risks involved in meme coin investments. Zhao stressed that Star10 was launched exclusively on the BNB Chain, cautioning investors against fake versions on other networks. He further noted that meme coins are highly volatile, and their trading volume has seen significant declines recently. “This post is NOT an endorsement,” Zhao stated . “Ronaldinho’s STAR10 coin was launched on BNB Chain exclusively. Other chains’ coins are fake. Beware of scammers.” His warning serves as a reminder of the risks associated with celebrity-backed tokens, which often experience price manipulation and rug pulls. Celebrity Tokens Fuel Meme Coin Buzz Ronaldinho is the latest in a growing list of public figures launching their own crypto assets. The trend gained momentum after Donald Trump’s team introduced TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins. Simultaneously, Argentina’s President also endorsed a meme coin , LIBRA, which has sparked massive controversy in the market. Among others, rapper Kanye West also reportedly launched $YZY, which quickly gained traction. While these tokens generate massive hype, many lack long-term utility, leaving investors vulnerable to extreme price swings. Considering these aspects, experts urge caution, highlighting the speculative nature of such assets. Binance Founder Warning: Here’s What Investors Should Know Despite Ronaldinho Coin’s (Star10) impressive debut, Changpeng Zhao’s warning highlights the risks involved. So, investors should conduct thorough research and avoid falling for scams posing as official tokens. As the Binance founder noted, the meme coin market remains unpredictable, with price surges often followed by sharp declines. As the hype around celebrity tokens grows, the crypto community must stay alert. In other words, the market participants should exercise due diligence and weigh the risks carefully before putting their bets on any newly issued tokens.

The U.S. government already holds around 200,000 BTC worth nearly $19 billion, mostly from seizures. If the U.S. starts accumulating more, it could aim to control 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply , pushing its value higher and positioning it as a hedge against financial uncertainty. But is the government building a Bitcoin stash, or is this just wishful thinking? Let’s break it down. What’s Happening? Over the weekend, Trump’s post hinted at steps toward creating a Bitcoin reserve. This caused a surge in speculation, with Polymarket bettors increasing the odds from 42% to 63% that such a reserve could be created within his first 100 days in office. Odds of a US $BTC reserve happening this year just skyrocketed to 63% on Polymarket. The sudden move up came after Trump stated his support for a crypto strategic reserve yesterday. Let's see if the hype is sustainable this time, or if it fizzles out in a few weeks again. pic.twitter.com/rRaDeYKzxm — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) March 3, 2025 However, for this to happen, the U.S. government must actively hold Bitcoin—not just confiscated assets—by April 30, 2025. Simply announcing plans isn’t enough for it to count as an official reserve. But for now, it’s all speculation, and nothing has been formally approved. Bitcoin Reserve or Just Holding Seized Assets? According to 10X Research analyst , a true Bitcoin reserve would mean the government is buying Bitcoin just like it stockpiles gold. However, Trump’s executive order in January only talks about “evaluating” the idea of a digital asset stockpile. That’s a passive approach—meaning the government is more likely to hold onto the $19.1 billion in seized crypto assets (97.9% of which is Bitcoin) rather than buying more. The analysts raise a key question on the US’s actual motive with seized $9Billion BTC: Is the U.S. committed to Bitcoin, or is it just keeping what it already has? Right now, there’s no clear push from Congress to actively purchase Bitcoin, so the idea of a strategic reserve remains just that—an idea. One crypto analyst, ChestyPuller’s Ghost, stated that the U.S. government won’t spend money to buy Bitcoin for a strategic reserve but will instead use the BTC it has already seized. According to them, the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) will likely include a mix of U.S.-based digital assets with real utility rather than just Bitcoin. They argue that the government won’t take on more debt for Bitcoin purchases, making it clear that the focus will be on assets it already controls. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Did ‘Crypto Czar’ David Sacks Sell All His Crypto Holdings? Here’s the Truth , What’s Next for the Seized Bitcoin? If the government keeps Bitcoin, it could signal a shift toward recognizing it as a legitimate asset, much like gold. But if it decides to sell, it could impact market prices and suggest that Bitcoin isn’t part of the country’s long-term financial strategy. For now, the fate of the seized Bitcoin remains uncertain. Whether the U.S. embraces Bitcoin or just sees it as confiscated property to be sold off is still up for debate. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ronaldinho @10Ronaldinho · Follow My new one and ONLY OFFICIAL token is HERE! It’s time to celebrate greatness, passion, and that legendary spirit that NEVER fades 😎Legends are not born… THEY ARE FORGED. And YOU can choose to be a part of it. Get your $STAR10 NOW. Let’s make history together!… 3:47 AM · Mar 3, 2025 627 Reply Copy link Read 485 replies The token promised exclusive benefits, such as signed memorabilia and access to an AI agent, attracting significant investor interest. Shortly after its release, STAR10 surged over 20%, reaching a peak of $0.29. The token’s market cap currently stands at nearly $20 million, with a fully diluted valuation of $23.5 million and a trading volume exceeding $26 million, according to CoinGecko . Source: CoinGecko The rapid price surge and trading activity have drawn scrutiny, with on-chain data revealing potential insider trading. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen identified an insider wallet linked to Ronaldinho that profited nearly $4.95 million from the token’s launch. The wallet reportedly acquired 20.79 million STAR10 tokens for 48 BNB (around $29,247) and has since sold a small portion, leaving a substantial holding worth $4.93 million. Insider trading concerns rise Blockchain investigators flagged unusual trading patterns in STAR10’s early market activity. According to Onchain Lens, the identified insider wallet sold 119,278 tokens for 54 BNB ($33,106) while retaining over 20.68 million tokens. The revelations have led to accusations of pre-planned profit-taking, raising concerns over transparency in celebrity-backed cryptocurrencies. The token’s association with a high-profile figure like Ronaldinho amplified initial investor enthusiasm, but the insider trading allegations have cast a shadow over its legitimacy. Crypto traders on X (formerly Twitter) reacted with scepticism, with some calling STAR10 a “celebrity cash grab” and questioning the long-term viability of such tokens. Ronaldinho’s crypto past Ronaldinho’s involvement in cryptocurrency has been marked by past controversies, with accusations of endorsing projects that later collapsed. In September 2023, he faced legal scrutiny over his alleged ties to 18kRonaldinho, a crypto investment scheme accused of defrauding investors of $61 million. The project falsely used Ronaldinho’s name and image to lure investors with promises of 2% daily returns, a claim he later denied involvement in. The football star has also promoted meme coins like WATER and Baby Doge, as well as NFT projects such as Lord Society and World Cup Inu, some of which suffered sharp declines following their initial hype. Crypto investigator ZachXBT had previously warned investors about Ronaldinho’s crypto ventures, suggesting a pattern of endorsement without accountability. STAR10’s uncertain future Despite its initial surge, STAR10’s credibility is now under intense scrutiny. The emergence of insider trading allegations has raised doubts about the token’s long-term stability. Investors remain wary, especially given the history of celebrity-backed tokens experiencing sharp price declines once hype subsides. While Ronaldinho has not publicly addressed the allegations, STAR10’s market performance will likely determine investor confidence. With increasing regulatory attention on celebrity-endorsed crypto projects, the token’s ability to maintain credibility will be key to its survival in an already volatile market.

Many altcoins charted even more impressive gains, especially those that were namedropped by President Trump. BTC Soars by $10K It was a tough week for the primary cryptocurrency as the asset plunged from $96,000 on Monday to $78,000 by Friday morning . This came amid Trump’s escalating trade war against a few countries, fears about rising inflation, and other possible reasons. After flushing out billions in over-leveraged positions, BTC finally started to rebound on Friday afternoon and jumped to $84,000. The weekend started calmly, and bitcoin remain still at around $84,000 to $86,000. That’s when the market took another turn, this time for the better after another interaction by US President Trump . This time, he confirmed that his administration will work on the promised US Crypto Reserve, which sent shockwaves through many altcoins, but more on that later, and BTC eventually. The largest cryptocurrency had retraced slightly to $85,000 but shot up by $10,000 to $95,000 within a few hours. It has lost some steam since then, but it’s still well above $92,000 as of now. Its market capitalization has surged to $1.840 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts stands tall above 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Biggest Alt Gainers The first trio of crypto assets that was mentioned by Trump was SOL, ADA , and XRP . Expectedly, their prices skyrocketed the most just minutes after his announcement went viral. Although many have retreated from their respective local tops yesterday, the price gains on a daily scale are evident and still impressive. ETH is up by almost 5% and sits above $2,350. DOGE is close to $0.22, while SOL, ADA, and XRP are still up by double digits. LINK and AVAX are the other top gainers from the larger-cap alts. In contrast, BNB and LTC are left behind with losses of 1% and 4%, respectively, perhaps because they were not mentioned by Trump. The total crypto market cap exploded by $300 billion since Sunday’s low after the announcement and is now well above $3.15 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

The crypto trading platform revealed that it will be delisting all non-MiCA-compliant stablecoin trading pairs in the EEA (European Economic Region) shortly. Binance To Delist Non-MiCA Compliant Stablecoin Trading Pairs In EEA According to an official Binance announcement on March 3 , the crypto exchange is implementing changes to non-MiCA-compliant stablecoin trading pairs in the EEA region. As per the announcement, trading pairs with USDT, FDUSD, TUSD, USDP, DAI, AEUR, UST, USTC, and PAXG will be delisted for EEA users on March 31 . However, MiCA-compliant stablecoins pairs, such as USDC, EURI, and fiat pairs (EUR ) will remain available. Simultaneously, the crypto exchange also urged EEA users to convert any remaining non-MiCA compliant stablecoin holdings (e.g., USDT) to USDC, EURI, or EUR. Why Is Binance Delisting Stablecoin Trading Pairs? Meanwhile, it’s also noteworthy that Binance rolled out its latest delisting announcement following recent stablecoin-related guidelines from EU authorities. As a result, the top crypto exchange is making changes to the availability of non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins in the EEA. What’s More? Starting March 31 at 23:59 UTC, the exchange will restrict the availability of Spot trading pairs pegged to non-MiCA Compliant Stablecoins. Further, starting March 27 at 07:00 UTC, any non-MiCA compliant Margin trading pairs will also be delisted for EEA users. Other services like trading bots, earn, and loans will also be impacted for users. Nevertheless, the exchange clarified that users will still be able to sell any remaining non-MiCA-compliant stablecoin holdings after March 31. Binance Continues Modifying Trade Offerings Simultaneously, with the abovementioned endeavor weighing in, the leading cryptocurrency exchange further cements its top ranking in the market. Notably, Binance has secured the top spot by constantly enhancing trade offerings in line with market needs. CoinGape recently reported that the exchange extended support to the Ethernity Chain (ERN) token swap process, sparking an ERN price upswing. On the other hand, the CEX also delisted key BNB and ETH trading pairs, adding to its foray into revolutionized offerings.

But while most digital assets tumbled, Bitcoin held up surprisingly well, proving once again why it’s the king of crypto. Meanwhile, meme coin investors had a rough ride—especially Dogecoin holders, who saw their portfolios shrink fast. That said, the meme coin scene isn’t completely dead. Instead of giving up, traders are pivoting to new trending projects. Crypto influencers are already eyeing up-and-comers like Solaxy (SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull (BULL), calling them potential winners while older names like DOGE and PEPE struggle to keep up. Let’s check out the details. Meme Coins Are Struggling to Bounce Back While many top cryptos have lost their post-election gains, meme coins have taken the biggest hit. The entire sector has retraced back to where it was in November 2024, wiping out the hype-driven rally from the winter “meme coin season.” Take Dogecoin (DOGE), for example. It shot up to nearly $0.50 after Trump’s win but has since slumped back to $0.20. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and FLOKI (FLOKI) have all seen similar drops, but PENGU got hit the hardest—plunging a brutal 40% from $0.015 to $0.009. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, the meme coin boom might be coming to an end. In a recent tweet, he pointed out some red flags, including rumors of Melania Trump, Libra, and the Lazarus Group allegedly using meme coins to launder stolen Ethereum. What crypto is digesting right now is the end of the memecoin boom. The combination of Melania, Libra, and the Lazarus Group using memecoins to launder stolen ETH will kill it dead. Maybe not today, but within 6 months. The good news is there are already things ready to replace… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) February 25, 2025 If true, it’s no surprise investors are losing confidence. Hougan even predicts the entire meme coin sector could collapse within the next six months. However, others, like Clay Bro, believe that the best presale meme coins, like $SOLX and $BTCBULL could generate substantial profits in the weeks to come. Let’s see why. Solaxy ($SOLX) – The Layer 2 Upgrade Solana Desperately Needs Solaxy ($SOLX) is stepping up to fix some of Solana’s biggest headaches—failed transactions, network congestion, and scalability issues. With Solana’s price action all over the place and ongoing drama in its meme coin space, Solaxy could be the game-changer the ecosystem needs. What makes Solaxy different? It’s the first Layer 2 for Solana, designed to make the blockchain faster and more reliable while also connecting it with Ethereum’s deep liquidity. That means DeFi, GameFi, meme coin, and NFT projects can enjoy the best of both worlds—Ethereum’s capital and Solana’s speed. Investors are already piling in, with Solaxy’s presale raising nearly $25 million. Its native token, SOLX, powers transactions and offers a massive 166% APY for stakers. With a 2025 launch ahead, this could be the upgrade that finally brings stability to Solana and fuels its next major rally. Visit the Solaxy ($SOLX) presale now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Meme Coin That Pays You in Bitcoin BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t just another useless meme coin—it’s designed to reward holders with actual Bitcoin as BTC climbs toward $1 million. Unlike most meme coins that rely purely on hype, BTC Bull Token offers a unique incentive structure where holders receive $BTC airdrops at key price milestones. The rewards start when Bitcoin hits $150K and continue every $50K thereafter, making it an appealing option for long-term Bitcoin believers. The project is already gaining serious traction, becoming one of the best presales in March, raising over $3,4 million. Investors can also stake $BTCBULL for a 136% APY, further increasing their holdings. A built-in burn mechanism helps reduce supply over time, potentially boosting the token’s value as demand grows. With Bitcoin regaining strength and meme coins leading market rebounds, BTC Bull Token positions itself as the ideal play for investors looking to capitalize on both trends. Audited by Coinsult and SolidProof , BTCBULL offers a safe, secure way to earn free Bitcoin while participating in the next wave of meme coin mania. Visit the Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) presale now Final Words Meme coins aren’t dead, but the game is changing. The old giants like DOGE and PEPE aren’t delivering like they used to, and investors are starting to look for fresh opportunities—projects with more than just hype behind them. That’s exactly why Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) are getting so much attention. Whether it’s fixing Solana’s biggest issues or literally paying holders in Bitcoin, these top meme coin presales are giving traders something new to be excited about.",Crypto News|Press Release|BTC Bull Token|DOGE|meme coins|PEPE|Solaxy,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|TRADING|SOL|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-03-03 11:51:09

The settlement , which will be split among affected investors, was preliminarily approved on February 28 by Boston federal court Judge Denise Casper. Settlement Reached After Lengthy Legal Battle The case, originally filed in March 2023, accused DraftKings of selling NFTs on its now-defunct DK Marketplace that functioned as investment contracts under U.S. securities laws. Lead plaintiff Justin Dufoe, who claimed to have lost $14,000 due to declining NFT values, spearheaded the lawsuit against DraftKings and its executives, including co-founders Jason Robins and Matt Kalish. In response, DraftKings attempted to have the case dismissed in September 2023, arguing that its NFTs did not meet the criteria of securities under the Howey Test . However, Judge Casper ruled against the dismissal, stating that the NFTs could indeed be classified as securities. Shortly after, in July 2023, DraftKings shut down its NFT marketplace, citing “recent legal developments.” With the marketplace defunct, investors argued their NFTs were rendered worthless, and DraftKings allegedly offered them only a fraction of their original investments as compensation. Investors Accept Deal Despite Higher Damages Estimate The settlement discussions between DraftKings and the class group began following the marketplace closure and culminated in an all-day mediation session. The legal team representing the investors called the agreement “an outstanding result”, highlighting that prolonged litigation would have been costly and uncertain. While the potential damages in the case were estimated between $18 million and $58 million, the $10 million settlement represents 26% of the midpoint of those estimates, which the plaintiffs’ attorneys argue is a “strong recovery” given the circumstances. As part of the settlement, Dufoe is expected to request a $50,000 award for his role in the litigation, while attorneys will seek up to one-third of the settlement fund in legal fees. This marks DraftKings’ second NFT-related legal dispute this year . In January, the company settled a lawsuit with the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) over the unauthorized use of NFL players’ likenesses in NFTs. While the terms of that settlement remain undisclosed, the case has been paused until March 28 for finalization.

This price decline has worried investors, especially since other altcoins have been doing well recently. Pi Coin hasn’t been able to keep up with the general market optimism that has followed President Trump’s crypto strategic reserve plan. Three main reasons seem to be causing Pi Coin’s price to fall: First, the wait for a Binance listing is taking too long. Second, big investors (whales) might be messing with the price. And third, not enough people are actually using Pi Coin. These issues have made people sell, making it hard for the price to go up.

As investors wait for the Trump-fueled rally to continue, Coinshares released its weekly cryptocurrency report, saying there were $2.9 billion in outflows last week. “Cryptocurrency investment products experienced a third consecutive week of outflows, marking the largest weekly outflow on record with a total of $2.9 billion. The total outflow in three weeks reached 3.8 billion dollars.” Two Altcoins Outperformed Others! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of the outflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an outflow of $2.59 billion, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an outflow of $300 million. When we look at other altcoins, the picture was mixed. While TON had an outflow of $ 22.6 million, Solana (SOL) had an outflow of $ 7.4 million; XRP had an inflow of $ 5 million, and Sui (SUI) had an inflow of $ 15.5 million. “Bitcoin has been hit the hardest by weak market sentiment, seeing $2.59 billion in outflows last week. Ethereum has also not escaped the negative sentiment and saw a record outflow of $300 million last week. Solana and Ton also saw debuts of $7.4 million and $22.6 million, respectively. Sui was the best performing cryptocurrency with $15.5 million inflows, followed by XRP with $5 million inflows. When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an outflow of 2.87 billion dollars. After the US, Switzerland and Canada saw exits of $73.1 million and $16.9 million respectively. In the face of these outflows, Germany experienced an inflow of $55.3 million. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin and Altcoins Take Their Biggest Weekly Hit!

It crashed 6% on Monday, and a risky pattern it formed on the weekly chart pointed to a big dive as CEX balances surged. Ethereum Price is at Risk as CEX Exchanges Jumped ETH price has remained in a technical bear market after falling by over 40% from its highest level in November last year. This sell-off may continue now that the volume of ETH balances on exchanges has continued rising this year. CoinGlass data shows that these balances soared to 15.5 million on Monday, up from 14.9 million last week. These balances have surged to their highest levels since February 8 of this year. Rising Ethereum reserves on exchanges is a sign that investors are moving their coins from self-custody to exchanges to sell. Ethereum Balances on Exchanges One sign that this is happening is that spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to see substantial outflows. The chart below shows that these funds have had outflows in the past seven straight days. They lost over $355 million in assets in this period, bringing their cumulative net inflow at $2.82 billion . Spot Ethereum ETFs ETH Price Triple-Top Pattern Points to a Big Crash These Ethereum headwinds mean that it may remain under pressure for a while. The weekly chart shows that the ETH coin formed a triple-top chart pattern around the $4,000 resistance level. This chart pattern is made of three peaks and a neckline. ETH hit the initial peak in March 2024. It then moved closer to that resistance level in May, and retested it again in November last year. That resistance is a sign that the bulls were afraid to place buy trades above that price. Ethereum price has now crashed to the triple-top’s neckline at $2,156, its lowest level in September last year. It has also plunged below the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines tool at $2,500, and the 50-week moving average. These are all signs that bears are now in control. Ethereum Price Chart Etherem Target Prices The most likely scenario is where the Ethereum price continues its strong bearish breakdown, with the next viable target being at $880, its lowest level in June 2022, which is about 60% from the current level. This target is at the oversold level of the Murrey Math Lines level. On the flip side, the bearish ETH price forecast will be invalidated if it rises above the top of the trading range at $2,800.

Because of the Bybit hack, it lost nearly $1.4 billion. In February, losses from hacks increased by at least 1,500% compared to January. Let’s dive deep to analyse the scenario better! Bybit Hack: The Largest Crypto Attack in History It was on February 21 that the Bybit hack was reported. At least $1.4 billion was lost due to the hack. It was orchestrated by a notorious hacking group based in North Korea, known as the Lazarus Group. The involvement of this North Korean cyber-criminal group in the Bybit hack was confirmed by the FBI, the top investigative agency in the United States. The last time the crypto sector witnessed a hack of this scale was when over $650 million was hacked from the Ronin ecosystem. Notably, the Bybit hack was twice as big as the Ronin hack. However, one thing in common between these two infamous hacks was that both were orchestrated by the same criminal group, Lazarus. Other Major Crypto Hacks in February No fewer than $1.53 billion was lost due to hacks in February. The Bybit hack alone accounted for $1.4 billion. Without this hack, February’s losses still totalled $126 million, which was at least 28.5% higher compared to January’s $98 million. The Infini hack and ZkLend hack were the other two major hacks recorded in February. On February 24, nearly $49 million was stolen from stablecoin payment firm Infini. Hackers exploited admin rights to redeem all Vault tokens. Interestingly, the company offered the hackers 20% of the stolen funds if the rest was returned. However, the hackers have not yet responded to the offer. On February 12, decentralised money lending protocol ZkLend was hacked. At least $10 million was stolen in the Zklend hack. Because of these two hacks alone, at least $59 million was lost in February. CertiK data shows that wallet compromise was the prime cause of hacks. The data also indicates that code vulnerabilities and phishing were also important causes.",News|Hack,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 12:05:28

However, at press time, Cardano price was erasing some of these gains after dropping from above $1 to trade at $0.97. The volatile price swings stirred by news around ADA being added to the US crypto strategic reserve have caused jitters among traders about whether it will sustain the rally. In this article, we explore the top reasons why you should not buy Cardano despite the recent gains. Cardano Price Surges 80%, But Here’s Why You Should Not Buy Despite Cardano outperforming the rest of the crypto market in the last 24 hours, below are the top 3 reasons why you should not buy ADA yet. A US Crypto Reserve Still Needs Congressional Approval As aforementioned, the recent Cardano price rally was fuelled by news around the US altcoin being added into a strategic crypto reserve. However, despite President Donald Trump’s executive order, this crypto reserve faces key hurdles . BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes noted that President Trump would still need Congressional approval to borrow money to buy the digital assets that will be part of the reserve. He stated, “Nothing new here. Just words. Let me know when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that, they have no money to buy Bitcoin and shitcoins.” Analyst Ali Charts also identified these challenges saying Congress had to pass the necessary legislation. Moreover, financial regulatory agencies had to establish compliance rules. According to the analyst, “Even if President Trump signs an executive order, a US Strategic Crypto Reserve wouldn’t become a reality overnight… And if Congress rejects it, is the entire market pump going to be undone?” If Congress challenges Trump’s executive order on a crypto reserve and it fails to pass, Cardano price could dump due to a brutal selloff. Whales Sold 110M ADA During the Rally Despite Cardano price posting one of its biggest daily gains in history, whale activity suggests that large ADA addresses are not confident in a sustained momentum. Whales holding between 10M and 100M ADA tokens reduced their holdings by 110M tokens, suggesting that they likely sold as the price rallied past $1. Cardano Whale Activity If whales are selling despite the price gain, it shows a bearish Cardano price forecast . This could weaken the current momentum and spark a price reversal. Cardano Price Reverses After Being Overbought After traders rushed to buy into yesterday’s rally, Cardano reached overbought levels, and the price is now facing a reversal. The RSI line is tipping south showing waning buyer interest. However, the RSI at 67 shows that a bullish momentum is still at play. The fading MACD histogram bars also show that buyers are leaving the market, increasing the risk of further downside. If selling activity continues, and Cardano price loses its current support at $0.97, it could trigger another decline to the next support levels of $0.81 and $0.65. ADA/USDT: 4-hour Chart However, despite this selling activity and bearish signs, ADA price could still rally later this week due to the White House Crypto Summit. As such, traders should brace for volatile swings in Cardano price during the week.

SOL YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Much like the downturn was triggered by external economic uncertainty emerging from President Donald Trump’s trade war , inflation data, and geopolitical concerns, the more recent upsurge can be traced back to the weekend cryptocurrency reserve announcement . Under the circumstances and given the possible tailwinds emerging from SOL’s inclusion in the reserve, Finbold consulted the advanced artificial intelligence ( AI ) of OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o on where the token might stand at the end of 2025. ChatGPT-4o sets Solana price target for December 31, 2025 Though ChatGPT quickly assessed Solana positively, its research, reasoning, and recommendations proved somewhat lackluster. Specifically, its initial price target for December 31 – set at $300 for an 85.71% upside from press time – was based on the assumption that the Bitcoin ( BTC ) halving has yet to take place. ChatGPT sets SOL price target for the end of 2025. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o Still, in its explanation, ChatGPT proved it is counting the months from the actual halving to historical market peaks correctly despite believing April 2024 is in the future. Indeed, it not only settled for the $300 price target due to factors more directly related to Solana, such as technological advancements, market positioning, institutional adoption, and broader trends, but it also gave the forecast due to December 31 being in the 12-18 month post-halving window. ChatGPT forecasts when SOL will peak based on the assumption the 2024 BTC halving has yet to happen. Source: Finbold & ChatGPT-4o The confusion, however, emerged once again when the AI was asked when SOL would see its cycle high. ChatGPT estimated that the plateau – set between $500 and $700 – would come either in late 2025 or early 2026, with the indication pointing toward the later period due to the December 31 forecast. Such a setup did not prevent the platform from stating that 2025 would be the optimal exit year due to the crypto market being likely to head back toward a bear market in the later months of 2026. ChatGPT revises its 2025 SOL price target Finally, a secondary prompt revealed that ChatGPT’s research was deficient, despite the AI being instructed to verify up-to-date information from the very start. Specifically, the model admitted it hadn’t accounted for the digital assets reserve announcement and Solana’s inclusion in the program. Still, SOL bulls hoping for greater gains might welcome the revised forecasts – if they find it credible – as ChatGPT revised its December 31 price target upward to the $500 to $700 range. ChatGPT revises SOL price target for the end of 2025.

Maker fees reward traders who provide liquidity (‘make’ the market) by placing limit orders that are not immediately filled. These orders create depth in the order book, improving market stability. Taker fees, typically higher, apply to traders who remove (‘take’) liquidity through market orders that execute immediately against existing orders. This fee structure encourages thoughtful order placement and helps maintain market equilibrium. Network Fees There is a direct relationship between trading volume and fees. High-volume traders often benefit from tiered fee discounts, making frequent trading more viable. For infrequent traders, fees influence minimum trade sizes and order types, pushing them towards cost-effective strategies. Deposit/Withdrawal & Other Fees Exchange revenue streams extend beyond basic trading fees, encompassing custody charges for large balances, penalties for account inactivity, premium feature subscriptions, and currency conversion fees. Another almost universal source of revenue across most platforms is deposit and withdrawal fees. Deposits can also carry costs associated with bank transfers or credit card premium rates. However, they are almost always lower than withdrawal fees, which vary by exchange and blockchain network. When making withdrawals, network fees can be absorbed by the exchange fee or passed on to the user. How Fees Affect Trading Frequency & Volume As the heading implies, there is indeed a close relationship between trading frequency and volume with fees. For one, high-volume traders may be incentivized to trade frequently by tiered fee structures. This relationship between trading volume and fee rates creates natural breakpoints where increased activity becomes more profitable. What happens in low-frequency trading, then? What influence might fees have when you buy bitcoins every once in a while? Minimum trade sizes adjust to justify fixed fees, while trading pair selection often gravitates toward lower-fee options. Order types shift between market and limit orders based on fee differentials, and trading frequency adapts to maximize volume-based discounts. Fees and Trading Strategies Impact on Day Trading, Long-Term Holding, and Arbitrage Different trading strategies face varying impacts from fee structures. Day traders, executing multiple positions daily, must maintain razor-sharp awareness of fee accumulation. A strategy generating consistent 2% gains might become unprofitable if fees consume 1.5% of each round trip. Long-term holders face less fee pressure but must consider withdrawal fees and custody costs when selecting platforms for extended positions. Arbitrage traders face particularly complex fee considerations. Successful arbitrage depends on exploiting price differences across exchanges while accounting for: Trading fees on both platforms Withdrawal fees for moving assets Network fees during transfers Time delays in cross-exchange movements Choosing an Exchange with Fees in Mind Fee Competition, Zero-Fee Models, and Beyond Fees The cryptocurrency exchange landscape has long evolved beyond simple fee competition. Of course, traditional fee structures are most common, but where else but in the crypto market can innovative models emerge? A particularly successful way of capturing market share is zero-fee trading promotions, though they come with sustainability limitations that are crucial to keep in mind. The maker-taker fee model is far from the only option for crypto traders these days: Layer-2 solutions reduce network fees for both centralized and decentralized platforms Automated market makers introduce dynamic fee structures based on pool stability Integration of traditional finance mechanisms with cryptocurrency trading infrastructure Hybrid models combine centralized efficiency with decentralized security Buy Bitcoins: Fee Considerations and Minimization Fees for Buying Bitcoin & Minimization Tips Buying Bitcoin comes with various fees. Bank transfers generally cost less than credit cards, and peer-to-peer marketplaces have different structures. Cost-saving strategies include timing purchases during low congestion, using limit orders, consolidating trades, and selecting optimal payment methods. The Psychology of Fees and Trading Decisions Loss Aversion, Fee Perception, and Fee Transparency Fees impact traders beyond economic costs. Loss aversion causes traders to avoid explicit fees while ignoring hidden costs like spread markups. Exchanges with transparent fees allow for informed decision-making, preventing traders from making emotional or suboptimal choices. The Future of Exchange Fees is Decentralized DEXs, Trends, and the Evolving Landscape We have already briefly touched upon thi,s but decentralized exchanges (DEX) and their fee models reshape trading. Instead of percentage-based fees, you are more likely to see dynamic algorithmic pricing that responds to liquidity pool dynamics. Smart contract automation and reduced operational overhead enable different economic models, though gas fees and network congestion create new considerations. Conclusion The interplay between exchange fee models and trading behavior is a cocktail of economics, psychology, and market dynamics. Love them or hate them, fees belong in the trading ecosystem as more than simple transaction costs. To make things more complicated, in the crypto world, fee structures evolve beyond familiar shapes, forming new implications. One of the many things that separate a successful trader from a struggling one is awareness of hidden and explicit costs alike and the ability to adapt their strategy to ever-shifting market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions How do maker and taker fees work? Maker fees apply when placing non-immediate orders (e.g., limit orders), adding liquidity and incurring lower fees. Taker fees apply to immediate trades (e.g., market orders), removing liquidity and typically costing more. Are zero-fee exchanges free? Zero-fee exchanges offset costs through wider spreads, higher withdrawal fees, or premium features, making trading not entirely free. How can I minimize exchange fees when trading cryptocurrency? Use limit orders for lower maker fees, trade during low congestion, leverage volume discounts, consolidate trades, and choose cost-effective payment methods. What other factors should I consider besides fees when choosing a crypto exchange? Evaluate security, regulatory compliance, liquidity, platform stability, geographic availability, and customer support for a well-rounded trading experience.",Guest Post,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 12:08:06

33767162,[object Object],1741003798,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Economist Says Recent Bitcoin Collapse Was ‘A Necessary Move.’ Crypto Rally Predicted as Meme Index Presale Nears End,https://bitcoinist.com/economist-recent-bitcoin-collapse-necessary-crypto-rally-meme-index-presale/,"The recent Bitcoin collapse in value from $90K+ to $78K may have forced traders to eat store-brand muesli instead of the premium stuff. But one leading economist says that the drop in Bitcoin value was a ‘necessary move.’ Zeberg made a couple of wild predictions . But one prediction he made is something most people agree on – a recession is likely on the horizon. The analyst insisted that Fed Chair Jerome Powell will soon be forced to start printing more dollars to prop up the stuttering US economy. That would potentially be good news for crypto investors, as printing more cash will further weaken the US dollar, which would likely force people to turn to crypto. Bitcoin is now back up to $92K+ with bright sunny days hopefully ahead. But it won’t just be Bitcoin flexing its muscles. Altcoins will also be eating its spinach and bouncing back. Zeberg described ‘an amazing altcoin season about to set in.’ But before these meme coins rally really take off, you need to find yourself a safe place to store and invest those meme coin investments. That is a very good reason why, out of all the current best presales , the current Meme Index presale could be your knight in shining armor. Is There a ‘Blow-Off Top’ Event Coming If The Fed Cuts Interest Rates? Zeberg maintains that what he described as a ‘blow-off top’ event is coming soon. In other words, the value of crypto is about to go through the roof. That’s likely to happen when the Fed will eventually cut interest rates and start printing more money. Adding to that, Zeberg said that Bitcoin slumped to $78K in such a short time largely due to ‘fear in crypto-land’. But now will likely be the time when we see a complete reversal (which he labeled as an ‘unpopular perspective .’) And that complete reversal might be spearheaded by the likes of Meme Index, the first-and-only meme coin index in the world. Meme Index Spreads Your Meme Coin Investment Risk Meme Coin is one of the best altcoins out there, by virtue of the fact that it makes an investor’s life easier. How? Because it spreads the risk and you also don’t have to constantly check every meme coin investment. The problem with new crypto – especially meme coins – is that you never know which ones are going to be runners and which ones are going to fall down at the first hurdle. If you put all your money on the wrong coin, then you’ve lost most or all of your money. Meme Index fixes that sticky situation by spreading your investment over four exclusive investment funds. These funds range from relatively safe (the ‘Meme Titan Index’) all the way up to heart-pounding panic attacks (the ‘Meme Frenzy Index’ – even the name gives you the shakes.) You need to decide which fund you sink your funds into, depending on your willingness to tolerate risk. These investment funds are only for holders of the Meme Index tokens. By buying into these tokens – especially at the presale stage – you’ll enter an exclusive investment club. Benefits include a great token price (now at $0.0166883) and a mind-blowing staking APY amount (which is currently at 583%). As well as all of this, you also get voting and governance rights, which means you can play a big part in the future development decisions of Meme Index. The presale is over in 28 days, so the time to lock in that reduced token price and staking APY is right now. Head on over to the Meme Index website and connect your crypto wallet. Then start stocking up on tokens. Remember though that you won’t get your tokens in your wallet until after the presale ends next month. Sunny days are predicted to be ahead for Bitcoin and other altcoins – which means taking steps to safeguard your meme coin investment. Meme Index can help with this so the sun shines on you too. The Best Advice Is Always To Do Your Own Research First We’re not financial advisors or lawyers. So we can’t give you 100% dead-certain guidance on where to place your money. We can only analyze the recent trends and make educated predictions based on our crypto experience. Therefore, you shouldn’t solely take our word for it. Before committing any of your hard-earned funds to Meme Index, you should always do lots and lots of research from credible sources (Facebook doesn’t count). Come to your own independent conclusions and then make your own decision. Never, ever invest money that you can’t afford to potentially lose. Meme coin investing is fun – but not if it makes you broke.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-03 12:09:58
41099670,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136006,1741003836,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive Bitcoin Surge: CryptoQuant CEO Unveils Coinbase Whales as Driving Force,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-surge-coinbase-whales/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster, and recently, it’s been shooting for the stars! You’ve probably seen the headlines and maybe even felt the excitement (or anxiety!) in your crypto portfolio. But what’s really behind this latest upward swing? According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, we can point our fingers (or perhaps fins?) at some big players making moves on a major exchange: Coinbase. Let’s dive into what Ki Young Ju is saying and what it could mean for the volatile world of cryptocurrency, especially for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Price Surge Explained: The Whale Factor Ki Young Ju, the CEO of the crypto analytics firm CryptoQuant, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his insights on the current Bitcoin price surge. His analysis points towards a specific group of investors as the primary catalyst: whales on Coinbase. But who are these “whales,” and why are they so important? In the crypto world, whales are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. Their trades, especially large ones, can significantly impact market trends and, in this case, the Bitcoin price. Ki Young Ju backed up his claim with a chart illustrating the BTC Coinbase Premium Index, a key indicator we’ll explore further. Decoding the Coinbase Premium Index: A Whale Watching Tool So, what exactly is this “Coinbase Premium Index” that Ki Young Ju is highlighting? Think of it as a price barometer, specifically comparing Bitcoin prices on two major cryptocurrency exchanges: Coinbase and Binance. Here’s the breakdown: Coinbase: Primarily caters to the US market and is often favored by institutional investors and larger players (whales). Binance: A global exchange with a broader international user base. The Index: Measures the percentage difference between the Bitcoin price on Coinbase and the Bitcoin price on Binance. When the Coinbase Premium Index is positive, it means Bitcoin is trading at a higher price on Coinbase compared to Binance. This premium often suggests strong buying pressure from US-based investors, particularly institutional ones. Conversely, a negative premium might indicate weaker US demand or stronger selling pressure. In the context of the recent Bitcoin surge, a significant positive Coinbase Premium Index, as pointed out by Ki Young Ju, strongly suggests that buying activity on Coinbase, likely driven by whales, is a major factor pushing the Bitcoin price upwards. Why Coinbase Whales Matter for the Crypto Market Why is the activity of Coinbase whales so crucial to understanding the current crypto market dynamics? Here’s why their movements are worth paying attention to: Market Influence: Whales, due to their large holdings, have the capital to execute substantial trades that can create ripples across the entire crypto market. Their buying sprees can trigger price rallies, while their selling activity can lead to downturns. Institutional Involvement: Coinbase is a preferred platform for institutional investors in the US due to its regulatory compliance and reputation. Whale activity on Coinbase often reflects institutional money flowing into Bitcoin. Leading Indicator: The Coinbase Premium can sometimes act as a leading indicator for broader market movements. Strong buying on Coinbase can signal growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin and potentially foreshadow wider market rallies. Therefore, observing whale behavior on Coinbase, as highlighted by the Coinbase Premium Index, provides valuable insights into the underlying forces driving the Bitcoin price and the overall health of the crypto market. It’s like getting a sneak peek into the strategies of the big players who can significantly shape market trends. Navigating the Bitcoin Surge: Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what can you, as a crypto enthusiast or investor, take away from this analysis of the Bitcoin surge and the role of Coinbase whales? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor the Coinbase Premium Index: Keep an eye on the Coinbase Premium Index as a potential indicator of buying pressure from US-based whales and institutions. Several crypto data platforms provide this index. Track Whale Wallets (with caution): While on-chain data is publicly available, tracking whale wallet activity can offer clues about large players’ movements. However, remember that wallet tracking is not foolproof and should be considered alongside other indicators. Understand Market Sentiment: Whale activity often reflects broader market sentiment. Strong institutional buying can signal growing confidence in Bitcoin and potentially attract more retail investors, further fueling the Bitcoin price. Stay Informed, Stay Vigilant: The crypto market is known for its volatility. While whale-driven surges can be exciting, they can also be followed by corrections. Always do your own research (DYOR), diversify your portfolio, and manage your risk wisely. Example: Imagine you notice a consistent and significant positive Coinbase Premium Index. This, coupled with other positive market signals, might suggest a strengthening bullish trend driven by institutional accumulation. Conversely, a sudden drop in the premium or a negative index could signal a potential cooling off or correction in the Bitcoin price. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of the Crypto Market The recent Bitcoin surge is a reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto market. Ki Young Ju’s analysis, focusing on Coinbase whales and the Coinbase Premium Index, provides a fascinating glimpse into the forces behind this rally. By understanding the role of these large players and monitoring key indicators, you can gain a deeper appreciation for market dynamics and potentially make more informed decisions in your crypto journey. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just starting to explore the world of digital assets, staying informed and understanding the influence of whales on platforms like Coinbase is crucial for navigating the exciting, yet sometimes turbulent, waters of the crypto market. The actions of Coinbase whales are definitely something to watch as the crypto market continues to evolve.

Altcoins analysis",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/are-ethereum-eth-ripple-xrp-and-solana-sol-back-on-track-altcoins-analysis,"Following President Trump’s announcement on the Crypto Strategic Reserve on this Truth Social account on Sunday, the entire crypto market has blown skywards. Has this announcement put $ETH, $XRP, and $SOL back on track? Maybe money talks, but it’s not just Bitcoin that is being considered for the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve. It’s in the name. President Trump expressly mentioned $XRP, $SOL, and $ADA in his post on Truth Social, and these cryptocurrencies rocketed accordingly. $XRP surges 38% on Sunday Source: TradingView For the price of $XRP, the Trump announcement was like a turbo booster. The price had been steadily declining since the $3.40 all-time high that was achieved in mid-January. However, it did not take long for the price to crash all the way back down to $1.77 in early February. A bull market floor looks to have been made since then at $1.95, and this horizontal level was touched again as recently as 28 of February. The Trump announcement had the effect of scorching the price all the way up to the $3 resistance, which was a 38% surge in just one day. On Monday, the price has since back-tested all the way to the descending trendline. If this is held above, which looks like happening, the $3.40 all-time high will definitely be a target. $ETH price boosted away from last-ditch support Source: TradingView The $ETH price was certainly in a precarious position before Sunday. The bears had the $ETH price on the very brink as it looked as though it could crash down through the major support, as well as the bull market trendline. While $ETH was not actually mentioned in President Trump’s post on the Crypto Strategic Reserve, it is highly likely to be one of those cryptos that are included. Therefore, a 21% pump from the edge of disaster was warmly welcomed by interested investors. On Monday, the price has so far returned to perhaps confirm the $2,350 horizontal as support. If this is achieved, and the bulls are able to get behind a potential $ETH breakout, the trend reversal would then become more of a possibility. $SOL surges away from the jaws of disaster Source: TradingView $SOL bulls are arguably the most relieved. At one point last week, the $SOL price was no small matter of around $47 below the bull market trendline. To all intents and purposes it really looked as though the uptrend was going to be lost, and perhaps for the rest of the bull market. The $SOL price hit its lowest point of $125 on Friday, and then on Sunday, as much as a 25% surge took the price back from the jaws of disaster. This means that a full candle body has still not closed below the ascending trendline. It now remains for the price action over the rest of this week to play out, with the next big directional decision possibly being made at the end of play this coming Sunday. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators in a great position for a potential crossover that could eventually lead to huge upside price momentum.

Decentralized prediction platform Polymarket is buzzing with activity, and the sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish. Users are placing their bets, and the collective wisdom of the crowd is pointing towards a high probability event: a Solana ETF approval by the SEC in 2025. Let’s dive into why Polymarket users are so confident, what a Solana ETF could mean for the crypto landscape, and whether this prediction holds water. Why is the Crypto Community Predicting an 87% Chance for a Solana ETF? Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, isn’t just a platform for casual guesses. It’s a place where users put their money where their mouth is, using crypto to bet on the likelihood of future events. The current prediction of an 87% chance of a SOL ETF approval by December 31, 2025, is a significant indicator of market sentiment. But what fuels this optimism? Momentum from Ethereum ETFs: The recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the SEC has undeniably paved the way and built confidence for other crypto ETFs. This landmark decision signals a growing regulatory acceptance of cryptocurrency investment vehicles. Solana’s Growing Ecosystem: Solana has emerged as a formidable player in the blockchain space, boasting a vibrant ecosystem of DeFi projects, NFTs, and a strong developer community. Its technological advancements, particularly in speed and scalability, make it an attractive asset for institutional investment. Institutional Demand for Solana: As institutional interest in crypto expands beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is increasingly being viewed as the next frontier. The demand for diversified crypto exposure is likely driving expectations for a Solana ETF . Polymarket as a Sentiment Gauge: Polymarket’s prediction markets serve as a valuable real-time gauge of market sentiment. The high probability assigned to a SOL ETF reflects a strong belief within the crypto-savvy community that approval is likely. What Exactly is a Solana ETF and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the ETF world, let’s break down what a Solana ETF actually is and why its potential approval is such a big deal. An Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is essentially an investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. A Solana ETF would specifically track the price of Solana (SOL). Instead of directly buying and managing SOL tokens, investors could gain exposure to Solana through the ETF by purchasing shares. Benefits of a Solana ETF: Simplified Investment: ETFs make investing in crypto more accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly those unfamiliar with wallets, exchanges, and the complexities of digital asset custody. Regulatory Compliance and Security: ETFs operate within established regulatory frameworks, offering investors a sense of security and compliance that may be lacking in direct crypto ownership. Increased Liquidity and Trading: ETFs are traded on major exchanges, providing high liquidity and ease of buying and selling during market hours. Diversification: A Solana ETF allows investors to diversify their crypto portfolio beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, tapping into the potential of the Solana ecosystem. Potential Price Appreciation for SOL: The introduction of a Solana ETF could significantly increase demand for SOL tokens, potentially driving up its price as ETF providers accumulate SOL to back their shares. Challenges and Roadblocks to SEC Approval for a SOL ETF While the Polymarket prediction is optimistic, and the Ethereum ETF approval is encouraging, the path to a Solana ETF approval is not without its hurdles. The SEC has historically been cautious about crypto products, and several challenges remain: Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will likely subject any Solana ETF application to rigorous scrutiny, focusing on market manipulation risks, custody solutions, and investor protection. Solana’s Classification: The SEC’s classification of Solana as a security or commodity could influence the approval process. Clarity on this front is crucial. Market Maturity: While Solana’s ecosystem is growing, the SEC might assess the maturity and stability of the Solana market before greenlighting an ETF. Political and Economic Factors: Broader political and economic factors can also influence regulatory decisions. Shifts in government policy or market downturns could impact the SEC’s stance. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? The 87% prediction on Polymarket is a strong signal, but it’s crucial to remember that it’s still a prediction, not a guarantee. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments related to crypto ETFs and Solana specifically. News from the SEC and industry commentary will be crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Whether or not a Solana ETF is approved, diversification remains a key strategy in crypto investing. Consider allocating a portion of your portfolio to Solana and other promising altcoins. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Don’t solely rely on predictions. Conduct thorough research on Solana’s technology, ecosystem, and long-term potential. Monitor Polymarket: Keep an eye on Polymarket and other prediction markets for evolving sentiment around a SOL ETF and other crypto-related events. These platforms can provide valuable insights into market expectations. Prepare for Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Be prepared for price swings, and invest responsibly, only what you can afford to lose. The Future Looks Bright for Solana ETFs The strong prediction from Polymarket users reflects a growing optimism within the crypto community about the future of Solana ETFs . While regulatory hurdles remain, the momentum from Ethereum ETFs, Solana’s robust ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest paint a promising picture. An approved Solana ETF could be a game-changer, bringing further legitimacy and mainstream adoption to Solana and the broader crypto market. Keep watching this space – 2025 could be a landmark year for Solana and crypto ETFs!

People are now using Pi Coin to buy things like cars, coffee, and many more. However, while its use is growing, some authorities have warned that using Pi Coin for payments may not be legal. Pi Payments Gaining Global Acceptance After years of waiting, Pi Network launched its Open Mainnet on February 20th. Known for its easy “tap-to-earn” mining, Pi has already won over 50 million users and crossed 100 million downloads of its Pi Browser. Now, its focus is shifting toward real-world payments. One of the most recent examples of Pi adoption comes from the U.S., where Cube Motors, a well-known Florida car dealership, has partnered with Pi Coin. Now, they’re accepting Pi Coin as payment for vehicles.

Rising Regulatory Challenges For Pi Coin Despite Pi Coin’s growing use cases, some countries have raised concerns. Officials in China, Vietnam, and Thailand have warned that using Pi for payments may not be allowed. Vietnam’s police even warned people about possible risks because of the country’s rules on digital money. In South Korea, crypto is not yet officially accepted for payments, making Pi transactions uncertain. But despite these issues, more businesses are starting to accept Pi, showing that many people still believe in it as a new way to pay. Pi Coin’s Price Swings In the last 24 hours, Pi token price has seen a surge of 4% , currently trading at $1.76. However, listings on major exchanges like OKX, Bitget, and MEXC have helped it stay 14% higher over the past week. As of now, the price is still under pressure, and if selling pressure continues, Pi Coin could fall to $1.49 or even $0.70. But if more buyers step in and adoption keeps growing, the price could bounce back to $2.5.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 12:13:23
41099827,https://coinpedia.org/?p=427168,1741004077,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Bitcoin Lithium : Future of Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrency,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/bitcoin-lithium-future-of-eco-friendly-cryptocurrency/,"The post Bitcoin Lithium : Future of Eco-Friendly Cryptocurrency appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Lithium ($BTCL) is poised to present itself as the next bottleneck in crypto, one that is a much-needed cross-section of a world that intersect between sustainability and technology to solve the great problems of global humanity. The project is combining blockchain innovation and environmental consciousness which promises great returns to investors but is also distinctly unique in that it takes this eco-friendly approach. Now, let us take a close look at what Bitcoin Lithium has to offer and how it is better than its green counterparts. What is Bitcoin Lithium? Bitcoin Lithium is a new cryptocurrency project using the blockchain architecture to benefit the real world. Fundamentally, $BTCL is the tokenization of carbon credits where consumers and corporations can easily offset carbon emissions. Providing seamless access between carbon tie-ins and cryptocurrency investment, this tokenization makes carbon credits available and easily tradable. Now in stage 6 of its presale, Bitcoin Lithium has already generated more than $2.5 million in funding so far from investors around the globe. This innovative method of combining profitability with sustainability seems to set it apart from other green crypto projects popping up in this trending niche. The Eco-Friendly Advantage The main benefit of Bitcoin Lithium is the capacity to turn environmental action into tangible rewards. The platform achieves this by incorporating carbon credits into its blockchain which both eliminates hurdles to entering into the sustainability sector while also encouraging users to implement green habits. Bitcoin Lithium is in a league of its own with its dual focus on environmental and financial benefits. On top of that, Bitcoin Lithium will roll out low-cost, high-efficiency battery recycling stations, solving another environmental problem, energy storage. The stations are clean energy-friendly, creating green energy infrastructure for the future. The project also moots launching a crowdfunding platform to enhance its social and ecological impact. Introducing $BTCL Token: Driving Forces Ready for Change The $BTCL Token is at the center of this ecosystem. This token is the backbone of Bitcoin Lithium, rewarding holders as we continue to grow and fund green initiatives. With presale interest soaring, $BTCL could rise immensely, with analysts expecting it to top $1 by the end of 2025. This makes it an appealing investment option for people looking for financial returns while contributing to climate change through rewarding forests. The Future of Bitcoin Lithium Bitcoin Lithium is the next generation of green crypto. It provides a unique selling point through the merger of Blockchain innovation with the commitment to sustainability, which focus on assessing customers who are aligned with eco-friendly. With the addition of tokenized carbon credits, a strong renewable energy ecosystem, and a future crowdfunding platform, it is unlike, and a leader in cryptocurrency. Now is the right time to act, as its presale has already achieved more than $2.5 million. The vision for Bitcoin Lithium is certainly in line with the direction that the world economy is headed, making this a potentially paradigm-shifting cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin Lithium in the forefront. To sum it up, Bitcoin Lithium is not just a green cryptocurrency, but rather a step into a clean, green, and sustainable world. If your interest lies in making an impact and earning its significant returns, $BTCL will interest you.

41099864,90ab846d-7c71-428d-9153-f6cf11086335,1741004109,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png,Crypto Daybook Americas: Trump's Reserve Shock Revives Cautious $100K BTC Hope,https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/03/03/crypto-daybook-americas-trump-s-reserve-shock-revives-cautious-usd100k-btc-hope,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The flip-flopping nature of the crypto market is on full display as the sentiment on social media has changed from ""it's so over"" to ""we are so back"" in just 24 hours, thanks to President Donald Trump naming BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and ADA as candidates for the long-promised strategic crypto reserve. The announcement has lifted valuations across the board, with market leader bitcoin reinstating $89,000 and $91,000 as key support levels, and the options market shows renewed interest in the $100K bets. Still, some analysts are calling for caution. ""Crypto is back on track with a positive momentum and enthusiasm from investors. However, it's important to note that no concrete actions have been taken yet, and a continued lack of immediate catalysts could lead to another slowly correcting market,"" Valentin Fournier, analyst at BRN , said in an email. That's sensible because tough questions may be asked once the initial excitement about the announcement subsides. For instance, Trump still needs congressional approval for this basket of reserves. While BTC makes sense as a reserve asset, having reportedly found a place in investor portfolios as digital gold, including XRP, ETH, SOL, and ADA raises concerns, as some of these tokens barely have links to economic activity. It begs the question: Why would a government facing debt issues invest in assets with minimal ties to the economy and are unlikely to generate a significant multiplier effect and help improve debt-to-GDP ratios? Plus, allegations of insider trading related to Trump's Sunday announcement might dent sentiment. On Sunday, an unidentified trader deployed roughly $6 million in a 50x leveraged long bet on BTC and ETH and booked out with a profit of $6.8 million. ""A U.S. crypto reserve could be a great boon to the asset class, but investors may feel more confident if significant measures are taken to resolve the fear of insider meddling,"" Mena Theodorou, co-founder at crypto exchange Coinstash, said, referring to the alleged insider trading. For now, it's risk-on, and a similar positive action on Wall Street could see solid gains in XRP/BTC, SOL/BTC and ADA/BTC crosses. Solana's co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, also known as Toly, has reportedly expressed support for the SIMD-0228 proposal, which seeks to reform Solana’s staking mechanism to reduce inflation . We can expect more details about the proposed reserve at Friday's crypto summit at the White House. In the meantime, two other key events to watch are Wednesday's U.S. ISM non-manufacturing (services) PMI and Friday's payrolls report. Note that the U.S. 10-year yield has declined for seven straight weeks, largely pricing a slowdown in the economy. The focus might shift back to that if the two impending data sets print below estimates, potentially weighing over risk assets.

Touted as his “official” token, it’s his fourth known crypto venture since 2018, following Ronaldinho Soccer Coin (RSC), $RON, and a Solana-based token—all of which soared briefly before crashing, earning him “rug pull” accusations. RSC aimed for VR football projects but flopped; $RON and the Solana token faded amid hype and no delivery. Critics on X slam $STAR10 as another cash grab, citing his pattern: leveraging 21 million X and 76 million Instagram followers for pumps, then abandoning projects. Past tokens lacked follow-through, with prices tanking after initial spikes—RSC hit near-zero, $RON stalled, and the Solana token raised manipulation flags. Community sentiment is wary—some see a quick flip, others a repeat rug. Four tokens in seven years, all hyped and forgotten mere days after launch. Investors tread carefully. Derivatives Positioning BTC and ETH's futures open interest remained flat Sunday as prices surged, a sign the rally was spot-driven. OM, HYPE and BCH tokens still see negative funding rates, a sign of the dominance of leveraged short bets. TRX, BTC, XMR, ADA and BCH are tokens with positive cumulative volume deltas, implying net buying in the perpetual futures markets. On Deribit, short-term skews have bounced to zero from negative, indicating a decline in bias for protective puts. Block flows featured demand for BTC $90K and $100K calls, calendar spreads at $85K strike puts. An entity sold the $92K strike put in April expiry while purchasing the $102 call in the same expiry, according to Amberdata. Ether flows featured short positions in puts to fund longs in calls.

Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely on utility and adoption, meme coins thrive on community support, social media engagement, and market hype. Their ability to rally quickly and generate 1000X gains for early investors has made them one of the most sought-after sectors in the market. Among the best new meme coins with 1000X potential, BTFD Coin is leading the charge with its presale performance and massive investor interest. While Dogecoin remains a market leader, and Pudgy Penguins is revolutionizing the NFT space, BTFD Coin is making waves with analysts predicting a massive surge post-launch. With only two presale stages left, now is the last chance to secure a position before prices take off! 1. BTFD Coin: The Presale Powerhouse Set for a Major Price Explosion BTFD Coin is taking the meme coin market by storm, thanks to its strong presale performance, bullish analyst predictions, and high investor demand. Unlike many projects that struggle to gain traction before launch, BTFD Coin has already built an army of holders and an engaged community, positioning itself for massive growth once it hits exchanges. Now, let’s talk numbers. A $13,000 investment at the presale price of $0.00016 secures 81,250,000 tokens with the LAUNCH100 bonus applied. Once BTFD Coin lists at $0.0006, that investment skyrockets to $48,750. But here’s the real game-changer—if BTFD Coin reaches its moon price of $0.006, that same investment turns into $487,500, delivering an incredible 3,650% ROI. With over $6.24 million raised, more than 70 billion tokens sold, and 11,100+ holders already on board, BTFD Coin is one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential. With only two presale stages left (Stages 15 and 16), this is the final opportunity to get in before a major price surge! 2. Dogecoin: The OG Meme Coin That Continues to Dominate Dogecoin is the foundation of the meme coin movement, proving that community-driven cryptocurrencies can stand the test of time. Originally launched in 2013, Dogecoin has grown from a joke into a multi-billion-dollar asset, attracting investors from all levels of the market. One of Dogecoin’s biggest strengths is its real-world adoption, with businesses like Tesla and AMC accepting DOGE for payments. Unlike newer meme coins, Dogecoin has proven its ability to sustain value over multiple market cycles, making it a safe bet among meme coins. For those looking for long-term potential with a stable meme coin, Dogecoin remains one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential. 3. Baby Dogecoin: The Hyper-Deflationary Meme Coin with Community Strength Baby Dogecoin is gaining traction as one of the fastest-growing meme coins, thanks to its deflationary supply model. Unlike its predecessor, Baby Dogecoin uses automatic burns to reduce supply over time, making each remaining token more valuable in the long run. With a strong community, passive rewards for holders, and strategic marketing campaigns, Baby Dogecoin is proving that it’s more than just a Dogecoin spin-off. As its supply decreases and its adoption grows, Baby Dogecoin is positioned as one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential. 4. Shiba Inu: Expanding Beyond the Meme Coin Label Shiba Inu started as a Dogecoin competitor, but it has quickly evolved into a legitimate blockchain project. With ShibaSwap, staking rewards, and upcoming metaverse projects, Shiba Inu is building an entire ecosystem beyond its meme roots. With increasing adoption, growing token burns, and integration into DeFi, Shiba Inu has positioned itself as a top meme coin for long-term investors. If you’re looking for a meme coin that offers both hype and utility, Shiba Inu is among the best new meme coins with 1000X potential. 5. Floki Inu: Blending Meme Culture with Real Utility Floki Inu is one of the few meme coins successfully integrating utility into its ecosystem, with DeFi products, NFT marketplaces, and real-world adoption strategies. Unlike many meme coins that fade after their initial hype, Floki Inu has continuously expanded its roadmap to maintain investor interest. With its marketing strength, expanding ecosystem, and dedicated investor community, Floki Inu is proving that meme coins can have both hype and substance. This makes it one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential. 6. Peanut the Squirrel: A Meme Coin Caught in Legal Controversy Peanut the Squirrel is a unique meme coin inspired by the late social media sensation, Peanut the squirrel. Despite its legal battles over branding rights, Peanut the Squirrel has managed to gain significant investor interest, making it one of the most controversial and talked-about meme coins. While its future remains uncertain due to ongoing legal disputes, its strong community backing and viral appeal make it a meme coin worth watching. If it can navigate legal challenges successfully, it has the potential to deliver massive returns to early investors. 7. Pudgy Penguins: The NFT Meme Coin Hybrid Taking Over Pudgy Penguins is a unique project that combines meme coin culture with the power of NFTs. Unlike traditional meme coins, Pudgy Penguins focuses on digital collectibles, brand partnerships, and expanding its Web3 presence. With major NFT collaborations and growing mainstream recognition, Pudgy Penguins is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after meme-based digital assets. Investors looking for a mix of NFTs and meme coin appeal should keep their eyes on this project. Final Thoughts: The Time to Invest Is Now Meme coins continue to dominate the crypto market, offering massive returns for those who get in early. BTFD Coin, Dogecoin, Baby Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, Peanut the Squirrel, and Pudgy Penguins are among the best new meme coins with 1000X potential, each bringing something unique to the market. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale growth, analyst-backed predictions, and potential for a 3,650% ROI make it the standout investment of the moment. Meanwhile, Dogecoin continues to dominate, Baby Dogecoin introduces a deflationary model, Shiba Inu builds a DeFi ecosystem, Floki Inu blends meme culture with real utility, Peanut the Squirrel thrives on controversy, and Pudgy Penguins merges NFTs with meme coins. With BTFD Coin’s presale entering its final stages, the chance to buy at the lowest price is closing fast. For those searching for the best new meme coins with 1000X potential , BTFD Coin leads the way—don’t miss out!

Dogecoin remains a top meme coin due to its longevity, adoption, and strong investor base. 3. What makes Baby Dogecoin different? Baby Dogecoin has a deflationary supply model that rewards holders and decreases total token circulation over time.

A chilling development in the cryptocurrency world reveals a hacker targeting Bybit Exchange is in the final stages of laundering a massive $148 million in ETH. On-chain analysts are sounding the alarm, predicting the Bybit hacker will conclude their illicit activities within just two days. This unfolding situation underscores the ever-present threats in the digital asset space and the critical importance of robust crypto security measures. Urgent Update: Bybit Hacker’s ETH Laundering Timeline According to prominent on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), the clock is ticking for the Bybit hacker . In a recent update, @EmberCN highlighted that the hacker’s wallet currently holds approximately 60,000 ETH, valued at a staggering $148 million, which is yet to be laundered. The analyst projects that this remaining sum will be processed and moved out of the hacker’s control either today or tomorrow. This rapid pace of ETH laundering demonstrates the sophistication and efficiency of modern crypto cybercriminals. The ability to move and obscure such vast amounts of cryptocurrency in a short timeframe raises serious concerns about exchange security protocols and the overall vulnerability of digital assets. Decoding the Hacker’s Tactics: On-Chain Analysis Reveals Clues How do analysts like @EmberCN track these movements? The answer lies in on-chain analysis . This powerful tool allows experts to scrutinize blockchain transactions, tracing the flow of funds from one wallet to another. By meticulously examining transaction patterns, analysts can identify suspicious activities and, in this case, track the ETH laundering process in near real-time. Key aspects of on-chain analysis in this scenario include: Wallet Monitoring: Tracking the hacker’s known wallet address and any associated addresses. Transaction Pattern Recognition: Identifying patterns indicative of laundering, such as frequent, small transactions through mixers or decentralized exchanges. Exchange Flow Analysis: Observing how the stolen ETH moves between different exchanges and services. Velocity Tracking: Monitoring the speed at which the funds are being moved and converted. The insights gained from on-chain analysis are invaluable in understanding the hacker’s methods and potentially disrupting their operations. It serves as a crucial tool for law enforcement and crypto security firms alike. Crypto Security Under Scrutiny After Bybit Exchange Hack This incident throws a harsh spotlight on crypto security practices within exchanges. While Bybit Exchange is a reputable platform, this hack underscores that no exchange is entirely immune to sophisticated cyberattacks. The incident raises critical questions: Are current security measures at exchanges sufficient to deter determined hackers? What vulnerabilities exist in exchange architectures that hackers are exploiting? How can exchanges proactively enhance their security protocols to prevent future incidents? What role can regulatory bodies play in enforcing stricter security standards for crypto exchanges? The answers to these questions are vital for the future of crypto security and the sustained trust of users in digital asset platforms. Exchanges must continuously invest in and innovate their security infrastructure to stay ahead of evolving cyber threats. This includes multi-factor authentication, cold storage solutions, regular security audits, and proactive threat intelligence. Impact Assessment: What Does ETH Laundering Mean for the Crypto Market? While the immediate impact of the ETH laundering may seem contained to the stolen funds, its broader implications for the crypto market are significant. Such events can erode investor confidence and trigger market volatility. Here’s a breakdown of potential impacts: Impact Area Description Market Sentiment News of large-scale hacks and laundering operations can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market, leading to negative sentiment. ETH Price Volatility While direct price impact might be limited, large ETH movements associated with laundering could contribute to short-term price fluctuations. Investor Trust Repeated security breaches can damage investor trust in crypto exchanges and the overall digital asset ecosystem. Regulatory Scrutiny High-profile hacks often prompt increased regulatory attention and potential tightening of regulations on crypto exchanges. Exchange Reputation While Bybit’s reputation might take a hit, proactive communication and enhanced security measures can mitigate long-term damage. It’s crucial for the crypto industry to collectively address these security challenges to foster a safer and more trustworthy environment for all participants. Protecting Your Crypto Assets: Actionable Insights for Users While exchanges bear the primary responsibility for securing their platforms, individual users also play a vital role in protecting their crypto assets. Here are some actionable insights: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Employ robust and unique passwords for all your crypto accounts and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible. Hardware Wallets for Long-Term Storage: Consider using hardware wallets for storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency offline, providing a higher level of security.

Always verify the authenticity of communications before clicking links or providing personal information. Stay Informed About Security Best Practices: Continuously educate yourself about the latest crypto security threats and best practices to stay ahead of potential risks. Diversify Exchange Usage: Avoid keeping all your crypto assets on a single exchange. Diversifying across multiple reputable platforms can mitigate risks. By taking these proactive steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your crypto holdings and reduce your vulnerability to cyber threats. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Crypto Security The ongoing Bybit hacker incident serves as a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving threats in the cryptocurrency landscape. The speed and scale of the ETH laundering operation highlight the need for continuous vigilance and improvement in crypto security across the board. For exchanges, this means investing in cutting-edge security technologies and robust protocols. For users, it necessitates adopting proactive security measures to safeguard their digital assets. As the crypto industry matures, collaborative efforts between exchanges, security experts, and users are paramount to building a more secure and resilient ecosystem. The race against cybercriminals is ongoing, and staying one step ahead is critical for the future of cryptocurrency.

41100045,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=685725,1741004396,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41100045.jpeg,"Trump wants a crypto reserve, but Congress holds the bag",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-wants-crypto-reserve-congress-holds/,"The digital assets industry witnessed a major plot twist and investors have been loving it. US President Donald Trump said the United States would soon establish a strategic crypto reserve that will feature Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). This declaration sent the crashing crypto market over the moon, regaining the crucial $3 trillion cumulative market cap. Its 24-hour trading volume jumped by a massive 196% to hit the $205 billion mark. However, even if Trump signs an executive order, the US Treasury won’t just start market buying BTC tomorrow. It still needs to get through Congress. Trump’s crypto reserve plan For the first time ever, a sitting US president acknowledged XRP, Solana, and Cardano alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Trump posted on his Truth Social account that “I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.” He even mentioned that the crypto reserve will elevate the industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration. Meanwhile, a US Strategic crypto reserve is far from becoming a reality overnight. It needs to be accepted and passed through Congress first. The Parliament has to draft, debate, and pass legislation. The drafted bill will need to define which digital assets are included, their weightings, and the reason behind adding them to the reserve. It doesn’t stop here, as the Council will seek funding sources needed to be allocated to build these reserves. Moreover, agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury are required to establish compliance rules. Congress, not Trump, holds crypto reserve power A US strategic crypto reserve faces legislative hurdles, as the creation of such stockpiles involves going through dark legal waters. The stance over the usage of cryptocurrencies looks widely separated globally. It is not yet defined properly or regulated even in the US financial framework. US financial watchdogs have turned down their scrutiny around the digital assets linked companies after Trump took over the White House. The SEC recently dropped several cases or closed investigations filed under Gary Gensler’s regime. This includes Uniswap Labs, Coinbase, and Gemini cases. It looks like the regulators are ready to accept crypto’s validity and build some laws regulating it. The US president had mentioned creating a crypto “reserve” instead of a “stockpile,” which sounds like a major win for the industry. As the term suggests, “stockpile” will hold crypto but not actively buy them. On the other hand, “reserve” will ensure regular Bitcoin, ETH, and other crypto buys like a digital gold standard. Trump is set to host the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on March 7, 2025. It is expected that the meeting will see discussions over regulation and innovation around crypto. However, investors will be looking for more insights about the crypto reserve plans. Bitcoin and the entire crypto market were in freefall last week after the trade war intensified. However, Trump’s announcement sent BTC back above $94K overnight. Bitcoin is now up by 8% in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s XRP price is up by 18% in the past 24 hours. The recent spike has erased all the losses it took over the last 7 days. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.63 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume blasted by over 580% to stand at $21.8 billion. Cardano turned up as the biggest gainer of the day after dealing with a long line of selling pressure. ADA price is up by 47% over the past day. ADA price has gone up by 15% on the year to date (YTD), suggesting a major breakout. Cardano is trading at an average price of $0.97 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed by 1800% to stand at $10.7 billion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

41100027,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136020,1741004408,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,SHOCKING Claim: BitMEX Founder Slams US Crypto Reserve as ‘Empty Talk’,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-reserve-empty-talk/,"Is the United States government’s grand plan to create a strategic crypto reserve just hot air? According to BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, it might very well be. In a recent tweet that sent ripples through the crypto community, Hayes didn’t mince words, dismissing the announcement as mere “empty talk.” Let’s dive into why this influential voice in the crypto world is so skeptical and what it means for the future of digital assets. Arthur Hayes on US Crypto Reserve: Bold Statements or Valid Concerns? Arthur Hayes, known for his candid and often contrarian views, took to X to express his skepticism about the U.S. government’s stated intention to establish a strategic crypto reserve . His argument is straightforward and financially grounded: without explicit congressional approval to allocate funds or a significant revaluation of gold prices, the government simply lacks the capital to make substantial bitcoin and altcoin purchases. Here’s the crux of Hayes’s argument broken down: Lack of Funding Approval: Hayes points out that creating a strategic reserve, especially one involving volatile assets like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, requires significant financial backing. Such financial commitments typically need congressional approval. Without this crucial step, any announcement remains purely aspirational. Gold Revaluation as a Potential Funding Source: He humorously suggests that a massive revaluation of gold could hypothetically provide the government with the necessary funds. However, he implies this is highly improbable, highlighting the current lack of viable funding mechanisms. “No Money to Buy Crypto”: In essence, Hayes believes that unless the U.S. government demonstrates a clear financial strategy and secures the necessary funds, their talk of a crypto reserve is just that—talk. It lacks the financial muscle to become a reality. Why a US Crypto Reserve? Exploring the Potential Benefits The idea of a strategic crypto reserve , while currently questioned by figures like Arthur Hayes, is not without its merits. Proponents argue that it could bring several benefits to the U.S. and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: National Security in the Digital Age: Just as nations hold reserves of oil and precious metals, a crypto reserve could be seen as a strategic asset in an increasingly digital world. It could provide a hedge against economic instability and potentially be used in future financial crises. Boosting US Influence in Crypto: By holding a significant bitcoin and cryptocurrency reserve, the U.S. could exert more influence in the global crypto market. This could be particularly relevant in shaping international regulations and standards. Supporting Innovation and Adoption: A government-backed crypto reserve could signal a strong endorsement of the cryptocurrency industry, encouraging further innovation and broader adoption within the United States. This could attract talent and investment, solidifying the US as a leader in the crypto space. Financial Tool for the Future: Cryptocurrencies are increasingly seen as a new asset class. Holding a reserve could provide the government with a modern financial tool for various purposes, including managing inflation or stimulating economic growth in the future. The Challenges and Roadblocks to a US Crypto Reserve Despite the potential advantages, the path to establishing a U.S. crypto reserve is fraught with challenges. Arthur Hayes’s skepticism highlights just one aspect—funding—but there are several other significant hurdles: Challenge Description Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains unclear and fragmented. Establishing a government reserve would require navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks, which are still evolving. Volatility and Risk Management Cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin , are known for their price volatility. Managing a large reserve of such assets would require sophisticated risk management strategies to protect taxpayer money. Public and Political Perception Public and political opinion on cryptocurrencies is still divided. Convincing taxpayers and policymakers of the value and necessity of a crypto reserve could be an uphill battle, especially given concerns about illicit activities and environmental impact. Operational and Custodial Issues Securing and managing a large cryptocurrency reserve presents significant operational challenges. Ensuring the security of digital assets and preventing theft or loss requires robust custodial solutions and expertise. Market Impact Large-scale purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by the government could significantly impact market prices, potentially leading to inflation or market manipulation concerns. The Role of US Crypto Policy and Future Outlook Arthur Hayes’s comments underscore the critical need for clear and decisive US crypto policy . While the idea of a strategic reserve is intriguing, it requires more than just announcements. It demands concrete action, including legislative support, funding allocations, and a well-defined regulatory framework. Currently, the US crypto policy landscape is characterized by: Agency Scrutiny: Various government agencies, including the SEC and CFTC, are actively involved in regulating different aspects of the cryptocurrency market. This fragmented approach can create confusion and hinder progress. Legislative Efforts: There are ongoing efforts in Congress to create more comprehensive crypto legislation. However, progress has been slow, and reaching a consensus on key issues remains challenging. International Coordination: Given the global nature of cryptocurrencies, international cooperation is crucial. The U.S. needs to work with other countries to develop consistent global standards and regulations. For a crypto reserve to move beyond “empty talk,” the U.S. government must: Secure Congressional Approval: Explicit authorization and funding from Congress are essential to demonstrate commitment and allocate resources. Develop a Clear Regulatory Framework: Establishing a consistent and comprehensive regulatory framework will provide clarity and encourage responsible innovation in the crypto space. Engage with Industry Experts: Collaborating with cryptocurrency experts and industry stakeholders will ensure that policies are practical, effective, and aligned with technological realities. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? So, what should crypto enthusiasts and investors take away from Arthur Hayes’s commentary and the current state of the crypto market ? Temper Expectations: Hayes’s skepticism serves as a reminder that government announcements don’t always translate into immediate action. It’s crucial to critically evaluate claims and look for concrete steps rather than just rhetoric. Focus on Fundamentals: In a market influenced by both hype and skepticism, focusing on the fundamentals of individual crypto projects and the broader technology remains vital. Look at adoption rates, technological advancements, and real-world use cases. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Regulatory clarity is a key factor that can significantly impact the crypto market. Keep abreast of developments in US crypto policy and global regulations to anticipate potential market shifts. Diversify Your Portfolio: Given the inherent volatility and uncertainties in the crypto market, diversification remains a prudent strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and consider a mix of different cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Conclusion: Decoding the Crypto Reserve Rhetoric Arthur Hayes’s dismissal of the U.S. crypto reserve plan as “empty talk” is a stark reminder of the gap between aspiration and action. While the idea of a strategic reserve holds potential benefits for national security and U.S. influence in the digital economy, significant challenges remain. Funding, regulatory clarity, and public perception are just some of the hurdles that need to be overcome. For the crypto market and investors, Hayes’s comments serve as a valuable dose of realism, urging a focus on tangible progress and sound fundamentals amidst the ever-evolving narrative of cryptocurrency adoption. The future of a U.S. crypto reserve , and indeed the broader trajectory of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, hinges on concrete actions, not just promising words.

41100028,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=136123,1741004444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Surge: Euro Gains Momentum as Dollar Retreats on Ukraine Peace Talk Breakthroughs,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/euro-gains-dollar-retreats-ukraine/,"In a dramatic turn of events in the global financial landscape, the euro is experiencing a significant upswing, fueled by growing optimism surrounding potential peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, the US dollar is taking a breather, stepping back from its recent dominance. For those in the cryptocurrency world, these shifts in the traditional Forex market can signal broader changes in risk sentiment and asset flows. Let’s delve into what’s driving these currency fluctuations and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why Are Euro Gains Surging Amidst Ukraine Peace Talks? The primary catalyst behind the euro’s recent strength is the glimmer of hope emerging from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. After weeks of intense geopolitical tension that heavily weighed on the euro, any indication of de-escalation is seen as a major positive for the European economy and its currency. Here’s a breakdown of factors contributing to the Euro Gains : Peace Talk Progress: Reports suggesting progress in negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have significantly boosted market sentiment. Investors are interpreting these developments as a potential pathway to reduced conflict and economic stabilization in the region. Reduced Geopolitical Risk Premium: The euro had been trading at a discount due to the high geopolitical risk associated with the conflict in Ukraine, which borders the Eurozone. As peace prospects improve, this risk premium is unwinding, leading to a natural appreciation of the euro. Economic Rebound Anticipation: A resolution to the conflict could pave the way for economic recovery in Europe. The anticipation of reduced energy price volatility and a return to more stable trade relations is bolstering confidence in the euro’s future. Short Covering: Many traders had previously bet against the euro (short positions) due to the conflict. As the outlook improves, these traders are closing their short positions, buying euros to cover their bets, further driving up the currency’s value. For crypto enthusiasts, this demonstrates how geopolitical events can ripple through traditional markets and create shifts in investor sentiment that can eventually influence digital assets as well. A stronger euro, driven by peace hopes, can be indicative of a broader risk-on environment. What Factors Contribute to Dollar Retreats? While the euro is basking in the sunlight of peace hopes, the US dollar is experiencing a Dollar Retreats , albeit a measured one. The dollar had previously benefited from its safe-haven status during the peak of the Ukraine crisis. However, with improving sentiment, some of that safe-haven demand is waning. Here’s a closer look at why the dollar is stepping back: Risk-On Sentiment: As investors become more optimistic about a resolution in Ukraine, they are moving away from safe-haven assets like the dollar and towards riskier assets, including the euro and potentially even cryptocurrencies. Profit-Taking: The dollar had enjoyed a significant rally in recent months, driven by expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and its safe-haven appeal. Some investors are now taking profits on these dollar positions. Federal Reserve Policy Already Priced In: The market has largely priced in the expected interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve. Unless there are significant surprises in inflation data or Fed communication, further dollar appreciation based solely on interest rate expectations may be limited for now. Relative Value Shift: As the euro becomes more attractive due to improving geopolitical conditions, the relative value proposition of the dollar, especially against the euro, may slightly diminish. It’s crucial to note that a Dollar Retreats in this context doesn’t necessarily signify dollar weakness in the long term. It’s more of a recalibration as geopolitical risks slightly subside and other currencies, like the euro, catch up. For crypto traders, a slightly weaker dollar can sometimes be correlated with increased appetite for alternative assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins. How Do Ukraine Peace Talks Influence the Forex Market? The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the associated peace negotiations have become a significant driver in the Forex Market . Geopolitical events of this magnitude can trigger rapid and substantial shifts in currency valuations. Here’s how these talks are influencing the market: Influence Factor Impact on Forex Positive Peace Talk Developments Euro appreciation Dollar depreciation (relative to euro) Increased volatility in ruble and other related currencies Potential for recovery in Eastern European currencies Negative Peace Talk Developments/Escalation Euro depreciation Dollar appreciation (safe-haven demand) Surge in volatility across Forex markets Flight to safety into traditional safe havens like USD and JPY Prolonged Uncertainty/Stalemate Continued volatility and risk aversion Euro remains under pressure but may find some support levels Dollar maintains some safe-haven appeal but may not strengthen significantly Market focus shifts to other economic data and central bank policies Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone trading in the Forex or cryptocurrency markets. Geopolitical risks are a major factor influencing global financial flows, and the Ukraine situation is a prime example of this. Navigating Currency Fluctuations: What’s Next for the Forex and Crypto Markets? The current currency fluctuations in the Forex market present both opportunities and challenges for traders, including those in the crypto space. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Monitor Peace Talk Developments: Stay informed about the progress (or lack thereof) in Russia-Ukraine peace talks. News headlines and official statements can trigger immediate market reactions. Track Economic Data: While geopolitics are dominant now, economic data releases (inflation, GDP, employment) and central bank announcements will regain importance as the geopolitical situation stabilizes. These will influence the longer-term trends in currency values. Assess Risk Sentiment: Pay attention to overall market risk sentiment. A risk-on environment, often signaled by rising equity markets and a weaker dollar, can be favorable for cryptocurrencies. Conversely, risk-off sentiment may favor the dollar and potentially pressure crypto. Diversification and Hedging: Consider diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes, including both traditional Forex and cryptocurrencies. Forex markets can sometimes offer hedging opportunities against volatility in the crypto market, and vice versa. Volatility is Opportunity: Increased currency fluctuations create trading opportunities. Both Forex and crypto markets thrive on volatility. However, manage risk carefully and use appropriate position sizing and stop-loss orders. The interplay between traditional Forex markets and the cryptocurrency world is becoming increasingly evident. Events that drive movements in major currencies like the euro and dollar can have knock-on effects on the crypto market, particularly in terms of risk appetite and capital flows. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Forex and Crypto Dynamics The current market scenario, with the euro showing hopeful strength and the dollar experiencing a temporary retreat , underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. The Ukraine peace talks are a powerful reminder of how geopolitical events can swiftly reshape the Forex Market and influence broader investor sentiment. For those engaged in the world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these currency fluctuations and their underlying drivers is crucial for navigating market volatility and identifying potential opportunities. As the situation evolves, staying informed, adapting your strategies, and managing risk will be key to thriving in both the Forex and crypto realms.
