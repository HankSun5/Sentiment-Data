Or grab Snek before it made millionaires overnight? The next big crypto opportunities are happening now with the top new meme coins to join today and those who hesitate risk being left behind. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Snek (SNEK) have already made their mark, but a new beast is entering the ring— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . With its presale in the final stretch and an insane 3650% ROI potential, there’s a reason investors are piling in before it’s too late. BTFD Coin has captured the hearts of over 11,100 holders and sold more than 70 billion coins, raising a staggering $6.21 million so far. With a referral program that rewards users for spreading the word and staking rewards as high as 90% APY, this is more than just another meme coin—it’s a revolution. The 14th stage of the presale is already 98.50% complete, and at just $0.00016 per token, the window to claim massive returns is closing fast. Those who wait might have to pay a premium later—or miss out entirely. BTFD Coin: 3650% ROI Potential and the Most Rewarding Referral Program in Crypto BTFD isn’t just a meme—it’s a battle cry. Buying the dip is more than a strategy; it’s a mindset that has built fortunes in the crypto world. BTFD Coin embodies that philosophy perfectly, offering early investors a shot at incredible gains before the bull market kicks into overdrive. The presale is structured in 16 stages, with each phase pushing the price higher. Right now, in Stage 14, you can secure BTFD at $0.00016. Once the presale ends, the price is set to hit $0.0006, delivering a 275% return immediately. But that’s just the beginning. Analysts predict a moon price of $0.006, which translates to a jaw-dropping 3650% ROI for those who get in now. Let’s break it down. If you invest $3,750 at the current price of $0.00016, you’ll receive 23.4 million BTFD tokens. At the presale’s closing price of $0.0006, your holdings would already be worth $14,040. But if BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006, that same investment could balloon to an astonishing $140,400. And that’s not all—BTFD Coin rewards you just for bringing others in. Their referral program lets you earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD tokens when your code is used. If your referrals purchase at least $50, they get an extra 10% in tokens, making this one of the most rewarding referral programs in crypto. Add in the staking program—where holders can earn a massive 90% APY—and BTFD isn’t just another hype among the top new meme coins to join today. It’s a wealth-building machine designed for those who know how to seize opportunities before they explode. Pudgy Penguins: The NFT Sensation Expanding Beyond the Blockchain Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) started as an NFT project but has since evolved into something much bigger. With an army of loyal holders and a strong brand, PENGU has become one of the most recognizable names in the meme and NFT space. Its recent expansions into merchandise and physical collectibles have driven renewed interest, proving that this isn’t just a fleeting trend—it’s a cultural movement. As Pudgy Penguins continue to dominate the NFT world, investors are taking notice. While it may not have the same explosive ROI potential as a presale like BTFD, PENGU remains a powerhouse in the crypto space, particularly for those who believe in the long-term future of digital collectibles. Snek: Cardano’s Meme Coin King Snek (SNEK) has established itself as the go-to meme coin on the Cardano network. Unlike other meme tokens that exist purely for the hype, SNEK has built a dedicated community and a solid foundation, making it one of the most talked-about projects on Cardano. What makes Snek stand out? Its strong grassroots movement and focus on decentralization have made it a favorite among crypto purists. While it may not promise the 3650% ROI potential of BTFD, its track record of growth and resilience in the market makes it an attractive choice for those who believe in Cardano’s long-term vision. Final Thoughts Timing is everything in crypto, and right now, BTFD Coin is in the sweet spot. The presale is almost over, the price is still at an entry-level discount, and the community is growing by the day. Unlike established meme coins like Pudgy Penguins and Snek, BTFD offers a chance to get in before the hype fully takes off. Based on market trends and our research, early-stage investments in presales have historically outperformed later-stage buys. Those who recognized Dogecoin’s potential early turned small investments into fortunes. The same goes for Shiba Inu. BTFD Coin is shaping up to be the next big success story—but only for those who act fast on the top new meme coins to join today. Join the BTFD presale before it’s too late. Visit the BTFD website , connect your wallet, and secure your tokens today. The 14th stage is almost full, and this price won’t last much longer.

He argues that the cryptoverse is in safe hands as key players brace for sweeping regulations and policy changes. Cardano Founder Douses Speculation For Crypto Role By US Government As the US crypto regulatory landscape braces for changes, insiders say Hoskinson is in the offing for a White House crypto role by community members. A meeting with an unnamed VIP in Florida has sent tongues wagging that the Cardano founder could be in the thick of things in shaping US crypto policy. However, Hoskinson has refuted speculation that he could be appointed to a crypto role, adding that “meetings do not imply endorsement. Hoskinson’s X post confirmed that a crypto role in the White House is not within reach at the moment. Hoskinson added that he will not be making any comments on the topic of a crypto appointment unless he obtains new relevant information. Citing the cross-agency collaboration for crypto regulations , the Cardano founder argues that the industry has proper representation from experts and enthusiasts. “At this juncture, further comments and speculation are both counterproductive and unnecessary,” said Hoskinson. The Cardano founder is in pole position to attend the inaugural White House Crypto Summit on Friday but details are still sparse. Stepping Up To Defend XRP Following Inclusion In Strategic Reserve Cardano’s community is still buzzing from President Trump’s decision to include ADA in the Crypto Strategic Reserve . Amid the hype, the Cardano founder has waded in to defend XRP’s inclusion in the Strategic Reserve in the face of criticisms. Hoskinson argues that the underlying technology of XRP is “great” and points to its community resilience in the face of a lengthy regulatory witchhunt. His comments come on the heels of scathing criticisms by Peter Schiff with XRP’s community expressing gratitude to Hoskinson for stepping up. “XRP is great technology, a global standard, survived a decade through many harsh cycles, and has one of the strongest communities,” said Hoskinson.

41074739,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=241890,1740956261,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ethereum Price Gains 15% in 1 Hour as Trump Finally Confirms ETH for Crypto Strategic Reserve,https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-forecast-trump-confirms-eth-sol-ada-xrp-btc-us-crypto-strategic-reserve/,"Ethereum price surged 15%, climbing from $2,200 to $2,550 within a frenetic one-hour period on Sunday, March 2, after Trump confirmed ETH’s inclusion in the official Crypto Strategic Reserve. Ethereum (ETH) Price Soars 15% as Trump Confirms ETH Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Ethereum price action came under intense scrutiny over the weekend as markets reacted to Trump’s official confirmation of the much-anticipated Crypto Strategic Reserve. Notably, Trump had initially omitted ETH from the list of altcoins to be included in the strategic reserve bucket of assets. The announcement, which came around noon in the U.S. trading session, had featured only SOL, ADA, and XRP, sparking concerns that ETH was excluded due to recent network update squabbles and changes in leadership. “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum! – Donald Trump, via Truth Social, March 2, 2025 Within an hour, SOL, XRP, ADA, and Bitcoin prices all rose by double digits , while ETH remained rooted at the $2,200 level. However, nearly two hours after the initial announcement, Trump issued another post clarifying that both ETH and BTC were also included on the list of assets to be acquired by the United States Treasury. US President Donald Trump Confirms ETH Inclusion in Crypto Reserve Following this clarification, ETH price promptly joined the rally. Within one hour of Trump’s second post, Ethereum surged 15%, moving from $2,200 to reclaim territory above the $2,550 level. Bulls Establish 80% Dominance in ETH Derivatives Market Considering that XRP and Cardano have now recorded gains exceeding 20% at press time, ETH could potentially witness further upside, especially as U.S.-based investors holding ETH ETFs could mount major buy orders when markets reopen on Monday, March 3. Movements observed in the derivatives market show that some strategic traders deployed massive leverage on Sunday in hopes of booking amplified profits if the trading week begins on a positive note, as widely anticipated after Trump included ETH in the Crypto Strategic Reserve. Coinglass Liquidation Map data, which measures the real-time balance of leverage deployed on active long futures contracts against shorts, shows bulls established significant dominance on Sunday, hinting that the majority of traders are betting on further gains when markets reopen for the week. Ethereum Liquidation Map data, March 2, 2025 | Coinglass The ETH liquidation map chart above shows that bulls mounted a total of $1.14 billion at press time on Sunday, while short leverage has dwindled to just $333 million. This reflects that bulls now dominate the ETH market, with long leverage exceeding shorts by approximately 70%. Aligning with the trending news events, it appears short traders are opting to close out their positions early rather than risk bigger losses, as the current ETH price rally has the backing of the United States government. With the U.S. government set to begin the official process of purchasing ETH, BTC, SOL, and ADA, the current bullish setup in the derivatives market could persist. Unless another comparable bearish catalyst arises, ETH is poised to face weakened resistance levels as it approaches the $3,000 mark in the week ahead, as implied by the dwindling short positions in the derivatives market. Ethereum Foundation’s Leadership Shuffle also Lifted Market Sentiment Another key factor contributing to the positive swing in Ethereum’s market momentum was the leadership change announced by the Ethereum Foundation on Saturday, March 1. The Foundation appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang, a core researcher with seven years of experience, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of Nethermind, as co-Executive Directors. This leadership restructuring aims to enhance technical expertise and improve communication within the Ethereum ecosystem. Following recent controversies surrounding network updates, this leadership shuffle has lifted investor sentiment ahead of President Trump’s major announcement on Sunday. ETH Price Forecast: Falling Wedge Pattern Hints $4K Rally Ahead After intraday 15.72% gains, Ethereum price forecast charts continue to flash bullish signals for a potential rally towards $4,000 as March 2025 kicks off on a positive note. As seen below, the ETHUSDT 12-hour chart reveals a textbook falling wedge breakout, a historically strong reversal pattern. If confirmed by a decisive close above the upper trendline near $2,500, ETH price could advance further towards $3,000 mark, especially as the 70% bullish dominance in the derivatives market hints weaker resistance clusters at key price levels ahead. Typically, the falling wedge pattern projects a measured move equal to the height of the formation, with the current target signaling a potential ETH price rally toward $4,000 in the coming weeks. ETH Price Forecast The strong bullish candle on the breakout signals robust buying interest, reinforced by increasing volume, confirming the validity of the trend reversal. The price currently hovers around $2,514, with the next key resistance zone near $2,800, which previously acted as a supply zone. If Ethereum clears this level, momentum could accelerate toward the $3,200-$3,400 range, aligning with the upper bound of historical resistance. A sustained move above this threshold would validate the full breakout target near $4,000. On the flip side, failure to hold above $2,500 could invite selling pressure, potentially retesting the former resistance-turned-support level at $2,300. A break below this threshold might invalidate the bullish setup, opening the door for a deeper pullback. However, given the strength of the breakout, Ethereum bulls appear poised for further gains in the near term.

Based on historical data DOGECAPITAL predicts Dogecoin’s value will reach $10 during 2025 following support line retracements before price explosions. Dogecoin’s annual value increase during 2024 outperformed both 2016 and 2020 since it reached 3.5 times its initial value but surpassed the 1.5x increase from 2016 and 2.5x growth from 2020. Analysts predict that Dogecoin could rise beyond $1.70 after institutions started buying more than 530 million units within 72 hours and continued this trend. As this happens, a newer crypto project is stealthily positioning itself with superior prospects: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Dogecoin price predictions Dogecoin needs to follow its historical patterns to reach the $10 milestone. The weekly price movements of Dogecoin match historical bull hierarchies as analyzed by DOGECAPITAL. The support level once located near $0.20 currently undergoes retesting as liquidation phase prior to recent parabolic increases. Two significant consolidations during 2017 and 2021 triggered DOGE to start its multi-year price surge. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows historical triggering points for market rallies which both analyst communities and Trader Tardigrade agree demonstrate a bullish pattern in Dogecoin structure. Skeptics warn about the impact of speculative trading and meme-aged hype for sustaining Dogecoin’s expansion despite forecasts that it will reach $1 after its current surge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has successfully brought in large capital sums during its second token presale period as Dogecoin moves towards record-breaking prices. Token holders have accumulated tokens worth over $2 million at the beginning of the two presale stages when prices started at $0.015. The innovative lending model together with tokenomics system creates an immediate opportunity for presale investors because they will experience a 33.3% profit increase when prices reach $0.02 at the next stage. The MUTM cryptocurrency launch price will start at $0.06 following its launch therefore providing a 300% value increase above its present presale value of $0.015. After launch there is a strong prediction that MUTM tokens will rise to $10 through a buy-and-distribute system that supports continued token ownership. Mutuum Finance stands apart because of integrated demand systems that operate within its framework. The mtTokens system in Mutuum Finance grows in value due to their functioning as interest-generating assets. Users who deposit ETH or DAI tokens receive equivalent mtETH or mtDAI tokens that generate yields while enabling smooth operations between DeFi platforms. The system provides passive income and complete liquidity features which resolve an important shortfall in decentralized lending systems. The platform allocates 20 percent of its revenue toward MUTM token repurchases to cause permanent market demand. Users who receive distributed tokens after repurchases have the ability to prevent token sell-offs thus stabilizing the long-term value. A considerable $100,000 prize giveaway program drives the protocol’s rapid expansion of loyal users. Presale Momentum Highlights Limited-Time Opportunity The initial pre-sale stage for Mutuum Finance achieved a total sellout within short time because investors showed significant interest in practical decentralized finance options. The price during Phase 2 stands at $0.015 as one of the last available buying opportunities before Mutuum Finance goes public on exchanges. Investors participating at present have the potential to achieve returns of above 300% when the project goes live while long-term targets point toward a probable $10 value. Although MUTM demonstrates structured growth through its planned rise it falls behind Dogecoin’s 3.5x annual gain performance point. The real-world financial applications Mutuum Finance utilizes make it delegate the volatile meme-driven performance of Dogecoin due to analyst predictions of sustained higher returns. Dogecoin’s potential ascent to $10 hinges on historical trends and speculative fervor, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a concrete alternative rooted in DeFi innovation. With its presale advancing rapidly and mechanisms designed to sustain demand, MUTM presents a time-sensitive opportunity for exponential gains. As the crypto market shifts toward utility-driven projects, early investors in Mutuum Finance may well eclipse those waiting for Dogecoin’s next meme-fueled peak.

Dogecoin Holders Pay Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/is-rcof-going-to-1-from-0-1-by-march-2025-dogecoin-holders-pay-attention/,"Dogecoin has dropped below $0.20 for the first time since November 2024, right before Trump’s re-election. Now, the memecoin is tumbling, leaving investors wondering how low the beloved memecoin can go. As whales rush to buy the dip, other investors are looking elsewhere for projects with real utility and high growth potential. Dogecoin holders are paying attention to RCO Finance (RCOF) , an emerging altcoin that analysts predict could soar from $0.1 to $1 by March 2025. With its cutting-edge trading tools and groundbreaking features, RCOF will be a game changer in crypto. Dogecoin (DOGE) Plunges 10%: How Low can the Memecoin go? At press time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing bearing momentum having dropped by 9.9% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.1882. In the past three days, Dogecoin (DOGE) whales have bought the dip, accumulating about 530 million tokens. From technical analysis, Dogecoin appears bearish but has been consolidating in a tight range near its crucial support of $0.175. Based on historical patterns, Dogecoin is still bearish and could drop further by 15%. The king of memecoins is trading below 200 EMA in the daily timeframe indicating a downtrend. Again, on-chain data shows that intraday derivatives signal traders have abandoned Dogecoin, witnessed by its dropping open interest. Since January 2025, Dogecoin’s open interest has fallen from $5.25 billion to $1.79 billion. This signals fading investor interest due to declining momentum and market volatility. With bearish momentum, Dogecoin holders are shifting focus to a utility altcoin, RCOF, which provides groundbreaking innovations. Similarly, analysts predict that the crypto could rise from its current price of $0.10 to $1 by March 2025. The rise of RCOF: Web3 project Attracting Dogecoin Holders As Dogecoin experiences bearish momentum, RCOF is drawing in traders to its presale at an astonishing rate. The altcoin offers real utility through its integration of AI and blockchain technology. As a result, analysts predict that the altcoin could surge from $0.1 to $1 in the next month. RCOF’s AI-powered Robo-advisor is its crown jewel. This smart tool crafts personalized investment strategies based on their unique profiles, giving them a great advantage in the financial markets. The Robo-advisor eliminates emotional bias by understanding market trends through data-driven insights. This smart tool helps investors properly control their investments in both TradFi and DeFi markets.

The Robo-advisor analyzes everything from on-chain analytics, whale activity, social sentiments, and real-time data to detect tokens about to skyrocket or crash. For instance, the LIBRA token went viral and pumped overnight, but as quickly as it rose, it plummeted, leading to a loss of $4.4 billion in investor funds. If investors had access to RCOF’s Robo-advisor, they would have caught in the bullish signals in advance and been able to exit before losing their funds. Unlike Dogecoin, RCOF offers investors over 120,000 tradable assets, including traditional, digital, and tokenized assets. With a leverage option of up to 1,000x on select assets, investors can reap big rewards from a small stake, enabling them to maximize returns.

The token now has a $166.49 billion market cap, more than 14% of Tether’s at $142.43 billion. XRP has surged by over 30% following President Donald Trump’s post on his social media platform, Truth Social. In his post, Trump claimed he directed the inclusion of the XRP token in the Crypto Strategic Reserve. The president‘s message seems to have ignited investor confidence in the token, driving buying activity. Source: Cryptorank Donald Trump says he directed the inclusion of XRP, SOL and ADA tokens in the Crypto Strategic Reserve As part of his plan to make the US the crypto capital of the world, Trump had previously suggested the institution of a national crypto reserve. This Sunday, Trump made further comments on his reserve plans on Truth Social, saying: A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. President Donald Trump Following his post, XRP jumped 32%, ADA grew 62%, and SOL rose by almost 25%. Meanwhile, BTC climbed 10% in the last 24 hours, trading above $91,000, breaking past $80,000 to the $84,000 range. ETH also crossed $2,400, increasing by 13%. Aside from these crypto gains, analysts believe Trump’s decision will continue to drive more bullish momentum in the market. Some have even suggested it could spur institutional and government adoption. Digital asset prices first started picking up on Friday when Trump announced the March 7 crypto summit. XRP could trade as high as $3.40 if its bullish rally persists The Price DAA Divergence metric suggests a buy on the XRP token as the asset price has risen along with investor participation. Moreover, the number of active addresses is up, which means that new traders are engaging with the asset. All of these point to growing investor confidence in XRP, which in turn could help drive its prices higher. In addition, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator shows that investors are still buying XRP, which could signal further price increases in the next few weeks. XRP is currently trading at $2.85 , poised to break through the $2.95 resistance and move further up to $3.00. Furthermore, analysts expect that if XRP is able to move above its resistance levels, it could trade as high as $3.40, which could attract more investors and buying pressure. However, if investors begin to cash out their gains early and the token’s momentum slows, the asset may fail to surpass its $2.95 resistance and dip to $2.70. If this happens, it may end its bullish rally temporarily before any more price movements surface. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Right now, SUI is facing a crucial moment as its price teeters on key resistance levels, while Astra is making waves with its explosive presale, securing over $1 million in its first day alone. These two projects are catching the eyes of community members, but the real star of the show might just be Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS) is shaping up to be one of the top crypto coins to buy now , thanks to its game-changing Web3 aggregator technology, non-custodial multi-chain wallet, and high-profile CertiK audit. Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics is built for real-world adoption, making cross-chain transactions seamless, secure, and efficient. With over 21,900 token holders already on board and a presale that has pulled in more than $14.4 million, Qubetics is proving it’s not just another hyped-up project—it’s a serious contender for the next breakout crypto. Qubetics: The Future of Secure and Interoperable Blockchain Transactions Blockchain fragmentation is a nightmare. Imagine trying to transfer assets across multiple blockchains, only to get hit with sky-high fees, slow transactions, and compatibility headaches. This is where Qubetics steps in, revolutionizing the industry as the world’s first Web3 aggregator. Qubetics’ interoperability features allow users to seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains without friction. It provides real-time asset transfers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. Whether you’re a developer building dApps, a business looking for secure cross-border transactions, or an individual managing multiple crypto assets, Qubetics simplifies the entire process. One of the major highlights of the Qubetics ecosystem is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. Unlike traditional wallets, which rely on centralized entities for asset storage, Qubetics gives users full control over their funds. It supports multiple blockchains, allowing users to manage assets across various networks without relying on third-party services. Think of it as the ultimate Web3 wallet—secure, decentralized, and built for the future. Qubetics Wallet and Blockchain Audit: A Game-Changer for Security Security is everything in crypto. Hacks, exploits, and rug pulls have left countless early buyers burned. This is why Qubetics has taken a proactive step by undergoing a comprehensive blockchain audit by CertiK, one of the most trusted security firms in the space. CertiK has audited some of the biggest projects in the industry, including Binance, Aave, Polygon, and PancakeSwap. Their deep-dive analysis of Qubetics’ smart contracts and wallet infrastructure ensures that the project meets the highest security standards. This not only boosts credibility but also instills confidence in the growing Qubetics community. With the audit nearing completion, analysts predict an even bigger surge in adoption as new participants recognize Qubetics as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics has also partnered with 1inch, a leading DeFi aggregator, to optimize decentralized trading for users. This integration connects Qubetics Wallet users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), providing the best possible rates, optimized liquidity, and seamless transactions. This partnership transforms Qubetics into more than just a wallet—it becomes a full-fledged trading hub for DeFi enthusiasts. Qubetics Presale: Limited-Time Opportunity for Exponential Gains With Stage 23 in full swing, the Qubetics presale has already raised $14.4 million, attracting over 21,900 holders and selling 493 million $TICS tokens. The current presale price is locked at $0.0888, but not for long—prices surge by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM as each presale stage lasts only 7 days. Those who move fast will secure the best possible entry price before Qubetics explodes onto the scene. Analyst predictions are fueling FOMO, with $0.25 expected by presale’s end (181.52% ROI). But the real action starts post-presale, with forecasts of $1 (1,026.09% ROI), $5 (5,530.44% ROI), and an astronomical $15 (16,791.32% ROI) after mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment now at $0.0888 could soar to $168,000 if TICS hits $15. Time is running out—will you be part of the next crypto giant? With a Q2 2025 mainnet launch already confirmed, this crypto presale is picking up serious momentum. The window to join one of the top crypto coins to buy now is closing fast. Astra Secures Over $1 Million in First 24 Hours of Presale Astra is making some serious noise in the crypto space, especially after securing over $1 million within the first 24 hours of its presale. As a project focused on decentralized applications and next-gen blockchain solutions, Astra is quickly positioning itself as a competitor in the race for Web3 dominance. The excitement surrounding Astra comes from its scalability and efficiency. The network is built to handle high transaction volumes without the congestion issues that plague older blockchains. Early buyers are eyeing Astra as a long-term hold, particularly as demand for scalable blockchain solutions grows. With the presale already gaining massive traction, Astra is proving to be a formidable player in the crypto market. However, its long-term success will depend on how well it delivers on its promises of scalability and decentralization. SUI Faces Critical Resistance as Market Uncertainty Grows SUI is at a crucial juncture as technical indicators show a struggle to maintain its current price levels. Recent chart patterns indicate a potential head-and-shoulders formation, which could signal a downturn if support levels don’t hold. Despite the volatility, SUI’s blockchain technology continues to attract attention. Designed for high-speed transactions and low fees, SUI aims to be one of the most scalable networks in the industry. But with uncertainty looming in the market, analysts are watching closely to see whether SUI can break past resistance or if it will experience further retracements. While the SUI ecosystem remains promising, short-term price action suggests caution. Some community members are holding strong, hoping for a breakout, but others are looking at alternatives like Qubetics, which offers real-world utility and lower risk of price instability. Conclusion: Is Qubetics the Best Crypto to Buy Right Now? The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities—Astra is crushing its presale, SUI is battling key resistance levels, but Qubetics stands out as one of the top crypto coins to buy now . Its CertiK audit, 1inch partnership, and multi-chain interoperability make it a strong contender for long-term adoption. With its Q2 2025 mainnet launch on the horizon and a crypto presale that’s gaining serious momentum, Qubetics offers a rare chance to get in early on a project with sky-high potential. If you’re looking for a crypto presale with massive upside, join the Qubetics presale today before the next price jump.

Per the media outlet El Colombiano , Senator Gustavo Moreno and Congress Representative Julián López have rolled out a bill seeking to create a legal framework that “protects” the country’s crypto users. Colombia: Crypto Regulations ‘Urgently Needed,’ Say Lawmakers Moreno noted that the lack of regulation means that crypto exchanges and other firms operate in a rules-free space that “generates uncertainty and risk for customers.” Colombian senators meet in the nation’s senate in 2024. The Senator added that the “lack of regulation” means there are no “protection mechanisms for consumers.” Moreno added that Colombia does not have any “control to prevent the misuse of cryptoassets.” Blockchain analysts claim that over five million Colombians now use crypto. They say that during 2024, citizens and residents of the country transacted some $6.7 billion worth of tokens. But critics claim that adoption has been soured by a rise in crypto scams and crypto-related pyramid schemes. Others claim that some Colombians are using the largely unregulated crypto industry to launder illicit funds. The nation’s top financial regulator, the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia (lit: Colombian Financial Superintendence), has been working on crypto-related pilots since 2021. However, the same media outlet noted that the Superintendencia’s pilots have not yet produced a “specific regulatory framework.” Such a framework would allow the Colombian crypto sector to “integrate with the national financial system,” the outlet wrote. The Colombian parliament building in Bogotá, Colombia. (Source: Bernard Gagnon [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Regulatory ‘Framework’ Bill The bill contains 16 clauses that cover monitoring, rules on marketing, education, crypto tax , and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures (AML/CFT). The lawmakers say that by “protecting users,” the law could also “encourage [crypto] investment” in the long term. “Colombia has fallen behind the rest of the world . While other countries are moving forward, [the industry here] remains unregulated. Our bill seeks to establish clear rules of the game. We want to generate a reliable and more attractive ecosystem for investment with built-in guarantees for this emerging industry.” Colombian lawmaker Julián López By appointing two trusted — but controversial — top aides to key cabinet posts, Gustavo Petro is trying a new tack to leave his mark on Colombia in the last 18 months of his presidency https://t.co/Fsntkmwbs4 — Bloomberg Economics (@economics) March 1, 2025 VASP Operating Permit System The bill seeks to introduce a licensing system for crypto operators, who would need to register as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). In other nations, VASP licensing systems are usually designed to force crypto exchanges and wallet firms to comply with AML/CFT protocols. The media outlet quoted the financial analyst Gregorio Gandini as stating that it was “important to regulate cryptocurrencies” because “they are becoming increasingly popular” in Colombia. He added: “If crypto is not regulated, [Colombians] will adopt them in an irregular manner.” Colombia's Petro to name Edwin Palma as new energy minister, source says https://t.co/SO2XPP52HR pic.twitter.com/3MODPLqnh1 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 27, 2025 However, the Colombian crypto investor Daniel Aguilar was quoted as stating that while it was important to provide a “safe framework” where firms could “grow and consolidate,” it was important “not to kill innovation with overly strict rules.” Aguilar said: “If regulation is too rigid, crypto companies and entrepreneurs could be forced to operate from other countries that have more flexible regulations. We need a legal framework that protects users without stifling the growth of the sector.” The investor also said that it was “important that cryptoassets are taxed reasonably.” Aguilar said lawmakers should avoid “creating tax burdens that discourage” crypto adoption in Colombia.

As new opportunities emerge, investors are keeping an eye on promising meme coins. With trends shifting fast, staying ahead of the curve is crucial. One of the most anticipated launches is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), a meme coin presale unlike any other. Meanwhile, Peanut the Squirrel and Dog (Bitcoin) are also making waves in the market. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins. Token Burns: How Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) Maximizes Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has integrated an aggressive burn mechanism to enhance scarcity and drive long-term value. Every week, unsold tokens from the ongoing meme coin presale are permanently removed from circulation. But the burning doesn’t stop there—any remaining tokens post-presale will also be eliminated, ensuring a deflationary environment that benefits early adopters. This process, recorded transparently on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), increases the coin’s desirability by reducing supply. The continuous token burns create an ever-dwindling supply, driving demand and potentially amplifying future returns. With a strategic and verifiable burn mechanism, Arctic Pablo Coin positions itself as one of the best new meme coin to join now. Penguinopolis Beckons – Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Is Moving Fast! Arctic Pablo Coin is unlike any other meme coin presale—it follows an adventurous storyline where each presale phase represents a new location. Currently, Arctic Pablo has reached Penguinopolis, the 12th stop on its journey. Investors are racing to get in at the current price of just $0.000067, as this phase offers a jaw-dropping potential ROI of 11,844.78% from now until the launch price of $0.008. Previously, Arctic Pablo Coin stormed through Blizzard Bay in under six days, finishing all ten prior locations ahead of schedule. With over $1.69 million already raised, demand is soaring, and each new location sees prices climb. This could be the last chance to enter at a bargain before the next milestone! Peanut the Squirrel’s Big Move – Latest Developments Peanut the Squirrel has taken center stage after securing a major exchange listing that catapulted its trading volume overnight. With increased liquidity and broader accessibility, investors are flocking to this quirky yet high-potential meme coin. Adding to the excitement, Peanut the Squirrel announced a new staking program, offering double-digit APYs for long-term holders. The project’s innovative approach and strong community backing continue to fuel speculation about its future price trajectory. Dog (Bitcoin) – A New Surge in Activity Dog (Bitcoin) has seen a remarkable resurgence as whale transactions hit record levels. Analysts suggest that this heightened activity could be linked to rumors of an upcoming partnership with a major blockchain platform. Meanwhile, the team behind Dog (Bitcoin) has been teasing an exclusive NFT drop, sparking excitement among collectors and traders alike. As momentum builds, many are watching closely to see if Dog (Bitcoin) can sustain this newfound traction. Final Thoughts – Which Coin Stands Out? With meme coins dominating the market, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) stands out as the most thrilling investment right now. Its deflationary burn mechanism, innovative presale structure, and rapidly increasing price make it a strong contender for high returns. Peanut the Squirrel and Dog (Bitcoin) are also making headlines, but Arctic Pablo’s journey through Penguinopolis is drawing the most attention. As prices continue to rise, now is the perfect moment to secure a spot in this groundbreaking meme coin presale.

Web3Bay, Helium, or Dogecoin?",https://thecoinrise.com/which-is-the-best-crypto-investment-for-2025-web3bay-helium-or-dogecoin/,"The crypto market is continuously transforming, drawing investors towards the best crypto investment in 2025. While the well-established Dogecoin (DOGE) and Helium (HNT) have secured dedicated user bases, Web3Bay (3BAY) is quickly rising as the leading candidate with its innovative decentralized e-commerce framework and a striking 3,633% ROI possibility. While Dogecoin is known for its memetic charm and Helium specializes in decentralized connectivity, Web3Bay is innovating e-commerce with actual applicability, governed by its community, and propelled by investor incentives. Its presale has already amassed over $1.60 million, with more than 390 million tokens distributed, signaling Web3Bay as a burgeoning high-growth investment. Let’s explore how these three cryptocurrencies compare, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses, and why Web3Bay presents the best blend of immediate and long-term growth prospects. Dogecoin (DOGE): Widely Used, but Functionally Limited Originating as a playful meme, Dogecoin swiftly climbed the ranks to become a globally recognized cryptocurrency, bolstered by community support and celebrity endorsements, including Elon Musk. It is popularly used for tipping and smaller transactions, even accepted by companies like Tesla and AMC for payments. Strengths of Dogecoin: Broad Adoption: Accepted widely, including by significant retailers for transactions. Economical Transactions: Faster and more cost-effective than transactions with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Vigorous Community: Continues to be highly engaged within the crypto community. Weaknesses of Dogecoin: Limited Technological Advancement: Lacks functionalities like smart contracts, remaining a simple transactional token. Market-Driven Volatility: Its value is heavily influenced by social media and celebrity commentary. Sparse Institutional Interest: It doesn’t attract institutional investors like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Dogecoin, despite its popularity, remains an asset driven more by speculation than utility, with no significant tech advancements on the horizon. Helium (HNT): Innovative Technology Facing Adoption Challenges Helium has introduced a decentralized network providing connectivity for IoT devices, where users earn HNT tokens by operating Hotspots. However, its value has significantly dropped, now trading more than 90% below its peak as it transitions its blockchain base to Solana. Strengths of Helium: Practical Application: Provides decentralized connectivity, a significant technical leap forward. Corporate Partnerships: Collaborates with major firms like T-Mobile to broaden its 5G network. Income Through Participation: Owners of Hotspots earn by expanding network coverage. Weaknesses of Helium: Falling Demand: Struggles with network expansion and user adoption. Initial Setup Investment: High costs associated with starting a Helium Hotspot. Blockchain Transition Concerns: Its move to Solana has stirred stability and reliability worries. Although Helium’s concept is pioneering, its slow adoption rate and declining price point to a higher-risk investment scenario compared to alternatives like Web3Bay. Web3Bay (3BAY): The Best Crypto Investment for 2025 Presale Raised: $1.60M+ | Tokens Sold: 390M+ | Current Price: $0.0052 In contrast to Dogecoin and Helium, Web3Bay addresses the trillion-dollar inefficiency in traditional e-commerce. By cutting out intermediaries, Web3Bay establishes a fully decentralized online marketplace, enhancing user control over transactions, pricing, and governance of the platform. Why Web3Bay is the Best Crypto Investment Opportunity: Unprecedented Presale Success Web3Bay has already amassed over $1.60 million and distributed over 390 million tokens. Each stage of the presale quickly sells out, with imminent price increases. Early investors are in a prime position for potential returns of up to 3,633% following the launch. Tangible Real-World Application Web3Bay transcends the typical speculative token by offering a practical utility. Participants can engage in buying and selling digital assets free from excessive platform fees or corporate meddling. Its decentralized market structure promotes equitable and transparent transactions. Governance Powered by the Community Distinct from Helium and Dogecoin, Web3Bay grants its token holders the right to influence platform decisions. Following the distribution of all non-team tokens, Web3Bay intends to transfer ownership of the contract, achieving complete decentralization. Token holders do more than invest; they play an integral role in steering the platform’s future. Rewards Through Staking and Incentives Web3Bay compensates its token holders with earnings from staking, discounts on transactions, and exclusive benefits on the platform. 3BAY tokens offer a means to earn passive income, contributing to the ecosystem’s expansion and robustness. Identifying the Best Crypto Investment? The comparison underscores Web3Bay as a standout for 2025. Dogecoin, while popular, is limited by its speculative nature and lack of functional utility. Helium faces hurdles with its ecosystem’s growth and a concerning blockchain transition. In contrast, Web3Bay’s robust presale success, tangible e-commerce utility, and participatory governance framework highlight it as the best crypto investment right now . Investors aiming for both immediate returns and sustained growth should consider Web3Bay’s upcoming presale stages. With over $1.60 million already secured and a potential 3,633% ROI, missing out on this opportunity could be a significant oversight.

While making the announcement, the President said the Crypto Strategic Reserve is meant to strengthen the crypto industry, which he claims was weakened under the previous administration. Upon announcement, XRP, SOL, and ADA steamed to impressive price pulls, which triggered direct market reciprocations. XRP is up 37%, SOL has increased by 23%, and ADA has soared 68%. Bitcoin Advocates are not happy with the reserve’s composition Samson Mow wrote on his X that Bitcoin might be up, but it’s a sad day for America if they actually shitcoin at a nation-state level. He added that he wasn’t surprised, though, with Trump having launched a meme coin. Critics accused Trump of being swayed by some corporate-backed cryptocurrencies, which they claim oppose the spirit of decentralization. The list of those cryptocurrencies, which includes XRP, Solana, and Cardano, was called misleading. They cautioned that it could mislead investors and that this counsel could divert their focus from Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. Some financial analysts said that a national crypto reserve could become an indicator of skepticism about the long-term viability of the U.S. dollar. The rationale is that the government would inadvertently endanger faith in the real financial system by having a basket of digital assets in the national reserves. Others cautioned that targeting specific cryptocurrencies could create legal and regulatory migraines for the FTX Group, particularly since many digital assets have been the subject of debate about whether they should be classified as securities. However, as complaints mounted, the reserve advocates defended their action, arguing that support for and inclusion of a diverse set of cryptocurrencies would stimulate greater innovation across the blockchain ecosystem. They said that while Bitcoin dominated, it was not exclusive, and a broader variety of tokens could facilitate a more dynamic and adaptable future of finance. Trump’s announcement might be more political than economic Beyond its economic implications, several political analysts view Trump’s announcement as a bid to court crypto investors, developers, and entrepreneurs as part of a broader campaign plan. They said that as the crypto industry matures and grows into a powerful political and financial bloc, opposition to the rising tide of crypto is alienating voters on some level. If Trump can convince voters that he is a pro-crypto leader, he will garner votes from a base group frustrated by and fighting against recent regulatory action targeting digital assets. Yet, Bitcoin community members were not convinced by the political motives of what they considered a grassroots initiative. They argued that the reserve’s structure looked less like a carefully constructed economic policy and more like it was trying to buy certain blockchain communities’ goodwill. Others see the move as improving the options for Treasury Reserves and point out that Texas is one of the states most active with Bitcoin at the level of the states, so it shouldn’t be a stretch to make the case that Bitcoin should be the closer target cryptocurrency to be included in Treasury holdings. The contrast between the multi-asset approach of the federal government and the Bitcoin-only strategy embraced by certain states reflects deeper ideological divinations in the U.S. cryptocurrency space. In working to propose the White House Crypto Summit, the Trump administration has expressed interest in discussing digital asset national financial policy with leading policymakers and industry figures. Whether the Crypto Strategic Reserve is a permanent policy or a political manoeuvre relative to the current political moment remains unclear. The plan has provoked strong sentiment from other parts of the financial community — Bitcoin maximalists don’t like it, advocates of so-called altcoins embrace it, and critics say it’s a terrible idea whose long-term fatigue will eventually become apparent. While debate rages, one thing is sure: the role of cryptocurrency in U.S. financial policy is changing quickly. Whether the Crypto Strategic Reserve is a laudable leap toward innovation or a harebrained economic experiment will take some time to determine; how the fund is implemented, regulated, and welcomed by the marketplace and lawmakers will be a deciding factor.

However, several bottlenecks stand in the way of a swift resolution for the Ripple SEC Case but there appears a way out for both parties. An Injunction By Judge Torres Complicates Matters For Both Parties According to a post by Attorney Jeremy Hogan, the delay in bringing the Ripple SEC case to a close lies with an injunction imposed by Judge Analisa Torres. In her landmark judgment, District Judge Torres previously restrained Ripple Labs from selling securities to the public subject to certain conditions. The presence of the injunction could hurt Ripple Lab’s chances of proceeding with an IPO in the future, a position that appears unacceptable to the firm. Hogan says Ripple Labs’ attempt to ask the court to disregard the injunction is the primary source of delay for a dismissal. “How do you dissolve an injunction?” read Hogan’s X post. “It’s not simple, which is why I think the case doesn’t resolve until April-May whereas all these other cases have already been dismissed.” The Commission’s dismissals of Coinbase’s case and shuttering enforcement action against Gemini have triggered speculation that the end is in sight for the Ripple SEC case. A Way Out For The Ripple SEC Case Asking the court to ignore its injunction because the parties have settled is an uphill task in the Ripple SEC Case. Rule 60 of the Federal Rules makes provision for relief for a judgment in special circumstances in light of new facts or errors. However, the injunction hinges on the Howey test, a longstanding US Supreme Court Law, making it difficult for the court to set aside the injunction. Hogan notes that if Ripple Labs can present a powerful argument for the court, the judge may use her discretion to set aside the injunction. Following a closed-door meeting with the SEC , Ripple Labs is in the endgame of its legal battle with the security watchdog. “Ripple only has one shot at getting the injunction dissolved with the trial court so it will have to draft a very carefully worded motion,” said Hogan. “That takes time and the SEC will basically have to sign off on it – more complication. Hogan predicts that parties will dismiss their appeals in April, effectively bringing an end to the drawn-out legal saga in May.

Enter Web3Bay —a pioneering decentralized e-commerce platform that has quickly garnered investor interest with its $1.58 million presale achievement, selling 390 million tokens, and creating an ecosystem aimed at addressing real-world challenges. While many projects momentarily capture public interest, Web3Bay remains dedicated to a more sustainable objective: transforming the dynamics of digital buying, selling, and interaction. By removing intermediaries, boosting transaction transparency, and empowering its user community, Web3Bay distinguishes itself not merely as another digital currency, but as a revolutionary solution within the blockchain domain. What Is Web3Bay? Crafting the Marketplace of Tomorrow Web3Bay is more than just another crypto project; it is a decentralized e-commerce platform, rooted in blockchain technology, that seeks to rectify the inefficiencies and privacy issues prevalent in conventional online marketplaces. In typical centralized platforms, intermediaries hold sway over user data, levy substantial transaction fees, and often expose buyers and sellers to fraud. Web3Bay offers a new narrative. Utilizing smart contracts and decentralized data storage, it enables users to conduct transactions directly, ensuring both security and privacy. Buyers benefit from clear transaction histories, while sellers enjoy quicker payment processes and reduced fees—a critical advantage in a digital economy where trust and operational efficiency are key. Why It Matters With global e-commerce expected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030, there is a pressing need for platforms that emphasize transparency, user control, and cost-effectiveness. Web3Bay is strategically positioning itself at the nexus of these requirements, providing a marketplace that appeals to both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and the general market. Presale Success: Over $1.58 Million Raised and Counting In the crypto world, tangible results speak volumes, and Web3Bay’s presale figures are particularly telling. The project has swiftly raised over $1.58 million and sold more than 390 million tokens, signaling strong investor confidence and endorsement of its vision. Spread across 28 stages, the presale offers escalating token prices to early supporters. With several stages already completed, the demand for Web3Bay continues to grow. This enthusiasm is not merely about potential—it’s a clear indicator of the platform’s practical applicability and the market’s appetite for decentralized solutions. Why Investors Are Excited Those who join early are not merely purchasing a token; they are investing in a thriving ecosystem. With an anticipated ROI of 4,200% at launch, Web3Bay presents a unique blend of speculative potential and tangible application, a combination seldom seen in the current market landscape. Key Features That Distinguish Web3Bay Decentralized Governance A key aspect of Web3Bay is its dedication to community-led governance. Token holders actively participate in key decision-making processes, influencing everything from transaction fees to new feature implementations. This model isn’t just about embracing decentralization; it’s about fostering a marketplace that evolves to meet the actual needs of its users, free from centralized control. Real-World Utility Beyond Speculation While numerous crypto projects are primarily concerned with market speculation, Web3Bay provides concrete benefits: Reduced Transaction Fees : Traditional marketplace fees are a thing of the past. Accelerated Payments : Sellers receive funds promptly. Enhanced Privacy : Users maintain ownership of their data thanks to decentralized storage. Staking & User Incentives Web3Bay extends beyond mere transactions. By staking their tokens, users can generate passive income, enhancing the value proposition for long-term holders. Additionally, those who use Web3Bay’s token for purchases receive discounts, further promoting platform adoption. Commitment to Full Decentralization Unlike some platforms that maintain some degree of control, Web3Bay commits to full decentralization by relinquishing control of its smart contract post-presale, ensuring no single party can alter the system, thereby bolstering trust and decentralization. Why Web3Bay Could Dominate in 2025 While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum often steal the spotlight, Web3Bay is securing its niche by addressing a specific, pressing need—secure, efficient, and user-friendly e-commerce. Its practical utility, coupled with robust presale performance and a dedicated community, positions it as a project with both immediate impact potential and sustainable viability. For investors scouting for the top cryptocurrency to watch, factors like utility, potential for adoption, and community involvement are paramount—and Web3Bay meets all these criteria. As e-commerce continues to grow and consumer preferences increasingly lean towards platforms that offer privacy and cost reductions, Web3Bay is not just capitalizing on current trends—it’s laying the groundwork for the future of online commerce. Which Is the Top Cryptocurrency to Watch? Web3Bay’s $1.58 million presale success, the sale of 390 million tokens, and the projected 4,200% ROI at launch, underscore a well-founded investor enthusiasm. But the real appeal lies beyond impressive metrics. By addressing the fundamental flaws of centralized e-commerce systems and returning control to users, Web3Bay is redefining the standards for decentralized marketplaces. Whether you’re an experienced investor chasing high-growth prospects or a newcomer eager to engage with a project of genuine relevance, Web3Bay stands out as a top cryptocurrency to watch —and invest in—this year. With presale stages rapidly selling out and market momentum escalating, the opportunity to get involved early is swiftly narrowing.

While mainstream crypto assets dominate the headlines, market analysts have identified a handful of hidden altcoins as the best cryptos to buy in the US. These under-the-radar digital assets boast strong fundamentals, innovative use cases, and increasing adoption, positioning them as the best cryptos to buy in the US for explosive gains in 2025. In this article, we’ll reveal three under-the-radar altcoins that are set to be the best cryptos to buy in the US in 2025. With unique technology, solid development teams, and strong market potential, these digital assets are PropiChain (PCHAIN), Solaxy (SOLX), and Meme Index (MIND). Whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started, these best cryptos to buy in the US could be your next big win in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. 3 Best Cryotos To Buy In The US In 2025 This list of best cryptos to buy in the US has been carefully researched based on their solid fundamentals, unique value proposition, and high-growth potential. 3. Meme Index ($MIND): Innovating Meme-Based Investments Occupying the number 3 spot on our list of best cryptos to buy in the US is the Meme Index ($MIND). The token introduces a novel approach to the meme coin phenomenon by creating a decentralized index that tracks the performance of various meme-based crypto assets. The Meme Index value proposition allows investors to gain diversified exposure to the over $120 billion meme coin market without individually managing multiple assets. The Meme Index operates through a smart contract that automatically adjusts the index composition based on the performance and volatility of the included tokens. This dynamic rebalancing ensures that the index remains representative of the current memecoin landscape, providing investors an efficient way to participate in this high-risk, high-reward sector. The $MIND token is positioned to capture a significant share of the memecoin market, a good buy for early investors. 2. Solaxy (SOLX): Revolutionizing Blockchain Efficiency Taking the number 2 spot on this list of best cryptos to buy in the US is Solaxy (SOLX), an emerging altcoin designed to address the scalability challenges faced by existing blockchain networks. Solaxy implements advanced consensus algorithms and optimizes data structures to enhance transaction speeds and reduce network congestion. This focus on efficiency positions Solaxy as a viable solution for decentralized applications (dApps) requiring high throughput and low latency. The network employs energy-efficient protocols that minimize environmental impact, aligning with the growing demand for eco-friendly blockchain solutions. Additionally, Solaxy’s developer-friendly environment encourages innovation, attracting projects that contribute to a robust and diverse ecosystem. 1. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Powering the Future of the $600 Trillion Global Real Estate The number one on our list of best cryptos to buy in the US is PropiChain, a blockchain-based real-estate tokenization platform that bridges the gap between the $600 trillion global real estate market and blockchain technology. PCHAIN is the utility token of PropiChain, an altcoin designed to give investors early access to the future of the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market. PropiChain is poised to capture 1% of the global real estate market share, a staggering $6 trillion, positioning the altcoin for a massive rally in the coming months. Leading market analysts strongly believe that PropiChain will outperform other assets on this list of best cryptos to buy in the US. Its value proposition to revolutionize the global real estate market is set to spark a chain reaction that could propel the token to historic heights in the coming months. Why PropiChain Leads The List of Best Cryptos To Buy In The US PropiChain is transforming real estate investment using innovative technologies such as the Metaverse, blockchain smart contracts, artificial intelligence, and real-world asset tokenization. By integrating the Metaverse technology, the platform enables investors to bypass traditional barriers like logistical challenges and high travel costs associated with property visits. With immersive 3D technology, users can explore properties worldwide from the comfort of their homes. For example, a potential investor in Singapore can virtually walk through a luxury beachfront villa in the Maldives or inspect a high-rise building in Kuala Lumpur without leaving home. Beyond virtual property tours, the Metaverse enhances global real estate transactions by facilitating seamless interactions between buyers and sellers. Additionally, PropiChain harnesses smart contracts to automate essential real estate processes such as lease agreements and rental payments. This approach eliminates reliance on middlemen like brokers and agents. The automation reduces costs while ensuring transparency, efficiency, and security for investors and property owners alike. PropiChain also integrates AI-powered tools, including virtual assistants and chatbots, to provide real-time support for real estate investors. These AI solutions help investors navigate the complex real estate market. Additionally, PropiChain employs predictive analytics to identify emerging opportunities, allowing investors to stay ahead of market shifts and optimize their portfolios for maximum returns. One of the platform’s most groundbreaking features is blockchain-based real estate tokenization. By converting real estate assets into digital tokens, PropiChain enables fractional property ownership, making high-value real estate investments more accessible to a broader audience. This approach disrupts traditional investment models, democratizing access to lucrative opportunities and fostering a more inclusive, decentralized, and dynamic real estate market. Pchain Presale: A Life-Changing Opportunity For Early Investors As the crypto market matures, hidden gems like PropiChain, Solaxy, and Meme Index offer unique value propositions that set them apart as the best cryptos to buy in the US. However, market experts have singled out the ongoing PCHAIN presale as the ideal opportunity for massive gains, linking its trajectory to the early days of Dogecoin. The presale is already in its second stage and has raised over $2.5 million cumulatively. Priced at $0.01, the token price will rise to $0.023 for the next presale round. Market experts say your $1000 investment in the presale could yield over $487,600 by the end of Q2 2025. Join the presale now to enjoy massive gains. The PCHAIN token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a bold move by the project to increase its accessibility and visibility to potential investors. Additionally, BlockAudit , a top blockchain security company, audited the project’s smart contract and found no vulnerability.

The news sent the bears packing, liquidating $160 million in Bitcoin shorts in the process, per data from Coinglass. In his announcement, which was made via Truth Social as usual, president Trump said: “My Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA. I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” Trump first shared the idea for a Bitcoin national reserve at the Nashville Bitcoin Conference in July 2024, though at the time, he only mentioned Bitcoin. It was also during this conference that he started calling himself the ‘crypto president.’ Bitcoin hits $94K, and altcoins get a bump too After the announcement, Bitcoin’s price surged by over 10% in 24 hours, reclaiming $94,000. Ethereum followed with an 11% spike, reaching $2,500. Solana saw an increase of 20% to $169, while XRP surged by 30% to $2.80. Cardano saw the biggest increase, rallying 60% to $1.02, per data from CoinGecko. This rally comes after weeks of losses. Bitcoin, which started the year at $109,000, had dropped below $80,000 last week after a wave of risk asset selloffs and a security breach at Bybit that saw nearly $1.5 billion stolen. Meanwhile, Trump has announced that he is gonna host the first-ever White House Crypto Summit on Friday, with a mission to bring together top executives, investors, and blockchain founders like Gemini’s Winklevoss twins, Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong, Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, and Cardano’s Charlie Hoskinson. The event comes as investors and analysts speculate how the US Crypto Reserve will be funded. One option is using the government’s massive Bitcoin stash—more than 180,000 BTC worth $18 billion—seized from cybercriminals and darknet markets. Historically, these assets have been auctioned off, with proceeds going to victims and government expenses. It remains unclear if the administration will hold onto these coins or accumulate more. After the Sunday announcement, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks (who has been investing in Bitcoin since 2011), shared that: “President Trump has announced a Crypto Strategic Reserve consisting of Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies. This is consistent with his week-one E.O. 14178. President Trump is keeping his promise to make the U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the World.” More to come at the Summit.” Arthur Hyayes, BitMEX’s infamous founder (who has been trading crypto since 2009), commented on David’s statement to say : “Nothing new here. Just words. Lmk when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that they have no money to buy Bitcoin and shitcoins.” Peter Schiff, a longtime Bitcoin critic, questioned why altcoins are even included at all. “I get the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve,” Peter wrote. “I don’t agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold. So let’s create a Bitcoin reserve too. But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

From dog-themed legends to frog-fuelled riches, these coins prove that community hype and viral appeal can send prices sky-high. But if you missed out on some of the biggest meme coin explosions of the past, don’t sweat it. Today, three top contenders could be the next big thing: BTFD Coin, Sudeng, and Cheems. Whether you’re into play-to-earn (P2E) rewards, quirky branding, or just want to ride the next hilarious wave, these meme coins offer something special. Right now, BTFD Coin is making waves with its presale, having already raised over $6.21 million. This article will break down why its P2E game is drawing major attention, alongside Sudeng’s unique appeal and Cheems’ unbeatable meme energy. Here’s a pro tip before you go any further: every BTFD Coin purchase during Stage 14 is DOUBLED if you use the bonus code LAUNCH100 . That’s right—double your tokens instantly. With that out of the way, read on to find out why these are the best new meme coins to join now! BTFD Coin: A P2E Beast Preparing for Takeoff! Gaming + Memes + Rewards = A Winning Combo. That’s the formula behind BTFD Coin’s explosive success. At its core, BTFD is an ecosystem built to reward players and investors alike. With its P2E game, users can earn BTFD tokens just by playing, making every game session potentially profitable. Imagine this: You’re grinding through an epic boss battle in the BTFD P2E game . Your character has just collected 100,000 in-game coins. You exchange them for BTFD tokens and bam! You’ve just stacked up your crypto portfolio without even checking the charts. Now, say those tokens hit their predicted post-listing price of $0.0006 or even a moonshot of $0.006. That’s potentially 3650% ROI on coins you earned while gaming! On top of that, BTFD Coin’s presale is moving fast. It’s currently in Stage 14, and with only two stages left, the clock is ticking.

Ethereum-Based Security: Built on the Ethereum blockchain for scalability and security. Sudeng: The Sui-Based Meme Coin Backed by an Internet-Famous Baby Hippo Sudeng (HIPPO) is a meme coin on the Sui blockchain, inspired by Moo Deng, a baby pygmy hippo born on July 10, 2024, at Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo. With Sudeng’s official partnership with the zoo, a portion of its profits supports wildlife conservation, making it more than just another meme coin. Unlike similar tokens like MOODENG on Solana, Sudeng leverages Sui’s ultra-fast, low-cost transactions, powered by its Narwhal-Bullshark consensus mechanism. This makes trading HIPPO cheaper and more efficient compared to Ethereum-based meme coins. Launched in October 2024, Sudeng has quickly gained traction, securing listings on Bybit and DEX Screener, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. By October 30, it had a market cap of $85.56 million, ranking as the fifth-largest Sui-based crypto, proving that Moo Deng’s charm extends far beyond viral videos. Cheems: The Meme Legend Making a Comeback If you’ve been around meme coin culture, you already know Cheems. This lovable dog with his signature speech style has been a staple in internet culture for years, and now, his token is making a serious comeback. What makes Cheems stand out? It’s pure, unfiltered meme magic. The coin’s branding leans into nostalgia, attracting both seasoned crypto traders and newer investors who just want to be part of the next hilarious pump. Key Features of Cheems Massive Social Engagement: One of the most active meme communities online. Cross-Chain Compatibility: Expanding beyond Ethereum for multi-chain access.

With a presale drive that exceeds the pace of mainstream altcoin drops, MUTM is currently trading at $0. 015. With a roadmap that sees a 33. 3% increase to $0. 02 in the next presale phase, a return is immediate for those who invest now. Analysts predict a 300% return at its $0. 06 exchange listing—not speculative mania but transparent tokenomics. Post-launch, estimates put MUTM at $8 to $12 by 2025, fueled by its utility-based lending platform and its buy-back strategies. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating toward the end of its second presale stage amid growing demand. With more than $2 million raised in the first phase, investors clearly trust the decentralized lending platform. It trades now at $0. 015, the lowest level before the next stage drives the token to $0. 02—a 33.3% increase that early investors will surely profit from in plenty. With less than 20% of tokens left in this stage, time to secure MUTM at basement prices is running out. The tokenomics of the project is based on exponential growth. Scarcity is created by limited supply and buy-and-distribute mechanism on time, and profits from the platforms recycle back into buying MUTM from open markets. This creates constant buying pressure, protecting the token from sudden sell-offs. MUTM’s launch price of $0. 06 will guarantee presale investors a 4x return, but analysts who have followed its peer-to-peer lending adoption and mtToken adoption predict it to reach $9. 50 by mid-2025, a sharp increase from current prices. Customers deposit ETH, stablecoins or other funds and receive interest-bearing mtTokens whose value appreciates over time and are easily transferable between DeFi platforms. Loaners receive liquidity in the form of overcollateralized borrowing that secures lenders. The two-way system also generates a steady stream of platform revenue that goes straight into MUTM’s buy-back reserve. Unlike Dogecoin’s community-powered surge, MUTM growth is accompanied by user activity—a self-sustaining dynamic that meme coins lack. Mutuum Finance Edge Since SOL and ADA can’t be used in advanced dApps, MUTM’s niche in the expert market makes it eligible to target serious users who need passive gains and liquidity. The numbers speak for themselves: if MUTM reaches $9. 50, an investment of $500 today could grow to $31, 500—a life-changing return that’s far greater than typical SOL or ADA gains. With presale demand catapulting the project into rapid phase shifts, MUTM appears poised to follow the trajectory of early Ethereum (ETH) or Binance Coin breakouts before their multi-thousand percent surges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seeks to redefine DeFi’s utility by combining lending utility with investor incentives. Signs of its presale success—$2 million raised, 3800 holders, and a pending 33. 3% price increase—point to a project poised for vertical ascent. While Dogecoin chases its speculative highs and Solana struggles with technical glitches, MUTM’s disciplined approach gives you a linear path to 31268% gains.

Inside the Crypto Upstart’s Trillion-Dollar Quest!,https://thecoinrise.com/is-web3bay-the-next-amazon-inside-the-crypto-upstarts-trillion-dollar-quest/,"The next online revolution isn’t waiting in the wings—it’s happening now with Web3Bay, the crypto initiative taking the $8 trillion e-commerce industry by storm. With a $1.58 million presale record and $200K from whale investments in just a day, Web3Bay is more than just a trend—it’s a transformative force ready to reshape how we shop online. Web3Bay introduces a groundbreaking approach: decentralizing e-commerce. Imagine a platform that merges Amazon’s extensive market with Bitcoin’s decentralized spirit, offering lower fees, quicker transactions, and no invasive data collection. With growing distrust in traditional platforms, Web3Bay isn’t just a fresh option—it’s the obvious next step for online commerce. Legacy Giants: High Profits, High Costs? For years, platforms like Amazon and eBay have dominated online shopping, securing trillions in revenue at the cost of high fees, privacy breaches, and limited market diversity. Sellers forfeit up to 15% on sales, buyers deal with hidden fees, and everyone grapples with unclear policies. However, history is littered with disruptors: Uber revolutionized the taxi industry with a decentralized network of drivers. Airbnb transformed hospitality by empowering homeowners and providing travelers with affordable accommodations. Spotify reshaped music distribution , phasing out traditional CD sales. Each of these innovators democratized access to their services, and now, Web3Bay aims to democratize e-commerce using blockchain technology. Why Web3Bay’s Timing Is Impeccable The timing is critical, and Web3Bay’s launch aligns perfectly with several global trends: Relentless growth in e-commerce, expected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030. Heightened data privacy concerns, with users wary of being exploited. Increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Couple rising transaction fees and the centralized control of conventional platforms, and it’s clear the market is ripe for an alternative. Web3Bay enters at the perfect moment, promising direct transactions, community-led governance, and no middleman interference. Investors Are Taking Notice—And You Should Too Here’s the exciting part: Web3Bay tokens are currently priced at just $0.005247. By launch, they’re projected to soar to $0.1959, delivering a staggering 3,633% ROI for those who get in early. Invest $1,000 now for about 190,560 tokens. At launch: these tokens could be worth up to $37,336.64. That’s a 36x return, potentially outperforming Bitcoin’s early days or Ethereum’s epic rise in 2017. And if Web3Bay grabs even a slice of the trillion-dollar e-commerce market, these gains could just be the beginning. Why Whales Are Going All-In Crypto whales are strategic investors, not gamblers. Their $200K investment in 24 hours signals a calculated move for huge potential returns. They’re positioning themselves for the expected explosive growth, setting the stage for massive gains. Web3Bay stands out not just for its impressive presale but for its sustainable model: Real utility : Addressing genuine inefficiencies in online shopping. Community governance : Investors have a real say in the platform’s direction. Passive income through staking : More than just holding a token, it’s earning from it. A privacy-first model : Ending the era of selling user data to marketers. Long-Term ROI: Sky-High Potential or Just Hype? Let’s speculate: if Web3Bay captures just 0.01% of the global e-commerce market, that equates to $800 million in transactions. This demand could push the token price well beyond the initial projections. Conservative 2-year estimate : $0.50 per token, nearly 95x ROI from the presale. Optimistic 5-year forecast : $2 per token, around 381x ROI—turning $1,000 into $381,000. Ambitious? Certainly. Unachievable? Far from it, especially when considering whale strategies and the looming retail investor FOMO as the media spotlight intensifies. Redefining Online Shopping With Web3Bay Envision accessing Web3Bay to purchase digital art, concert tickets, or even tangible items—without hefty fees or privacy concerns. Transactions are lightning-fast. No intermediaries. No data breaches. Simply pure, decentralized commerce. As its use expands, so do the opportunities: 💳 Global merchant adoption—from solo artists to major commercial enterprises. 🎟️ Revolutionizing event ticketing—minimizing fraud and eliminating scalping. 🏠 Peer-to-peer rentals and services—challenging established platforms like Airbnb or Fiverr. Web3Bay isn’t merely entering the e-commerce field—it’s charging through the gates with blockchain technology and a commitment to prioritizing users. Web3Bay: The Next Amazon of Web3? E-commerce transformed retail by offering unparalleled convenience. Web3Bay aims to transform trust in online transactions. With its robust presale, significant whale backing, and a platform that prioritizes user interests, Web3Bay is not just participating in the e-commerce market—it’s leading a charge. Is there risk? Inevitably. But in the world of crypto, where risk parallels reward, Web3Bay represents a compelling opportunity—especially for those poised to invest before the broader market catches on. Will Web3Bay fulfill its promise? The signs are promising, and the investment community believes it will.

Qubetics is the Next Big Crypto to Explode—Here’s Why You Can’t Afford to Overlook It,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-vechain-qubetics-is-the-next-big-crypto-to-explode-heres-why-you-cant-afford-to-overlook-it/,"The crypto world moves fast—blink, and an opportunity is gone. Anyone who’s been around long enough remembers when Bitcoin was just a couple of bucks or when Ethereum was considered an experimental project. Vechain? That ship has sailed. While it remains a strong contender in blockchain supply chain solutions, the days of life-changing gains from early investment are over. But here’s the kicker—there’s another project still under the radar, and it’s got all the right ingredients to be the next big crypto to explode. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another name in the sea of blockchain startups. It’s tackling real-world financial inefficiencies head-on, especially in cross-border transactions. With its presale in the 24th stage and over 493 million tokens already sold to 21,900+ holders, raising over $14.4 million, it’s clear that momentum is building. At just $0.0976 per token, this is a rare chance to get in before the world catches on. Vechain Was Game-Changer – But It’s Too Late Now Vechain made waves in the crypto space by revolutionizing supply chain management. By integrating blockchain technology with real-world logistics, it provided an unparalleled level of transparency and security. Major companies jumped on board, and its ecosystem expanded rapidly. Partnerships with brands like Walmart China, BMW, and PwC cemented its status as a serious player. Those who recognized Vechain’s potential early on saw massive gains. When it first hit the market, it was trading at fractions of a cent. Fast forward to the 2021 bull run, and its price soared past $0.25, rewarding early believers handsomely. But that was then—this is now. Vechain has already had its moment in the spotlight. The current price movements suggest that while it remains a solid long-term project, the explosive, moonshot-like returns are in the rearview mirror. The market has priced in its growth, and the chance to ride the wave from the ground floor is long gone. The real question now is: what’s next? Where’s the next big crypto to explode? Qubetics: The Ultimate Crypto for Cross-Border Transactions The answer is simple: Qubetics. While Vechain revolutionized supply chains, Qubetics is disrupting cross-border finance. Here’s a reality check—traditional banking systems make international transactions a nightmare. High fees, slow processing times, and endless red tape make sending money across borders a frustrating experience. Now imagine a world where businesses and individuals could send money across the globe in seconds, without the hassle of banks, hidden fees, or waiting days for transfers to clear. That’s exactly what Qubetics is bringing to the table. With its lightning-fast blockchain network and decentralized framework, Qubetics makes cross-border transactions seamless and cost-effective. Think about it—freelancers working for clients overseas, businesses paying suppliers in different countries, or even someone sending money to family back home. Each of these situations becomes infinitely easier and cheaper with Qubetics. No more waiting for SWIFT transfers, no more unnecessary middlemen, just instant, low-cost transactions. And here’s where it gets really interesting. The Qubetics crypto presale is still active, meaning there’s a real chance to get in at the ground level. With $TICS tokens currently priced at $0.0976 and analysts predicting major gains post-presale, this could be one of the last chances to buy before it skyrockets. Qubetics Presale: The Opportunity That Can’t Be Missed The numbers don’t lie. Qubetics has already sold over 493 million tokens, drawing in more than 21,900 holders and raising over $14.4 million. That’s not just hype—it’s a sign that people are recognizing its potential. Price predictions for $TICS are turning heads. Analysts are projecting a price of $0.25 by the end of the crypto presale, which would mean a 155% ROI for those who jump in now. But that’s just the beginning. Once the presale ends, experts expect $TICS to hit $1—an insane 923% ROI. Looking further ahead, post-mainnet launch estimates go as high as $15 per token, marking a mind-blowing 15,255% return. It’s rare to see an opportunity like this in crypto, especially with a project that actually solves real-world problems. Vechain was a missed opportunity, but Qubetics is still in the early stages, and there’s still time to act before it takes off. The Bottom Line: Don’t Sleep on Qubetics Every cycle, there’s a handful of projects that explode, leaving latecomers kicking themselves for not getting in earlier. Vechain was one of them, and now its major growth phase is behind it. Qubetics , on the other hand, is still a hidden gem, and everything about it screams potential. With its game-changing cross-border transaction capabilities, a growing community, and an ongoing presale that’s gaining serious traction, Qubetics is shaping up to be the next big crypto to explode. The window of opportunity is still open—but not for long. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs Why is Qubetics considered the next big crypto to explode? Qubetics is tackling a real-world problem—cross-border transactions—with a fast, cost-effective blockchain solution. Its presale success and strong analyst predictions indicate massive growth potential. Is it too late to invest in Vechain? Vechain remains a solid project, but the opportunity for massive early-stage gains has passed. The next big crypto to explode is more likely to be an emerging project like Qubetics. How can Qubetics improve cross-border payments? By eliminating middlemen, cutting fees, and reducing transaction times from days to seconds, Qubetics is revolutionizing the way businesses and individuals send money internationally. How much has Qubetics raised in its presale? So far, Qubetics has raised over $14.2 million, selling more than 491 million tokens to 21,600+ holders. What price predictions do analysts have for $TICS? Analysts estimate $TICS could reach $0.25 at the end of the presale, $1 post-presale, and as high as $15 after the mainnet launch.

Cardano CEO Shutdown Peter Schiff’s ‘Bitcoiner’ Campaign against Ripple’s Strategic Reserve Inclusion,https://coingape.com/markets/xrp-price-forecast-cardano-ceo-peter-schiff-bitcoiner-campaign-against-ripple-crypto-strategic-reserve/,"Ripple (XRP) price rose 40% on Sunday March 2, grazing the $3 mark in reaction to US President Donald Trump’s decision to include XRP in a newly-established crypto strategic reserve. Ripple (XRP) Delivers 40% Gains after Trump’s Executive Order on Crypto Strategic Reserve Ripple (XRP) has dominated crypto media headlines in recent weeks, thanks to events surrounding a new stablecoin launch, the SEC dropping multi-year-long charges against Ripple, and speculations around ETF filing progress. However, US President Donald Trump introduced fresh bullish impetus on Sunday after announcing an executive order to include XRP, along with Bitcoin ( BTC ), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) , in the newly established US Crypto Strategic Reserve. Ripple (XRP) Price Action, March 2, 2025 As expected, the news boosted demand for XRP as traders moved swiftly to bolster their holdings to front-run gains, anticipating that the US Treasury—managing the world’s second-largest economy—would begin making spot XRP purchases for its strategic reserve. Within hours of Trump’s posts on Truth Social, Ripple price rose by a remarkable 40%, surging from an opening price of $2.14 to graze the $3 mark before the close of trading on Sunday. Notably, XRP delivered the second-highest price gains among the five assets mentioned in Trump’s US Crypto Strategic Reserve pool, behind Cardano, which surged by more than 100%, moving from $0.60 to a peak of $1.20 at press time. Cardano CEO Responds as Peter Schiff Leads Bitcoiners’ Campaign Against Ripple’s Inclusion Trump’s inclusion of XRP in the Crypto Strategic Reserve follows a public appeal from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on February 28. Garlinghouse urged the administration to adopt a more holistic approach rather than solely endorsing Bitcoin for the U.S. Treasury. However, XRP’s inclusion has sparked backlash from Bitcoin enthusiasts and maximalists who argue that only BTC should be adopted, citing operational risks associated with altcoins. Economist Peter Schiff voiced strong opposition, questioning why the U.S. needs an XRP reserve. Despite widespread industry support, Schiff challeged President Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve that includes XRP alongside Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). While acknowledging the logic behind a Bitcoin reserve—comparing it to the U.S. gold reserve—Schiff appeared baffled by the choice to include XRP, writing that: “I get the rationale for a bitcoin reserve. I don’t agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. So let’s create a bitcoin reserve too. But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” – Peter Schiff, March 2, 2025 His post quickly drew responses from the global “XRP Army” crypto community, who defended the decision, pointing to Trump’s pledge to make the United States a global leader in cryptocurrency. Cardano founder and CEO Charles Hoskinson was among those who responded, backing XRP’s inclusion. “Because XRP is great technology, a global standard, survived for a decade through many harsh cycles, and has one of the strongest communities. I think the president made the right decision,” – Charles Hoskinson, Cardano Founder and CEO, March 2, 2025 . By spreading capital across four altcoins, Bitcoin is expected to see less upside than if it were the sole asset. As US Treasury funds begin flowing into XRP, ADA, SOL and ETH could potentially encroach on Bitcoin’s market dominance in the near-term, it strengthens the mainstream appeal of the crypto industry globally. XRP Price Forecast: Multi-day closes above $3 could see bulls set sights on $5 rally XRP price action has seen a dramatic surge, gaining nearly 40% in two days before facing resistance near the $3 psychological level. The daily chart reflects strong bullish momentum, with XRP breaking above its Bollinger Band midline ($2.53) and nearing the upper band ($2.99). However, the rejection at $2.99 signals an overheated market, and bulls must secure multi-day closes above this threshold to confirm continuation toward $5. XRP Price Forecast The MACD indicator further supports bullish momentum, with the MACD line (blue) crossing above the signal line (orange) and histogram bars flipping green. A continued expansion in the histogram would validate sustained buying pressure. Still, failure to hold current levels could see prices retracing to the midline of the Bollinger Bands at $2.53 or even the lower band at $2.07, where dip buyers may step in. For now, bulls must defend $2.80 as support while pushing for a decisive close above $3. If successful, momentum could propel XRP price towards $3.50, followed by the $5 psychological mark. Conversely, rejection at resistance and a bearish MACD crossover would expose XRP to deeper correction risks, potentially revisiting $2.50 in the short term The post Will XRP Price Rally Hit $5 ?

XRP, SOL ADA In Crypto Reserve! On Sunday, Trump took to social media to announce that he had signed an order which “directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA”. Bitcoin dominance dropped from 55.4% to under 50% after President Trump initially announced that XRP, Solana, and Cardano would be part of the Reserve. About an hour later, he revealed that BTC and ETH would also be key players in the reserve. The price of ADA soared by more than 63% within two hours after the president’s post, while SOL increased by 23% and XRP by 32%. Massive Gains in the Market Notably, President Trump’s news of a Crypto Strategic Reserve holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, XRP, and potentially more coins triggered massive gains across the crypto market. Bitcoin jumped 7.5%, Ethereum rose 10.2%, Solana surged 18.8%, Cardano skyrocketed 61.7%, and XRP soared 24.5%. Notably, the top four performers in the last 24 hours (with a market cap over $1 billion) were Cardano, XRP, the Official Trump memecoin, and Solana. BNB had the smallest gain among the top 10 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins), but still rose by 2.55%. Analyst’s POV On chain analyst Ali Martinez shared that the whales bought over 270 million XRP in the last 48 hours, further cementing bullish sentiments. He also predicts that Ethereum is about to skyrocket. While BTC also recorded gains, he shared that Bitcoin could be rebounding like it usually does when it hits the 200-day MA, only to face a rejection later and break through it. Nevertheless, Trump’s posts gave crypto prices a boost, reversing the sharp drop seen after his election surge. Over the weekend, Ether climbed 20% to $2,482, XRP jumped 38%, Solana rose 20%, and Cardano soared 78%. Furthermore, the rally could keep going right into Trump’s first White House Crypto Summit on Friday. The White House Summit, Next David Sacks shared in an X post that Trump’s move aligns with his earlier executive order (E.O. 14178) from his first week in office, reinforcing his commitment to making the U.S. the “Crypto Capital of the World.” More details are expected to be revealed during the upcoming summit.

Investors are rushing in, not just because of its unique presale journey but also due to its aggressive token burn mechanism. Every week, unsold tokens are permanently removed, reducing supply and increasing value. After the presale, any leftover tokens will also be burned, ensuring a deflationary model that could lead to serious price surges post-launch. The transparency of Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn process is backed by Binance Smart Chain (BSC), making every transaction publicly verifiable. With the current price at just $0.000067, the opportunity to lock in a prime entry before the price skyrockets is now. Arctic Pablo Coin Presale Hits Penguinopolis—12th Phase Offers a Jaw-Dropping 11,844% ROI Potential Arctic Pablo Coin’s meme coin presale journey has now reached Penguinopolis, its 12th location, after completing expeditions in 11 different locations within just 45 days.

At $0.000067 per APC, investors at this phase are staring at a staggering 11,844% ROI potential leading up to the launch price of $0.008. But as Arctic Pablo moves forward, so does the price. Those who wait too long could end up paying much more. The window to secure a low entry point is closing fast. Broccoli’s Latest Upgrade Aims to Boost DeFi Functionality Broccoli is making waves in the crypto world with its latest protocol upgrade, designed to enhance DeFi interactions and smart contract efficiency. The team has announced that their new staking pools will offer higher yields, attracting more investors to their ecosystem. With a growing community and increased adoption, Broccoli continues to solidify its position as a major player in the DeFi and meme coin space. Shiba Inu’s Burn Rate Surges—What This Means for Investors Shiba Inu has once again caught the market’s attention as its burn rate spikes by over 500% in the last 24 hours. With millions of SHIB tokens permanently removed from circulation, speculation is growing about a potential price breakout. As Shiba Inu continues to focus on reducing supply and increasing utility through its Shibarium layer-2 blockchain, investors are closely watching its next move. Final Thoughts: Arctic Pablo Coin Leads the Charge Among the Best New Meme Coins to Buy Now The meme coin market is brimming with potential, but Arctic Pablo Coin ’s unique presale model and aggressive token burn strategy set it apart. While Broccoli and Shiba Inu continue making impressive strides, the massive 11,844% ROI potential of Arctic Pablo Coin makes it a standout choice for investors looking for explosive gains.

The market reaction came after Trump took to Truth Social on Mar. 2, reaffirming his commitment to making the U.S. “the Crypto Capital of the World.” His latest executive order directs the Presidential Working Group on Digital Assets to move forward with establishing a national crypto reserve, which will include Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). Bitcoin surged 8% in the last 24 hours, breaking above $93,000, while Ethereum jumped 11%. The gains in other altcoins were much greater, with Cardano surging 66% surge, Solana up 20%, and XRP soaring 28%. At $163.9 billion in market capitalization, XRP surpassed USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency, according to crypto.news price tracker . Trump’s plan differs from his earlier notion of a Bitcoin stockpile, in which the US would merely keep its current Bitcoin holdings. On the other hand, a strategic reserve implies a proactive cryptocurrency accumulation. The crypto community is divided about the move. Because of its security and decentralization, some contend that Bitcoin ought to be the only asset in the reserve. Some worry that a government-controlled cryptocurrency reserve may weaken the dollar and be susceptible to future political changes.

The market’s reaction suggests that traders are weighing the long-term effects of government involvement in cryptocurrency ownership with both excitement and caution. Investors are looking forward to the forthcoming crypto summit , where more details will be revealed, as well as potential policy revisions, regulatory updates, and a clearer framework for the reserve.

Despite this, certain projects emerge that radiate undeniable promise. Investing early in presale tokens presents a unique opportunity to tap into significant growth potential before they hit broader markets and see price surges. So, which projects are the best long-term crypto to buy now? We highlight five exciting initiatives, each with robust use cases, strong community support, and the potential for substantial returns. Notably, Web3Bay is garnering significant interest with its revolutionary approach to decentralized e-commerce and its standout presale achievements. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY): Decentralized E-Commerce with Practical Solutions Web3Bay confronts the real challenges of traditional e-commerce platforms—excessive transaction fees, slow processing, and privacy issues. Its decentralized model facilitates direct peer-to-peer interactions, slashing costs and enhancing user data control. Why Web3Bay Stands Out: Successfully raised over $1.58 million with 390 million tokens sold during its presale. Current presale price: $0.005247 per token (Stage 5). Anticipated launch price: $0.1959, translating to a potential 3,633% ROI for early backers. Notable utility: Provides transaction discounts, staking rewards, and decentralized governance. The robust presale performance is a testament not merely to market hype but to investor confidence in Web3Bay’s approach to tackling the $8 trillion global e-commerce sector by removing intermediaries and enhancing transparency. 2. Mind of Pepe ($MIND): Combining AI & Meme Culture for Strategic Investing Mind of Pepe integrates AI with the playful nature of meme coins to offer real-time market analysis and actionable insights for its holders. Key Highlights: Over $6.4 million raised in its ongoing presale. Current price: $0.0033454, with staking options available. Unique feature: Provides continuous, autonomous market analysis. Investors attracted to cutting-edge technology and meme coin allure find Mind of Pepe an engaging portfolio addition. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Streamlining Crypto Asset Management Best Wallet addresses the complexity of managing assets across various blockchains with a unified platform that offers easy token swaps, access to DEXs, and the Best Card for straightforward purchases. Investor Attraction Points: More than $10 million raised in the presale. Rapidly growing user base exceeding 500,000. Benefits include reduced transaction fees and early access to new features. With its comprehensive functionality and expanding user base, Best Wallet is becoming an essential tool for crypto enthusiasts. 4. Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL): Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s Ascendancy As Bitcoin approaches new peaks, Bitcoin Bull Token enables investors to share in the excitement with additional benefits like BTC airdrops and high-yield staking options. Essential Stats: Raised over $2 million in the first week of its presale. Current price: $0.00237, with upcoming increases. BTC rewards triggered at specific Bitcoin price milestones. For those optimistic about Bitcoin’s future but seeking extra earnings, $BTCBULL presents an enticing option. 5. Meme Index ($MEMEX): Intelligent Investment in Meme Coins Navigating the meme coin market is risky—Meme Index offers a strategic tool by assessing trends and risks, providing investors with essential insights. Distinctive Features: $3.7 million raised since its launch in December 2024. Community-driven governance model promoting transparency and fairness. Provides risk metrics for both established and emerging meme tokens. Investors eager to explore the dynamic meme coin market will find Meme Index an invaluable guide. Key Highlights! While all five tokens offer unique advantages, Web3Bay’s innovative disruption of the e-commerce space, coupled with its significant early-stage interest, highlights its potential as a market leader. Its $1.58 million presale success and extensive token distribution reflect genuine market confidence. However, diversifying investments remains wise. Combining Web3Bay with established projects like Best Wallet or high-reward options like $BTCBULL could optimize returns while balancing risks. For those aiming to seize the best long-term crypto to buy now , engaging early in these presales could mark the difference between moderate returns and transformative financial outcomes.

These involve BTFD Coin, the Bulls Squad-powered presale sensation, Moo Deng, the cute baby hippo, and SPX6900, the science-based meme token with a cult following. Each brings something fresh to the table, and you won’t want to miss what’s in store! Here’s a quick heads-up: BTFD Coin is running an insane promo right now. Every token you buy in Stage 14 will be DOUBLED with the bonus code LAUNCH100—but only if you act fast before the presale sells out! BTFD Coin – Bulls, Bonuses, and a Breakout Moment Ever wished you had a crew to guide you through the chaotic meme coin jungle? Enter the Bulls Squad, BTFD Coin’s mascots and the ultimate hype team designed to keep investors engaged and thriving. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull represent different investment styles, community personalities, and a roadmap to navigating crypto’s highs and lows. Imagine investing with the wisdom of a Wall Street veteran (Nerdy Bull) and the sheer conviction of a diamond-handed degenerate (Raging Bull)—you get the best of both worlds. BTFD Coin’s presale is already in its 14th stage, with over $6.21 million raised and 70 billion coins sold. The hype is real, and with just two stages left before exchange listings, analysts are eyeing $0.0006 post-launch, with an optimistic moonshot projection of $0.006—a 3650% ROI from today’s presale price of $0.00016. That’s not just growth; that’s the kind of play that turns an entry-level investment into a life-changing moon mission. Oh, and don’t forget: Using the LAUNCH100 code will double the number of tokens you purchase in Stage 14, making this one of the most bullish presales of the year! Moo Deng – A Long-Term Play Worth Waiting for Named after the two-month-old pygmy hippo from Thailand who stole the internet’s heart with her playful antics, Moo Deng has taken meme coin investors on a wild ride. This coin became an overnight success after a crypto trader turned a modest investment of $1,300 into over $12 million in just 17 days. The claim, shared by the blockchain analysis account Lookonchain on X, showed that the investor bought Moo Deng coins on September 10 and saw their value skyrocket by more than 9,000x within weeks. With stories like this, it’s no wonder Moo Deng has caught the attention of traders worldwide. These days, its price action is pretty low, but long-term traders are still bullish about a comeback soon. SPX6900 – The Wild Card of Meme Coins SPX6900 (SPX) is a wild ride of a meme coin built on Ethereum, with a supply of 1 billion tokens and about 930 million in circulation. It’s been making moves on DEXs like Uniswap V2 and Aerodrome, with a market cap of around $10 million. Volatile? Absolutely. But for traders who love the thrill, that’s part of the fun. SPX6900 is all about trading—buy low, sell high, and (hopefully) cash in. You’ll need a crypto wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask, some ETH, and access to a DEX like 1inch to start swapping. While spot trading is the safest play, leveraged or perpetual trading? Probably not a great idea unless you enjoy stress. Bottom line: SPX6900 is for those who love chasing pumps and don’t mind the occasional dip. Feeling lucky? How to Redeem the LAUNCH100 Bonus Code for 2X $BTFD Here’s how to double your BTFD Coin tokens before Stage 14 sells out: Go to the BTFD presale page . Connect Your Wallet – Click “Connect Wallet” and select MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or another supported wallet. Enter the Bonus Code – Locate the bonus field, type LAUNCH100 in ALL CAPS, click Apply, and confirm. Enter Purchase Details – Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy.

ETH is now back above $2,400 and facing hurdles near the $2,550 level. Ethereum started a decent increase above the $2,350 resistance zone. The price is trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels to continue higher. Ethereum Price Rallies 10% Ethereum price extended losses below $2,200 before the bulls appeared, like Bitcoin . ETH tested the $2,080 zone and recently started a strong increase. There was a move above the $2,200 and $2,320 resistance levels. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even surged above the $2,500 resistance level. A high was formed at $2,550 and the price is now correcting some gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,173 swing low to the $2,550 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,350 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,500 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,520 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,550. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,650 resistance. An upside break above the $2,650 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,780 resistance zone or even $2,850 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,400 level. The first major support sits near the $2,360 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,173 swing low to the $2,550 high. A clear move below the $2,360 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,220 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,080. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

However, one legal battle continues to unfold—the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple (XRP). While cases involving companies like OpenSea, Robinhood, Uniswap (UNI), Gemini, MetaMask, and Coinbase are being dismissed, Ripple’s case remains unresolved. Meanwhile, President Trump’s recent announcement about a U.S. cryptocurrency strategic reserve, which includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), has added fuel to market speculation. Investors are now wondering if XRP’s inclusion in the reserve could lead to a swift resolution of the ongoing case, with many believing the SEC may soon drop its lawsuit. What’s Next For Ripple Lawsuit? Legal expert Jeremy Hogan recently opened up about the delay in settling the Ripple case, pointing to a significant injunction in Judge Torres’ judgment that prevents Ripple from directly selling to customers. Hogan explained that although there are workarounds, Ripple is reluctant to violate the injunction. Once a court issues such an order, the parties involved cannot simply agree to disregard it, making it a challenging obstacle to overcome. To dissolve the injunction, Ripple would need to seek “relief from a judgment” under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. However, it’s not a simple process, and changes in the crypto regulations by the SEC won’t automatically nullify the court’s decision. The court’s judgment, based on the Howey test, stands independent of any rule changes the SEC might implement. https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1896232607592902957 Still, there is a possibility that Ripple could resolve this issue, but it would require careful legal maneuvering. Hogan said that the court would need to exercise discretion, and if both Ripple and the SEC agree to request the dissolution of the injunction, it could be a strong argument. Ripple’s case could be resolved by late April or early May.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|FIAT|ADA|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 03:35:34

Responding to White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks on X, Armstrong outlined two potential strategies for structuring the reserve. The first strategy would treat Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the modern equivalent of gold, focusing solely on it. Excited to learn more. Still forming an opinion on asset allocation, but my current thinking is: 1. Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold 2. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto… https://t.co/jv8Gcn8N2S — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) March 3, 2025 This would minimize government interference in the larger cryptocurrency market and strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a store of value, offering stability, transparency, and simplicity. The second approach would distribute assets based on the respective market sizes of each coin using a market cap-weighted index. For example, if Bitcoin makes up 50% of the total crypto market and Ethereum ( ETH ) 20%, then the reserve would allocate its assets in proportion to these figures. Favoritism would be avoided, and the reserve may eventually reflect changes in the market. Armstrong did, however, suggest that a Bitcoin-only approach might be more feasible and consistent with the reserve’s objective.

The decision has sparked debate among the financial and cryptocurrency communities, with differing views on its ramifications. Some crypto advocates have praised the reserve as a landmark move toward widespread adoption, arguing that it will boost investment and establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets worldwide. Others, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, remain skeptical. Hayes dismissed the announcement as political posturing, stating that without congressional approval or a revaluation of gold, the government has no way to fund large-scale crypto purchases. Nothing new here. Just words. Lmk when they get congressional approval to borrow money and or revalue the gold price higher. Without that they have no money to buy #bitcoin and #shitcoins . https://t.co/Q06cDtL6h7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 3, 2025 As Trump gets ready to host the White House Crypto Summit, the debate over the structure of the reserve is growing more intense.

While the valuation is elevated, technical support is in play as bitcoin's price rallies of last week's low under $80,000. Despite its high volatility and poor ETF Grade, BITQ's concentrated portfolio and potential for new highs make it a compelling investment. Technical indicators suggest a bottom may be in place, with support near $14 and bullish seasonality expected to drive gains through mid-year. It has been a dramatic handful of days in the crypto markets. Bitcoin plunged from the mid-$90,000s to below $80,000 for a moment last Friday morning. It was a classic high-volatility correction in the world’s most valuable digital currency, but bitcoin snapped back sharply on February’s final day. Another upward jolt came about last Sunday when it was announced that President Trump called for the creation of a crypto strategic reserve. After being up 16% year-to-date on Trump’s first day in office and then plunging to a –16% YTD return last week, bitcoin is now flat in 2025 as of this writing. It’s been a roller coaster ride to say the least. Today, I’m analyzing a somewhat new ETF focused on crypto-related stocks. The Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF ( BITQ ) is a small fund, and it has been volatile just like the entire crypto market in recent months. I have a buy rating on the product as I see last Friday’s bitcoin price action as a washout, setting the stage for new highs in the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin: Retraces Half the January-February Plunge StockCharts.com Chances of a Bitcoin Reserve Rising Kalshi Trump Comes to Crypto's Rescue? Truth Social According to the issuer , BITQ provides focused exposure to the crypto economy without the complications of holding crypto assets directly. It’s a traditional, regulated ETF, giving holders simplicity and ease of use. Bitwise is one of the largest crypto asset managers. The index leverages Bitwise’s industry expertise to identify what they believe are the right companies in the space. BITQ is a small ETF with just $173.5 million in assets under management as of February 28, 2025. It carries a high annual expense ratio of 0.85% while the trailing 12-month dividend yield is low at just 1.0%. Share-price momentum has been weak since January 20, back when bitcoin notched its all-time high. BITQ shares actually peaked in advance of Trump being sworn into office. December 5, 2024, was its cycle high, just shy of $23. The fund fell 38% to its low last week near $14, successfully holding the pre-election nadir of $14.07. As you might suspect, BITQ is a highly volatile product , and that’s seen in its very poor F ETF Grade per Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system. The annualized volatility is sky-high at 65%, so I underscore that using a small position size with this crypto equity fund is important when it comes to risk management. What’s more, liquidity metrics are sketchy since average daily volume is under 200,000 shares while the 30-day median bid/ask spread is high at 28 basis points, so using limit orders during the trading day, particularly around the market’s open, is prudent. Looking closer at the portfolio, BITQ has mixed exposure across the style box. A plurality of its holdings is found in the risk-on small-cap growth area, which underscores the ETF being a high-volatility product. The 36-holding allocation was created in 2021, and it sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.2x, per Morningstar, with a long-term EPS growth rate of 10%. The PEG ratio of nearly 3 is no bargain, but with bitcoin potentially back in bull-market mode, the valuation is not a primary concern today. BITQ: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar BITQ is primarily a fintech fund. Sixty-eight percent of the portfolio is invested in the Financials sector with another 29% allocated to Information Technology. I would also call out that there is international exposure—25% of BITQ is invested in non-US stocks. The concentrated portfolio shows a high 58% of assets allocated to the top 10 positions, so monitoring both fundamental and technical developments in names like Strategy (MicroStrategy) ( MSTR ), Coinbase ( COIN ), and MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is a sound strategy. BITQ: Sector and Dividend Information Seeking Alpha Also catching my eye is bullish bitcoin seasonality. While the cryptocurrency was down big in February—its worst month since June 2022—the March through July period has been strong when analyzing historical trends. More recently, since 2019, bitcoin has a mean March return of 9%, up 5 of 6 times with gains often extending through mid-year. Bitcoin: Bullish Seasonal Stretch Through July Barchart Strong Bitcoin Returns March-May Since 2019 StockCharts.com The Technical Take With high volatility in the crypto universe as we enter March, BITQ’s chart has interesting features if you’re a bitcoin bull. Notice in the graph below that the fund tagged its long-term 200-day moving average, briefly dipping below that mark, in late February. It has a history of pulling back to the 200dma before rallying sharply ever since the fund notched its all-time low of $3.20 in December 2022. Marking the top last year was a bearish RSI momentum divergence. Price hit a new high, but the RSI indicator at the top of the chart made a lower high, a telltale bearish clue. Now, after hitting technical oversold conditions last week, I see signs of capitulation washout. The weak momentum tally was paired with a volume spike, lending further evidence to a potential bottom being in place. I see support near $14 with the high $9s being another downside point of interest. On the upside, BITQ paused at its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the November 2021 all-time high to the December 22 low. That is a longer-term resistance point, while the mid-$16s is near-term resistance. BITQ: Shares Fall To Trendline Support On Oversold Conditions StockCharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on BITQ. With signs of a bitcoin recovery, the sharp 37% fall in this crypto equity ETF may be done. With bullish seasonality on tap, I expect BITQ to catch a bid in the months ahead.",BTC-USD|BITQ,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|FIAT|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-03 03:50:27

For investors eager to get ahead, jumping into high-potential projects early can be crucial. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum often steal the spotlight, the real opportunities frequently lie with lesser-known, emerging projects that boast solid fundamentals and innovative use cases. Curious about the top crypto gainers to buy now? We’ve scoped out four promising projects that could potentially skyrocket by 2025. From revolutionizing decentralized e-commerce to enhancing blockchain scalability, here’s why these tokens are worth your attention. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY): Redefining E-Commerce Through Decentralization Fed up with hefty fees on platforms like Amazon or eBay? Web3Bay is set to turn the e-commerce industry upside down with its peer-to-peer marketplace that cuts out middlemen, slashes transaction fees, and puts control back into users’ hands. Leveraging blockchain technology, Web3Bay guarantees secure, transparent, and exceptionally fast transactions. Why You Should Watch Web3Bay: Raised $1.58 million and sold over 390 million tokens during its presale. Current presale price: $0.005247 (Stage 5). Projected launch price: $0.1959, which could yield a 3,633% ROI for early investors. Standout features include staking rewards, transaction discounts, and community governance. With the global e-commerce market projected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030, Web3Bay’s innovative platform arrives at a perfect time. Its successful presale and practical utility make it one of the top crypto gainers to buy now for those looking for significant gains and sustainable value. 2. Story (IP): Securing Intellectual Property in the Digital Age As digital content continues to proliferate, protecting intellectual property (IP) becomes increasingly crucial—particularly with the advent of AI-generated content. Story Protocol addresses this need with a blockchain-based system for creators to register, track, and monetize their creations securely. Key Highlights: Uses the native token (IP) for network transactions and licensing. Recent surge: Up 165% this past week, now trading at $5.06. Offers tangible solutions for artists and tech creators. With AI reshaping content ownership, Story Protocol’s forward-thinking solution positions it as an intriguing investment for those focused on utility-driven tokens with long-term growth prospects. 3. Solana (SOL): Speed, Scalability, & Adoption While many blockchains buckle under the pressure of their growth, Solana stands out with unmatched transaction speeds and minimal fees. Thanks to its Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism, it can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it an ideal platform for decentralized apps, NFTs, and DeFi projects. Why Solana is a Must-Buy: Current price: $171.00 as of February 2025. Analysts predict a potential rise to $500 by the end of 2025. It hosts a robust ecosystem attracting major projects and partnerships. Offers scalability solutions superior to competitors like Ethereum. With its growing developer engagement and increasing institutional interest, Solana not only offers stability but also strong growth potential, making it a top crypto gainer to buy this week for those wanting a mix of security and upward mobility. 4. Sonic (S): A New Era of Fast, Scalable, Developer-Friendly Previously known as Fantom, Sonic has rebranded and relaunched to prioritize ultra-fast transactions and a robust developer ecosystem. Its mainnet aims to process up to 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant confirmation times. Why Sonic is Attracting Attention: Transitioned from FTM to S token with a 1:1 swap. Offers lucrative developer incentives, retaining up to 90% of generated fees. Seen a 64% increase in market interest over the past week. Focusing on speed and developer benefits, Sonic is poised for success, making it a compelling choice among emerging low-cap cryptocurrencies. Choosing the Top Crypto Gainer! While all four projects offer substantial potential, Web3Bay’s standout presale success and its disruptive approach to e-commerce make it one of the top crypto gainers to buy now . Its combination of a low entry price, enthusiastic investor base, and high ROI projection sets it apart. However, Solana’s proven track record and scalability make it a solid choice for those seeking a balanced crypto portfolio. Meanwhile, Story and Sonic introduce fresh opportunities in managing intellectual property and enhancing transaction speeds, respectively, appealing to niche investors and tech enthusiasts alike.

The price is now trading above $2.750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2.40 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Despite the market’s optimism, fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “strategic national Bitcoin reserve” and the upcoming White House Crypto Summit on March 7, Pi Coin has dropped 50% in the past four days, falling from $3 to $1.50. Bitcoin’s recent surge comes after a tough February, during which it dropped 25% from its all-time high of $107,791. The rally has driven other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) to gains between 12% and 50%. However, Pi Coin’s decline stands in contrast, despite the overall strength of the crypto market. However, analyst Kim Wong said that $1.50 is considered a strong support level for Pi Coin, making it a potentially attractive buy for investors anticipating good news and positive market sentiment in the near future. With Pi Coin’s current price and the general strength of the crypto market, this might be an ideal time to consider an entry point. Important Resistance and Support Levels The first level to watch is $2, followed by $2.20 as the next major resistance. An extended bullish target could push the price above $2.50. The market shows signs of momentum with a bullish MACD crossover and a Stochastic RSI moving out of oversold territory. With increasing volume near the breakout, there is potential for a bullish move, making this a setup to monitor closely.

The company, listed on Nasdaq, reported $376.7 million in total revenue in 2024, which was up over 34% from 2023’s $280 million, despite challenges in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Meanwhile, net income during the same period reached $109.4 million. This figure is a sharp turnaround from a net loss of $49.4 million the previous year. Record Year For Riot The revenue boost was primarily attributed to Bitcoin mining operations, which generated $321 million—nearly double the $189 million recorded in 2023—benefitting from higher Bitcoin prices alongside an increased operational hash rate. Despite this, the company produced fewer Bitcoin in 2024 as it mined 4,828 BTC compared to 6,626 BTC in 2023. According to this week’s press release , the reduction was a result of rising mining costs, the Bitcoin halving event in April 2024, and a 67% increase in the global network hash rate. Riot noted that the average cost to mine each Bitcoin rose to $32,216 in 2024, a significant increase from $3,831 in 2023 due to reduced power credits and the more competitive mining environment. The company also revealed that its “unique” power strategy helped reduce some of the cost pressures and achieve an all-in power cost of 3.4 cents per kilowatt hour across its facilities. The company earned $33.7 million in power credits during the year, though this was down from $71.2 million in 2023. A key highlight of 2024 was Riot’s expansion through acquisitions. For instance, the purchase of Block Mining in July expanded its mining operations. Additionally, the acquisition of E4A Solutions strengthened its engineering business and operational capabilities. The Corsicana Facility was energized during the year, which is being deemed a milestone in Riot’s growth initiatives. AI and HPC Focus for 2025 To further boost its Bitcoin yield strategy, Riot raised $579 million through its inaugural convertible senior notes offering in December. The proceeds were used to acquire an additional 5,784 BTC, which increased the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 17,722 BTC by the end of 2024, which was a 141% rise year-over-year. This accumulation brought the company’s Bitcoin treasury to approximately $1.65 billion based on year-end market prices. Going forward, Riot said that it plans to capitalize on emerging opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing (HPC), particularly at its Corsicana Facility.

Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Mechanism: Enhancing Scarcity and Value Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) introduces a deflationary mechanism designed to increase token scarcity and value. During the presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation every week. Additionally, any tokens remaining after the presale will be burned, creating a deflationary environment that aims to enhance investor value and ensure long-term sustainability. These token burn transactions are meticulously recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust within the community.

To date, the project has successfully raised over $1.67 million, reflecting strong community support and confidence in Arctic Pablo Coin’s vision. As the presale progresses through various phases, the token price is poised to increase, making now an ideal time to participate at this advantageous entry point.

Official Melania Meme Coin: A Political Meme Coin on the Rise The Official Melania Meme Coin has captured the crypto community’s attention with its unique blend of politics and humor. Inspired by former First Lady Melania Trump, this meme coin is gaining traction as a culturally relevant digital asset. Recent surges in trading volume suggest increasing investor interest, fueled by speculation and the broader meme coin hype.

On March 2, Trump announced an executive order establishing a national crypto reserve, marking a major shift in the government’s stance on digital currencies . The reserve, which includes Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA), triggered a sharp rally across the crypto market, with some altcoins posting double-digit gains. Bitcoin surged 8% to surpass $93,000, while Ethereum jumped 11%. Cardano led the altcoin rally, skyrocketing 66%, followed by XRP with a 28% increase and Solana gaining 20%. XRP’s surge propelled its market capitalization to $163.9 billion, overtaking USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency. The market’s reaction underscored investor optimism, yet debates have emerged regarding the potential implications of a government-controlled crypto reserve. Bitcoin stockpile vs. reserve Trump’s latest plan represents a shift from his earlier proposal of merely stockpiling Bitcoin, where the US government would hold but not actively accumulate additional cryptocurrency. Instead, the new approach involves a strategic reserve that includes proactive acquisitions of various digital assets. This distinction has divided the crypto community, with some supporting the move as a step toward mainstream adoption, while others fear potential risks. Bitcoin proponents argue that only BTC should be included due to its security, decentralization, and proven track record. The inclusion of altcoins such as XRP, Solana, and Cardano has raised concerns that the government could unfairly influence the crypto market by favouring certain assets over others. Critics also warn that a future administration could liquidate the reserve, undermining its intended long-term benefits. US crypto reserve: political and financial impact Trump’s initiative has been widely supported by Republican lawmakers, who view it as a strategic move to strengthen the US position in the evolving financial landscape. With China accelerating its push for digital yuan dominance, policymakers see the crypto reserve as a counterbalance to Beijing’s influence. The initiative also aligns with broader efforts to integrate blockchain technology into the financial system, potentially setting the stage for a more regulated and government-backed digital economy. The move has triggered scepticism among some market analysts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in the ‘Fear’ zone at 33, reflecting uncertainty over the long-term impact of government involvement in digital assets. While the crypto market has reacted positively to Trump’s announcement, concerns persist about potential regulatory overreach and the risk of political interference in crypto markets. Crypto summit ahead The upcoming White House Crypto Summit, set for later this week, is expected to provide further details on the reserve’s structure, policy framework, and regulatory outlook. Investors are closely monitoring the event for insights into the government’s long-term crypto strategy, particularly regarding taxation, security measures, and the role of centralised oversight. Trump’s announcement marks a significant milestone in the government’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency. While the market has responded with enthusiasm, the broader debate over the implications of state-controlled crypto holdings continues to unfold. As details emerge, investors will be watching for potential regulatory shifts that could shape the future of digital assets in the US and beyond.

ADA is up over 60% and now consolidates near the $1.050 support zone. ADA price started a fresh surge above the $0.70 and $0.90 levels. The price is trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1450 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.150 resistance zone. Cardano Price Skyrockets After a major decline, Cardano found support near the $0.580 zone. ADA formed a base and recently started a fresh surge after Trump’s announcement of the crypto reserve. It rallied over 60%, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move above the $0.70 and $0.90 levels. The bulls even pumped the price above the $1.0 resistance. A high was formed at $1.1577 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $1.10 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.6446 swing low to the $1.1577 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.00 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.10 zone. The first resistance is near $1.1450. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1.1450 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The next key resistance might be $1.150. If there is a close above the $1.150 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.220 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.150 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.040 level. The next major support is near the $1.00 level. A downside break below the $1.00 level could open the doors for a test of $0.90. The next major support is near the $0.80 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

The announcement has already triggered solid gains in Bitcoin and altcoins over the last 24 hours. While BTC price is up 8%, the Ripple cryptocurrency, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) are up by 25-60%. Just Bitcoin Is Ok, Do We Need XRP Reserves? Some of the veteran crypto industry players have voiced their concerns regarding the XRP reserves. Bitcoin critic and popular economist Peter Schiff noted: “I get the rationale for a Bitcoin reserve. I don’t agree with it, but I get it. We have a gold reserve. Bitcoin is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. So let’s create a Bitcoin reserve too. But what’s the rationale for an XRP reserve? Why the hell would we need that?” Addressing the Trump administration, Schiff further noted: “America will never be great again so long as you can create worthless crypto tokens, then pay off government officials to declare them valuable and use taxpayer money to buy them”. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson gave a quick response to Schiff adding that “XRP is great technology, a global standard, survived for a decade through many harsh cycles, and has one of the strongest communities. I think the president made the right decision”. Industry Leaders Back BTC Hunter Horsely, the CEO of crypto asset management firm Bitwise also shared a similar view on the matter. He stated that having just the Bitcoin strategic reserve would make the most sense to him considering that it’s a digital store of value. “Many crypto assets have merits, but what we’re talking about here isn’t a US investment portfolio — we’re talking about a reserve, and BTC is the undisputed store of value for the digital age,” wrote Horsely . Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also shared his opinion and added, “Just Bitcoin would probably be the best option – simplest, and clear story as successor to gold. If folks wanted more variety, you could do a market cap weighted index of crypto assets to keep it unbiased”. Community Members Defend The Decision Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan has backed the community, stating why it was important to have a Ripple altcoin. JP Richardson, CEO of crypto wallet Exodus stated that it’s a “terrible news” for the US, adding that Americans only need a BTC reserve and nothing more. Responding to him, Morgan said: “Does anyone care about Exodus. You stay with your Bitcoin customers. Everyone else should run a mile from a business that hates most of crypto. Seriously who would use Exodus wallet other than Bitcoin maxis with such thinking from a CEO”. Furthermore, other Ripple critics also asked why the US government would care about having a crypto reserve wherein the parent firm controls 50% of the total. Bill Moirgan called it an attempt to spread FUD stating: “XRP in escrow is now down to 37.62 % and the circulating supply is 62.33%. Ripple has a small % of the 62.33% circulating supply. Stop lying”. Ripple Lawsuit Outcome Coming Soon? As President Donald Trump announces Ripple cryptocurrency to be part of the US strategic reserves, all eyes will be on how soon the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ends the Ripple lawsuit moving ahead. Attorney Jeremy Hogan has highlighted a key factor delaying the conclusion of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit —an injunction imposed by Judge Analisa Torres. Hogan noted that the injunction could hinder Ripple Labs’ ability to move forward with a potential IPO. He also stated that Ripple Labs’ efforts to persuade the court to set aside the injunction are the main cause of the delay in reaching a resolution. He anticipates that both parties will likely withdraw their appeals by April, paving the way for the legal battle to conclude in May.

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President confirmed the creation of a U.S. “crypto strategic reserve,” sparking a massive rally in major digital assets. Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP , Solana, and Cardano all saw major price increases following this announcement, which mentioned these cryptocurrencies as part of the reserve. Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve Plan In a recent post on Truth Social, Trump confirmed that Bitcoin and Ethereum will be the core of this crypto reserve , alongside other major assets like XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This move is seen as highly bullish for the crypto market, as it signals the U.S. government’s involvement in holding and possibly purchasing these cryptocurrencies as reserve assets. The announcement has already had a noticeable impact on market prices, with XRP seeing a sharp price surge of around 35%. XRP Price Analysis: A Strong Breakout XRP’s price has experienced a significant jump since Trump’s announcement. The cryptocurrency, which was priced at approximately $2.20 before the news, has surged past $2.80, breaking through key resistance levels. If XRP continues to hold above the $2.80 level and closes with a daily candle, it could confirm a bullish breakout, possibly pushing the price toward $3 and beyond. Market Outlook: Continued Bullish Momentum? While the recent rally is promising, it’s essential to be cautious. The current price movements have been volatile, and after a major pump, some caution is advised. If XRP maintains its upward momentum and continues to break key resistance levels, it could be headed toward new highs, potentially revisiting its all-time highs near $3.40. At press time, XRP is up by more than 24% and is trading at $2.80.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|FIAT|ADA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-03 05:10:45

In the UK, Olumide Osunkoya received a four-year prison sentence for operating unregistered crypto ATMs, which was the country's first criminal conviction for this kind of offense. Vitalik Buterin Supports Roger Ver Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently expressed his support for Roger Ver, the early crypto investor and entrepreneur that is currently entangled in a legal battle with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) over alleged tax evasion. Ver was arrested in Spain and faces extradition to the US. Since then, he has attracted a lot of backing from various figures in the crypto community, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Buterin reposted Ulbricht’s message calling for the charges against Ver to be dropped and described the case as ”absurd” and ”politically motivated.” He criticized the US tax system, particularly its taxation of citizens regardless of residence and its stringent exit tax, and pointed out that very few other countries impose similar regulations. Ver’s legal troubles began when the DOJ announced tax evasion charges against him on April 30 of 2024. He was subsequently arrested in Spain and spent several weeks in prison before posting a $163,000 bail on May 17, 2024. (Source: DOJ ) The bail conditions required him to stay in Spain, surrender his passport, and report to court officials every two days. In a legal filing that was submitted on Dec. 3 of 2024, Ver’s attorneys argued that the case was unconstitutional and sought to have the charges dismissed . They said that the US exit tax law for citizens with more than $2 million in investable assets was vague and violated the Apportionment Clause and the Due Process Clause of the US Constitution. The case against Ver also reignited debates over US tax policies , particularly as lawmakers and citizens push for comprehensive tax reform. Many in the crypto community see the charges as part of a broader crackdown by the Biden administration on the industry. Critics even accused the DOJ of unfairly targeting Ver because of his outspoken support for cryptocurrency rather than for genuine tax violations. Ver himself held firm that his prosecution is politically motivated , and alleged that the US government is using the case to suppress crypto advocacy. Judge Dismisses SEC Case Against Richard Heart A US district court judge also recently dismissed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SECs) lawsuit against Hex founder Richard Heart, which accused him of raising more than $1 billion through unregistered crypto offerings and defrauding investors of $12.1 million. Heart’s real name is Richard Schueler. He was also alleged to have spent misappropriated funds on luxury items, including the world’s largest black diamond. However, Judge Carol Bagley Amon ruled that the SEC failed to establish US jurisdiction over Heart’s crypto activities, and stated that his alleged actions were global in scope and not specifically targeted at US investors. In the court ruling that was issued on Feb. 28, Amon noted that the alleged misappropriation took place through digital wallets and crypto asset platforms that had no connection to the United States. She also stated that if Heart misused investor funds through deceptive mixer transactions, those actions took place entirely outside of US jurisdiction. The tokens at the center of the SEC’s allegations—PulseChain (PLS), PulseX (PLSX), and HEX (HEX)—have seen big price increases since the verdict, rising close to 30%, 60%, and 70%, respectively. After the ruling, Heart shared his relief at the outcome by stating that winning a securities-related case against the SEC was rare. He pointed out that HEX has been operating flawlessly for over five years and that the decision provided some very welcome relief and opportunity for the broader cryptocurrency industry. Despite the dismissal, Amon granted the SEC an opportunity to amend its complaint and refile the case in 20 days, leaving the possibility of future legal action open. Beyond the SEC lawsuit, Heart is facing additional legal troubles in Finland. On Sept. 13, 2024, Finnish authorities took him into custody over allegations of tax fraud and assault, but he has since gone missing. On Dec. 22, Interpol issued a Red Notice for his arrest based on these allegations. Although authorities have been unable to locate him, they still managed to seize approximately $2.6 million worth of watches that he is believed to have abandoned. Heart’s Interpol Red Notice While he is still out of reach for authorities, Heart is very active on social media, and regularly uses platforms like X and YouTube to promote his cryptos and engage with his followers. UK Sentences First Illegal Crypto ATM Operator Roger Ver and Richard Heart are not the only people in the crypto space facing legal issues. Olumide Osunkoya was sentenced to four years in prison for operating an illegal network of cryptocurrency ATMs. This was the UK’s first criminal sentencing for unregistered crypto activity. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the ruling on Feb. 28, and believes that the case sends a strong message to those who try to evade regulations and engage in illicit financial activities. Osunkoya was charged on Sept. 10 for running crypto ATMs without the required registration at 28 locations through his company, GidiPlus Ltd, from December of 2021 to March of 2022. During that period, his ATMs processed transactions totaling 2.6 million British pounds ($3.14 million). To avoid detection, he later transferred the ATMs from GidiPlus and continued operating up to 12 machines under a fake name and company. The FCA stated that he failed to implement measures to prevent money laundering through these machines. In addition to being the first individual charged in the UK for running an illegal crypto ATM network, Osunkoya pleaded guilty to five charges on Sept. 30. He was also convicted of forgery after creating four fraudulent bank statements to pass a source of wealth check at a crypto exchange. Other charges included using a fake identity to establish a company and possessing criminal property, with authorities seizing 19,540 British pounds ($24,567) in cash obtained through his illegal operations. During sentencing at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Gregory Perrins condemned Osunkoya’s actions as a deliberate and calculated attempt to defy regulators. He stressed that the case was not a simple regulatory breach but an intentional effort to circumvent financial laws. This case took place after a 2023 crackdown by the FCA and local police agencies aimed at shutting down illegal crypto ATMs. The regulator reported visiting 38 locations and dismantling 30 machines, which led to a decline in the number of crypto ATMs listed on Coin ATM Radar from 80 in 2022 to zero this year.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-03 05:20:35

While President Donald Trump has moved to establish a national crypto reserve—including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano—regulatory uncertainty remains a key challenge. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long recently criticized the administration for failing to address crypto debanking issues, arguing that financial institutions still face restrictions when engaging with digital assets. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken steps toward a more crypto-friendly stance, leaving industry stakeholders eager to see if banking regulators will follow suit. With a White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7, discussions around regulation, financial inclusion, and the role of digital assets in the US economy are set to take center stage. Trump Expands US Crypto Reserve to Include XRP, Solana, and Cardano—Bitcoin and Ethereum Added as Core Holdings President Donald Trump has directed the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets to include XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) in the country’s strategic crypto reserve. The announcement marks a pivotal moment in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, as the United States seeks to solidify its position in the evolving global digital economy. Trump later expanded the list to include Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), declaring that these two cryptocurrencies would form the ”heart of the reserve.” This move aligns with his previously stated ambitions to establish a national Bitcoin stockpile, a promise he made during the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee. During his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to Bitcoin. His announcement initially resonated strongly with Bitcoin supporters, who saw it as a validation of the cryptocurrency’s role in the global financial system. However, the subsequent inclusion of XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Ethereum has sparked debate among crypto purists, particularly Bitcoin maximalists, who argue that only Bitcoin should be considered a national asset. The inclusion of multiple cryptocurrencies in the national reserve represents a significant policy shift in how the US government views digital assets. While Bitcoin remains at the forefront of Trump’s strategy, the addition of XRP, Solana, and Cardano suggests a broader vision for the country's engagement with blockchain technologies. XRP: Known for its fast transaction speeds and focus on cross-border payments, XRP's inclusion could indicate that the US sees value in leveraging blockchain for global financial transactions. Solana (SOL): With its high throughput and low fees, Solana has been increasingly positioned as a scalable solution for decentralized applications (dApps) and finance. Cardano (ADA): Cardano’s emphasis on security, sustainability, and formal verification may have played a role in its selection for the reserve. Ethereum (ETH): As the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT industries, Ethereum’s inclusion signals an acknowledgment of its crucial role in digital asset ecosystems. The decision to create a diversified digital asset stockpile also raises questions about future regulatory frameworks. The President’s Working Group on Digital Assets is now tasked with determining how these assets will be acquired, stored, and managed. Bitcoin Maximalists React to Trump’s Broader Crypto Strategy While Trump’s Bitcoin -centric narrative previously garnered strong support from Bitcoin-only advocates, his latest executive order has triggered disappointment among hardcore maximalists. The Jan. 23 order, which directed the establishment of a ”digital asset stockpile” rather than a strictly Bitcoin-only reserve, led some in the community to voice concerns over dilution of Bitcoin’s primacy. Bitcoin-focused commentators quickly took to social media to express their discontent. Walker, host of THE Bitcoin podcast, criticized the move. Similarly, Pierre Rochard, Vice President of Research at Riot Platforms, pointed out that Trump’s order diverged from earlier promises made to Bitcoiners. Despite the backlash, some industry leaders view the expanded reserve as a pragmatic decision that acknowledges the diversity of use cases within the crypto sector. By incorporating multiple cryptocurrencies, the US government is hedging against reliance on a single blockchain network. Trump’s decision to include a range of cryptocurrencies in the national reserve also coincides with his ban on research and development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States. His executive order explicitly prevents US agencies from pursuing CBDC initiatives, aligning with the Republican party’s broader skepticism toward central bank-backed digital currencies. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have announced the formation of a bicameral crypto working group, which will work alongside Trump’s administration to craft policy measures that favor private-sector blockchain development while limiting government control over digital assets. Trump’s move to build a multi-crypto reserve has significant economic and political ramifications. While it positions the United States as an aggressive player in digital asset accumulation, it also raises concerns over regulatory clarity, potential volatility, and the challenge of managing a diverse set of digital assets at the government level. Caitlin Long Blasts US Government for Inaction on Crypto Debanking, Calls for Regulatory Overhaul Despite a shift in tone from the US SEC since President Donald Trump returned to the White House, the federal government has done little to address the issue of crypto debanking, according to Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long. Speaking at ETHDenver on Feb. 28, Long criticized federal banking agencies for maintaining restrictive policies toward cryptocurrency firms, arguing that no substantial changes have been made to ease the financial sector's stance on digital assets. The crypto-friendly banking executive added that, while she believes regulatory change is inevitable, Trump has yet to propose a clear path forward for digital assets within the US banking system. Long’s comments highlight an ongoing struggle between crypto firms and traditional banks, as US regulators have historically viewed the industry as a high-risk sector. Since Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, crypto advocates had hoped for a more lenient banking environment, especially given the President’s vocal support for Bitcoin and other digital assets. However, according to Long, the federal regulatory landscape remains largely unchanged. The lack of movement has frustrated many within the blockchain industry, particularly in the wake of Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a federal effort under former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Martin Gruenberg, which allegedly sought to debank crypto-related businesses. Gruenberg, a longtime opponent of cryptocurrency banking integration, stepped down as FDIC Chair earlier this year. His replacement, Acting Chair Travis Hill, has yet to signal a definitive policy shift, leaving crypto banking regulations in limbo. While banking agencies have resisted change, the SEC has made a dramatic pivot in its crypto policy under Trump’s administration. Just one day after Trump’s inauguration, the SEC established a Crypto Task Force, led by commissioner Hester Peirce, to reframe the agency’s stance on digital assets. One of its first actions was rescinding Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121)—a controversial rule that required financial firms to record crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. The repeal of SAB 121 was widely celebrated within the crypto industry, as it had previously discouraged banks from offering custodial services for digital assets. Long acknowledged this ”massive 180” in policy, stating that she hopes a similar shift will soon follow in banking regulations. Beyond banking access, Long emphasized the urgent need for stablecoin regulation. While she believes new legislation is on the horizon, she warned that stronger consumer protections are necessary—particularly in how banks hold cash reserves. Long cited the collapse of Silvergate Bank, a once-prominent crypto-friendly institution, as evidence that poor banking practices can destabilize even the most promising financial models. To protect consumers and ensure the stability of digital assets, Long called for stablecoin issuers to be required to hold cash reserves equal to their outstanding liabilities. What’s Next for Crypto Banking Under Trump? While Trump has vocally supported Bitcoin and other digital assets, his administration’s lack of movement on crypto banking policy remains a key concern. If the White House fails to address these regulatory hurdles, it could undermine America’s ability to remain competitive in the global blockchain sector. With the first-ever White House Crypto Summit scheduled for March 7, industry leaders and policymakers will have an opportunity to discuss the future of digital asset regulation. Long and other crypto executives will likely push for: Overturning restrictive banking policies to allow financial institutions to safely engage with digital assets. A clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, ensuring they are backed by adequate reserves. Leadership changes at key financial agencies, such as the FDIC, to encourage innovation rather than suppression of digital finance. As the Trump administration continues to shape its approach to crypto regulation, the industry is watching closely to see whether banking access will finally open up to digital asset businesses—or if anti-crypto policies will persist. Caitlin Long’s criticisms shed light on the ongoing tension between crypto innovators and traditional financial regulators. While the SEC’s policy shift offers a glimmer of hope, banking restrictions remain a significant barrier for crypto businesses in the United States. With Trump’s administration still formulating its approach, the industry will be looking to the March 7 White House Crypto Summit for concrete action on crypto banking reform. Until then, Long’s message is clear—the government has done nothing yet, and time is running out for meaningful change.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-03 05:30:00

Investor sentiment remains weak, with many fearing a further dip toward $70,000. However, analysts believe Bitcoin will likely stabilize in the $72,000–$80,000 range before making a comeback. Despite the correction, optimism about Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains strong , with Standard Chartered’s head of digital asset research, Geoffrey Kendrick, predicting a massive rally in the coming years. A Tough Market, But a Bright Future In a CNBC interview , Kendrick acknowledged the challenges Bitcoin is currently facing, attributing its decline to increasing market uncertainty and regulatory pressures . However, he sees this as just a temporary setback. He remains confident that Bitcoin will climb to $200,000 by the end of this year and could even reach $500,000 before early 2029. While these figures may seem ambitious, Kendrick believes that key market shifts and increasing institutional interest will drive Bitcoin to new heights. Key Catalysts That Could Fuel the Rally One of the biggest factors, according to Kendrick, is regulatory clarity. He expects new regulations surrounding stablecoins and Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance to provide the legitimacy that institutional investors have been waiting for. As the crypto space becomes more structured and compliant, major financial institutions in the US will start taking crypto as a serious business opportunity . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market is Up Today? 3rd March : Truth Social Donald Trump , Cardano News , XRP Price , Trump Crypto Reserve , Next up are Bitcoin ETFs , which have already sparked a wave of interest, but Kendrick believes this is just the beginning. Large US pension funds, managing a staggering $40 trillion in assets, currently have minimal exposure to Bitcoin ETFs. As regulatory clarity improves, these massive funds could start investing heavily, pushing Bitcoin’s demand to new levels. While he believes that the real game-changer could be sovereign wealth funds. Abu Dhabi’s Sovereign Wealth Fund has already stepped into the Bitcoin ETF space , and Kendrick expects more governments and large-scale funds to follow. This institutional adoption could act as a major catalyst, fueling Bitcoin’s climb to new highs. The Road to $500K While Bitcoin’s short-term outlook remains volatile, Kendrick’s long-term vision suggests that the right mix of regulatory changes, institutional involvement, and ETF growth could propel Bitcoin to half a million dollars. Though challenges still exist, the growing adoption of Bitcoin by major financial players and governments could set the stage for one of the biggest bull runs in crypto history. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

One of the primary catalysts for the current surge is likely US President Donald Trump’s recent hint towards a US XRP Reserve. However, amid this, a top market pundit predicts the asset’s value to soar past the $70 mark with a potential timeline. XRP Price Soars 25% As US Crypto Reserve Gains Momentum XRP price jumped nearly 25% today and exchanged hands at $2.79, while its one-day trading volume skyrocketed $19.09 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high and low of $2.97 and $2.23, respectively. Furthermore, XRP Futures Open Interest rose about 40% to $4.33 billion, its highest level since early February, indicating the regaining confidence of the traders. Meanwhile, the rally comes against the backdrop of the latest US Crypto Reserve comment by Donald Trump . Notably, the social media war between the Bitcoin and Ripple community has recently gained traction, especially amid rumors of XRP Reserve in the US instead of only BTC-focused Reserve. However, Trump said in his Truth Social platform that the US is considering adding XRP, ADA, and SOL to the US Crypto Reserve alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, what lies ahead for Ripple’s native asset? Here we cover how bullish the experts are on the future trajectory of the coin. Ripple Coin Targets $70 Rally, Here’s When In a recent X post, renowned market expert Dark Defender has made a bold prediction for XRP price ahead, setting a short-midterm target of $77.7. In a recent X post, Dark Defender outlined a possible scenario where the crypto could extend toward $18 “with the third wave”. The expert identified key supports at $2.60 and $2.77, and resistances at $5.85, $8.03, and $18.22. According to Dark Defender’s analysis, XRP could reach the $77.7 mark by 2027, as indicated in a shared price chart. Meanwhile, this prediction has generated significant interest among cryptocurrency enthusiasts, who are eagerly watching the asset’s price movements. While market predictions can be uncertain, Dark Defender’s expertise and track record make this forecast worth considering. Source: Dark Defender, X Levels To Watch For Short-term Echoing bullish sentiments, other market experts also remained bullish on the future trajectory of the coin. For context, in a recent analysis CasiTrades said that if the XRP price holds the $2.92 support, it is likely to continue its rally ahead to a new high. Source: CasiTrades, X Simultaneously, another expert Rose Premium Signals also echoed a similar sentiment. According to the expert, the next targets for Ripple’s coin sit at $3, $4.2, and finally $5. Having said that, if the XRP price breaks past the initial two targets, it could rally to $5 in the near term. Source: Rose Premium Signals, X Besides, the market trends also indicate a bullish market sentiment that is currently hovering. For context, renowned market expert Ali Martinez highlighted the massive buying pressure from the XRP whales recently. In a recent X post, Martinez said that large investors have purchased 270 million coins over the weekend.

However, it’s worth noting that an expert has recently refuted claims over the Ripple SEC case’s impact on the crypto’s price ahead.

On Sunday, while traditional finance was off the clock, president Donald Trump announced the creation of a Strategic Crypto Reserve (SCR) for the United States, sending Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies soaring. Eric called the timing “genius” and took a shot at legacy finance. “Traditional finance better catch up, or it will quickly become extinct,” he said . “The world no longer runs on a Mon-Friday, 9 to 5.” Eric Trump speaking at the Student Action Summit, at Palm Beach County Convention Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. Markets reacted instantly. Bitcoin (BTC) surged 10% to $94,343.82, recovering from a three-month low under $80,000 on Friday. Ethereum (ETH) gained 13%. The biggest gainer was Cardano’s ADA, which skyrocketed over 60%. XRP jumped 33%, while Solana’s SOL climbed 25%. The announcement came directly from Donald Trump on Truth Social, where he confirmed that the U.S. government would establish a national reserve holding BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. Trump confirms U.S. crypto reserve, market reacts Trump’s post made it clear—this wasn’t just talk. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” Trump said. He followed up with another post, explicitly including BTC and ETH in the reserve. “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,” he wrote. “I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” This marks the first time Trump has publicly differentiated between a “crypto reserve” and a “stockpile.” A reserve implies active purchasing of crypto over time, while a stockpile would mean simply holding onto existing crypto seized by the U.S. government through law enforcement actions. Trump first introduced the idea of a Bitcoin stockpile last summer at Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville, Tennessee. It was at that event that Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis also pushed for a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. The concept gained traction after Trump’s re-election in November, as Bitcoin surged to new all-time highs on speculation about U.S. government adoption. Trump speaking at Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee But things slowed down when Trump’s executive order on digital assets in late January raised more questions than answers. The order directed the President’s Working Group on Crypto to study “the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile, potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.” The wording of “digital asset stockpile” instead of “crypto reserve” left many investors uncertain about what exactly was coming. Crypto community divided on Trump’s reserve plan Reactions from the crypto industry were split. Many saw the SCR as a bullish move, while others questioned what it would mean long term. One of the biggest debates is which cryptocurrencies belong in the reserve. Some argue that Bitcoin should be the only asset held, as it is the most decentralized and secure. Others disagree with the government picking winners and losers by including XRP, SOL, and ADA alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Another group completely opposes the idea of a U.S. crypto reserve. They warn that it could destabilize the U.S. dollar or be liquidated by a future administration. “The next election could see a new administration come in and need to find money to pay debt, social security, etc. They could sell the reserve,” said Adam Blumberg, vice president of Enclave Group. Blumberg also questioned whether the U.S. government should be holding crypto at all. “I just don’t like the idea of the U.S. government, or any government, owning the most decentralized asset ever,” he said. “That’s not what it was created for [and puts] too much power in the hands of the federal government, which is always in a 4-year, or even 2-year, cycle.” Bitcoin had been struggling since Trump’s executive order, closing out its worst month since 2022. But with this Strategic Crypto Reserve announcement, everything has changed. The next big moment comes Friday, when Trump hosts the first-ever White House Crypto Summit. Investors will be watching for more details on how the reserve will operate and whether traditional finance finally wakes up. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

41087447,https://zycrypto.com/?p=103054,1740981078,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Aya Miyaguchi is Ethereum Foundation’s New President,https://zycrypto.com/aya-miyaguchi-is-ethereum-foundations-new-president/,"Aya Miyaguchi, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation since 2018, stepped up to the role of president, promising to boost institutional relationships and expand Ethereum’s use. “This new opportunity”, wrote Miyaguchi, “will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly”. Miyaguchi spent 10 years as a high school teacher before joining the crypto exchange Kraken, where she became managing director of the Japanese office. She later became executive director of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) in 2018. During her stay at EF, Miyaguchi helped the crypto transition to proof-of-stake, prioritised decentralisation, and promoted her concept of “subtraction,” which means a more hands-off approach to allowing developers more freedom. In 2022, Under Miyaguchi, Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake, reducing its carbon footprint by 99%. Miyaguchi further focused on layer 2 technologies, expanding the coin’s scaling capabilities. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, supports Miyaguchi and claims she creates an environment conducive to innovations. “As I see it, the role of an ED is to create an environment where others can shine and do their best work, and so every success of the EF – the steady execution of Ethereum hard forks, client interop workshops, Devcon, Ethereum’s culture and steadfast commitment to its mission and values, and more – is in part a result of Aya’s stewardship”. However, some Ethereum community members oppose Miyaguchi, claiming that she is not an effective leader and does not attract new developers to the project, losing talent to rival coins like Solana. Some even blame Miyaguchi for the lagging Ethereum price, even though she has only just become president. Others welcome a leadership change because a new direction may help the project rebound. A restructuring of the EF may also help address issues related to the treasury and the spending of funds on new projects. The Ethereum faction that calls for Miyaguchi’s resignation also wants Danny Ryan to replace her. Ryan is an Ethereum researcher and developer. Although, despite being a developer, Ryan may lack Miyaguchi’s leadership skills, having technical skills but possibly lacking in management skills, a common issue with developer leaders, focusing too much on the trees and not focusing on the larger forest (i.e. big picture, company vision, business scaling). There have also been toxic attacks on Miyaguchi, prompting Buterin to condemn these actions and to remind the community that he still has a lot of say regarding the foundation’s decisions. Miyaguchi has further claimed that the move to place her as President fits in with the Ethereum Foundation’s broader strategy, which includes other issues concerning sustainability and a long-term vision for the project. One of those issues, as highlighted by Miyaguchi, involves the project’s decentralized design, which separates the foundation from other projects with special interests. “We must avoid evolving like a traditional corporation”, wrote Miyaguchi, “because our goal isn’t for EF to ‘win’-it is for Ethereum to win over the long term while staying true to its core values. Ethereum doesn’t grow like a machine; it grows like a garden, strengthened by its biodiversity”. Miyaguchi further references Stewart Brand’s “pace layering” framework to explain Ethereum’s different levels of growth and sustainability. From this perspective, cryptocurrency makes a lot of sense when applied to real-world problems like poverty, access to banking, pollution, and financial security. Like a garden providing relief from an urban environment, cryptocurrency offers relief from corrupt governments. Several controversies within the Ethereum Foundation have negatively affected mainstream adoption. One such prominent case was when EF researchers Justin Drake and Dankrad Feist took paid for advisory roles from the EigenLayer Foundation. Such conflicts of interest have angered community members. A lack of transparency regarding funds has exacerbated the problem. Buterin has stepped in to provide interim leadership until someone can be found to manage the EF treasury properly.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-03 05:51:18

Armstrong has suggested that the US should adopt a Bitcoin-only approach when establishing a national crypto reserve, confirming his stand and support for Bitcoin over the years. Armstrong was reacting to President Trump’s suggestion that the national crypto reserve hold several altcoins. The CEO has joined several Bitcoiners in condemning the idea of having anything other than Bitcoin in the reserve. Most people who believe in Bitcoin have said it is the only cryptocurrency worth hosting in the crypto reserve due to its performance over time. Armstrong’s position has received different feedback, with some users on X bashing his open love for Bitcoin at the expense of other crypto. However, a number of comments have also supported his idea, stating that only Bitcoin can be characterized as a store of value. Coinbase CEO champions Bitcoin as the superior reserve asset Armstrong has openly shown his faith in Bitcoin for a long time. He holds that Bitcoin has unique properties that make it better than other cryptos. For instance, he said Bitcoin scarcity is a strength that can only be compared to Gold. Yet, its portability and divisibility outdo Gold; therefore, it’s best for reserve. At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, the CEO expressed optimism about Bitcoin’s ability to surpass Gold in market capitalization. He is also confident that other countries, including the G20 members, would follow suit if the US Bitcoin were a national reserve. However, his position contradicts Trump’s broader approach, which aims to support the entire cryptocurrency industry by including a range of digital assets in the reserve. Following Trump’s announcement , Bitcoin’s price surged past $94,000, while Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano also saw significant gains. People hold different perspectives on a Bitcoin-only reserve The debate on Bitcoin-only reserve is not as light as it appears. There are accusations that the government is accommodating altcoins to please institutions that advocate for them. Some people read political undertones on the decision. Bitcoiners are adamant that there are pointers that make Bitcoin the only worthy crypto. Analysts have predicted Bitcoin to hit $300,000 in 2025, which is enough to have it as a national reserve. Despite the justifications, people are criticizing having Bitcoin alone in reserve. They argue that having one digital asset, especially Bitcoin, is a big risk due to its volatility. They say that overlooking altcoins will mean losing a big opportunity. One of the social media users responding to Armstrong’s comments reportedly asked whether it had been a sensible strategy to put all reserves into a single digital asset and pointed out that while Bitcoin dominates the space, diversification is always a key strategy in finance. Another criticized the creation of a reserve with cryptocurrencies that have proven to be speculative and could jeopardize a country’s financial stability and insisted that Bitcoin is the only viable instrument to enforce monetary sovereignty. The controversy surrounding the establishment of a US crypto reserve underlines the political economy challenges of incorporating digital assets into national policy in general. Proponents of a total Bitcoin reserve assert its performance, security, and decentralized nature; others warn that a diversified cache would better reflect and account for digital assets’ simmering volatility and evolving utility. With Trump’s endorsement of a multi-asset crypto reserve and Armstrong’s call to focus solely on Bitcoin, the US government must make a critical decision. Should it make one bet on Bitcoin or hedge that position with other cryptocurrencies? Policymakers will need to weigh the long-term economic impact of their decisions as regulatory frameworks come online. Whether Bitcoin is on its own or alongside altcoins, one thing we are sure of is that the debate on crypto reserves has just begun. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While the Bitcoin price experienced a rapid recovery from its low point, the increases in the altcoins in question were even more dramatic. The Ice Is Melting Between Cardano and XRP One of those most surprised by this development was economist Peter Schiff, known for his hostility towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Schiff criticized the XRP front by saying that he understood the idea of a Bitcoin reserve to some extent, but could not make sense of the idea of an XRP reserve.

Hoskinson, in response to Schiff's statements, said that the reason for adding XRP to the strategic reserve is that the coin has great technology, has become a global standard, has survived many tough cycles and has one of the strongest communities. In addition, he added that the US President made the right decision by adding XRP to the reserve. Hoskinson’s response surprised even Ripple’s chief technology officer, David Schwartz, who responded to Hoskinson on X by saying, “Am I dreaming?” *This is not investment advice.

Caroline Crenshaw, SEC Commissioner and Democrat, disagreed with the conclusion, claiming that the agency is overstepping its jurisdiction and should not exclude meme coins from SEC oversight. Crenshaw further argues that the SEC has not provided an adequate definition of a meme coin, let alone made an argument for rejecting them as securities. “The guidance offers no clear definition”, said Crenshaw, “from law or even a basic dictionary. It generally describes a meme coin as an asset reflective of online or social trends, of speculative value, that tends to experience high volatility. But these are near universal hallmarks of crypto assets”. The Division of Corporate Finance reasoned that meme coins are mainly driven by speculation, trends, and social media promotion, whereas traditional securities like stocks and bonds are driven by part ownership in a company and income derived from dividends. The division also concerned itself with the criminal element surrounding meme coins, requiring other agencies, rather than the SEC, to monitor such issues. Meme coins are cryptocurrencies created as internet memes or jokes. They are often spread through social media as trends, but they fundamentally hold no real world value. Owners typically buy meme coins for fun or speculation. “In this regard, meme coins are akin to collectibles,” said the SEC division, having “limited or no use or functionality”. “Given the speculative nature of meme coins, they tend to experience significant market price volatility, and often are accompanied by statements regarding their risks and lack of utility, other than for entertainment or other non-functional purposes”. Recent examples of meme coins include $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens, inspired by the Trump presidential campaign. These tokens hope to take advantage of the recent hype surrounding U.S. politics, but they only reinforce how absurd the concept has become, holding no intrinsic value at all. Since the concept started, there has been an explosion of meme coins. The tokens often have no underlying value and are of little use as cryptocurrencies. In this respect, they do seem to resemble trading cards or other types of collectibles. The SEC’s announcement comes as politicians are trying to introduce regulations against creating meme coins. Californian politician Sam Liccardo aims to prevent elected officials from launching or promoting meme coins. The move comes in response to the Trump token, which oscillated wildly and could be used by politicians to enrich themselves and defraud the public.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|SHIB|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-03 06:05:12
