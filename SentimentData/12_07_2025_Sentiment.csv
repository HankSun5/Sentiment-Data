The Paris prosecutor’s office has confirmed that the national gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit will spearhead the probe. In a statement , Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau confirmed that the investigation targets both X as a corporate entity and unnamed individuals connected to the platform. The probe is centered on two serious potential offenses: the “alteration of the operation” of an automated data processing system, and the “fraudulent extraction of data” from such a system, allegedly carried out “by an organized group.” These charges suggest authorities are examining whether coordinated efforts were made to manipulate the platform’s algorithm and extract data that could compromise national or democratic integrity. French MP claims against X In February, two reports came in from the cybercrime section of the Paris prosecutor’s office about how the social network was allegedly using algorithm manipulation for foreign interference. This made Laure Beccuau’s office start its first investigation into X. Also, both an unnamed senior official from a French public institution described by French media as a cybersecurity manager and a member of parliament called Éric Bothorel made these claims. On Friday, Eric Bothorel welcomed news of the investigation moving forward, saying that they come “at a time when the new Grok update seems to be tipping over to the dark side of the force, with a predominance of questionable, even nauseating, content.” Suite à la communication du @parquetdeParis relative au dossier #X #Twitter et la nouvelle orientation que prend l’enquête notamment sur l'usage des algorithmes de X ""à des fins d'ingérence étrangère"", voici mon communiqué ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/GWXNw1B2GR — Éric Bothorel #FreeCécileKohler (@ebothorel) July 11, 2025 X took down the automatic account for its AI chatbot on July 9 after it spread antisemitic stories on Tuesday afternoon, which wasn’t the first time it happened. Eric Bothorel said that he filed his report as an MP, but also as a citizen who does not want Moscow, Silicon Valley, or anyone else to distort democratic conversations. “I was convinced that information bias, which is particularly strong on the X platform, was serving Elon Musk’s political opinions, and that this could only be achieved through algorithmic manipulation,” the elected official stated. As the prosecutor for Paris, Beccuau has led cases involving the hacking site BreachForums. She is also in charge of the ongoing legal investigation into Telegram and its CEO, Pavel Durov, who was arrested on suspicion of helping criminals use the app. Since then, Durov has been permitted by the court to leave France for Dubai, but the probe is still going on. This is proof that Musk and X are up for a run. European Commission to open investigation into Grok Meanwhile, the European Commission is in touch with X about this issue. Some European lawmakers and the Polish government pressed the European Commission to open an investigation into Grok under the EU’s flagship online safety rules. In Turkey, Grok has been banned for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his late mother. The reason for this is that there is also a lot of damaging and offensive content in these sets, like hate speech and even material about sexually abusing children on the internet. Because the data sets are so big, getting rid of all of this information would be very hard and time-consuming. Grok can also see all of X’s data, which is something other robots can’t do. This makes it more likely that it will repeat content from the platform. Still, Musk has not been swayed. On Thursday, as CEO of Tesla, he revealed that Grok would soon be available in all of its cars. Some people think that the events are in line with Musk’s history of pushing the limits to bring about new ideas. The CEO of a tech company, Katie Harbath, says, “Elon has a reputation of putting stuff out there, getting fast blowback and then making a change.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This isn’t just a casual tweet; it’s a direct challenge to journalistic integrity and a spotlight on the often-contentious relationship between traditional media and the rapidly evolving crypto space. What exactly did CZ claim, and why does this accusation resonate so deeply within the community? CZ ‘s Fiery Accusation: Unpacking the ‘Hit Piece’ Claim On a prominent social media platform, CZ didn’t mince words. He asserted that Bloomberg had once again targeted him with an article, going as far as to suggest it was ‘sponsored by a competitor.’ Furthermore, he highlighted that the piece contained ‘so many factual errors I don’t even know where to begin.’ This isn’t the first time CZ has voiced strong opinions about media coverage, but the direct accusation of a ‘sponsored’ attack elevates this particular incident to a new level of concern for those following crypto news . Let’s break down the core elements of CZ’s claim: The ‘Hit Piece’ Label: This term implies an article designed to damage reputation, often with a biased or incomplete portrayal of facts. It suggests malicious intent rather than objective reporting. ‘Sponsored by a Competitor’: This is a grave accusation, implying a conflict of interest and a breach of journalistic ethics. If true, it would mean Bloomberg’s reporting was influenced by external, vested interests. ‘Factual Errors’: This is perhaps the most actionable part of the accusation. Identifying and correcting factual inaccuracies is a standard part of journalistic accountability. However, without specific examples provided by CZ at the time of his initial statement, the community is left to speculate. Understanding the Context: Bloomberg ‘s Role in Financial Reporting To fully grasp the weight of CZ’s words, it’s crucial to understand who Bloomberg is. Bloomberg LP is a privately held financial, software, data, and media company headquartered in New York City. It’s renowned for its Bloomberg Terminal, a sophisticated software system that provides financial data, analytics, and trading tools to financial professionals. Its news arm, Bloomberg News, is one of the world’s largest financial news organizations, known for its extensive global network of reporters and its focus on market-moving information, economics, and business. Given Bloomberg’s stature and influence, an accusation of a ‘hit piece’ or being ‘sponsored’ is not taken lightly. It raises questions about: Journalistic Integrity: Is a reputable news organization compromising its standards for external influence? Trust in Information: If such claims are true, how can readers trust the information they consume, especially in volatile markets like crypto? Power Dynamics: It highlights the immense power media outlets wield in shaping public perception and market sentiment. The Broader Challenge of Media Bias in Crypto CZ’s accusation isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a symptom of a larger, ongoing tension surrounding media bias in the coverage of cryptocurrencies. For years, the crypto community has often felt that mainstream media outlets, including prominent ones, approach the industry with a skeptical, often negative, or ill-informed bias. This perceived bias can manifest in several ways: Focus on Negatives: Overemphasis on scams, hacks, illicit activities, and price crashes, while underreporting technological advancements, adoption, and positive use cases. Lack of Understanding: Journalists sometimes struggle with the technical complexities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, leading to misinterpretations or oversimplifications. Traditional Finance Lens: Applying traditional financial paradigms to a revolutionary technology that often defies them, leading to critical assessments based on outdated frameworks. Regulatory Uncertainty: Reporting often highlights regulatory crackdowns or warnings, contributing to a narrative of risk and instability. This perceived bias creates a feedback loop: negative coverage can fuel public distrust, potentially impacting adoption and regulatory attitudes, which then can be cited in further negative reporting. It’s a challenging environment for any entity operating in the crypto space, particularly a dominant player like Binance . The Impact on Binance and the Crypto Ecosystem As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance is constantly under the microscope. Its operations span the globe, making it subject to diverse regulatory frameworks and intense scrutiny from governments, financial institutions, and media alike. When its founder, CZ , makes such a public statement against a major media outlet, it has several potential repercussions. Binance has faced its share of regulatory challenges and media scrutiny in the past, making CZ’s response understandable within that context. The exchange has been working to enhance its compliance frameworks and engage more proactively with regulators, making accurate and fair media representation crucial to its ongoing efforts. Navigating the Information Landscape: Actionable Insights for Consuming Crypto News In an era where information spreads rapidly and accusations fly, how can individuals interested in crypto discern truth from noise? CZ’s claims against Bloomberg serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of critical media literacy. Here are some actionable insights: Verify Sources: Don’t just read the headline. Who published the article? What is their reputation? Do they have a track record of balanced reporting? Look for Evidence: Does the article cite specific data, quotes, or documents? Are claims substantiated with verifiable facts, or are they based on anonymous sources or speculation? Consider Multiple Perspectives: Read articles from various news outlets, including those with different editorial slants. Compare their narratives and factual reporting. Follow Original Statements: If a public figure like CZ makes a claim, try to find their original statement (e.g., on their social media, official press releases) rather than relying solely on third-party interpretations. Understand Motivations: Consider the potential motivations of both the reporter/outlet and the subject of the article. Is there a financial interest, a competitive angle, or a desire to shape public opinion? Engage with the Community (Critically): Online crypto communities can offer valuable insights and different viewpoints, but also be aware of echo chambers and misinformation within these groups. Always cross-reference. By adopting a more discerning approach to crypto news , readers can better navigate the complex and often polarized information landscape, making more informed decisions about their investments and understanding of the industry. The Ongoing Saga: What’s Next for CZ , Bloomberg , and Binance ? The accusation by CZ against Bloomberg is more than just a public spat; it’s a reflection of the intense scrutiny and high stakes involved in the cryptocurrency industry. Whether Bloomberg will issue a formal response, provide clarification, or simply stand by its reporting remains to be seen. What is clear is that this incident highlights the delicate balance between journalistic freedom and the potential for perceived or actual bias to influence public perception. For Binance , maintaining a strong public image and fostering trust among its vast user base is paramount. For the broader crypto community, it’s a call to arms for greater media literacy and a deeper understanding of the forces that shape narratives around digital assets. As the crypto space continues to mature, the relationship between its key players and traditional media will undoubtedly evolve, hopefully towards more balanced, informed, and constructive dialogue.

After reaching an unprecedented all-time high, many are wondering: what’s next for the king of crypto? A recent insightful observation from a prominent industry expert suggests that the stage might be set for even greater heights. This isn’t just about celebrating past achievements; it’s about understanding the underlying market dynamics that could propel Bitcoin into a new phase of growth. Prepare to delve into the fascinating world of market indicators and expert analysis that points towards significant Bitcoin upside potential . Unlocking the Mystery: What Drives Bitcoin Upside Potential? In a recent revelation that has sparked considerable discussion across the crypto community, Jeff Park, the astute head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, shared a compelling perspective on Bitcoin’s current market standing. Despite Bitcoin unit price recently establishing a new all-time high, Park highlighted several intriguing observations on X (formerly Twitter): Low Open Interest: This suggests that there isn’t an excessive amount of speculative capital currently tied up in Bitcoin derivatives contracts. A low open interest can indicate that the market isn’t overheated with leveraged bets, leaving room for fresh capital to enter. Low Implied Volatility: Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings. When it’s low, it suggests that options traders are not anticipating large, sudden movements. While counterintuitive, this can sometimes precede significant price action, as the market might be underestimating an impending shift. Low Liquidity: A market with low liquidity means that large orders can have a more significant impact on price. While it can lead to increased volatility during sell-offs, it can also amplify upward movements if strong buying pressure emerges. Park succinctly summarized his analysis, stating, “All you need is a catalyst. No promises, but the probability is [Bitcoin goes] higher now than at any point this year.” This statement is a powerful beacon of hope for many investors, suggesting that the current calm might be the precursor to a storm of positive price action. It implies that the foundational elements for a substantial move are in place, awaiting the right trigger. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook: What Do the Indicators Say? Understanding the broader crypto market outlook requires more than just glancing at price charts. It involves deciphering complex market indicators that offer clues about investor sentiment and potential future movements. Jeff Park’s analysis zeroes in on three critical metrics that, when combined, paint a picture of a market poised for a significant shift, rather than one on the verge of exhaustion. Why Low Open Interest Matters Open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts (like futures or options) that have not yet been settled. High open interest often correlates with high speculative activity and can sometimes signal an overheated market, vulnerable to a sharp correction. Conversely, a low open interest, as observed by Park, can indicate a less crowded trade, meaning there’s less leveraged money that needs to be flushed out. This leaves ample room for new capital inflows to drive prices higher without immediate resistance from over-leveraged positions. The Significance of Low Implied Volatility Implied volatility (IV) is derived from the prices of options contracts and reflects the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations. When IV is low, it means options are cheaper, and traders are not pricing in large swings. Historically, periods of low implied volatility have often preceded significant price movements in Bitcoin. It’s akin to a coiled spring – a period of relative calm before a powerful release. This “calm before the storm” scenario suggests that the market might be underestimating Bitcoin’s true potential for an upward surge. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting its price. Low liquidity means that even relatively small buy or sell orders can cause noticeable price movements. While this can exacerbate downward pressure during corrections, in an environment ripe for a catalyst, low liquidity can amplify upward momentum. If a wave of buying interest emerges, the limited supply available at current prices can quickly push Bitcoin’s value higher, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. Decoding Bitcoin Price Prediction: Are We Headed Higher? The core of Jeff Park’s statement lies in his Bitcoin price prediction : the probability of Bitcoin going higher now is greater than at any point this year. This isn’t just a hopeful wish; it’s an assessment based on the confluence of these specific market conditions. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the methodology behind such predictions is crucial. Analysts like Park often look for divergences between price action and underlying market health indicators. When Bitcoin hits a new all-time high, but speculative metrics like open interest and implied volatility remain subdued, it suggests that the rally isn’t fueled by irrational exuberance or excessive leverage. Instead, it implies a more organic, sustainable growth, potentially driven by spot market demand and long-term conviction. Consider the following: Healthy Consolidation: The current market structure might be a period of healthy consolidation after reaching an ATH, rather than a top. This allows new buyers to enter and previous holders to take profits without crashing the market. Reduced Speculative Overhang: With low open interest, there’s less risk of a massive cascade of liquidations if the price were to dip slightly, making the market more resilient to minor corrections. Anticipation of Catalysts: The market is effectively a dry tinderbox, waiting for a spark. Potential catalysts could include: Further institutional adoption (e.g., new ETF approvals, corporate treasury allocations). Significant regulatory clarity or positive legislative developments. Macroeconomic shifts favoring scarce assets (e.g., inflation concerns, weakening fiat currencies). Technological advancements or network upgrades (though less direct for BTC price action, it can boost overall crypto sentiment). Embracing the BTC All-Time High: A Foundation for Future Growth? Reaching a BTC All-Time High is often seen as a significant psychological and technical milestone. For some, it signals the peak, while for others, it’s merely a stepping stone. Jeff Park’s analysis suggests the latter. Instead of being a point of exhaustion, this ATH, coupled with the subdued derivatives market, might represent a robust foundation for the next leg up. Historically, Bitcoin has often consolidated after hitting new highs before embarking on further parabolic runs. What makes this particular ATH different, according to Park, is the absence of the typical speculative frenzy that often accompanies such milestones. This indicates that the current price discovery is perhaps more fundamentally driven, allowing for a more sustainable climb. Key takeaways from the current ATH scenario: Indicator Current State (per Park) Implication for Upside Open Interest Low Less leverage, more room for fresh capital. Implied Volatility Low Market underestimating future price moves, coiled spring. Liquidity Low Amplifies price movements with strong buying pressure. Price Action New All-Time High Strong underlying demand, not overleveraged. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Analysis? The insights from Jeff Park, coming from Bitwise – a prominent institutional crypto asset manager – carry significant weight. His perspective offers a glimpse into how sophisticated players conduct their institutional crypto analysis . For institutional investors, risk management and understanding market structure are paramount. The observations of low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity are not just technical points; they are crucial signals for deployment of large capital. Institutions typically seek markets that offer both potential for growth and manageable risk. A market that has hit an ATH but isn’t showing signs of speculative overheating can be particularly attractive. It suggests that the price appreciation is more “real” and less prone to sudden, violent corrections driven by leveraged liquidations. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor not just price, but also key on-chain and derivatives metrics. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, market volatility is inherent. Always practice sound risk management, including setting stop-losses and only investing what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey is often characterized by significant corrections within broader bull markets. A long-term perspective often yields the best results. Identify Catalysts: Keep an eye on potential catalysts mentioned earlier, as these could be the triggers for the next major move. Are There Any Challenges or Counterarguments? While Jeff Park’s analysis is compelling, it’s essential to consider potential challenges. The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. A “catalyst” might not materialize as expected, or unforeseen macroeconomic events could shift sentiment. Regulatory crackdowns, significant exchange hacks, or sustained FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) could also impact price action. Moreover, low liquidity, while amplifying upside, can also amplify downside if a strong selling wave emerges. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consider a balanced perspective. Conclusion: The Path Ahead for Bitcoin Jeff Park’s insightful analysis from Bitwise provides a powerful bullish argument for Bitcoin’s immediate future. By highlighting the subdued nature of speculative indicators despite a new all-time high, he paints a picture of a market that is consolidating healthily and preparing for its next major move. The low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity suggest a market that is not over-leveraged, but rather poised for an “explosive” surge once the right catalyst emerges. While no one can promise future returns, the confluence of these factors significantly enhances the probability of further Bitcoin upside potential . As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, understanding these nuanced market signals becomes increasingly vital for navigating its exciting journey.

Pulte has reacted to reports that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is considering resigning. Pulte posted on his official X account that he is encouraged by the reports of Chair Powell considering to resign. “I’m encouraged by reports that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. I think this will be the right decision for America, and the economy will boom,” Pulte noted . The Beef Between Chair Powell and President Donald Trump Although not officially confirmed, the reports that Fed Chair Powell is considering to resign stems from the misalignment with the Donald Trump administration. In the past few months, President Trump has urged Chair Powell to lower the interest rates to bolster the country’s economic growth. “Tech Stocks, Industrial Stocks, Nasdaq, hit all-time high, record high! Crypto through is the roof, Nvidia is up 47% since Trump tariffs. USA is taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs … .The Fed should rapidly lower rates to reflect this strength,” Trump noted on TruthSocial. According to President Trump, the Fed ought to have cut its benchmark rate by 3 points, since the inflation has declined. However, the Fed Chair has reiterated several times that the tariffs will likely increase inflation amid weakening U.S. dollar. What Next for Crypto? If Fed Chair Powell resigns in the coming days as predicted by Pulte, President Trump will replace him with his team members. As a result, the odds of several rate cuts in the United States before the end of 2025 will skyrocket.With the crypto market already in the early stages of a parabolic rally, several rate cuts could further fuel the underlying bullish outlook.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-11 22:26:32

Florida AG subpoenaed internal records to verify Robinhood’s claim of being the cheapest crypto trading platform. Despite scrutiny, Robinhood pushes global crypto growth with $200M Bitstamp acquisition completed. Florida Launches Investigation into Robinhood Crypto Robinhood Crypto LLC is facing a state-level investigation in Florida over how it promotes its trading costs. The state’s Attorney General, James Uthmeier, said the platform’s claim to offer “the least expensive way to purchase crypto” doesn’t appear to be backed by evidence. “Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive,” Uthmeier said. The AG’s office has issued a subpoena for internal documents, including any records supporting the claim that Robinhood offers the lowest trading costs on average. Marketing vs. Actual Costs Robinhood operates as a commission-free platform but earns from routing trades to third-party firms through payment for order flow. Florida officials say this practice may mean users pay more than expected, even if they aren’t charged upfront fees. The state’s probe will look at whether customers are given a full picture of what they pay. Uthmeier added, “When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions.” SEC Closes Separate Probe into Robinhood Crypto While Robinhood now faces scrutiny in Florida, it recently cleared a federal regulatory hurdle. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ended its long-standing investigation into the company’s crypto unit without taking action. That decision removes a major obstacle for Robinhood as it pushes deeper into digital assets. The company also sent a proposal to the SEC last month, calling for updated rules around tokenized real-world assets. It asked regulators to treat blockchain-based versions of assets like real estate or stocks the same as their traditional forms, rather than as derivatives. Despite the state investigation, Robinhood is moving ahead with its global expansion. As CryptoPotato reported , the company has completed a $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, gaining access to customers across Europe, the UK, and Asia. The move marks a shift toward serving larger institutions alongside retail users. Meanwhile, Robinhood shares ended Thursday at $98.70, up 4.4% for the day, according to Yahoo Finance .

While Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, smashing through its previous all-time highs and setting new records, a curious phenomenon is unfolding across the broader market. Despite Bitcoin’s triumphant ascent, a significant portion of the altcoin market remains surprisingly subdued, exhibiting what many are calling a distinct altcoin lag . This unusual divergence raises crucial questions for investors and enthusiasts alike: Is this a sign of a healthier, more sustainable rally, or a precursor to further market shifts? Let’s delve into the data and unravel what this unique market dynamic truly signifies for the future of cryptocurrency trends . Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Phenomenon Bitcoin’s journey to a new all-time high has been nothing short of spectacular. This latest surge has cemented its position as the undisputed leader of the crypto realm. Data cited by The Kobeissi Letter, referencing Sentimentrader on X, highlights this dominance starkly: despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high, nearly 0% of other cryptocurrencies are trading within 5% of their respective 252-day highs. This statistic underscores a highly concentrated rally, where capital seems to be flowing almost exclusively into Bitcoin. What’s driving this singular focus on Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Institutional Inflow: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large investment firms, pension funds, and wealth managers now have a regulated, accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging. This influx of significant capital naturally prioritizes the most liquid and established asset. Halving Narrative: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, continues to be a powerful narrative. Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs, creating anticipation and driving demand. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and traditional financial instability. This perception attracts a broader range of investors seeking a safe haven. First-Mover Advantage: As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin possesses unparalleled brand recognition, network security, and liquidity, making it the primary choice for new capital entering the crypto space. The Curious Case of Altcoin Lag : Why Aren’t They Following? The stark contrast between Bitcoin’s stellar performance and the subdued state of altcoins is perplexing to many. In previous bull cycles, a Bitcoin rally typically served as a precursor, pulling the entire market upwards, with altcoins eventually experiencing even larger percentage gains. So, why the current altcoin lag ? The Sentimentrader statistic – almost zero altcoins within 5% of their 252-day highs – paints a clear picture of underperformance. Here are key reasons contributing to this divergence: Liquidity Concentration: The immense capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs has absorbed a significant portion of the new money entering the crypto market. This means less liquidity is immediately available to trickle down into altcoins. Investors are opting for the most direct and regulated exposure to the asset class, which is currently Bitcoin. Risk Aversion: During the initial stages of a bull market, or when macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to be more risk-averse. They prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, perceived as the safest and most established crypto asset, before venturing into the higher-risk, higher-reward altcoin space. Lack of Dominant Altcoin Narratives (Yet): While some altcoin sectors like AI, DePIN, or Real World Assets (RWAs) are gaining traction, a broad, compelling narrative that captures widespread retail and institutional attention for altcoins, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF story, has not fully materialized. Market Maturity: The crypto market is maturing. Institutional participants are more discerning. They conduct deeper due diligence, focusing on fundamental value, regulatory clarity, and sustainable tokenomics, rather than simply chasing speculative gains across all altcoins. Phased Market Cycles: Historically, crypto bull markets unfold in phases. Bitcoin often leads the charge, followed by large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum), and then smaller-cap altcoins and meme coins. The current market might simply be in the ‘Bitcoin-first’ phase. Historical Context: Past Rallies and Bitcoin All-Time High Behaviors To understand the current market, it’s crucial to look at historical precedents. Past rallies often provide clues, though every cycle has its unique characteristics. The original report notes that in previous rallies, Bitcoin highs coincided with stronger altcoin performance, citing examples where 75% (likely referring to the Feb 2021 period) and 40% (perhaps Nov 2021) of altcoins showed robust gains. Consider the 2017 and 2021 bull runs: 2017 Bull Run: Bitcoin’s initial surge to its then all-time high was followed by an explosive ‘altcoin season’ in early 2018, where many altcoins saw parabolic gains, some even outperforming Bitcoin significantly. 2020-2021 Bull Run: Bitcoin broke its 2017 high in late 2020 and continued its ascent into 2021. This was again followed by a broad altcoin rally, particularly strong in spring 2021, driven by DeFi, NFTs, and other emerging narratives. Ethereum, in particular, saw substantial growth. The current cycle, while exhibiting Bitcoin’s leadership, shows a more pronounced and prolonged altcoin lag at this stage. This suggests a potentially more deliberate and perhaps more institutionally-driven market. The ‘smart money’ might be consolidating positions in Bitcoin before strategically diversifying into select altcoins with strong fundamentals or compelling narratives. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis : What Does This Divergence Mean? This unusual divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. A thorough crypto market analysis is essential to interpret these signals correctly. Potential Interpretations: More Upside for Bitcoin: The initial report suggests that the current divergence implies Bitcoin’s rally may still have room to run. If altcoins haven’t caught up yet, it could mean that the broader market has not yet reached its peak euphoria phase, and Bitcoin’s ascent is still in its primary stage. A Healthier, More Sustainable Rally: Some analysts argue that a Bitcoin-led rally, rather than a speculative altcoin frenzy, indicates a more mature and sustainable market. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin provides a strong foundation, potentially leading to less volatile, more gradual growth across the ecosystem. Impending Altcoin Season: Many seasoned investors view the current lag as a sign that an ‘altcoin season’ is merely delayed, not canceled. Once Bitcoin consolidates its gains or its momentum slows, capital could rotate into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Increased Market Bifurcation: It’s also possible that the market is becoming more bifurcated, with Bitcoin establishing itself as a premier, lower-risk asset, while altcoins remain a higher-risk, higher-reward play. This could lead to a permanent shift in how different segments of the crypto market behave. Actionable Insights for Investors: Patience is Key: For altcoin holders, patience may be paramount. Historical patterns suggest that altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with a delay. Strategic Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing portfolios. If Bitcoin has significantly outperformed, taking some profits and reallocating to fundamentally strong altcoins that have lagged could be a strategy, assuming you believe in their long-term potential. Focus on Fundamentals: When considering altcoins, prioritize projects with strong technology, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. Avoid purely speculative plays. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to use DCA strategies to accumulate positions in both Bitcoin and chosen altcoins, mitigating volatility risks. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins carry higher risk. Diversify your altcoin holdings and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Future Cryptocurrency Trends : What to Expect Next? Predicting the future of cryptocurrency trends is always challenging, but the current market dynamics offer some clues about potential paths forward. The divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins sets the stage for several interesting scenarios: Rotation into Large-Cap Altcoins: Once Bitcoin’s initial surge cools, capital may first rotate into established large-cap altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and others with significant ecosystems and development activity. Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades, particularly those related to scalability and efficiency, could serve as a major catalyst. Sector-Specific Rallies: Instead of a broad altcoin season, we might see more targeted rallies in specific sectors that are gaining traction. This could include AI-related tokens, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), GameFi, or Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects. Investors will need to be highly selective. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: As capital moves more strategically, altcoins might experience more pronounced swings. Those with weak fundamentals or limited utility could struggle to regain their previous highs, while strong projects could see significant gains. Regulatory Impact: The evolving regulatory landscape will play a crucial role. Clearer regulations could attract more institutional money into altcoins, while uncertainty could continue to dampen enthusiasm. Innovation Driving Adoption: Continued innovation in blockchain technology, such as advancements in layer-2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and user-friendly applications, will be critical for driving broader adoption and, consequently, altcoin growth. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these potential shifts is paramount. The current Bitcoin-led rally could be laying the groundwork for a broader market expansion, but it may unfold differently than in past cycles, demanding a more nuanced investment approach. In conclusion, while Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs is a cause for celebration among its holders, the accompanying altcoin lag is a notable characteristic of the current market cycle. This divergence, as highlighted by Sentimentrader, suggests that while Bitcoin may still have significant upside potential, the broader market’s full rally might be yet to come, or it may unfold in a more selective and mature manner than previously observed. Understanding the forces driving Bitcoin’s dominance and the reasons behind altcoin’s current underperformance is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Patience, strategic analysis, and a focus on fundamental value will be key for investors looking to capitalize on the next phase of cryptocurrency trends .

Thanks to the coin’s sharp rise this week, Satoshi’s fortune has grown by billions of dollars. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, the recent Bitcoin price rally has boosted the mysterious creator’s net worth. Satoshi Nakamoto is now reportedly richer than Amancio Ortega, the founder of fashion giant Zara. He is now ranked as the 12th richest person in the world. Bitcoin’s Price Rally Sends Nakamoto’s Net Worth Soaring On Thursday, July 10, the top coin reached a record high of $116,842, sparking even more excitement in the crypto market. By Friday, Bitcoin ‘s price climbed further to hit $118,909, a new all-time high. However, the market has pulled back slightly, now trading at $117,690, but up by 5.78% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. This substantial rise followed a massive $1.18 billion inflow into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This marked the most significant single-day investment into the investment funds in 2025 so far. As a result of this surge, Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash, believed to be about 1.096 million BTC, grew significantly in value. In just 24 hours, the worth of these coins jumped by more than $8 billion. As of now, his holdings are valued at approximately $129.42 billion. Satoshi Nakamoto: One of the Richest, But Still Unknown Despite this staggering wealth, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. The individual or group behind the name has never revealed their identity. Even more intriguing, the Bitcoin linked to Satoshi has never been moved or spent since the cryptocurrency’s early days. His crypto wallets have remained dormant for over 15 years. This silence has fueled endless debate in the crypto world. Some believe Satoshi is gone, while others think he is choosing to stay hidden forever. His untouched fortune adds to the legend of Bitcoin’s creation. Many see it as a sign that Satoshi wanted the digital to be for the people, not for personal gain. Bitcoin’s Big Week The flagship crypto has seen one of its strongest weeks in 2025. Reportedly, it is on track for nearly a 10% weekly gain. The crypto market has responded strongly to rising demand, especially from institutional investors pouring money into Bitcoin ETFs. Recently, 10x Research analyst Markus Thielen said many traders haven’t bought enough Bitcoin after last month’s options expiry. He believes this could lead to a rally that pushes BTC up to $133,000 by September. As the crypto asset grows and gains mainstream acceptance, so too does the value of Satoshi Nakamoto’s hidden fortune.

48064040,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=177288,1752273648,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48064040.jpeg,Binance Stablecoin: Unpacking the Explosive USD1 Allegations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-stablecoin-usd1-allegations/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to controversy, but a recent Bloomberg report has sent shockwaves through the industry, pointing fingers at crypto giant Binance. At the heart of the matter lies a stablecoin named USD1, reportedly tied to the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLF). This report suggests a deep involvement from Binance in the creation and distribution of this particular Binance Stablecoin , raising significant questions about political influence, business ethics, and the very fabric of the digital asset space. Binance Stablecoin: Did the Crypto Giant Help Launch USD1? According to a bombshell report from Bloomberg, crypto exchange powerhouse Binance allegedly played a pivotal role in the development and deployment of USD1, a stablecoin linked to the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLF). The publication, citing three individuals familiar with the situation, claims that Binance assisted in writing the smart contract for USD1. This is a significant technical undertaking, as smart contracts are the foundational code that governs how a digital asset operates on a blockchain, dictating its rules, issuance, and transfer mechanisms. If true, this involvement would mean Binance provided core technological infrastructure for WLF’s stablecoin ambitions. Beyond just the technical development, the report further alleges that Binance facilitated the stablecoin’s availability for use through a massive $2 billion transaction. While the exact nature of this transaction remains somewhat opaque in the initial report, it suggests a substantial financial commitment or arrangement that would have enabled USD1 to gain significant liquidity and reach within the crypto ecosystem. This level of alleged involvement, both technical and financial, paints a picture of a much deeper partnership than mere listing or advisory roles, thrusting the Binance Stablecoin narrative into an entirely new light. Unpacking USD1 Stablecoin: What Are Its Controversial Ties? The USD1 Stablecoin itself is a central figure in this unfolding drama. Stablecoins are a crucial component of the cryptocurrency market, designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They aim to combine the benefits of blockchain technology (such as fast, low-cost transactions) with the stability of traditional currencies, making them ideal for trading, remittances, and hedging against crypto volatility. However, the controversy surrounding USD1 stems not from its technical design, but from its reported associations. USD1 is linked to World Liberty Financial (WLF), an entity associated with the Trump family. This connection immediately raises eyebrows, especially given the current political climate and the increasing scrutiny on the intersection of politics and finance. The idea of a stablecoin, a digital asset meant to be neutral and universally accessible, having direct ties to a prominent political family introduces a layer of complexity and potential conflict that is rarely seen in the crypto space. The report’s implication that political influence was potentially leveraged for business gain through this stablecoin further complicates the narrative, prompting a deeper look into the transparency and governance of such ventures. World Liberty Financial: Is Political Influence Shaping Crypto? The involvement of World Liberty Financial and its alleged ties to the Trump family introduces a critical dimension to this story: the potential for political influence to shape the trajectory of a cryptocurrency project. The Bloomberg report explicitly highlights a ‘conflict of interest issue,’ suggesting that political sway may have been used to advance business interests within the digital asset sphere. This isn’t just about a company launching a stablecoin; it’s about who that company is connected to, and how those connections might impact the broader market and regulatory landscape. In an industry that often champions decentralization and independence from traditional financial and political structures, such allegations are particularly potent. They challenge the perception of crypto as a purely meritocratic or technologically driven space, suggesting that real-world political capital could be a significant factor in a project’s success or adoption. For regulators, this scenario could underscore the urgent need for clearer guidelines on political lobbying, transparency in stablecoin reserves, and the prevention of undue influence in the burgeoning digital economy. The very notion of a politically connected stablecoin, whether through direct involvement or indirect influence, sparks debate about the future integrity and perceived neutrality of digital finance. Crypto Conflict of Interest: How Did CZ Respond to the Allegations? The allegations of a Crypto Conflict of Interest involving Binance and the USD1 stablecoin naturally drew a swift response from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Known for his direct communication style, CZ took to social media to address the claims, stating unequivocally that the article’s claims are ‘groundless.’ This direct denial from one of the most influential figures in the crypto world adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, pitting a major financial news outlet’s investigative reporting against the public statements of a powerful industry leader. CZ’s denial highlights the challenge of verifying information in the fast-paced and often opaque world of cryptocurrency. On one hand, investigative journalism plays a vital role in holding powerful entities accountable. On the other hand, the crypto industry has frequently been the target of misinformation or sensationalized reporting, leading to a climate of skepticism. Binance, under CZ’s leadership, has faced numerous regulatory challenges and legal battles globally, making any new allegation, especially one involving political ties, a significant point of concern for its reputation and ongoing operations. The market and public will now watch closely to see if further evidence emerges to substantiate or refute Bloomberg’s claims. Beyond the Headlines: What Does This Mean for Blockchain News and Trust? This Bloomberg report is more than just a piece of breaking Blockchain News ; it’s a potent reminder of the growing pains and evolving challenges within the digital asset industry. Allegations of a major exchange facilitating a stablecoin for a politically connected entity, coupled with claims of a conflict of interest, underscore several critical themes that the crypto world must confront: Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto moves further into the mainstream, it inevitably attracts more attention from regulators. Reports like this will likely intensify calls for stricter oversight, particularly concerning stablecoins, their reserves, and the entities that issue or facilitate them. Governments are increasingly concerned about financial stability, consumer protection, and preventing illicit activities, and politically charged collaborations could accelerate regulatory actions. Industry Transparency: The incident highlights the ongoing need for greater transparency within the crypto ecosystem. While blockchain technology itself is transparent, the operations of centralized exchanges and the relationships between various crypto projects and traditional entities often remain opaque. Increased transparency regarding partnerships, funding, and governance structures could help build greater trust. Trust and Reputation: For Binance, a company that has worked to navigate a complex global regulatory landscape, these allegations could impact its reputation and perceived trustworthiness. For the broader crypto industry, such stories can erode public confidence, making it harder to attract new users and institutional adoption. Maintaining trust is paramount for the long-term growth and legitimacy of digital assets. The Interplay of Power: The report clearly demonstrates how traditional power structures—political influence and established media—are increasingly intersecting with the nascent world of crypto. This dynamic will continue to shape the industry’s future, as crypto projects navigate not just technological hurdles but also complex political and economic landscapes. Ultimately, this situation serves as a critical test for the crypto industry’s maturity and its commitment to principles of fairness and transparency. How these allegations are resolved, and how the industry responds to the challenges they present, will be vital for its future trajectory. The Bloomberg report on Binance’s alleged involvement with the USD1 stablecoin and World Liberty Financial has ignited a firestorm of debate. From claims of Binance’s direct role in smart contract development and a massive $2 billion transaction to the contentious issue of political influence, the narrative is complex and fraught with implications. While Binance founder CZ has vehemently denied the allegations, the story underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency, traditional finance, and political power. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, issues of transparency, regulatory compliance, and potential conflicts of interest will remain at the forefront, shaping the future of blockchain technology and public trust in this dynamic space. The crypto community awaits further developments in this intriguing and potentially industry-defining saga.

On Friday, July 11, 2025, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Jim Banks sent a joint letter to Nvidia’s CEO, Huang. They urged him not to meet with companies suspected of working around US export controls or those believed to be aiding China’s defense or intelligence agencies. The pair pressed Huang to avoid any talks with organizations listed under the United States government’s export restrictions. Their request extends not only to firms that might chip away at American technology safeguards but also to any entity officially banned from receiving U.S. semiconductors. “We are worried that your trip to the PRC could legitimize companies that cooperate closely with the Chinese military or involve discussing exploitable gaps in U.S. export controls,” the letter states. It adds, “There is a new bipartisan consensus that the hardware powering advanced AI, which includes NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), is of immense strategic importance.” Huang was due for his China visit on Friday. In response to the letter, a spokesperson from NVIDIA said that when U.S. technology becomes the world standard, “America wins.” The spokesperson noted that China hosts the largest number of software engineers globally and argued that AI applications “should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.” Earlier this year, at Taipei’s Computex trade show during May 2025, Huang praised former President Donald Trump’s move to lift certain AI chip export curbs. He called the previous diffusion rules a “failure” and said they ultimately spurred Chinese firms to build their own high-end chips. In April 2025, Washington tightened export restrictions on advanced AI chips. Huang warned that those rules would slash NVIDIA’s revenue by about $15 billion, noting that the company had modified its products to comply with U.S. regulations. In their letter, Banks and Warren pointed out that chips used for cutting-edge AI have become a rare issue that unites lawmakers from both parties in favor of looser export paths. They warned that AI can “accelerate the PRC’s effort to modernize its military.” Congress is worried about China dodging the U.S. controls Congressional concern has also grown over efforts to dodge U.S. controls. Lawmakers have proposed requiring chipmakers to track and verify the final destination of the products. In June 2025, Reuters revealed that DeepSeek was working with China’s military and had used third parties to bypass U.S. export limits. Reuters also reported earlier that NVIDIA plans to release a lower-cost version of Blackwell chips specifically for the Chinese market. In their letter, the senators highlighted NVIDIA’s new Shanghai research facility as one sign that the company’s moves could strengthen China’s domestic AI and semiconductor industries. According to the Financial Times , earlier in July 2025, Huang is set to attend Beijing’s International Supply Chain Expo, which kicks off this coming Wednesday. Sources familiar with the matter said that the CEO hopes to meet Premier Qiang and Vice-Premier Lifeng. Those meetings are still being finalized and require Beijing’s approval. At Computex in Taipei, Huang argued that U.S. export curbs had only pushed companies in China to speed up their AI projects. He noted that NVIDIA’s share of the China AI-chip market had fallen from roughly 95 percent in 2021 to about 50 percent today, and he predicted that China’s AI sector could soon be worth $50 billion. During his trip, Huang would stress NVIDIA’s continued focus on China despite various export restrictions resulting in losses worth several billion for the company. A person with knowledge of the plans said the cheaper Blackwell chip will not ship before September 2025, after NVIDIA secures a green signal from the US government.

In a stunning display of market power, XRP has surged, leading the charge among the top 10 cryptocurrencies and sparking immense interest. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a significant move that signals shifting tides in the broader digital assets landscape. What’s Fueling the Remarkable XRP Price Surge? In a move that caught many by surprise, XRP experienced an impressive surge of over 12% within a mere 24 hours, climbing to $2.79. This outstanding performance positioned it firmly ahead of market giants like Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, showcasing its individual strength and renewed investor confidence. Over the past week alone, XRP has clocked nearly a 27% gain, demonstrating consistent upward momentum. While still approximately 18% below its ambitious 2018 all-time high of $3.40, this recent rally indicates a strong recovery trajectory. The question on everyone’s mind is: what’s behind this sudden burst of energy? It’s a combination of market dynamics and a renewed focus on regulatory clarity, particularly concerning crypto policy . Decoding XRP Open Interest : A Bullish Indicator? One of the most compelling metrics underpinning XRP’s recent ascent is the dramatic increase in its futures open interest. According to data from CoinGlass, open interest for XRP futures soared to $7.2 billion, bringing it tantalizingly close to its January peak of $8.3 billion and marking a significant six-month high. But what exactly does this mean for the average investor? Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially when coupled with a rising price, is often interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that new money is flowing into the market, and traders are opening new long positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset’s future price direction. For XRP, this surge in open interest points to: Increased Market Confidence: More traders are willing to bet on XRP’s continued rise. Growing Liquidity: A healthier market with more participants. Potential for Further Momentum: As long as open interest continues to climb alongside price, the rally could sustain. This metric provides a crucial glimpse into the sentiment of professional traders and institutions, whose collective actions often dictate short-to-medium term price movements. Ripple Crypto ‘s Strategic Plays and Political Engagement It’s no secret that Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been at the forefront of advocating for regulatory clarity in the United States. Their protracted legal battle with the SEC has been a defining feature of XRP’s journey, and any hint of a more favorable regulatory environment can significantly impact its valuation. The recent rally aligns with a renewed interest in crypto policy under the potential Trump administration, as reported by Decrypt. Ripple has consistently engaged in political outreach and lobbying efforts, aiming to shape a regulatory framework that fosters innovation rather than stifles it. This proactive approach, coupled with potential shifts in the political landscape, could be a game-changer. A more permissive or clearer regulatory stance from the U.S. government could: Reduce Regulatory Uncertainty: Making XRP a more attractive asset for institutional investors. Boost Adoption: Paving the way for broader use of Ripple’s payment solutions. Improve Market Sentiment: Dispelling the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) that has long plagued XRP. Ripple’s continued political engagement underscores its commitment to navigating the complex regulatory maze, a factor that investors are increasingly weighing when evaluating digital assets . Navigating the Broader Crypto Policy Landscape Under Trump The discussion around XRP’s surge cannot be separated from the wider discourse on crypto policy . The prospect of a Trump administration has injected a new layer of optimism into the crypto community, with many hoping for a more industry-friendly approach compared to the current regulatory climate. Former President Trump has recently expressed more favorable views towards cryptocurrencies, signaling a potential shift from previous stances. Why does this matter? Regulatory clarity is the bedrock upon which institutional adoption and mainstream integration of digital assets will be built. Ambiguity or outright hostility from regulators can deter significant investment and hinder innovation. A more defined and supportive policy framework could: Attract Institutional Capital: Big players need certainty to commit large sums. Foster Innovation: Companies can build and scale without fear of sudden regulatory crackdowns. Protect Consumers: Clear rules can also lead to better consumer safeguards. The interplay between political developments and market movements is becoming increasingly evident, with XRP serving as a prime example of how policy signals can translate into significant price action. XRP’s Position in the Evolving Digital Assets Market Beyond the immediate catalysts, XRP’s long-term value proposition lies in its unique role within the digital assets ecosystem. Designed for fast, low-cost international payments, XRP aims to be a bridge currency for financial institutions. Its underlying technology, the XRP Ledger, offers speed and efficiency that traditional banking systems often lack. While Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ and Ethereum as the backbone for decentralized applications, XRP carves out its niche in the realm of cross-border remittances and liquidity solutions. This specialization, combined with Ripple’s enterprise focus, positions XRP distinctly among its peers. However, it also faces challenges: Competition: Other blockchain projects and traditional payment systems are also vying for market share. Regulatory Hurdles: Despite recent positive developments, the path to full regulatory clarity remains ongoing. Centralization Concerns: Some critics point to the concentration of XRP holdings and Ripple’s influence over the network. Despite these challenges, the recent XRP price surge and renewed interest highlight its enduring relevance and potential in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights The current surge in XRP, driven by a confluence of market interest and shifting crypto policy , offers several takeaways for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike: Stay Informed on Policy: Regulatory developments, especially concerning digital assets , are becoming increasingly influential on market prices. Keep an eye on political statements and proposed legislation. Monitor Open Interest: For those trading futures, understanding XRP open interest can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Diversify and Research: While XRP is performing strongly, the crypto market remains volatile. Always conduct thorough research and consider diversifying your portfolio. Understand Ripple’s Strategy: Ripple’s corporate and political actions directly impact XRP. Following their announcements and partnerships can offer foresight. A Compelling Future for XRP? XRP’s recent performance is more than just a fleeting rally; it’s a powerful indicator of renewed confidence and the profound impact of regulatory dynamics on the crypto market. The surge in XRP open interest , coupled with Ripple’s strategic political engagement and the evolving crypto policy landscape, paints a promising picture for this unique digital asset . While challenges remain, the current momentum suggests that XRP is firmly back in the conversation as a significant player shaping the future of finance.

You might also like: RICH Miner simplifies cloud mining with real-time passive returns Storage ≠ appreciation: The limitations of traditional coinbase strategies Many investors choose to store cryptocurrencies in centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase or decentralized wallets, such as MetaMask, SafePal. This frozen asset method ensures security but lacks the ability to increase value. In a bull market, price increases may bring profits, but in a consolidation period or a bear market, assets not only cannot appreciate, but may even depreciate. Simple storage means missing the opportunity for active returns. The rise of cloud mining: a passive income tool that breaks the technical threshold Traditional mining used to be the patent of technology geeks and large mining farms. Ordinary people who want to participate are often limited by high hardware costs, electricity costs and technical maintenance barriers. However, the emergence of cloud mining has changed everything. Through platforms such as RICH Miner, users do not need to purchase equipment. They only need to register, select contracts, and invest in mainstream assets such as USDT or BTC to obtain stable cryptocurrency income every day, truly realizing using assets to generate assets. RICH Miner: An efficient, secure and transparent asset appreciation engine As a leader in the field of cloud mining, RICH Miner provides a variety of mainstream cryptocurrency mining contracts including Bitcoin (BTC) and DOGE, with a yield rate far higher than the industry average. Some contracts have a daily yield of up to $4,850, suitable for investors seeking high returns. The platform’s advantages include: Zero technical threshold: No need to deploy mining machines, suitable for all users. Daily settlement, transparent income: All mining income can be checked and withdrawn in real-time. Multi-wallet compatibility: Supports withdrawals from mainstream wallets such as Coinbase, Trust Wallet, and SafePal. The platform operates stably: With global server and mining pool support to ensure maximum mining efficiency. From passive waiting to active appreciation: How do you cash out assets? Suppose someone holds $10,000 worth of Bitcoin or USDT, which is stored in the coin library for a long time. After choosing RICH Miner, they can invest part of their assets in the cloud mining project, and realize a stable crypto value-added channel every day while ensuring the safety of the principal. 1: Create an account: Users can get $15 computing power by registering an account on the official website . 2: Contract selection: Choose a mining plan according to budget.

This isn’t just a simple aesthetic choice; it’s a powerful statement that reverberates through the realms of Coinbase NFT strategy, Web3 culture, and the broader acceptance of digital collectibles . What might seem like a small detail to an outsider is, in fact, a loud endorsement of a specific segment of the crypto ecosystem, hinting at deeper strategic shifts within the industry. Why Did Coinbase Embrace Pudgy Penguins for its X Profile? Coinbase’s decision to adopt a Pudgy Penguin as its public face on X is a calculated move that speaks volumes about its evolving relationship with the Web3 space. The Pudgy Penguins collection isn’t just another set of profile picture (PFP) NFTs; it represents a vibrant community, a successful brand, and a testament to the power of intellectual property (IP) in the decentralized world. Here are a few compelling reasons behind this strategic alignment: Community Connection: Pudgy Penguins boast one of the most loyal and active communities in the NFT space. By featuring a Pudgy Penguin, Coinbase instantly signals its understanding and appreciation for this crucial aspect of Web3. It’s a nod to the ‘degens’ and long-term holders who form the backbone of the NFT market. Brand Strength and IP: Unlike many NFT projects, Pudgy Penguins have successfully extended their brand beyond digital art, notably with their popular toy line sold in major retail outlets like Walmart. This demonstrates tangible real-world utility and broad appeal, aligning with Coinbase’s ambition to bridge the gap between crypto and mainstream adoption. Cultural Relevance: Pudgy Penguins have become a symbol of resilience and fun within the NFT bear market. Their consistent innovation and positive outlook make them an ideal ambassador for a company looking to project stability and forward momentum in a dynamic industry. This move is more than just an image change; it’s a strategic embrace of a successful digital collectible brand, showcasing Coinbase’s commitment to staying at the forefront of crypto culture. What Does This Bold Move Mean for Web3 Adoption? The embrace of a prominent NFT collection by a leading exchange like Coinbase carries significant implications for Web3 adoption . It acts as a powerful signal, not just to the crypto native community, but also to institutional investors and mainstream audiences considering their entry into the decentralized world. Historically, major financial entities have been cautious about associating with NFTs, often viewing them as speculative or niche. Coinbase, by proudly displaying a Pudgy Penguin, is effectively saying that digital collectibles are a legitimate and integral part of the future financial landscape. This can: Boost Mainstream Confidence: When a regulated and widely trusted entity like Coinbase publicly endorses an NFT project, it lends credibility to the entire sector. This can encourage more traditional investors and brands to explore opportunities within Web3. Accelerate Integration: It sets a precedent for other exchanges and financial institutions to consider deeper integrations with NFT ecosystems, potentially leading to more NFT-focused products, services, and partnerships. Demystify NFTs: For many, NFTs remain a complex concept. Seeing a familiar brand like Coinbase use one simplifies the idea, making it more approachable and less intimidating for newcomers. This action is a tangible step towards making Web3 concepts less abstract and more integrated into everyday digital interactions, propelling the broader agenda of Web3 adoption forward. How Does This Impact Coinbase’s NFT Strategy? Coinbase has been steadily building its presence in the NFT space, most notably with the launch of its own Coinbase NFT marketplace. While it hasn’t yet reached the dominance of OpenSea, moves like adopting the Pudgy Penguin PFP are crucial for establishing its credibility and appeal within the NFT community. This move suggests a multi-faceted approach to its NFT strategy: Coinbase’s X profile proudly displaying a Pudgy Penguin. Aspect of Strategy Potential Impact of Pudgy Penguin PFP Marketplace Engagement Draws attention to Coinbase’s NFT marketplace, potentially increasing traffic and trading volume for digital collectibles . Community Building Signals a deeper understanding and appreciation for NFT communities, fostering trust and loyalty among collectors. Brand Positioning Positions Coinbase as a forward-thinking, culturally relevant player in the Web3 space, beyond just being a traditional exchange. Future Collaborations Opens doors for potential official partnerships, integrations, or exclusive drops with leading NFT projects like Pudgy Penguins . This strategic update reinforces Coinbase’s commitment to not just facilitate crypto trading but also to actively participate in and shape the emerging Web3 economy, with NFTs playing a central role. Is This the New Frontier for Crypto Exchange Marketing? In the highly competitive world of cryptocurrency exchanges, standing out is paramount. Traditional marketing often focuses on security, low fees, and user experience. However, the Pudgy Penguins adoption by Coinbase points towards a new frontier in crypto exchange marketing : cultural alignment and community-driven branding. By leveraging an iconic NFT, Coinbase is employing a sophisticated marketing tactic that: Resonates with the Niche: It directly appeals to the passionate and influential NFT community, turning them into potential advocates. Generates Buzz: A simple profile picture change has generated significant discussion across social media and crypto news outlets, providing organic reach and brand visibility. Showcases Authenticity: It demonstrates that Coinbase isn’t just building Web3 products; it’s living and breathing Web3 culture, which can build deeper trust with users who value authenticity in decentralized spaces. This approach could inspire other exchanges to rethink their branding strategies, moving beyond conventional advertising to embrace more organic, community-centric forms of engagement that leverage the power of digital collectibles and Web3 culture. Actionable Insights for the Community What does Coinbase’s embrace of Pudgy Penguins mean for you, whether you’re an investor, a collector, or just curious? For NFT Collectors: Keep an eye on projects with strong IP, engaged communities, and potential for mainstream crossover. The Pudgy Penguins’ success story is a blueprint. The increased visibility from Coinbase could also indirectly benefit the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. For Aspiring Web3 Projects: Focus on building genuine communities and developing compelling utility or brand narratives that can transcend the digital realm. Major players are watching for projects that demonstrate longevity and real-world applicability. For Crypto Investors: Recognize that the lines between traditional crypto assets and digital collectibles are blurring. Understanding the NFT market is becoming increasingly important for a holistic view of the crypto economy. Pay attention to how exchanges like Coinbase integrate these new facets. The Future is Playful and Pixeled Coinbase’s adoption of a Pudgy Penguin is more than a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful symbol of the evolving landscape where major financial platforms are increasingly integrating with the vibrant, community-driven world of Web3. It underscores the growing importance of digital collectibles not just as speculative assets, but as cultural touchstones and valuable brand assets. This pivotal move by Coinbase not only validates the burgeoning NFT space but also sets an exciting precedent for how crypto exchanges will engage with their communities and market themselves in the future. As the boundaries between traditional finance and decentralized innovation continue to dissolve, we can expect to see more such creative and culturally resonant strategies from industry leaders.

Since its peak of $0.00004567 in March 2024, SHIB has experienced lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish structure. Following that peak, the token dropped to $0.00003074 and has remained within a descending triangle pattern ever since, with price action gravitating toward the lower boundary of the formation. However, recent market activity suggests that SHIB may be nearing a reversal. MasterAnanda pointed out that the token has posted a strong green weekly candle, indicating a possible shift in sentiment. Over the past week, SHIB has increased by approximately 19%, marking one of its strongest weekly performances since the first week of May, when it gained 25%. Despite the current price improvement, SHIB remains below the 200-day moving average (MA200), a key technical indicator used to determine overall trend direction. As long as the price remains under the MA200, which currently stands at $0.00001634, analysts generally view the broader trend as bearish. Breaking above this level would be a critical step in confirming sustained upward momentum. Analyst Targets Multiple Fibonacci Levels in 2025 Outlook MasterAnanda has outlined a set of potential price targets for Shiba Inu based on Fibonacci retracement and extension levels. The first target is $0.00003203, which corresponds to the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level and would represent a breakout from the current triangle formation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If SHIB maintains its momentum, the next significant price levels are $0.00006767 (1.618 extension) and $0.0001032 (2.618 extension). The analyst regards $0.0001032 as the baseline for a new all-time high this cycle. Beyond that, the analysis includes further bullish targets: $0.0001743 and $0.000220491, which reflect the 3.618 and 4.618 Fibonacci extensions, respectively. These projections represent gains of approximately 1,183% and 1,529% from the current trading price of $0.00001360. Notably, this optimistic outlook aligns with previous assessments from other market commentators. Analyst Alan Santana previously suggested a similar potential breakout from SHIB’s descending triangle formation, reinforcing the view that substantial upside could still lie ahead for the meme-based token. While Shiba Inu has experienced a prolonged period of downward movement, current technical indicators and renewed market interest suggest a potential shift in trend. However, a confirmation above key resistance levels, particularly the 200-day moving average, remains essential before a sustained bullish trajectory can be validated.

That tiny window between uncertainty and opportunity — it’s where fortunes are made or missed. As Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) surges to its 31st stage — Frigid Fortress — it’s not just another meme project. It’s turning heads and snowballing momentum with serious community energy and clever tokenomics. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins is catching fire with a trading volume of over $1.3B, and FLOKI continues to draw eyes with a massive spike in activity. But while those coins move, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is racing toward its final stages. With a micro-entry of just $0.00047 per token and gains projected up to $0.008, hesitation now could mean regret later. The clock is ticking — and this window won’t stay open forever. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Pudgy Penguins, and FLOKI. Earn While You Share: The Viral Power of Arctic Pablo’s Referral Engine What if spreading the word could boost your portfolio? Arctic Pablo Coin’s referral incentives are doing just that — encouraging holders to become brand ambassadors and earn real rewards. It’s not just marketing; it’s a strategy designed to reward early believers. How many coins are offering a chance to build a bag while growing the hype? The system is simple: share your unique referral link, invite new users, and get rewarded in Arctic Pablo Coin. This model aligns perfectly with the spirit of meme coins — driven by community, memes, and movement. Unlike standard airdrops or static bonus structures, Arctic Pablo Coin fuels a growing fire through community engagement. Could your successive crypto win come from simply spreading the word? Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 , and its referral system is one of the many reasons. Frigid Fortress Entry Is Freezing Over — 1,602% ROI Still on the Table for Arctic Pablo Welcome to Frigid Fortress, the 31st icy checkpoint on Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale journey — and perhaps your last chance to get in before the thaw melts away your shot at exponential gains. The current price is just $0.00047, but the projected listing is locked at $0.008, promising a 1,602% ROI. Imagine investing $1,500 now and walking away with over 3.1 million APC — worth $25,531.92 at launch. Raised funds? Already soaring past $2.91 million, and climbing faster with every hour. The real kicker? With each new phase, the price ticks higher, meaning hesitation costs you tokens. This isn’t about speculation anymore — it’s about timing. Will you watch from the sidelines as early buyers ride this wave into 2025? Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025, and Frigid Fortress may be your final low-cost access point. Pudgy Penguins Makes Waves with Over $1.3B in Trading Volume Pudgy Penguins has officially joined the elite ranks of meme coins, breaking trading volume records — posting a jaw-dropping $1.3 billion in 24-hour volume with a live price of $0.021395. The beloved penguin-themed token has long held a place in the hearts of NFT and meme investors, but this surge is different — it’s bringing serious liquidity and eyes to the project. With major centralized exchanges listing it and a growing narrative around its digital collectibles, Pudgy Penguins is evolving into more than just a meme — it’s a movement. But with such massive inflows, how long can this momentum last before late entries start seeing diminishing returns? Don’t wait for the iceberg to melt — strike while the price is still manageable. As they say, the early bird gets the worm, but in this case, the early penguin might just catch the moon. FLOKI Roars Back With Renewed Momentum and $200M+ Volume FLOKI, long considered a top-tier meme contender, is back in the headlines — this time, with a staggering $200,589,615 in 24-hour volume and a current price of $0.000104. The token, named after Elon Musk’s dog, is more than just a hype play — it’s doubling down on real-world utility, decentralized finance tools, and ecosystem expansion. Traders are clearly taking notice. The increased volume signals strong institutional and retail interest, potentially setting FLOKI up for a breakout moment. Could FLOKI reclaim its throne and ignite a fresh meme coin season? In crypto, timing is everything, and FLOKI’s charts are pulsing with momentum. Don’t be the one looking back wondering why you didn’t act when the trail was heating up. Bottom Line: 3 Coins, 1 Opportunity — Arctic Pablo Stands Tall Amid Meme Momentum Pudgy Penguins is dominating charts with billion-dollar activity, and FLOKI is roaring back with a vengeance. But one coin — Arctic Pablo Coin — stands poised at a critical junction between obscurity and viral success. Its referral engine is winning over investors organically, and the Frigid Fortress phase at $0.00047 offers a rare, low-cost, high-reward opportunity that’s disappearing by the day. Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 — not just because of the presale numbers, but because of its innovative mechanics, community-first approach, and built-in hype loop. As the presale crosses milestones and the token nears launch at $0.008, every moment of hesitation risks missing out on potentially life-changing gains. So here’s the question — when the ice melts and APC hits the open market, will your wallet be holding millions, or will you just regret it? For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What is Arctic Pablo Coin, and why is it trending now? Arctic Pablo Coin is a new meme coin in presale, offering referral rewards and a massive ROI potential as it climbs through its launch phases. How much can people earn with Arctic Pablo Coin at the current presale price? At $0.00047 per token, a $1,500 investment could return over $25,000 when APC lists at $0.008. What’s special about the Frigid Fortress phase? It’s the 31st stage of Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey — and likely one of the last low-entry points before price skyrockets. Is Pudgy Penguins a good investment right now? Pudgy Penguins recently saw over $1.3B in volume and continues gaining traction with its NFT and meme ecosystem. What’s driving FLOKI’s recent surge? FLOKI has regained momentum with a trading volume exceeding $200M and expanding use cases across DeFi and metaverse projects. Article Summary Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming the most talked-about presale in the meme coin universe. With referral incentives, exponential ROI potential, and a rapidly escalating presale at Frigid Fortress, it presents a unique opportunity to get in before the crypto world catches on. While Pudgy Penguins and FLOKI surge, Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 — and those acting now may thank themselves later.

48067417,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=764604,1752277615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48067417.jpeg,Roblox is turning teenagers into young millionaires,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roblox-teenagers-young-millionaires/,"A teenager sold a soccer game on Roblox for $3 million+ just months after it hit the platform. The deal highlights a growing secondary market for games on the platform. The unnamed developer, aged 19, said he and several co-developers took only 3 months to build the game. After its release last year, it drew more than one million players at once and brought in about $5 million each month in in-game purchases for the company. Do Big Studios, a firm that owns several Roblox titles, purchased the game. Roblox, which started almost 20 years ago, offered a digital platform for creators to build and share simple, low-resolution games. Now, with close to 100 million daily users, the platform has become a place where people can earn real money by selling games for prices reaching into the 7 and 8 figures. David Taylor from Naavik, an analytics company, stated, “We’ve seen a real shift in Roblox’s ecosystem.” He found that 7 among the top 15 most-earning Roblox titles were purchased from the owners in June. The trend of selling Roblox games increased after a December update Before December, Roblox had said selling games was against Roblox’s service terms and rules. A spokesperson said the company is not taking part in these secondary-market deals. Do Big continues to build momentum. The firm acquired a piece of Grow a Garden, a farming game, in May. Grow a Garden set a new mark later in June by drawing 21 million+ players simultaneously, outpacing Fortnite. Splitting Point, another Roblox game company, had taken over Grow a Garden in April from a teen developer who chose to remain anonymous. Similarly, an unnamed developer sold the top game at the time, Brookhaven RP, to Voldex Entertainment in February. Voldex’s founder and chief executive, Alex Singer, mentioned that the deal was much “bigger” in comparison to what was reported at that time. He also added, “When there are more dollars paid out to creators, it attracts more people.” Roblox reports that, over the year ending in March, its ten highest-earning developers each made about $36 million. For the very first time, it could pay out over $1 billion to its game creators this year. Several firms now purchase, create, or flip games on Roblox. The deal-making often happens on Discord, a messaging app popular among gamers, according to Connar Rhicards. Richards is a lawyer who has handled a dozen such deals.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.00009605 Market Capitalization $916.62M Trading Volume $210.47M Circulating Supply 9.54T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.0001043 24-hour Low $0.00009465 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.49% 50-Day SMA $0.00008375 14-Day RSI 67.67 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.00009663 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: Floki’s price is down 6% today, despite broader upside. The coin will likely consolidate between $0.00009000-$0.00011000 before the next major move. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: FLOKI Inu breaks above key resistance with strong volume The FLOKI daily chart for July 11 shows the coin breaking above the crucial $0.00009000 resistance level that had been capping price action for weeks. The token’s current position at $0.00009615 represents a significant technical breakthrough, supported by an exceptional volume of 48.07M that confirms genuine buying pressure. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The Williams Alligator indicator shows all three lines converging and beginning to separate upward, typically signaling the start of a trending move, while the moving averages align bullishly. However, the recent red candle formation after the breakout suggests some profit-taking, which is normal behavior after such a significant move. However, the overall structure remains constructive with higher lows being established. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: The coin sees momentum exhaustion after recent rally The 4-hour chart displays a concerning pattern, with FLOKI currently experiencing a -5.04% decline. The token had been riding a strong uptrend, but recent price action suggests momentum is waning as it approaches critical resistance levels around $0.00010500. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with price touching the upper band before retreating, indicating potential volatility ahead, while the 20-period simple moving average at $0.00009489 provides immediate support. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator reveals a bearish divergence with the histogram showing negative momentum. However, the signal line remains slightly positive, suggesting the trend may be losing steam rather than completely reversing. Floki Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00007905 BUY SMA 5 $0.00008327 BUY SMA 10 $0.00008055 BUY SMA 21 $0.00007600 BUY SMA 50 $0.00008375 BUY SMA 100 $0.00008157 BUY SMA 200 $0.00009663 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00008009 BUY EMA 5 $0.00008031 BUY EMA 10 $0.00007760 BUY EMA 21 $0.00007244 BUY EMA 50 $0.00007556 BUY EMA 100 $0.00009496 BUY EMA 200 $0.000119 SELL What to expect from FLOKI FLOKI is in a transitional phase where short-term weakness meets longer-term strength. The daily breakout above $0.00009000 with strong volume suggests momentum toward $0.00011000-$0.00012000, but the 4-hour chart warns of potential consolidation first. Traders should watch out for a successful retest of $0.00009000 as support to confirm the breakout, while failure to hold above $0.00008500 could signal a return to the previous range. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Meanwhile, the Kaspa (KAS) price today continues to move sideways between $0.0735 and $0.0775, held back by ongoing miner activity. Both coins remain contenders on the list of best cryptos to buy today, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is outshining them with its growing momentum. With new partnerships involving Seattle’s top rugby and cricket teams, the Seawolves and Orcas, BlockDAG is making strides in real-world adoption. These moves are pushing its presale beyond expectations, now at over $336 million. BDAG remains available at a low $0.0016 until August 11th, creating a time-limited entry point ahead of its official listing. Cardano Price Pushes Forward with Signs of Recovery The Cardano (ADA) price recovery is taking shape after its recent dip to $0.5650. ADA has regained some ground, moving just under a key resistance near $0.5925. If ADA breaks through this level, it could open the door for further gains in the short term. If the price fails to hold current levels, however, there’s a chance it may test support again at $0.5650. Despite some caution, many traders still view Cardano as one of the best cryptos to buy today, waiting for confirmation of a breakout before increasing exposure. Kaspa Price Faces Range-Bound Movement with Miner Pressure The Kaspa (KAS) price today remains flat near $0.075, unable to find a clear direction. It continues trading within a tight range, with minor support and resistance preventing major shifts. Reports suggest miner selling is contributing to this pressure, keeping the price from gaining traction. The RSI remains weak and leans slightly bearish, while the MACD remains flat, showing little buyer strength. To move higher, KAS needs to break past current resistance levels. Without new demand, it could drift lower toward its $0.060 support. For now, momentum is neutral and will need a spark to shift upward. BlockDAG’s Sports Deals Drive Record-Breaking Presale Growth BlockDAG’s presale is rapidly gaining momentum, with over $336 million raised and 23.7 billion coins already sold across 29 batches. Early buyers from batch 1 have seen gains of 2,660%, underlining the strength of this crypto project. Much of this growth comes from recent partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket. These collaborations are introducing blockchain to fans in new and exciting ways. With the Seawolves, BlockDAG will offer digital collectibles and behind-the-scenes content, blending sports with tech. Its partnership with the Seattle Orcas adds another layer of global exposure. The team’s recent victory over the Los Angeles Knight Riders adds excitement to the announcement, as BlockDAG brings NFTs and branded content to a global cricket audience. For now, BDAG remains priced at just $0.0016 until August 11 as part of the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With its confirmed listing price set at $0.05, buyers locking in today could see a potential 3,025% return. With momentum building, many view this as a rare window to join a project at an early and promising stage. Final Thoughts While the Cardano (ADA) price recovery continues to build above support and the Kaspa (KAS) price today stays in a holding pattern, BlockDAG is emerging as a frontrunner. With a $336 million presale and strong backing from the Seattle Seawolves and Orcas, BDAG is turning heads. The current $0.0016 price remains active until August 11, giving early supporters one of the best possible entry points. With its mix of global partnerships, expanding user base, and strong presale demand, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy today , especially for those looking ahead to major returns in 2025.

48068067,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74111,1752278437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitwise CEO Sparks Debate on Ripple’s Future Identity: Details,https://timestabloid.com/bitwise-ceo-sparks-debate-on-ripples-future-identity-details/,"Hunter Horsley, the Chief Executive Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, has drawn attention to a developing narrative in the digital asset space, the idea that Ripple may transform into an XRP-centric treasury entity within the next year. In a recent post on X, Horsley publicly contemplated whether Ripple could soon be described not just as a blockchain company, but as an XRP treasury institution. I wonder if in 12 months, people will call Ripple an XRP treasury company. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) July 10, 2025 Growing Conversation on XRP Treasury Use Horsley’s remarks have emerged amid increased institutional interest in XRP for treasury purposes. Notably, firms such as Trident Digital and Webus are reportedly raising close to $1 billion in XRP-linked treasury products, underlining the token’s expanding role beyond cross-border payments. These developments suggest that XRP could be maturing into a strategic reserve asset for certain institutions. In this context, Horsley’s observation appears to reflect an evolving narrative. Ripple, a company historically focused on building global payments infrastructure, may be poised to transition into an entity that leverages its XRP reserves more directly, potentially adopting a model similar to MicroStrategy’s with Bitcoin. Ripple’s XRP Holdings and Speculations of Strategic Intent Ripple currently controls approximately 40.92 billion XRP, which represents around 41% of the total circulating supply. Much of this amount is locked in escrow, with scheduled releases meant to manage liquidity and market impact. Despite the escrow mechanism, some industry voices suggest that Ripple’s sizable XRP holdings function similarly to a reserve strategy. Supporters believe this reserve could be used to support institutional partnerships or broader financial initiatives. In particular, some XRP community members, such as Edoardo Farina, speculated that Ripple’s escrowed XRP may be earmarked for collaboration with global institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, no official confirmation supports this theory. On the other hand, skeptics such as entrepreneur Gary Cardone argue that if Ripple genuinely views XRP as a high-value long-term asset, it should formally adopt a treasury-based approach and publicly acknowledge its strategic intent. This line of thinking questions whether Ripple’s current structure reflects its actual vision for XRP’s future role. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Community Torn Between Critique and Endorsement The debate has not gone unnoticed within the broader XRP community. One user, Ojo Oluwani, noted that Ripple assuming the role of an XRP treasury entity would represent a major shift, particularly after years of emphasizing the legal and operational separation between Ripple and XRP. Oluwani further argued that, based on the company’s large holdings alone, Ripple already functions like a treasury institution in practice, even if not in name. However, some commentators pointed out an apparent contradiction in public opinion; critics often blame Ripple for maintaining a disproportionately large share of XRP, while also suggesting it should double down and formalize this model as part of a strategic balance sheet. As the utility and market perception of XRP continue to grow, questions surrounding Ripple’s future direction remain open. With major institutional initiatives underway and its substantial XRP reserves under scrutiny, Ripple may face increased pressure to clarify its position.

Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on how the altcoin has broken through a crucial moving average (MA). Meanwhile, ETH’s dominance is again on the rise. Ethereum Price Breaks 50EMA On Weekly Chart In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that after 9 weeks of constant rejection at the EMA50 on the weekly chart, the Ethereum price has finally broken through. He claimed that it was a very good sign, as it suggests that ETH will reach higher targets in the coming weeks. The break above the 2,600 EMA50 level came as the broader crypto market rallied. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here? This rally has been led by the Bitcoin price, which has reached new all-time highs (ATHs). Based on this, the Ethereum price is expected to also reach new highs, with the yearly high of $3,600 already in sight. A reclaim of this level could also pave the way for ETH to reclaim the psychological $4,000 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital alluded to the rising dominance of the Ethereum price. He noted that this ETH dominance fractal will not be a copy-paste version of what happened between 2019 and 2020. However, the analyst claimed that the recent rise to 10% of the dominance level shows that Ethereum wants to become more market-dominant in the coming months. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also believes that it is time for the Ethereum price to make its move. In an X post, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $10,000 on this upward trend. He made this prediction while highlighting ETH’s chart against its BTC pair, suggesting that he also agrees that Ethereum’s dominance will rise in the coming months. ETH’s Move To Trigger Altcoin Season In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Ethereum price is following the Wyckoff re-accumulation schematic. He further remarked that this massive move will trigger altcoin season after ETH reaches the “SOS” level around $3,000. His accompanying chart also showed that he expects Ethereum to reach as high as $3,200 in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’ In another X post, Mikybull Crypto alluded to the fact that Bitcoin’s dominance was dumping even as the BTC price rises. The analyst remarked that this development means something, hinting at a potential altcoin season on the horizon. This is bullish for the Ethereum price and other altcoins as they would outperform BTC during this period. It is worth mentioning that Mikybull Crypto has also predicted that ETH can reach $10,000 in this market cycle. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,988, up over 7% according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A Wells Fargo customer for nearly four decades says the lender refused to make him whole after scammers drained $20,000 from his account. Scott Merovitch says he received a call from someone claiming to work at the bank, warning his account was flashing suspicious activity, reports FOX 26 Houston. According to Merovitch, the caller was able to provide information about his recent transactions. After the call, a woman pretending to work at Wells Fargo showed up at Merovitch’s front door, asked for his card and cut it into pieces. Two hours later, Merovitch says $20,000 exited his account at ATM locations just a few miles from his residence. When he filed for a reimbursement claim, Merovitch says the lender issued a letter telling him that the transactions were made by him or someone who had his permission. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase is refusing to reimburse a man scammed by a fake Apple support text, reports the CBS-affiliated news station KOLD. The phishing text, posing as Apple’s billing department, claimed unauthorized activity was underway. The victim says he quickly called the number, and the scammer likely installed malware on his iPhone to tap into his bank account. Chase says reimbursement is not happening. “After further review, our claim denial stands as we found these transactions were authorized by the customer with no evidence of fraudulent account takeover or of a compromised device.” Lastly, Bank of America refused to reimburse a customer who lost $450 to a taxi scam in Panama. Keith Lee says he was charged $450 for a $10 cab ride, according to the Elliott Report. The driver claimed Lee’s card didn’t process, so he paid cash. Bank of America denied his dispute, saying a chip-verified “card-present” transaction was executed. Consumer advocate Christopher Elliott then stepped in, contacting BofA on Lee’s behalf. After hearing from Elliott, Bank of America finally reversed the charge. Elliott says the bank acknowledged such taxi scams are well-known.

While Solana is riding a wave of institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly capturing attention with its community-first model and impressive presale ROI projections. Solana Rallies on ETF Momentum and Technical Breakout Solana is continuing its upward trajectory after breaking out of a long-term falling wedge and holding key support at $144 earlier this week. Despite broader market softness yesterday, SOL dipped just 3%, signaling resilience that analysts attribute to strong investor confidence. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $147, marking a 1.9% daily loss. According to CoinGlass, the long-to-short ratio among Binance’s top traders is 2.49, meaning they hold 2.5 times more long positions than shorts on SOL. Adding to the bullish narrative, crypto strategist Ali Martinez has identified a textbook cup-and-handle formation on Solana’s higher timeframes. He projects a breakout could push SOL toward $3,000 and potentially higher. Institutional interest is also gaining traction. The recently launched REX Shares Solana Staking ETF recorded strong trading volume within its first 48 hours. Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts estimate between $3 billion and $6 billion in potential inflows once spot Solana ETFs receive SEC approval. Further underscoring investor appetite, CME Solana Futures open interest surged to a record $167 million following the ETF’s debut. If Solana can break through resistance levels at $180 and $240, analysts believe a path toward a new all-time high is within reach. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as Q3’s Breakout Layer-1 Project While Solana dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum as one of the most promising and overlooked Layer-1 tokens of Q3 2025. The project is currently progressing through its presale and has rapidly expanded its community base. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-first approach. A significant portion of its total token supply was allocated to presale participants, deliberately avoiding venture capital or institutional pre-allocation. This structure promotes fair ownership, decentralization, and a grassroots foundation. Its political relevance and rapidly expanding online presence on Telegram and X have amplified its visibility and attracted ideologically aligned investors. Unlike meme coins built solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is merging crypto fundamentals with cultural identity and long-term utility. Conclusion As the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale continues, the current entry point offers one of the most attractive setups for retail and early-stage investors ahead of its exchange listing. For traders scouting the next breakout altcoin of Q3, MAGACOIN may be the one to watch.

Democrats Push Back On GOP Crypto Week According to the Friday notice posted on the House Financial Services Committee’s website, Democratic lawmakers will be pushing against the Republican Party’s planned “Crypto Week” in opposition to their political opponents’ mobilization to pass crypto legislation. NEW: To counter the GOP’s “Crypto Week,” Reps. @RepMaxineWaters & @RepStephenLynch are launching “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” rallying Dems to block the GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act & Anti-CBDC bill — warning they pave the way for what they call Trump’s crypto corruption. pic.twitter.com/kpT6JpTEKx — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 11, 2025 Specifically, Waters and Lynch called out both the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act by name in the notice, going so far as to call the proposed rulemaking “dangerous pieces of crypto legislation.” The two U.S. lawmakers also took aim at U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures , claiming his dive into the world of digital assets is merely a part of his “evil and corrupt crypto empire.” “Aside from lacking urgently needed consumer protections and national security guardrails, these bills would make Congress complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam – one that has personally enriched himself, his entire family, and the billionaire insiders in his cabinet, all while defrauding investors,” Waters said. Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Ventures Questioned Trump has garnered increased scrutiny in recent months over his affiliation with novel crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, over their new USD1 stablecoin as well as his the launch of his namesake memecoin $TRUMP. Critics of Trump’s ties to the blockchain sector allege that his Trump-affiliated cryptocurrencies may pose ethics concerns as anyone – including those involved in foreign governments – may purchase and hold the coins. “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto – especially given President Trump’s acceptance of billions of dollars in investment in his family crypto business from foreign governments and his blatant conflicts of interest,” said Congressman Lynch.

This move highlights a broader shift by EU authorities toward stronger oversight of the crypto industry. Under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation—a unified EU law aimed at streamlining rules for digital assets and related services—investor protections include clear standards for asset custody and complaint resolution, ESMA noted. Crypto regulators call for investor protection in the crypto ecosystem For years, regulators worldwide have expressed concerns about the crypto-related risks to digital asset investors. This was after various crypto platforms left several investors bankrupt after investing millions of their assets in them. An example is FTX , which failed in 2022. To address this, ESMA tried to unmask various factors that could lead to risks to which investors could be exposed. An example involves crypto asset service providers (CASPs) offering regulated and unregulated products on the same platform at once. The regulators explained how risky this was to investors, stating that customers might be unaware of which products lack MiCA’s protection. ESMA exposed additional risks linked to Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). The regulator pointed out that some CASPs promote their MiCA-regulated status to attract customers, which can create confusion about which aspects of their offerings are regulated. Following this, ESMA has urged crypto firms to stop using their regulatory status as a tool for promotion and suggesting to their clients that crypto products and services are regulated when, in reality, they are not covered by the EU’s rules. Notably, MiCA does not regulate products and services that include direct investments in commodities like gold and lending involving crypto-assets. The EU releases new guidelines in the crypto market The EU has introduced new guidelines for the cryptocurrency sector, requiring crypto firms to secure a CASP license from a national regulator. This license will serve as a passport, enabling companies to offer crypto services across all EU member states. ESMA also issued regulations on staff employment in crypto companies. According to the regulators, t he staff should be knowledgeable and skilled in evaluating crypto services. ESMA’s remarks come a day after it investigated Malta’s process for issuing the license and discovered that Malta’s Financial Services Authority did not do a complete job in evaluating the risks of a specific unnamed crypto company. The review showed that the Maltese regulator had the knowledge and resources to approve and oversee crypto companies. However, its approval process only met expectations “partially.” In response to these accusations, the Maltese regulator said it took pride in being one of the first to adopt digital asset rules. At the same time, it avoided directly addressing the criticisms. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ESMA was not the first to raise concerns on Malta’s process for issuing the license; some of the regulators had expressed fears behind closed doors about the swiftness with which some EU member states were issuing crypto licenses.

House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters and subcommittee colleague Stephen Lynch announced their intention to oppose a package of bills that Republicans plan to fast-track starting Monday. According to Waters, the proposed laws lack crucial consumer safeguards and threaten to expose the U.S. financial system to new vulnerabilities. Accusations of Favoring Industry Interests “[Republicans are] doubling down by fast-tracking a dangerous package of crypto legislation through Congress,” Waters said. She further claimed that the bills would make lawmakers “complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam,” referencing the former president’s ventures in the digital asset space. Legislative Package Includes Three Key Bills The crypto package includes the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate payment stablecoins and has already passed the Senate. Also on the table are the CLARITY Act, which would establish digital asset market structure, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to block any development of a U.S. government-issued digital currency. While Republicans hold a slim House majority, it remains uncertain whether they can gather enough support to pass all three bills, particularly in the face of unified Democratic opposition. Concerns Over National Security and Oversight Lynch criticized the GOP for prioritizing crypto industry interests over consumer protection. “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto,” he said. Many Democrats argue the legislation would reduce oversight by shifting regulatory authority away from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and toward the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Trump’s Crypto Ties Complicate Debate Trump’s connections to the crypto sector are also drawing attention. Reports indicate his personal wealth has increased by roughly $620 million in recent months, driven largely by investments in crypto-related ventures, including World Liberty Financial. This firm has reportedly launched its own stablecoin, USD1, raising further questions about the intersection of political influence and crypto regulation. Senate to Take Up Market Structure Bill While the GENIUS Act is likely to reach the president’s desk soon, momentum around the CLARITY Act appears to be shifting toward the Senate. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand are working toward a new draft of the bill with the goal of finalizing legislation by September 30. House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill said the revised draft will be the “best” version debated since 2023. Regulatory Roles Could Shift A comprehensive market structure bill would clarify regulatory jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC. Current drafts suggest handing more oversight to the CFTC, particularly for registering and supervising digital asset platforms. This restructuring could significantly reshape how cryptocurrencies are governed in the United States moving forward.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-12 00:33:46

The decision, which caught most of the industry off guard, adds another layer of pressure on U.S. businesses that rely heavily on imported copper to function. Refined copper is the largest import category, and its inclusion is expected to cause ripple effects across key sectors like energy, construction, electronics, and auto manufacturing. People close to the matter confirmed the tariff’s reach, noting that semi-finished copper products will also be affected. Those include rods, tubes, and other intermediary forms essential for turning raw copper into finished goods. U.S. producers don’t make enough of either to meet current demand, which is why this move is already causing concern among manufacturers. Industry tells Trump to leave copper scrap alone Just hours after Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, his Council of Economic Advisers met with metals industry executives. They urged the president not to include export controls on copper scrap. The U.S. produces more scrap than it can use, and the excess is shipped overseas. Industry leaders argued that blocking these exports wouldn’t help the domestic shortfall, it would just create a surplus no one can process. Executives from Rio Tinto, Southwire, and Trafigura were among those who asked Trump to instead restrict the exports of ore and scrap rather than taxing imports. Their position is that focusing on outbound shipments would be more effective in protecting domestic supply. The U.S. imported 908,000 metric tons of refined copper last year. It’s defined as copper with more than 99.993% purity, and it’s what fabricators rely on to make alloys, rods, and wires. Southwire, the largest fabricator in North America, supplies copper for military applications including naval vessels and bases. The company declined to comment. On top of that, the U.S. also imported 800,000 tons of semi-fabricated copper and alloy products in the same year. These imports filled the gap that domestic production couldn’t cover. A March 31 filing from the Copper Development Association to the Commerce Department explained that copper semis are critical to the military-industrial supply chain. The group, speaking for 90% of domestic copper semi producers, argued that the U.S. is structurally dependent on imports. Krisztina Kalman, co-founder of consultancy MM Markets, said she believes the 50% tariff will eventually hit semi-products too. “Any disturbance in foreign supply of copper and semi-finished products could expose the U.S. to significant issues in delivering electricity,” she said. She also warned that U.S. producers don’t have the capacity to replace the lost imports. “The local fabricators will not be able to produce 800,000 tons more semi-products with current capacity, and it could take up to seven years to install new capacity.” Chile, Canada react as market braces for long-term disruption Chile, the world’s top copper producer, has not yet received formal notice of the new tariffs, but Mining Minister Aurora Williams confirmed on Thursday that her government is pushing for an exemption. “Chilean mining production, in all its gambits, has high responsibility, is highly valued and highly necessary for manufacturing in the U.S.,” she told reporters. She also stressed that Chile’s refined copper is shipped with full traceability. Canada, the second-largest supplier of copper to the U.S., responded more aggressively. Industry Minister Melanie Joly called the tariffs “illegal” and promised to “fight” them. Speaking at an event in Vancouver, she said the measures were “a direct attack against its workers.” Meanwhile, the copper market is already reacting. Analysts at Macquarie said that once tariffs kick in, U.S. consumers will begin using copper from stockpiles that were built up earlier this year. They estimate those inventories will last about nine months, giving some temporary breathing room before the real supply squeeze hits. Last year, U.S. production of refined copper from ore totaled 850,000 tons, while imports added another 810,000 tons, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Recycling and inventory drawdowns made up the remaining 5% of the country’s copper demand. With only two active copper smelters in the U.S., about half of the semi-processed ore produced here is sent abroad; mostly to China. Rebuilding domestic capacity isn’t going to happen overnight. If refined copper is taxed but semi-fabricated products are not, analysts warn that those semi-products could flood the U.S. market instead. Alon Olsha and Richard Bourke of Bloomberg Intelligence wrote, “Without broader incentives and tariffs on semi-finished goods, import reliance will likely persist and hurt copper consumers.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, warned in June that AI might trigger a steep rise in joblessness soon. According to him, automation could wipe out one-half of white-collar entry level roles and push unemployment to roughly 20 percent over the coming 5 years. Huang argued that when companies develop new concepts, they can both boost output and create roles. But without fresh ambitions, he added, “productivity drives down,” which could mean fewer positions. He further added that the most fundamental aspect is having new ideas in society. Huang stressed the fact that as long as society has new ideas, it will grow and be productive. Investment in AI has surged, sparking a technology boom and stoking concerns about job losses. Some 41 percent of CEOs expect AI to cut staff numbers at several thousand firms in the coming 5 years, based on a survey from 2024 by Adecco. A January 2024 report from the World Economic Forum found that 41 percent of companies are planning to shrink their hiring by the year 2030 due to automation provided by AI. AI will make some jobs obsolete while creating new jobs, Huang says Huang added that AI will eventually affect everyone’s jobs. Some of these jobs may become completely obsolete, while new jobs will form. He added that he hopes that increased productivity from AI will lift industries. Nvidia reached a market value of $4 trillion and is at the forefront of the AI wave. It’s chips power data centres used by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to run cloud operations and AI models. Defending AI’s progress, Huang noted that in the past 300 years, and through the computer age, both output and employment have risen. He said new technology helps foster “an abundance of ideas” and fresh ways of building better futures. AI is set to change how tasks are accomplished. Over half of major U.S. firms are planning to bring automation to their tasks like supplier payments and invoice processing, based on a Duke University survey. Huang admitted that AI has even altered his own role, but he still has his job. Many companies already use tools such as ChatGPT and other chatbots to accomplish tasks like writing job adverts, press statements, and marketing plans.

The financial platform is now up more than 161% in 2025, fueled by the crypto market’s rally and a flood of retail momentum. But that spike came just as Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan plans to charge fintech firms for access to customer bank data, a decision that could slam Robinhood and its peers with new costs. That news hit hard. Robinhood relies on slim margins to offer free services. Just the idea of added costs rattled the market. PayPal and Affirm each dropped nearly 6% on the same day. And while Robinhood stayed green, the pullback from its intraday high showed just how fragile a rally could be in this era. Robinhood keeps facing backlash over crypto “Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said. His office is focusing on the company’s use of payment for order flow, where market makers pay Robinhood to execute trades. James said that practice could result in worse prices for users. Lucas Moskowitz, Robinhood Crypto’s general counsel, defended the platform’s practices in a statement to CNBC, calling the company’s trade disclosures “best-in-class.” “We disclose pricing information to customers during the lifecycle of a trade that clearly outlines the spread or the fees associated with the transaction, and the revenue Robinhood receives,” Lucas said. That wasn’t Robinhood’s only problem this week. The company announced it would begin taking 25% of staking rewards from U.S. users starting October 1. In Europe, it plans to take 15%. That puts it close to Coinbase, which charges anywhere from 25.25% to 35%, but higher than Gemini’s flat 15% fee. Robinhood avoided staking before due to U.S. regulatory pressure, but under President Donald Trump, the SEC has backed off its crackdown. Recent cases against Coinbase and Binance have been dropped, giving firms room to bring back services like staking. Robinhood triggers OpenAI dispute with tokenized stock rollout Robinhood is also facing scrutiny in Europe over its new tokenized stock program. The company launched blockchain-based assets giving users synthetic exposure to private firms like OpenAI and SpaceX through special purpose vehicles (SPVs). These tokens don’t offer voting rights or direct ownership. They track the value of SPVs that hold shares in the actual companies. In an interview with CNBC International, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev admitted, “It is true that these are not technically equity.” But he defended the offering. “What’s important is that retail customers have an opportunity to get exposure to this asset,” Vlad said, arguing that institutional investors often use similar financial instruments. Vlad also said that Robinhood is cooperating. “Since this is a new thing, regulators are going to want to look at it,” he said. “And we expect to be scrutinized as a large, innovative player in this space.” On CNBC’s Squawk Box, SEC Chair Paul Atkins called the model “an innovation,” a rare bit of support even as regulatory rules remain unclear in most regions. While the legal drama builds, Robinhood is already working on what could be its next big move. The company said it’s developing an app tied to Trump’s newly signed megabill, which includes $1,000 investment accounts seeded by the government for every newborn in the country. The initiative, known as ‘Trump Accounts’, could give Robinhood access to millions of new users. It’s early, but the company said it’s already prototyping the app. Robinhood’s year has been fast and messy. The market loves the growth. But the real question is how long Robinhood can keep flying this high before regulators pull it back to earth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On X, he warned that Bitcoin’s most recent surge put the cryptocurrency in what he described as the “ Banana Zone ,” ripe for potentially damaging emotional decision making based on FOMO, the fear of missing out. Bitcoin recently jumped above $117,000, a new record peak, igniting speculation it could surge as high as $124,000 or higher. Kiyosaki has a great answer to the run-up: Don’t go by emotion but strategy. “Be a smarter investor,” he said, noting that impulsive purchasing during euphoric market cycles is often associated with crippling losses. “Don’t be a HOG. HOGs get slaughtered. Be a PIG instead. PIGs get fat.” He shared that his buys were at $110,000, indicating conviction that we are long-term bullish, and cautioned against diving into the market at the top for no particular reason. His strategy? Wait for the market to correct, then buy back at a discount. Traders fuel fear and greed in banana zone rally Real Vision CEO and macro investor Raoul Pal is credited with popularizing the “Banana Zone”. It refers to a phase of rapid, nearly vertical price growth typically limited to high-demand, low-supply assets such as Bitcoin. Kiyosaki expressed a similar sentiment to Pal, stating that the “limited” nature of Bitcoin means that when there is an appetite for the coin, thereby driving up its interest, it faces a ton of upward pressure due to its scarcity. This cycle is usually driven by institutional adoption, media frenzy, and retail investor frenzy. It delivers the possibility of explosive gains but also introduces volatility, extreme risk, and emotional trading. As with previous surges, the current burst of optimism could lead to a short-lived price spike and some real downside risk, Kiyosaki said. He cautioned that many fresh investors are diving into the markets without understanding how fickle a game trading cryptocurrency can be. This flood of FOMO-driven buyers, he said, could add significant instability to the market. He said that as the price only goes up, inexperienced investors could become panicky, resulting in a “slaughtering” of those who bought in at these levels. In Kiyosaki’s view, this stage sees many investors piling in without doing any independent research, hoping for a quick buck. This “herd instinct” frequently results in excessive buying at the peak, with mass panic selling when the price “falls off a cliff”. He said investors should focus on educating themselves instead of chasing price surges while maintaining discipline. He cautioned that this was not the time to follow the crowd blindly, but rather an opportunity to sharpen their thinking. Traders push Bitcoin higher as risk escalates Bitcoin’s climb to $118,000 has bulls and analysts cheering. Some in the market believe the asset is in the early stages of a long-term bull run. Estimates of $124,000 or more are already being labeled conservative by certain circles. The more aggressive forecasters call for $250,000 by the end of 2025, and even $1 million by 2030 — particularly if macroeconomic travails continue to erode faith in fiat currencies. Kiyosaki, an ardent critic of central bank control over global monetary policy and fiat currency systems, believes Bitcoin is “people’s money” and that the flagship cryptocurrency presents a strong hedge against inflation. He’s sung Bitcoin’s praises for its fixed supply and decentralized nature multiple times. In June 2024, he repeated his faith in Raoul Pal’s Banana Zone theory and became a legendary figure of the upcoming bull market. He says he bought his first Bitcoin when the price was $6,000. Those early decisions have more than paid off, and he emphasizes that gains did so because he was investing smart and patiently, not gambling on hype.

The spike wiped out an estimated $1.25 billion in short positions within a single trading day, according to CoinGlass figures. Bitcoin Bull Trap Or Breakout? Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards took to X as the breakout unfolded. “New all-time highs beget new ATHs. It’s usually unwise to ignore a major breakout like this, until invalidated,” he wrote, adding that corporate treasury demand has “grown exponentially, with dozens of new companies popping up in recent months.” Edwards’ base-case projection calls for a further 50–70 percent advance over the next six months—roughly $170,000–$196,000. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold His focus on treasuries is backed by hard data. Public companies added a record 159,107 BTC in Q2—pushing aggregate corporate holdings above 847,000 BTC, or about four percent of max supply. Corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have even outpaced ETF net inflows. Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck, framed Bitcoin’s trajectory within a broader macro and policy backdrop. “The natural course for Bitcoin remains higher, driven by persistent US debt and deficit problems, demographic tailwinds, a weakening dollar, growing momentum around Fed rate cuts, and the potential for a new Fed chair next year,” he wrote on X. Sigel also highlighted Capitol Hill’s looming “Crypto Week,” where stablecoin legislation is widely viewed as the most passable of several digital-asset bills. Those developments, he argues, make $180,000 “very much in play for 2025.” Law-makers appear to share the sense of urgency. A press statement from the House Financial Services Committee confirms that the week of 14 July will be dedicated to advancing the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the GENIUS Act. Passage would establish the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and market structure, a change Sigel says could “unlock wide-open capital markets” for the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Spot Bitcoin ETFs are hardly idle: net inflows into BlackRock’s iShares fund alone have pushed its holdings past 700,000 BTC in the 18 months since launch. Yet Edwards and Sigel both note that treasury companies have become the marginal buyer in 2025. The dynamic creates what Edwards calls a “cap-raising flywheel,” as firms showcase outperforming share prices—up nearly 60 percent year-to-date for the treasury cohort—when courting investors. Notably, the rally is unfolding against a supportive macro backdrop. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told a Dallas Fed audience he is “open to cutting the policy rate in July,” arguing current settings are “too tight” given waning inflation pressures. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell over the past weeks, demanding immediate rate cuts. Trump’s tariff escalation also seems to fade out, supporting the Bitcoin rally. Notwithstanding euphoric headlines, technicians warn that momentum must sustain above $110,000 to avoid a failed-breakout pattern. “This theory would be weakened with closes below $110K and invalidated below $105K,” Edwards concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $117,854.

Litecoin remains a trusted name for its strong network and stable performance, drawing attention from those focused on long-term gains. BONK, meanwhile, has taken the meme coin space by surprise, with its chart trends sparking real interest. But it’s BlockDAG (BDAG) that’s turning the most heads. With over $336 million raised so far in presale, 23.8 billion coins sold, and a smart referral program, it’s showing what community-driven growth can look like. This comparison unpacks how all three line up on stability, momentum, and future upside. Litecoin: Solid Performance and Steady Network Strength The outlook for Litecoin (LTC) remains appealing to those who trust stability when markets swing unpredictably. As one of the oldest coins around, Litecoin still draws traders who appreciate its quick transactions and consistently low fees. Recent data reinforces the Litecoin (LTC) forecast, showing strong support levels that help it maintain its position as a steady choice when hype dies down. Litecoin’s proven security and transaction speed keep it practical for day-to-day transfers and cross-chain activity. Even as newer Layer 2 projects bring more competition, Litecoin’s ongoing upgrades and fresh partnerships for payments hint that it can still adapt. Its reliable reputation makes it more than just a legacy coin, it’s a practical tool that keeps evolving alongside the market. For anyone looking to balance risk with reliability, Litecoin remains a staple worth watching. BONK: Chart Activity and Community Support Keep Eyes On BONK began as a playful meme project, but it’s now pulling serious attention as fresh price action draws traders to keep a close eye on BONK chart trends. Recent spikes in volume and steady zones of support show that this dog-themed coin may have staying power beyond the meme. Many traders now turn to BONK chart analysis to gauge its next possible move. If BONK pushes past the $0.000025 mark, some believe that steady buying pressure could unlock more gains ahead. Unlike other meme coins that fade, BONK’s team keeps working on new ideas that add real demand. This has helped keep the community engaged and the project moving forward. Watching how these chart patterns evolve in the months ahead could signal whether BONK’s fun energy turns into a more solid place among the top crypto coins in 2025. BlockDAG: Community Growth Driven by a Smart Referral Program BlockDAG stands out as one of the top crypto coins for 2025, having already raised over $336 million in its presale and sold 23.8 billion coins along with 18,516 miners. This strong traction shows real community trust. But what really powers its reach is a straightforward referral program that rewards users for sharing. The official program lets anyone earn 25% BDAG on every successful referral, while newcomers receive a 5% bonus on their first purchase. There’s no limit on how much can be earned, and users can easily share a unique link or QR code and track their rewards live on their dashboard. This makes every buyer an active part of BlockDAG’s organic growth, no expensive marketing campaigns needed. Right now, the limited presale price is locked at just $0.0016 until August 11 , offering a potential 3,025% ROI if the coin hits its fixed $0.05 launch price. Alongside this, BlockDAG’s energy-efficient mining and DAG-based architecture keep transaction speeds fast and costs low, making the network scalable for millions of users worldwide. This clear balance of smart incentives, solid figures, and a buyer-friendly approach gives BlockDAG a strong edge. Its blend of real tech utility and a motivated community could make it one of the standout crypto stories as the market heads into 2025. How These Three Coins Could Shape 2025 Litecoin’s solid foundation and consistent Litecoin (LTC) forecast reinforce its role as a steady option when the market turns shaky. BONK’s vibrant chart moves, backed by real trading signals and community backing, show why its chart trends deserve attention. Yet it’s BlockDAG’s big $336 million presale results, smart referral system, and powerful pricing window that really stand out. This combination of simple incentives and proven traction could shape BlockDAG’s story into one of the most talked-about gains in crypto. As 2025 approaches, all three offer different paths to watch, one rooted in reliability, one built on viral energy, and one driven by community power and clear returns.

This $0.03 Crypto With DeFi Utility Could Beat It There,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-dogecoin-doge-ever-hit-1-this-0-03-crypto-with-defi-utility-could-beat-it-there/,"With Dogecoin (DOGE) hovering around the $0.15 mark and still far from the elusive $1 milestone, the market is once again asking whether meme-fueled momentum alone is enough to drive lasting value. Meanwhile, a new coin is rising from the DeFi market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.03 token positioning itself not through hype, but through functional utility in real-world decentralized lending. The project has already sold more than 65% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. Investors are rushing in, this being the lowest MUTM will ever be. The project has raised more than $12 million and has attracted over 13,000 investors. In the race toward $1, speculation may still fuel headlines, but it’s utility-driven protocol Mutuum Finance that are quietly rewriting the rules. Dogecoin Holds Steady Around Key Levels, Eyes Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at approximately $0.1683, slightly down from intraday highs near $0.172, after rebounding from a support zone around $0.166 . Recent on-chain data shows whale wallets holding 1M–100M DOGE increasing accumulation even as retail traders reduced exposure, hinting at confident long-term interest despite sideways movement. DOGE’s movement contrasts with emerging utility-based tokens, most notably Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as investors remain watchful for assets with on‑chain DeFi use cases. Strong Demand Marks Stage 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some real steam as it climbs up Stage 5 of its presale. Having already amassed over 13,000 early adopters and over $12 million in funding raised, the project is leaping giant strides as a top contender in the DeFi. Mutuum Finance, in a bid to contribute more to its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized stablecoin backed by USD on the Ethereum blockchain. Contrary to highly risk-leveraged algorithmic stablecoins, the token has been designed in such a manner that will guarantee its value even during times of market fluctuation. Mutuum Finance has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, wherein a 50,000 USDT reward is provided. The bounty is divided into four levels of severity, i.e., the critical, major, minor, and low. This will balance out all the vulnerability and reward tiers. Incentives for Early Supporters As a token of appreciation to the early supporters and in commemoration of the presale hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners like these will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a reward for being part of the early supporters of the project. With growing community at an exponential rate, the early supporters are rewarded, not only with the potential future gains, but with real, live rewards. Mutuum Finance’s Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructed as a hybrid lending protocol that will serve the passive and active DeFi users. The users can earn passive income since they lend their USDT via smart contracts pools, which provide stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending protocol. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables borrowers and lenders to be as engaging as they can ever be in exchanging terms of an agreement and do not require a third party to have influence over them on their behalf. The model is more prevalent for the clients of less secure assets. Dogecoin (DOGE) may still dream of $1, but it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s making real moves. Priced at $0.03, over $12 million raised, 13,000+ investors, and 65% of Stage 5 sold, MUTM is backed by real DeFi utility, a CertiK audit, and a $50K bug bounty. With a USD-backed stablecoin, dual lending model, and a $100K giveaway live, the time to act is now. Join the presale before the next price jump.

48073345,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=764647,1752284593,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48073345.jpeg,Brazil downplays economic risk amid market jitters and US tensions,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-open-to-lula-talks/,"Brazil’s government on Friday minimized concerns over the economic fallout from US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, expressing hope for future negotiations even as tensions flared over legal proceedings involving former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump told reporters he might eventually speak to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but criticized Brazil’s judiciary for prosecuting Bolsonaro, who faces charges of attempting to overturn Lula’s 2022 election victory. “Maybe at some point I’ll talk to him. Right now I’m not,” Trump said before departing for flood-hit Texas, reiterating his belief that Bolsonaro is being treated “very unfairly.” In response, Lula reaffirmed Brazil’s willingness to negotiate but warned of retaliation if diplomacy fails. “We’ll first try to negotiate, but if there’s no negotiation, the law of reciprocity will be put into practice,” Lula said in a Thursday interview with Record TV. Brazil downplays economic risk amid market jitters and US tensions Despite the tariff threat, Brazil’s Finance Ministry projected limited economic impact, maintaining its 2.5% GDP growth forecast for 2025. Officials said only specific sectors, like aerospace and energy machinery—heavily reliant on US buyers—might suffer. A White House official, speaking anonymously, said that critical sectors such as oil and minerals would remain exempt, aligning with broader tariff policies announced in April. Oil is Brazil’s top export to the US, but local industry groups expressed uncertainty about whether exemptions would continue. The US also imports significant volumes of Brazilian steel, coffee, pulp, beef, and orange juice—goods Brazil believes can be redirected to other markets. “It is not like we cannot survive without the US,” Lula said, reiterating Brazil’s ongoing efforts to diversify its trade partnerships. China already accounts for 28% of exports, compared to 12% for the US. Still, Brazilian exporters are wary. The country’s beef lobby warned the tariffs would make trade with the US “economically unfeasible.” In a letter to Lula earlier in the week, Trump linked the proposed tariffs to Bolsonaro’s ongoing prosecution, leaving little room for Brazil to maneuver. Lula, speaking to TV Globo, condemned Trump’s rationale as “extremely outrageous,” stating that Bolsonaro “didn’t just try to stage a coup—he tried to prepare my death.” Bolsonaro denies all accusations. Markets react cautiously as tensions weigh on investor confidence Financial markets reflected the unease. The Brazilian real slid 0.7% against the dollar on Friday, while the Bovespa stock index dipped 0.5%, with the weekly decline for the real on track to be the steepest since February. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s promised 50% copper tariffs are set to include all refined metal. This shows the president’s far-reaching efforts to bolster American production of one of the world’s most ubiquitous materials. Trump’s announcement of the levy, which he said would begin Aug. 1, lacked much detail. Still, refined copper will be included, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named, as discussions are private. Refined copper is critical to various industries, including construction, electric vehicles, power grids, and consumer electronics. Bloomberg reported that levies are also expected to apply to semi-finished copper products, which could further widen the policy’s impact across the supply chain. While the plan underscores Trump’s aggressive push to protect and revive American manufacturing, it is not yet finalized. A White House official noted that the tariff measures are still being evaluated and should not be considered definitive until officially announced by the president. In response to the announcement, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers met with industry stakeholders hours later. Sources say the industry urged the administration not to apply export restrictions on copper scrap, a byproduct of which the US is a major global supplier. With domestic scrap output exceeding local demand, much of the excess is shipped abroad, making it a critical component of international trade for the US metals sector.

This was just after the US President slapped a 35% tariff on the Nation. Navarro stated in an interview that he encouraged Canadian citizens to ask their leaders to negotiate fairly with the US. His remarks reveal that US trading partners still have time to negotiate for lower tariff rates as the August 1 deadline is around the corner. Navarro also noted that Trump’s tariff policies did not apply to products brought into the country through the trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada. Navarro finds Canadians very challenging in trade talks with the US Trump’s 35% tariff policies on Canada’s imports highlight that the president has ratcheted his trade talk and is focused on imposing tariff rates on the US trading partners after being involved in lengthy trade talks. US-Canada trade talks did not resemble those of other trading partners subjected to reciprocal tariffs. Mark Carney, the Prime Minister of Canada, mainly focused on ensuring Trump did not impose higher tariffs on their imports. Canada was initially subjected to a 25% tariff on imports from Country. The 35% tariff rate, which is set to take effect in August, was approximately 10% higher than the current one. However, this was not as intense as expected. This is because the USMCA agreement, which includes most of Canada’s exports to the US, neutralized the situation. On Friday, July 11, Navarro referred to Canada as a tough negotiator. In his opinion, Trump was doing the right thing as his tariffs counteracted higher taxes on US products and barriers to trade in other countries. Navarro stated that they talked with both the Mexicans and the Canadians. From the talks, he claimed that dealing with the Mexicans was a true pleasure during trade discussions in Trump’s first term, when he helped create the USMCA agreement. He further explained that the Mexicans were tough negotiators, but they were also fair and reasonable. On the other hand, Navarro mentioned that he found the Canadians very challenging and noted that they have always been hard to work with. Trump intends to subject several US trading partners to a blanket tariff ranging from 15% to 20% Following Trump’s 35% tariff threat on certain Canadian exports on July 11, and w ith the possibility of raising taxes in several other countries, he intensified his trade talks in statements that affected stock prices and strengthened the US dollar. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, posted on social media, Trump highlighted that Fentanyl is not the only issue the US faces with Canada. According to him, they have a lot of tariffs, non-tariff policies , and trade barriers that create huge trade deficits for the United States. The US president’s statement on Canada followed his remark to NBC News, where he pointed out plans to subject several US trading partners to a blanket tariff ranging from 15% to 20%. NBC reported that Trump mentioned that they would ensure that all the other countries pay, whether 20% or 15%. Based on his argument, they would figure that out. He also anticipated that the tariffs would be welcomed positively, revealing that the stock market reached a new high that day. Notably, the existing global average minimum tariff rate is nearly 10% for almost all of America’s trading partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While investors with diversified portfolios have been leaning on non-US assets for returns, July is flipping the script. The US index is now outpacing major global ETFs that had previously taken the lead, including those tied to Europe, emerging markets, and ex-US world stocks. This reversal comes even as trade tensions are ramping up again under President Donald Trump. During a call with Kristen Welker of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump pointed to Wall Street’s record levels as proof the tariffs are being “very well-received.” For US investors locked into the S&P 500, that confidence seems justified… at least for now. White House targets Brazil and Canada as ETFs slide US markets may be up, but foreign assets are under pressure. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ), which had been outperforming the S&P 500 earlier this year, is now down 4.6% just in July. That drop came after Trump slapped a brutal 50% tariff on Brazilian imports this week. The iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) is also falling behind, following a similar pattern. Both countries are now facing direct trade retaliation from Washington, and the market is reacting fast. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, Chief Investment Officer for the Americas and Global Head of Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note that Trump appears “emboldened to escalate trade actions” after winning some recent policy fights. Ulrike noted that many of the most heavily weighted stocks in the S&P 500 are largely safe from these tariff shocks. “We think the index can climb to 6,500 by June next year despite periodic volatility,” she wrote . That would represent about a 4% rise from where the index stood last Friday. The insulation Ulrike is talking about comes from the S&P 500’s heavy exposure to tech and other sectors that aren’t directly tied to the flow of physical goods. That makes it harder for tariffs to dent the value of many big US companies. It also gives domestic stocks a cushion that international funds just don’t have right now. US recovers dominance as global bets lose steam During the first half of 2025, foreign markets had the upper hand—a rare situation, given the last decade of US-led performance. But by July, that dynamic has started to swing back. Vanguard’s global ETFs excluding the US are now trailing the S&P 500, wiping out earlier gains. Investors who went all-in on diversification at the start of the year are now watching US stocks pull ahead again. Peter Oppenheimer, Chief Global Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs International, said US equities are still pricey. “Valuation spreads between the US and the rest of the world are at historical highs,” Peter wrote in a client memo. Even with that, he admitted that the US has reclaimed its footing faster than expected. “After a decade of US-led dominance, the case for diversification is back,” he said, but current numbers are proving otherwise. The S&P 500’s comeback puts pressure on global funds that were supposed to be the safe bet in a volatile election year. But that safety looks weaker now that Brazil and Canada are taking direct hits. Trump’s new tariffs are doing more damage abroad than at home, at least in the short term. Investors with broader exposure might feel the squeeze more than those who stuck with the core US index. And with Ulrike forecasting a 6,500 level by next summer, that bet on the S&P 500 is starting to look more appealing again, even if it comes with occasional swings. Right now, the American stock market is running hot, tariffs or not. And unless something drastic changes, July could be the point where the US fully reclaims its lead from the rest of the world.

Polygon (POL) is aiming for a breakout, with the next Polygon (POL) price target set at $0.2167 as it climbs above resistance at $0.1983. At the same time, signs of a VeChain (VET) price surge are building, with the token testing a big trendline and flashing bullish indicators. On the presale side, BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads with its Buyer Battles, sending out millions of BDAG coins daily. The setup is simple, fast, and loaded with energy. With two major tokens on the edge of a run and one presale making noise with big daily rewards, the market’s heating up fast. Let’s get into the details. Polygon (POL) Eyes $0.2167 as Breakout Momentum Grows The chart for Polygon (POL) is looking strong. A bullish MACD crossover just formed, and the Balance of Power indicator shows buyers stepping in. RSI is at 54.88 and climbing, which leaves room for more upside before things get overheated. If POL moves past $0.1983, the Polygon (POL) price target lands at $0.2167, matching up with the 1.618 Fibonacci level. If buyers keep pushing, prices might go beyond that too. If it dips, there’s support around $0.182 near the 0.618 Fib mark, which could help stabilize short-term pullbacks. VET Price Surge Could Be Close as Trendline Gets Tested VeChain (VET) is lining up for a breakout. The token is testing a descending trendline, which could be the trigger for a VeChain (VET) price surge. It’s already up 2.39% in 24 hours and recently hit $0.02140. If VET breaks above the current resistance, the first move could take it to $0.035, which would be a 63% jump. But it may not stop there. Some analysts see a full VeChain (VET) price surge hitting $0.05197, a 113% gain. History backs this up too, with a past breakout sending VET soaring by 252%. Daily Battles Heat Up: 50M BDAG Coins on the Line! Top crypto traders all share one habit: they move fast when the right setup appears. No waiting, no doubt, just action. That’s why BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles is getting serious attention across the space. Here’s the deal: 50 million BDAG coins are released each day. If they don’t all get picked up, the top buyer of the day takes the rest. The clock resets every day at 00:00 UTC. This isn’t a basic rewards event. It shows how much BlockDAG is focused on community. The platform already has a working testnet, mobile miner, and build tools live. Now, Buyer Battles adds more ways for early users to win. Right now, BDAG is still priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29, with the launch price confirmed at $0.05. That gives a 3,025% gain locked from the start. But this fixed rate ends with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. BlockDAG has now raised $336 million, and the presale is charging toward the $600 million goal. Buzz is building fast. Some market watchers are now calling for a $1 listing price. For anyone tracking the top cryptos to buy now, the timing could make all the difference. Once the early price window closes, it won’t open again. Where’s the Heat in the Market Right Now? If it breaks resistance, the Polygon (POL) price target is now marked at $0.2167. Meanwhile, signs of a Vechain (VET) price surge are showing, with forecasts reaching up to 113% if current barriers are crossed. Still, when it comes to finding the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG brings a strong case. At $0.0016, it offers the potential for 3,025% gains at launch, with no delay in action. With Buyer Battles active, traders can grab millions of coins every single day, adding even more upside. But the $0.0016 price won’t last much longer. The window is closing fast, and those who move now could see the biggest return.

According to SoSoValue data, IBIT saw $448 million in net inflows on July 10. On the same day, trading volume exceeded $5.39 billion, reflecting strong liquidity and sustained investor demand. The ETF’s net asset value is $80.11 billion, with each share trading around $64.50. These numbers represent not just a lot of money going into IBIT, but also the inclination of Bitcoin’s market value. IBIT now owns over 700k BTC and is one of BTC’s largest institutional holders. This holding represents around 3.55% of the total amount of Bitcoin. The fund was doing well amid a spurt in investor confidence in Bitcoin and the demand for exposure in a secure, regulated form. Unlike having Bitcoin directly under management, these ETFs, like IBIT, mean you can gain exposure without handling wallets or private keys, making them an attractive prospect for institutional/traditional investors. IBIT outpaces traditional ETFs and gold Though the meteoric trajectory of IBIT has no precedence in the crypto space, it has also outperformed the most successful traditional ETFs. IEFA required 2,034 days to achieve the same level while IEMG required 2,089 days. In contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF achieved this in just over a year. However, and in complete contrast, IBIT pulled off the task within a little over a year. Source: Eric Balchunas X According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the growth was “historic,” noting that IBIT hit the AUM milestone five times faster than any other fund. He also pointed out that the combined total AUM for all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has topped over $140 billion for the first time. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has also beaten gold to the accumulation finish line. It has taken in $70 billion AUM five times faster than gold-backed EFTs captured that level. This is a sign that more and more people are treating Bitcoin not as a risky bet, but are comparing it to something like traditional commodities in being a store of value. This change is crucial, as international financial uncertainty encourages investors to find alternative methods to protect themselves against inflation and fiat currency fluctuation. Bitcoin, the “digital gold,” is being looked at in some quarters as a rival to physical gold in institutional portfolios. IBIT accelerates toward matching Satoshi’s Bitcoin holdings Another major milestone has been reached: BlackRock’s IBIT is home to more than 700k BTC . This puts the firm on course to top the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is thought to have as much as 1 million BTC. If the current pace of accumulation continues, BlackRock would exceed that amount by 2026. Today, IBIT is the 21st largest ETF in the world — a stunning accomplishment for an upstart newcomer. Its success has reset the baseline for how swiftly a crypto-related financial product can earn trust and traction on Wall Street. This shift mirrors a fundamental change in the relationship between digital assets and traditional financial systems. Institutional players hesitated to get involved with crypto for years, citing volatility, lack of regulation, and security issues. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly one that Forbes reported was backed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, opens a new chapter. With ongoing interest from pension funds, family offices, and big wealth managers, the fund will likely experience even bigger inflows as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream in finance.

The lack of retail-driven hype amid BTC’s record-breaking run suggests there may still be room for further growth in the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ATH Sees Absence Of Hype According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Bitcoin’s current rally is notably characterized by the absence of retail investors. The contributor argues that this lack of retail participation implies BTC may still have significant upside potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The analysis centers on the Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge metric, which tracks the frequency of retail trading activity in the Bitcoin spot market. The analyst shared the following chart to illustrate the trend. When retail trading activity rises significantly compared to the one-year moving average (MA), the chart forms bubbles. Green bubbles indicate that there are very few retail investors currently in the market. Orange bubbles show that trading activity among retail investors is picking up. Similarly, red bubbles indicate caution, hinting that there are too many retail investors in the market and that it may be a good time to consider exit strategies. As the below chart shows, retail activity remains subdued – even as BTC continues to reach new ATHs. In fact, the metric has stayed within the gray zone since March 2024, reflecting a lack of mass retail entry. Historically, retail trading tends to surge as BTC approaches or exceeds ATH levels. The analyst notes that this absence may indicate the cycle top is still ahead: The bull market is still largely driven by institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When retail finally enters the scene, that might mark the beginning of the final phase. BTC Witnessing Subdued Selling Pressure In addition to the low retail presence, other on-chain indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s current rally is not overheating. For example, the Miner Position Index has been declining since November 2024, implying reduced selling pressure from miners. Another key metric, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, is holding steady around 2.2 – below the 2.7 levels observed during ATHs in March and December 2024. Recent analysis predicts the next significant resistance may emerge at around $130,900. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up?

This latest milestone comes after BTC’s former high at $111,000 levels in May, representing a 10% gain over the past week and roughly 5.9% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $117,584. The sharp price increase appears to be giving strength to activity among both miners and leveraged traders, prompting a closer examination of current market behavior. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have flagged a resurgence of miner activity alongside a rise in derivative positions, suggesting multiple forces may now be contributing to price movements. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold As these two segments of the market engage more actively, questions are emerging around the sustainability of this rally and whether these behaviors signal confidence or caution. The current on-chain environment shows both selling pressure from miners and increased exposure from long-positioned traders. Bitcoin Miner Activity Rises Alongside Price Surge One of CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributors, Arab Chain, observed a marked increase in miner activity as Bitcoin crossed the $118,000 level. According to the analyst, this uptick in activity is tied to miner transfers to exchanges, marking the first such increase since May 23. This trend suggests miners could be taking advantage of recent price gains to realize profits. As Arab Chain explained, “The continued activity of miners, coupled with Bitcoin’s price rising to new highs, clearly indicates that they are selling Bitcoin.” Despite this renewed transfer volume, miner behavior has not yet reached the scale of over-the-counter (OTC) selling seen in previous months. Historically, large-scale selling by miners has introduced notable volatility into the market, particularly when sustained across a broader period. The analyst also pointed out the economic leverage miners hold in decision-making, owing to their ability to manage operational costs and balance between holding and selling mined Bitcoin. Whether this increase in exchange flows will develop into heavier selling remains to be seen. Derivatives Market Shows Renewed Leverage Exposure In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader focused on derivatives market activity, highlighting a 24% surge in open interest from approximately $33 billion on July 1 to over $41 billion by July 11. The timing of this increase coincides with Bitcoin’s breakout above $118,000, and reflects renewed leveraged interest following a reset late last month. This level of open interest suggests that traders are positioning more aggressively, potentially anticipating continued upside. The analyst also noted a shift in funding rates from negative to their highest positive reading in a month, around 0.012% per eight hours. Positive funding indicates that long-positioned traders are paying to maintain their positions, a sign of bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback However, Enigma Trader cautioned that such positioning can become precarious if momentum slows. “This setup often fuels upside continuation if spot demand backs it, but also increases the risk of a long squeeze should momentum stall,” the analyst wrote.

ETH Eyes $5K & TIA Gains Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-seattle-sports-partnership-drives-presale-to-336m-eth-eyes-5k-tia-gains-strength/,"While Ethereum (ETH) continues to command attention with its upgrades and market confidence, its path toward a new all-time high of $5000 remains under close watch. At the same time, Celestia’s modular approach has strengthened the Celestia (TIA) price rally, showcasing its ability to stay resilient despite volatile conditions. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s remarkable presale momentum has secured over $336 million, boosted by its fresh partnership with the Seattle Seawolves. This analytical review examines their current standing in terms of performance, scalability, and practical adoption, and reveals which among them qualifies as the best crypto right now. Ethereum Price Target: Is $5000 Still Within Reach? Ethereum has stayed crucial for DeFi protocols and smart contract activities, supporting its $5000 price goal despite recent dips. Awakening of early wallets and steady whale accumulation indicate strategic moves from big holders. The platform still leads in total value locked, active development teams, and continues to roll out upgrades like proto-danksharding to maintain its dominance. Although transaction fees remain high, Layer 2 solutions are helping reduce network strain, adding to Ethereum’s strength. While regulatory uncertainty still affects certain regions, its wide adoption makes it difficult to replace. Overall, as long as usage and developer contributions remain strong, the Ethereum (ETH) price target remains valid, maintaining its position as an essential player in crypto with unmatched utility. Celestia (TIA) Price Rally Driven by Modular Design and Rollup Strength Celestia has proven how effective a modular blockchain model can be in practical terms. Its system separates consensus from execution, allowing builders to deploy rollup chains without the usual network bottlenecks. This structure is a key factor behind the recent TIA price rally, which has gained significant market attention. With a recent 26% increase, Celestia is attracting more developers and liquidity, strengthening its rollup-focused framework with solid proof in live markets. Unlike typical Layer 1 projects that overstate capabilities, Celestia delivers scalability efficiently. Its current momentum suggests the Celestia (TIA) price rally could move beyond $2.26 as adoption grows. Its fundamental strength aligns with its market performance, a trait that sets it apart from many others vying for attention this cycle. BlockDAG’s Seattle Seawolves Collaboration Fuels Web3 Expansion BlockDAG is setting itself apart not by just focusing on blockchain alone, but by entering mainstream spaces like sports to display its practical benefits. Its deal with the Seattle Seawolves, a leading Major League Rugby team, is far from a typical marketing move. The aim is to enhance fan experiences with exclusive digital collectibles, player-led content, and blockchain-powered tools that bring fans closer to the action. This partnership highlights practical Web3 usage that fans can witness firsthand. The strategic move is supported by BlockDAG’s strong technical framework built for secure, high-volume interactions. By working alongside the Seawolves, BlockDAG is testing its technology under real-world conditions, offering fans meaningful digital engagements that enhance their loyalty. Adding to this powerful push is its presale performance. BlockDAG has already raised over $336 million in presale funding, selling 23.8 billion coins and delivering a notable 2,660% growth in early buyers’ funds since batch 1. Currently, its batch 29 price stands at $0.0016, available until August 11th. With BDAG projected to launch at $0.05, this price point suggests a potential 3,025% upside. Combined with its practical market approach, BlockDAG stands strong among the best crypto right now, backed by real adoption, solid returns, and wide utility. Final Take! Ethereum’s enduring upgrades and revived wallet movements add credibility to the Ethereum (ETH) price target, keeping it among the top crypto networks by utility and stability. Celestia continues to impress with its modular design and rising Celestia (TIA) price rally, making it a strong Layer 1 for scalability-focused buyers. However, BlockDAG’s unmatched presale achievement, real-world partnerships with sports teams, and wide technological rollout solidify its place as the best crypto right now for those seeking practical growth combined with meaningful Web3 integration.

With inflows now exceeding $4 billion, both assets are seeing strengthened technical setups and increased investor conviction. This fresh momentum is being seen as the beginning of a broader altcoin reaccumulation cycle—one that may extend far beyond just the market leaders. Alongside this surge in legacy assets, a new generation of narrative-driven tokens is beginning to gain attention. Among them is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically themed altcoin quietly building a base of support among those seeking early exposure to conviction-led projects. Bitcoin and XRP Lead the Charge with Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains the dominant player in institutional crypto portfolios. The approval and rollout of multiple ETFs have made Bitcoin more accessible than ever to traditional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. These inflows are not only driving price resilience but also redefining Bitcoin’s role as a long-term macro asset. XRP has also staged a return to institutional portfolios. With its regulatory uncertainty resolved and Grayscale’s XRP ETF moving forward, the token has re-entered the spotlight. Analysts point to its utility in cross-border transactions, low-fee transfer mechanics, and increasing global adoption as reasons why capital inflows are likely to continue rising. Together, the two assets are serving as anchors for a broader resurgence in crypto market activity—particularly as ETF access reduces barriers for traditional capital. Altcoin Rotation Begins as Traders Search for Narrative-Driven Plays With Bitcoin and XRP stabilizing, seasoned investors are beginning to look down the market cap list. Historically, when large-cap tokens lead ETF-driven rallies, mid-cap and narrative-rich altcoins follow shortly after. Market sentiment is now focused on tokens that reflect strong thematic relevance: political identity, decentralized governance, or real-world application. This environment has created space for newer projects to emerge—particularly those with strong positioning and early traction. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Market Attention As Ethereum solidifies its lead with continued Layer 2 expansion and institutional flows, and XRP reclaims market share following its regulatory resolution, many altcoin traders are looking ahead — toward assets that combine narrative strength with growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into that spotlight with: A strong political narrative that breaks away from generic crypto themes A defined early advantage phase with high-conviction support Increasing mentions across analyst reports and trading forums Clear signs of preparing for broader exchange visibility As momentum shifts toward high-conviction projects that blend ideology with technology, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its lane at the perfect time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Political Altcoin with Cultural Relevance Among the early-stage projects attracting analyst attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE . Positioned as a decentralized political memecoin , it stands at the intersection of meme culture and ideological narrative—offering a rare mix of cultural resonance and structural integrity. The project is anchored by a zero-tax trading model, a fixed-supply framework, and a community-driven governance roadmap. Designed to appeal to users aligned with anti-centralization values, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning mentions in altcoin watchlists for its potential to capture attention in a cycle where identity and conviction are key drivers. Its political theme gives it an edge in a saturated market of trend-based tokens, while its early development progress has shown signs of long-term vision rather than short-lived momentum. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Q3’s Breakout Altcoin With over $4 billion in ETF-related inflows into Bitcoin and XRP, the foundations of a new bull phase may already be forming. For traders and investors seeking something with staying power, ideological relevance, and early access advantages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most compelling tokens to watch this quarter.

It’s a technology born from frustration with centralized control systems, and it has thrived because of one key principle – neutrality. Neutrality from politics, from institutions, from borders. Now that BTCFi is picking up the pace, it’s highly important to remember this principle – and defend it. Allowing BTCFi to be steered by the same political and institutional forces that have long shaped traditional finance (TradFi) would mean repeating many of the same historical mistakes that led the world to adopt the concept of crypto in the first place. It would also pose a significant risk to Bitcoin’s core purpose and future viability. The case for political neutrality At its core, Bitcoin was created to be outside of government control, immune to the kind of monetary manipulation that has plagued fiat currencies. Which means that neutrality isn’t a ‘nice-to-have’ in this situation – it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. Bitcoin works because it doesn’t care where you live – it’s an open, trustless, permissionless system that anyone can take part in so long as they simply have an internet connection. BTCFi must inherit this same core principle. If we start building it around the priorities of state-affiliated actors, there’s a very real risk of Bitcoin changing from a tool of decentralized empowerment into what would basically be just ‘TradFi 2.0.’ Wrapped up in new tech, perhaps, but still governed by the same old rules. Decentralized systems only work if they are decentralized in every way – infrastructure and values alike. What happens if BTCFi gets politicized The answer to this question is simple. Bitcoin could lose the one trait that makes it uniquely valuable and attractive – its neutrality. When institutions or governments influence how BTCFi evolves, the protocols being built will inevitably begin to cater to them. It won’t be long before we see gatekeeping and censorship. The introduction of permissioned systems wrapped in the illusion of decentralization. If we go down that road, Bitcoin’s utility as a neutral global store of value will plummet. And if so, the next wave of financial innovation will likely leave it behind in favor of other assets that are still politically neutral. Is the original cryptocurrency becoming the one that lost its way? I don’t think many people in the industry would want to see it happen. The good news is that the Bitcoin community has the tools to protect BTCFi from such a fate, but there needs to be an intentional approach to this. Let me explain what I mean by that. The path forward – B uilding with purpose Firstly, when DeFi developers work on their infrastructure, they need to make it politically neutral by default. That means no special privileges or reliance on centralized intermediaries. Native Bitcoin layer-twos must be trustless and resilient, and any DeFi product built on top of them should be censorship-resistant and globally accessible. Second, there needs to be more support from crypto investors – especially large holders – for projects that align with Bitcoin’s core values. If capital flows into politically aligned or institutionally influenced products, we’re feeding the wrong machine. Finally, speed matters. If BTCFi products can achieve rapid adoption, it will be that much harder for the whole ecosystem to be hijacked. In other words, momentum is its own form of protection – by outpacing regulators and institutions with centralized interests, they will have a hard time catching up to try and influence BTCFi’s development. But in order to achieve all of the above, developers must focus on making their products usable and safe. Without these two pillars, mass adoption will be a long way off. Investors and the broader community must be actively engaged to promote projects that preserve the ideals of openness and decentralization while also delivering tangible value to people. Why BTCFi is taking off – and why it needs safeguards The momentum behind BTCFi is undeniable. In late 2024, its total value jumped from $800 million to $6.5 billion in just a few months. Some analysts predict that by 2030, over $47 billion worth of Bitcoin could be actively used in DeFi. There are clear reasons for this surge. The growth of Bitcoin ETFs has made BTC the most ‘mainstream’ crypto asset, adding a sense of legitimacy and attracting whales who want to do more with their holdings without selling them. But with that same surge comes attention – regulators and institutions alike are watching and getting involved a lot more actively now. That’s why now is the time to set the tone for how BTCFi evolves. It has the potential to transform how Bitcoin is used, but that transformation will only be meaningful if we stay true to Bitcoin’s foundational values. Bitcoin’s greatest strength is that it doesn’t discriminate or take sides – a nd BTCFi should be no different. Michael Egorov is the founder of leading DeFi exchange Curve Finance .

From high-speed networks to meme-driven demand and AI innovation, different themes are shaping what many consider the best cryptos to buy now. Solana, PEPE, and Render each offer distinct advantages, whether it’s low-cost smart contracts, strong community hype, or decentralized computing power. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is generating major buzz of its own. Its daily Buyer Battles, fixed $0.0016 entry price, and a $336 million presale total make it one of the top names to watch as launch day nears. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Daily Buyer Battles Offer 50M BDAG to Top Participants BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have added an exciting twist to its ongoing presale. Every 24 hours, 50 million BDAG coins are available, and any unsold coins are awarded to the buyer with the largest single purchase of the day. This encourages consistent participation and gives buyers a chance to earn extra without paying extra, turning the presale into a competition. With the entry price fixed at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, many see this period as the best chance to buy before the price jumps to $0.05. The built-in 3,025% return, paired with the Buyer Battles system, adds a competitive edge and positions BlockDAG as one of the best cryptos to buy now. So far, over $336 million has been raised and more than 23.8 billion coins sold across 29 batches. BlockDAG’s focus on community engagement through referrals and strategic incentives shows how user-driven momentum can push a project forward. 2. PEPE: Meme Coin Keeps Drawing Attention PEPE made headlines in 2024 by jumping 1,500% in market cap, rising from a small microcap to a top 50 meme coin. Community-led token burns and exchange listings, including Coinbase, helped build momentum. Social media buzz and posts from Elon Musk pushed PEPE even further into the spotlight. Currently priced near $0.00001032 with a $4 billion market cap, PEPE still draws buyers looking for the next viral move. While it’s more volatile than other coins, its unpredictable nature is part of the appeal. For some, PEPE remains one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially if meme coin enthusiasm returns. 3. Solana (SOL): DeFi Ecosystem Expands Despite Price Dip Solana (SOL) continues to gain attention as a powerful alternative to Ethereum. With ultra-fast transactions and low fees, Solana supports a growing range of smart contracts and decentralized applications. After rebounding from the FTX-linked crash, it moved from around $100 early in 2024 to over $200 later that year. By early 2025, SOL reached $293 but has since pulled back to $151. For many, this lower range is an opportunity to enter before any potential recovery. With a strong developer community and new DeFi projects launching on the network, Solana still holds a spot among the best cryptos to buy now as the market heads into the final quarter. 4. Render (RNDR): Fueling AI Growth with GPU Sharing Render (RNDR) operates in the fast-growing AI sector by providing decentralized access to GPU computing power. It’s used for heavy-demand tasks like 3D rendering and machine learning, offering a useful alternative to centralized cloud providers. RNDR rose from about $4.40 to $7.50 last year, even hitting $13.53 during peak hype. Currently trading around $3.40 with a $1.7 billion market cap, Render appears to be at a more accessible entry point. If AI adoption keeps accelerating, Render’s services may see greater demand, lifting RNDR back onto the list of best cryptos to buy now for those watching the next AI wave. Evaluating the Best Crypto to Buy Now The crypto market keeps evolving, with Solana, PEPE, and Render each offering different reasons to consider them among the best cryptos to buy now. Whether it’s DeFi potential, meme momentum, or AI infrastructure, they represent the variety of themes driving today’s trading choices. However, BlockDAG is capturing more attention this month. With its locked $0.0016 price, $336 million raised, and a daily reward system through Buyer Battles, the project is quickly becoming a standout choice. For those seeking strong upside potential and daily engagement, BlockDAG may be one of the best cryptos to buy now before the next wave of adoption begins.

Related Reading: Drop NFTs Like It’s Hot: Snoop Dogg’s Telegram Collection Raises $12M In 30 Minutes Crypto Hacker Takes $42 Million From GMX On Friday, the recent GMX V1 exploit ended on a happy note after the individual responsible for the incident turned into a white-hat hacker. Perpetual and spot crypto exchange GMX lost over $40 million on Wednesday when an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the protocol’s first version on Arbitrum. According to online reports, GMX V1’s vault contract had a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to manipulate the GLP token price through the system’s calculations. Blockchain security firm SlowMist explained that “The root cause of this attack stems from GMX v1’s design flaw, where short position operations immediately update the global short average prices (globalShortAveragePrices), which directly impacts the calculation of Assets Under Management (AUM), thereby allowing manipulation of GLP token pricing.” Through a reentrancy attack, they successfully established massive short positions to manipulate the global average prices, artificially inflating GLP prices within a single transaction and profiting through redemption operations. As a result, approximately $42 million worth of assets, including Legacy Frax Dollar (FRAX), wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), wrapped ETH (WETH), and other tokens, were transferred from the GLP pool to an unknown wallet. The perpetual crypto exchange halted GMX V1’s trading and GLP’s minting and redeeming on both Arbitrum and Avalanche to prevent another attack and protect users’ funds. However, they clarified that the exploit was limited to GMX’s V1 and its GLP pool. GMX V2, its markets, or liquidity pools, and the GMX token were not affected and remained safe. White-Hat Claims $5 Million Bounty Following the incident, GMX sent a message on-chain and on X offering a $5 million white-hat bounty to the attacker, claiming that their abilities were “evident to anyone looking into the exploit transactions.” GMX’s team noted that returning the funds within the next 48 hours and accepting the bounty would allow the hacker to “spend the funds freely,” instead of taking additional risks to access them. They also vowed not to pursue any legal action and to assist the exploiter in providing proof of source for the funds if it is ever required. Today, the exploiter responded in an on-chain message, accepting the bounty and starting the return process. As Lookonchain reported, they initially returned $10.49 million worth of FRAX on Friday morning. Meanwhile, another $32 million worth of assets had been swapped into 11,700 ETH, which are now valued at $35 million after the King of Altcoins’ price jumped to the $2,990 mark. In the following hours, the hacker returned 10,000 ETH, worth $30 million, keeping only 1,700 ETH, valued at $5.2 million, as the bounty. Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time GMX later confirmed that the funds have now been safely returned and thanked the white-hat hacker for their actions, ultimately giving a positive turn to the incident.

The SEC had already approved the conversion on July 1 on an “accelerated basis”. However, a day later, the regulator issued a stay order to review the approval due to a pending internal review. “Grayscale, the Exchange and the Fund’s current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay in public launch of the Fund,” the company said. Grayscale also claimed that the fund’s approval should stand by default as the SEC missed its legal deadline to act on the proposal, and that under federal law, the conversion of the fund should be considered automatically approved. The asset manager’s lawyers are now contemplating filing a petition to force the regulator to allow its fund to begin trading as soon as possible. “Grayscale and the Exchange are therefore considering whether to file a petition requesting the Commission to lift the stay imposed by Rule 431(e) while the Commission reviews the action taken by delegated authority, so that the Fund may promptly launch while that review proceeds,” they postulated. The move to convert GDLC into a spot fund is in line with Grayscale’s wider strategy to introduce more crypto products to mainstream financial markets, following the successful introduction of its spot BTC ETF in early 2024. Meanwhile, asset managers have flooded the SEC’s desk with applications for ETF proposals tracking the prices of several cryptocurrencies, including meme coins like Dogecoin and Official Trump and other altcoins, amid a more lenient regulatory backdrop in the United States since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.",Cryptocurrency|News|Grayscale|SOL|Solana|SOLUSD|XRP News|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|BUSINESS|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-12 04:42:08

Thus far, there have been many opposing outlooks from different market participants. While some are convinced that altcoins will underperform for the rest of the year, others remain optimistic that the highly anticipated altcoin season will come into play before the close of the year. One such analyst who maintains a bullish outlook for altcoin is João Wedson. The verified analyst published on Cryptoquant and CoinMarketCap is sharing yet another bullish take with his 7,000+ follower base. In a post shared on X, the analyst makes a bold assertion, stating that a “mini altcoin season” is in play. Notably, altcoin season is a period when alternative coins outperform Bitcoin for a few weeks to several months. Per Wedson’s observation, as illustrated by an altcoin season index vs Bitcoin chart he shared, 90% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 72 hours. “After months of saying that June and July would heat up the altcoin market — this is just the beginning! Few will believe we’re in an Altcoin Season because the media and baseless analyses fill your head with hopelessness.” The analyst wrote . It, however, bears mentioning that the Altcoins in question include Altcoins outside the top 100 category. Notably, altcoin season usually kicks off when 75% of the top 100 Altcoins outperform Bitcoin within 90 days. According to data from CoinMarketCap , only 26 out of 100 leading altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The highest value of 30 was last recorded in June, while April 26 marked a yearly low, with only 12 altcoins outpacing Bitcoin. Wedson, who appears to be sticking to his guns, maintains that multiple “mini altcoin seasons” can be observed within a week. He remarks that whale activity is usually heightened at this time, and concludes with an even more bullish forecast for altcoins. “I’ve shared many times that within just one week, several mini Altcoin Seasons can happen — and that’s exactly when whales make fast, massive profits. But make no mistake: a larger Altcoin Season is already underway.” He added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Ethereum News|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ADA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-12 04:46:21

Crypto Trade Groups Urge Congress To Pass Crypto Legislation According to the Friday letter from Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, The Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone and President and Acting CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation Ji Hun Kim, the three digital asset policy collectives called on U.S. lawmakers to advance the “important” crypto legislation. 1/ United for CLARITY: The 3 leading U.S. digital asset trade groups — @BlockchainAssn , @crypto_council , and @DigitalChamber — are calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan CLARITY Act. It’s time for regulatory certainty. pic.twitter.com/AL7AdtvlQG — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) July 11, 2025 “The CLARITY Act represents meaningful progress toward the regulatory certainty needed for our industry to foster innovation and for blockchain technology to thrive in the U.S.,” the CEOs said. “Advancing this bipartisan market structure legislation sends a strong message that the U.S. is committed as the global leader in digital assets,” they added. If enacted, the CLARITY would largely see crypto regulatory responsibility delegated from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC). The move would mark a win for crypto proponents after years of the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach and treatment of digital assets as securities. “As the conversation continues, we encourage the Senate to build on the momentum from the House and engage closely with industry stakeholders to bring bipartisan market structure legislation to the Senate floor as soon as possible,” the letter states. “We look forward to continuing to work with both chambers to help ensure U.S. leadership in digital assets.” Congress Braces For Dueling Crypto Weeks The blockchain trade groups’ letter comes ahead of the Republican Party’s purported “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill. However, Democratic lawmakers Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch unveiled on Friday that they would be launching their own “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” in opposition to Republicans’ crypto legislative efforts. “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto,” Congressman Lynch said.

Wedson noted that the market may have reached a critical “Alpha Price” zone at current levels, and therefore a short-term correction is possible. However, he argued that this decline could create a new buying opportunity within the next few days. On the other hand, he said that if Bitcoin breaks above the $119,300 level, a strong uptrend could begin in the market. Related News: BREAKING: Highly Surprising Move from Coinbase - Official X Account Changes Profile Photo to Surprise Altcoin - Price Jumps Speaking specifically about Cardano, Wedson argued that ADA is currently in a distribution phase, which could present a good entry opportunity in the short term. However, he emphasized that the real breakout could occur in the final quarter of the year, saying, “It's possible that ADA will be trading well above $3 by the end of October or the beginning of November.” While acknowledging that this surge could disrupt some technical analysis patterns, Wedson stated that on-chain data is quite promising. “Our average buy price for ADA is $0.2883.

This stage is characterized by rapid, emotionally driven price gains fueled by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). With Bitcoin recently surging to $118,000 and reaching an all-time high, Kiyosaki cautions that peak euphoria often brings heightened volatility. Kiyosaki agrees with Pal that Bitcoin’s limited supply can trigger sharp price surges when demand spikes, often driven by institutions, media buzz, and retail FOMO, but also brings high volatility. Another RICH DAD LESSON: “PIGs get fat. HOGs get slaughtered.” I state this lesson because I bought my latest BITCOIN at $110k. I am now in position for what Raoul Pal calls “the Banana Zone.” In the Banana Zone the HOGS will rush in….driven to insanity by the dreaded… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 11, 2025 Bitcoin Enters the FOMO-Driven Banana Zone Before getting into the dynamics, let’s understand what is the Banana zone. This phase, often seen in Bitcoin bull markets, tends to be marked by explosive growth fueled by media hype, institutional interest , and retail FOMO. However, while the euphoria is building, Kiyosaki is urging caution. He warns that many new investors may be jumping in blindly, chasing rapid gains without understanding the volatility that comes with such parabolic runs. The emotional buying hype could easily flip into panic selling, especially if the price corrects sharply. Instead of getting swept up in the hype, Kiyosaki advises staying grounded and advises to focus on education, doing your research, and investing with discipline. In short, while the “Banana Zone” might look like a golden opportunity, it’s also a dangerous trap for the unprepared. “I Am a Fat PIG with Bitcoin,” Says Kiyosaki Kiyosaki bought Bitcoin early, around $6,000, and has made big profits by staying patient and not chasing hype. He credits his success to smart investing, not luck, and continues to support Bitcoin because of its limited supply and independence from governments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH , He still believes a major price surge, the “Banana Zone”, is on the way. He further revealed his latest Bitcoin purchase at $110,000, positioning himself well for the “Banana Zone.” He describes himself as a disciplined “fat pig,” patiently accumulating during market peaks, in contrast to “hogs” who jump in late and get burned. He expects temporary corrections but remains bullish, with a long-term target of $250,000 by 2025 and even $1 million by 2030 . Bitcoin Rises as Faith in Fiat Fades Many investors are starting to lose trust in traditional currencies (such as dollars or euros), primarily because governments are accumulating excessive debt, and people are concerned about inflation. In this environment, Bitcoin is starting to look more attractive, like digital gold, because there’s a limited supply of it, which makes it a good way to protect your wealth. But Kiyosaki and other experts believe this shift in thinking is helping Bitcoin gain momentum . Big institutions are also showing more interest, which adds fuel to the fire. Some analysts suggest that if the U.S. Federal Reserve alters its current policies, particularly by lowering interest rates, Bitcoin could surge again, potentially reaching five- or even six-figure prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This asserts the grey area of cryptocurrency in the country. According to Law 183-02 of the Republic, no payments are debts are to be accepted by the banks with crypto assets. Risk and Penalty Another statement released by the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic warned the entities operating crypto, saying any individual or company dealing and investing in crypto should do it at their own risk. In the same statement, the officials announced that any banks or other regulated financial institutions dealing with crypto may be subject to fines and sanctions. As a result of this, most banks do not take clients dealing with crypto assets. License – The Dominican Republic does not have any specific crypto regulations or licenses for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). However, if digital assets are used in financial intermediation, then the company and individual engaging in the activity would require a crypto license.

Legalised crypto platforms- Despite not legalizing crypto assets or regulating specific laws, people are engaging with crypto in the Dominican Republic. Platforms offering services are required to follow AML and KYC compliance to ensure the safety of customers’ funds. Arkham and Arkham Futures are some of the best crypto platforms in the Republic to ensure the protection of the user. These platforms do not engage in illegal activities and have strict compliance with KYC and AML. What is the government of the Dominican Republic saying about crypto? The government of the Dominican Republic, more specifically the Central Bank, has taken several cautious steps regarding cryptocurrency in the country. It has reiterated that crypto is not legal tender and is not backed by the government. It has not officially banned crypto but has warned the local institutions, banks, and citizens from using crypto due to its potential risks. The government has also emphasised that the national currency of the Dominican Republic remains the sole legal tender for payments in the country. Crypto License in Dominican Republic 2025 The Dominican Republic does not have any specific cryptocurrency license. Despite the lack of licensing in the country, there is no explicit prohibition on engaging in crypto activities. The existing financial regulations apply to crypto in the country, as the government is yet to address crypto and provide clarity on it specifically. Crypto Tax in the Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic follows a territorial tax regime to balance revenue and promote innovation. Under this regime, any income earned within the country is subject to tax. This same principle applies to crypto as well. Thus, earnings from crypto-related activities such as mining and trading are taxable in the Republic.

48086318,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=403743,1752299550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/48086318.jpeg,Report: BTC Treasuries Face $12.8B Maturity Wall by 2028,https://cryptopotato.com/report-btc-treasuries-face-12-8b-maturity-wall-by-2028/,"A looming $12.8 billion debt maturity wall could threaten the sustainability of major Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) like Marathon Digital and Nakamoto by 2028. This is according to a new Keyrock report showing that while such firms collectively hold more than 725,000 BTC, their reliance on capital markets and negative cash flows for acquisitions has made them vulnerable to weakening Bitcoin prices and souring investor sentiment. The Debt-Fueled Accumulation Boom BTC-TCs, public companies using debt and equity to amass Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, have exploded since Strategy pioneered the model in 2020. The Michael Saylor-led business intelligence provider now dominates the sector, holding no fewer than 597,000 BTC, or 82% of the cohort total, valued at about $67 billion at current rates. So far, the steadily growing industry has raised more than $3.35 billion in preferred equity and approximately $9.48 billion in debt, alongside substantial common stock sales to fuel their BTC buying spree. According to Keyrock, this capital structure has created a significant refinancing risk: $12.8 billion in debt maturities, heavily clustered in 2027 and 2028. While convertible notes, such as Strategy’s $7.3 billion in 0% issuance, have become popular and offer potential equity conversion relief, they hinge on sustained high stock prices. This means that if prices fall below conversion thresholds, it could force the BTC-TCs to sell portions of their holdings or resort to distress refinancing, which could trigger downward spirals. Newer entrants like Twenty One Capital and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet are trying to prevent such scenarios by employing varied strategies, including leveraging Japan’s zero rates and getting into SPAC mergers. That being said, Keyrock’s analysis shows that the core reliance on favorable market access remains pervasive across the sector. Sustainability Hinges on Fragile Premiums and Cash Flow Per the report, Bitcoin-focused businesses face two major risks: the cost of paying off their debts and how long they can keep operating without running out of money. Despite this, investors are willing to pay 73% more than the actual value of the BTC these companies hold. They justify this using Strategy as a case study. The firm has boosted its Bitcoin-per-share by about 63.6% each year, thanks to smart fundraising during bull markets that helped it buy more Bitcoin without hurting shareholders. However, according to Keyrock, there’s a big difference in how much cash these firms make. For instance, it says companies like Strategy and Marathon Digital are losing a lot of money from their day-to-day operations, about $78.3 million and $43.5 million each quarter. To stay afloat, they rely entirely on selling new shares at high prices. Nakamoto is in a similar position. Meanwhile, outfits like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and CoinShares are doing better. They either make a profit each quarter or have enough cash saved up, which helps them handle costs without needing to sell shares or dip into their BTC stash. Now, suppose BTC prices drop, or the hoarding strategy fails, and the market stops valuing these companies far above the actual worth of their holdings. In that case, Keyrock analysts claim that Marathon and Nakamoto could run into trouble, forcing them to sell Bitcoin or issue lots of new shares every quarter, which could reduce the value for existing investors.

PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover,"" hinting at big plans ahead. In the current market, PEPE stands out as an intriguing player. It taps into the power of memes and community spirit. While the future is uncertain, many are keeping a close eye on PEPE, wondering if it will reach new heights in the next big crypto cycle.

Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to the serious world of crypto. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum cap and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a joke or ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin took the world by surprise in 2021. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, its value skyrocketed, propelling it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, offering faster transaction times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Its community-driven approach has fostered a loyal following, contributing to charitable causes and sponsorships. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its simplicity and the backing of a vibrant community. While other cryptocurrencies focus on complex technologies and use cases, Dogecoin remains accessible to newcomers. Market trends show a growing interest in decentralized finance and meme coins, suggesting that Dogecoin could continue to gain traction. However, its unlimited supply may affect long-term value. Investors looking for potential gains might find Dogecoin attractive, but should consider the volatility and do their research.

Even with the recent market recovery, the price is still sitting over 45% below its all-time high price, highlighting the struggles that the altcoin has faced in recent times. Amid this, a crypto analyst has suggested that the Solana price could crash even further from here, predicting a 40% crash could be in the cards once more. Why Solana Could See A Price Crash Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader has highlighted the development of a rare bullish harmonic pattern on the Solana price chart. Now, while this pattern formation is inherently bullish for any digital asset, the shorter term does come with some hurdles for the altcoin to surmount first. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time The main thing to focus on here is that this bullish pattern does initially trigger a liquidity sweep of previous lows. In this case, the recent Solana price low lies at the $95 level, which is a 40% decrease from its current price, trending above $150. The possibility of this low sweep is made even more prominent by a couple of technical developments on the chart. The first technical point the analyst shows is the Point of Control (POC) Battle. According to the analysis, the Solana price is now testing this POC level with low momentum, shown by the slow climb over the last few days. Additionally, there is also mounting resistance at the Value Area High and the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which lies just above $163. Then, there is the completion of the C-leg of the wave, putting it as low as $95. A crash to this level becomes more likely if the Solana price fails to break through the resistance with conviction. If the price is rejected and the C-leg does play out, then this correction is expected to trigger the 40% crash to the $95 level. It’s Not All Bearish News As already mentioned above, the bearish leg of the rare bullish harmonic pattern is only temporary and often gives way to an even stronger impulse move. As the crypto analyst explains, the crash to $95 will only happen in the immediate short term, but it does not actually invalidate the overall bullish trend. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It’s Now ‘Illegal’ To Short Bitcoin, Here’s Why Once the D-leg is over and the crash is completed, the crypto analyst predicts that the Solana price will start to rally again. From the predicted $05 lows, an over 100% move is expected to take it back to $200 and beyond before the rally is over. The analyst explains that “Until this scenario is confirmed or invalidated, Solana remains range-bound between major high time frame levels.” Therefore, “Traders should stay alert for signs of rejection at current resistance — or, conversely, a volume-backed breakout above the value area high that would negate the harmonic setup.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Solana|Sol|SOL news|SOL Price|Solana news|Solana Price|SOLUSD|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-07-12 06:00:49

Its commitment to building a comprehensive platform could make it a key player in the next phase of digital finance.

Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This lets it tap into Ethereum's vast network of apps and tools. With an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB grabbed attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

While trading or owning stablecoins has been legalized in Bolivia, their use for business payments is not permitted, and they are not considered legal tender. Stablecoins transactions in Bolivia are only allowed via an authorized bank. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Bolivia 2025 What is the Bolivian government saying about crypto? Crypto License in Bolivia 2025 Crypto tax in Bolivia 2025 Crypto adoption rate in Bolivia 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Bolivia 2025 May 23, 2025 , YPFB Bans Executive Order 5399 bans the state-owned oil company from purchasing crypto to make payments.

May 7, 2025, Supreme Decree No. 5384 The Bolivian government confirms recognition of disruptive technologies– blockchains, tokenized assets, virtual assets, and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Recognizes financial technological companies of the country, establishing a legal framework that enables startups and developing fintechs. April 16, 2025- Resolution no. 019/2025 Laid the groundwork for the initial recognition of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASP). Marking a milestone by lifting the old restrictions and recognizing fintech developing frameworks.

Public awareness : After lifting the crypto ban in the country, the Bolivian government launched public awareness campaigns to teach people about crypto basics, risks, and how digital assets work. Consumer protection : The Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) officials are drafting crypto regulations focusing on transparency, safety, and innovation. It aims to prevent crypto scams while balancing rules and technology. USD-pegged stablecoins : In March 2025, the BCB utilized USD-pegged stablecoins for cross-border payments, remittances, and trading. It also traded crypto exchanges as a store of value in countries with volatile local currency. Crypto License in Bolivia 2025 Is there any crypto license in Bolivia? No, Bolivia does not have a specific crypto license. The government is currently prioritizing financial stability and capital preservation for digital assets. Hence, no license is required to conduct legal crypto activities in Bolivia. Crypto tax in Bolivia 2025 No capital gains tax : There is no specific tax legislation regarding crypto in Bolivia. While the standard taxes, like VAT/GST, are applied to goods or services purchased, crypto profits would likely be taxed under PIT (personal income tax). CIT : Hence, mining, staking, and other crypto-related activities will be subject to 25% corporate income tax (CIT) as business income and individual earnings via crypto are not taxed in Bolivia. Crypto adoption rate in Bolivia 2025 Dynamic growth – After lifting the crypto ban in 2024, Bolivia reported a 100% rise in virtual asset trading , becoming one of the most dynamic Latin American regions for cryptocurrency adoption. Present adoption rate – Currently, the crypto adoption rate in Bolivia is 3.5% , with a continuously evolving state of digital assets in the country.

Conclusion By regulating cryptocurrency in the country, Bolivia aims to maintain stability and innovation in its fintech market. However, its ban on using crypto in energy transactions is to prevent the instability that the digital assets could bring to its energy sector. While the Bolivian government is addressing the risks associated with crypto, it is also crucial for them to recognize the potential benefits to harness the full potential of cryptocurrency in the country’s economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Often misunderstood, DFINITY’s Internet Computer enables fully decentralized applications with no reliance on AWS or centralized APIs. Recent integrations with Bitcoin and Ethereum could open the door to a new wave of adoption. Why it Could 1000x: If its vision of a decentralized internet gains traction. 6. TRON (TRX) – The Unstoppable Settlement Layer Price: ~$0.13Narrative: Cross-border payments + stablecoin velocity TRON has quietly become a global settlement layer for stablecoins, particularly in developing countries. With billions in USDT moving daily and integrations with real-world commerce, TRX is underrated in its utility and stability. Why it Could 1000x: If stablecoins power global commerce, TRON could be the rails behind it. 7. Pudgy Penguin Token (PENGU) – Meme Culture Meets Merchandise Price: ~$0.009Narrative: Meme + NFT brand + toy distribution Spun off from the wildly popular Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, PENGU is trying to capture the retail market via toys in Walmart and Amazon. It’s a rare case of meme coin economics merging with real-world IP. Why it Could 1000x: Toy-based NFT hype could fuel explosive speculative runs. 8. Cronos (CRO) – Centralized Exchange Token with Utility Price: ~$0.076Narrative: CEX utility token + Web3 gateway Backed by Crypto.com, CRO supports staking, trading discounts, and payments in its native ecosystem. With global sports sponsorships and one of the largest user bases in crypto, CRO has brand power and cash reserves. Why it Could 1000x: As new users flood into crypto, CRO could benefit from app-based onboarding. 9. Bonk (BONK) – Solana’s Doge Price: ~$0.000024Narrative: Meme coin + DeFi integration Bonk isn’t just a joke—it’s integrated across Solana’s DeFi ecosystem and enjoys meme status comparable to Doge and Shiba. With listings on major exchanges and NFT collabs, Bonk has real traction. Why it Could 1000x: If Solana meme season returns in full force. 10. Kaspa (KAS) – The Fastest Proof-of-Work Blockchain Price: ~$0.08Narrative: Scalable PoW + decentralization purity Kaspa uses the GhostDAG protocol to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues while retaining security. It can process multiple blocks per second without sacrificing decentralization. For those who believe in PoW but want speed, Kaspa is a perfect fit. Why it Could 1000x: If Layer 1 wars heat up again, Kaspa could emerge as a surprise winner. Final Thoughts: Risk and Reward These small-cap altcoins all share one trait: asymmetrical upside. Some deliver real-world utility, others thrive on community momentum and narrative speculation, and in crypto, both paths can lead to exponential returns. A 1000x surge doesn’t require certainty—it just needs a spark, a story, and the right moment. Among them, XYZ stands out as a high-risk, high-reward play. With its fusion of meme coin energy and plans for real-world asset verification and sportsbook rewards, it has the kind of viral appeal that can ignite speculative frenzies.

These coins represent not just opportunities for substantial financial gains but also innovative technological contributions in the blockchain space. The Landscape of Opportunity: What Makes These Altcoins Stand Out? Often overlooked, small-cap altcoins possess unique traits that could potentially fuel their exponential growth. These include strong technical foundations, vibrant communities, and niche market positioning that caters to specific tech advancements or cultural trends. Detailed Analysis of Promising Altcoins Here's an in-depth look at select altcoins, each poised for significant impact and huge potential returns: XYZ (XYZVerse): Merging Memes with Market Utility Currently priced below $0.01, XYZ, also known as XYZVerse, stands out due to its dual appeal in meme culture and practical utility in real-world asset verification and decentralized betting. Its presence has stirred noticeable excitement, leading to its recognition as the Best New Meme Project . Check out the detailed ambitions of XYZVerse at their official site, XYZVerse.io . The enthusiastic backing by an active community and the spearheading of innovative features for online entertainment and betting suggest XYZ could lead the pack in meme-based cryptocurrencies with substantial use cases. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Adoption at Its Core With an impressive support network that includes major corporations like IBM and Boeing, Hedera Hashgraph (priced at about $0.07) leverages its advanced hashgraph consensus to offer quick, secure transactions for enterprise applications. Its robust technology and growing adoption in sectors like finance and telecommunications provide a strong case for potential growth. AIOZ Network: Empowering the AI and CDN Spheres Priced around $0.55, AIOZ Network aims to revolutionize content delivery networks through decentralized services and AI enhancements. This altcoin could significantly benefit from the escalating demand for decentralized data solutions and content streaming services. Additional Noteworthy Altcoins Other cryptocurrencies such as Jupiter (JUP), Internet Computer (ICP), and TRON (TRX) also hold promising prospects. These platforms are developing foundational technology layers—from DeFi ecosystems to fully on-chain web applications—that could redefine their respective fields. Investing in Potential: A Balanced View While the allure of high returns is strong, prospective investors should approach these opportunities with a balanced perspective, understanding the risks involved. Each altcoin's success hinges on various factors including technological adoption, market sentiment, and ongoing development.

The best platforms combine smart token economics, privacy-first access, and fluid gameplay across casino and sportsbook ecosystems. This report highlights three standout GambleFi projects redefining the crypto betting landscape: Dexsport — The ultimate decentralized casino and sportsbook Rollblock — AI-powered gambling with predictive analytics WINR Protocol — Fully on-chain gaming with scalable DeFi incentives Dexsport — Decentralized Betting Built for Web3 KYC: Not requiredBonus Model: Up to 25% in freebets, weekly cashback, VIP tiers, thematic promotions Dexsport remains the gold standard for GambleFi in 2025. Offering over 10,000 games, a full-featured sportsbook, and instant wallet onboarding, it epitomizes frictionless, borderless betting. Players can connect via MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Telegram, or email—no documents or ID ever required. The sportsbook is built for depth and speed: Over 100 betting markets per event Streaming matches—even on zero balance Turbo Combo parlay boosters Dedicated coverage across football, UFC, CS2, Dota2, and Valorant Promotions include themed campaigns, freebet drops, and cashback up to 10% for VIP users. Dexsport's adds a layer of smart utility, giving holders priority access, bonus boosts, and governance participation. Why It Stands Out: Full decentralization across casino and sportsbook Anonymous access with wallet-only login Massive game volume from top studios On-chain bet tracking and provably fair mechanics Dexsport is more than a casino—it’s a next-gen betting platform where transparency, speed, and user sovereignty come first. Rollblock — AI Meets GambleFi for Smarter Risk and Rewards KYC: Not requiredBonus Model: 100% welcome bonus (up to 10 ETH), rakeback, VIP club rewards, liquidity farming Rollblock brings AI into the world of decentralized betting. Users benefit from predictive models, automated risk profiles, and smart staking protocols. Designed for pro-level bettors and liquidity providers, Rollblock is both intuitive and powerful. Key features include: Casino games, sports betting, and predictive analytics NFT-enhanced gaming profiles and achievement tiers Staking returns via $RBLK liquidity pools with up to 30% APY 100% matched deposit bonus and recurring rakeback payouts Affiliate program with flexible commission models Its GambleFi stack allows players to optimize risk-reward strategies while earning passive yield through gameplay. Rollblock’s machine learning layer adapts to user behavior, recommending odds, calculating exposure, and personalizing strategy suggestions. Why It Stands Out: Integration of AI for dynamic bet modeling NFT-based identity layers across gameplay High-yield liquidity pools for active and passive users Deep customization and user-level analytics No KYC, instant access, full anonymity Rollblock pushes GambleFi into the predictive era—where data, staking, and AI create a truly intelligent casino framework. WINR Protocol — On-Chain Casino with Scalable DeFi Infrastructure KYC: Not requiredBonus Model: Weekly and monthly rewards, referral incentives, staking boosts WINR Protocol powers a gasless, 100% on-chain casino suite built for speed, integrity, and scalability. Every game runs directly on smart contracts—making it trustless and provable by design. Its architecture suits developers, liquidity miners, and gaming ecosystems alike. What sets WINR apart: No centralized backend—full EVM deployment Game outcome resolution with zero external middleware Native staking pools for passive income Referral bonuses and weekly milestone rewards Customizable operator dashboards for white-label deployment The $WINR token plays multiple roles: staking, fee discounts, liquidity access, and voting rights for future upgrades. Its reward system creates recurring incentives for both players and builders, while liquidity depth supports scalable volumes. Why It Stands Out: Fully on-chain, no gas fees on gaming execution Open architecture and developer-friendly modules Diverse gaming suite: dice, slots, roulette, blackjack Strong staking economy and governance via $WINR Zero KYC access with verified smart contract fairness WINR Protocol is an infrastructure play as much as it is a casino—designed to scale gambling across decentralized applications with speed and integrity. Comparison Overview Project KYC Required Bonus System Distinction Dexsport No Freebets, cashback, $1,500 promo Web3 casino with sports betting Rollblock No 100% match, rakeback, liquidity AI analytics + NFT gamification WINR Protocol No Weekly rewards, staking bonuses Fully on-chain casino infrastructure Final Thoughts From Dexsport’s robust sportsbook to Rollblock’s intelligent gaming layer and WINR Protocol’s smart-contract backbone—2025’s top GambleFi platforms prove that crypto betting is evolving rapidly. These ecosystems deliver privacy, performance, and programmable rewards that traditional casinos can’t match. Whether you're a passive staker, a competitive gamer, or a privacy-first bettor—one of these platforms offers exactly the flexibility and functionality modern players demand.

Key Reasons Behind the Surge,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-story-ip-crypto-rising-today-key-reasons-behind-the-surge/,"The post Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story (IP) crypto has captured market attention with a sharp price surge, fueled by a breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase. The sudden momentum shift reflects growing market interest, supported by a rise in trading volume and strategic accumulation by larger holders. As Story escapes its previous range, traders are eyeing higher targets amid renewed optimism. This upward move highlights a technically driven rally, suggesting that the asset may be entering a new phase of bullish continuation in the near term. Before analyzing the future projections, let’s see why the Story (IP) price is rising. Bitcoin smashed a new ATH during the past trading day, which has filled the entire crypto market with bullish momentum. The Story price rose above the accumulation zone that it had been stuck at for over a month. Story experienced a massive influx of liquidity of over $148 million, as per some reports, which is speculated to be huge whale activity. A breakout from a technical pattern where the IP price remained accumulated for a long time Despite the current breakout, the IP price failed to secure above a crucial resistance range. Does this suggest the Bulls’ strength was limited, and will this drag the IP price below $4? The latest price breakout led the IP price breakout from the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone between $4.97 and $5.15. However, this cannot be considered a rejection, as the technicians remain within the bullish frame. The price has surpassed the Gaussian channel, which was bearish and hence a daily close above the range may flip the indicator to bullish. On the other hand, the RSI failed to enter the overbought zone but remains stuck along the upper threshold. The overall sentiment is currently very bullish, wherein the on-chain indicators and technical analysis suggest it has outperformed many altcoins recently. On the other hand, rising whale activity and large trade volumes point to accumulation by major holders. Meanwhile, the volatility remains high, as a rapid squeeze up can be followed by a sharp pullback or correction. Besides, some models expect a decline towards $3.6 by mid-August if buying momentum waves. Wrapping it Up!! Story (IP) is rallying today due to a combination of a broader crypto rally led by Bitcoin and very high trading volume, including potential whale activity and technical breakout patterns. That said, some technical forecasts warn of possible short-term retracements before further upside. For now, the Story (IP) price is maintaining a strong ascending trend with strong bullish momentum and hence is above $5 and will eventually reach $5.5 in the near term.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 06:12:48

Ethereum’s once-reliable climb has flattened, and a new batch of meme coin favorites is picking up the slack. The name traders keep repeating in chat rooms and threads is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged, zero-tax coin that seems to fit 2025’s appetite for narrative and utility in equal measure. Inside MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Traders Are Talking MAGACOIN holders have similar reasons for what has attracted them to the project. Its tax-free transfer ensures gains aren’t nibbled away by a fee each time tokens move wallets, and a security stamp from clearing a HashEx audit already puts it ahead of several meme plays. The project also boasts a straightforward governance model as there are no venture-capital allocations, and every big decision heads to a community vote. Wrapping its tokenomics in a tongue-in-cheek political theme ensures a strong narrative that can keep memes flowing and holders engaged long after the initial pump fades. Numbers back the buzz. Early funding rounds pulled in more than ten million dollars, and on-chain data shows steady wallet growth as word spreads in Telegram channels. Supply is capped at 170 billion tokens, a decision to avoid the endless float that weighs on older meme giants. These features have analysts calling the project a “hybrid narrative token,” one with real mechanics beneath the memes. Ethereum Hits the Brakes Ethereum is still the backbone of decentralized finance, yet its price chart tells a quieter story this year. It sits roughly a quarter below its spring peak, held back by declining activity, and other Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks offer more efficient transaction layers. Even the long-awaited ETF approvals failed to light the usual fire under the market. The lull hasn’t dented Ethereum’s long-term thesis, but it leaves momentum-hungry traders searching elsewhere in the short term. Meme Tokens Find Their Spark Whenever Bitcoin inches toward fresh highs—as it has lately—speculative capital trickles down the ladder, and meme coins often catch the overflow. Dogecoin has posted solid weekly jumps, Shiba Inu isn’t far behind, and newcomers like FARTCOIN and PENGU are making headlines. Yet many of these rallies still hinge on nostalgia or sheer volatility. MAGACOIN offers an extra layer with a story that taps into political theater while keeping token holders in charge of the script. That blend of culture and control draws a crowd that once would have parked money solely in Ethereum or XRP. Final Thoughts Markets thrive on rotation. As Ethereum pauses to catch its breath and meme coins ride a fresh gust of speculative wind, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks well placed to benefit. Its fee-free design, audited code, and community-owned roadmap give it substance, while the political-meme angle supplies the spark. Whether it becomes 2025’s defining breakout remains to be seen, but the ingredients—clear narrative, active holders, and real utility—are already in the pot.

Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin bounced by 9.66%, regaining trader interest, while Shiba Inu rose 6.53%, signaling renewed community excitement. These moves have reignited debates over which meme coins still have room to grow, and which are already past their peak. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ride short-term waves, Troller Cat is building long-term momentum. Now in Stage 12 of its presale, it combines meme energy with robust tokenomics, offering staking at a 69% APY, and features a transparent, deflationary model. The project has already delivered an ROI of over 1193.2%, and the subsequent price increase is on the horizon. With 14 presale stages still left, staking live, and a 721.06% upside to the projected listing price, Troller Cat positions itself as the best meme coin to buy today, not just for laughs, but for real returns. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Structured Chaos Built for ROI Stage 12 of the Troller Cat presale draws inspiration from Horse_ebooks, a viral Twitter bot that became a cult internet icon through nonsensical but oddly profound tweets. This thematic layer underscores Troller Cat’s broader approach, embracing absurdity as a means to capture attention, drive virality, and ultimately, generate demand. With memes as the engine and smart tokenomics as the structure, this phase is more than just storytelling; it’s a calculated step in the project’s growth. The current price of $TCAT in Stage 12 is $0.00006466. Having launched at just $0.00000500, the token has already increased in value by over 1193.2%. Over 1,300 holders have joined the presale so far, raising more than $325,000. With a projected listing price of $0.0005309, a buyer entering now could realize a return of 721.06%, excluding staking and referral earnings. The next stage will raise the price by another 30%, making this a time-sensitive entry point. Liquidity will be locked for 2 years following the token launch, and the team provides full transparency on all presale data, including wallet counts, totals raised, and more. In addition, the platform’s ad-driven buyback-and-burn model promises sustained deflation, turning platform usage into direct upward pressure on token value. Referral Program: Built for Viral Growth Troller Cat’s referral program is crafted to reward word-of-mouth engagement. Anyone can generate a unique referral link or code and share it with others. When a new participant joins the presale using that referral, the original user receives bonus tokens instantly, no forms or delays required. The system offers a 10% referral bonus, which is unlocked once the referred user spends at least $25 in the presale. This ensures genuine user acquisition and filters out spam or fake referrals. Rewards are obvious through a real-time dashboard, making it easy to track earnings, invites, and conversions. This system empowers community members to become active promoters, transforming every user into a stakeholder in the project’s expansion. A $15,000 investment in $TCAT at $0.00006466 could grow to over $123,000 if it hits its $0.0005309 listing price, excluding staking and referral rewards. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Classic Meme Strength, Short-Term Rally Dogecoin surged 9.66% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.1983, marking a strong recovery from recent lows. Volume increased across major exchanges, and sentiment-driven buyers returned to chase the move. Analysts point to the $0.20 level as a psychological barrier that could unlock further upside if broken. Technically, Dogecoin has found support around $0.18, with several indicators flashing bullish momentum. However, its movement remains heavily tied to market sentiment, social trends, and public endorsements, rather than utility upgrades or protocol development. Despite being the meme coin OG, Dogecoin lacks staking features or a token-burning system. For holders seeking passive yield or structured tokenomics, Dogecoin offers entertainment, but little in terms of on-chain earning mechanics. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Ecosystem Buzz Lifts Short-Term Sentiment Shiba Inu climbed 6.53% in the last 24 hours to $0.00001332, rebounding off strong support at $0.00001250. Resistance now sits at $0.00001400, and if broken, could spark a push back toward previous highs. Technical analysts are watching volume patterns closely as the token attempts to regain bullish ground. The bounce coincided with community chatter around new Layer 2 integrations and NFT ecosystem updates. These ecosystem developments have reignited interest among long-term supporters and traders alike. However, Shiba Inu still lacks native staking or referral utility. While its roadmap shows ambition, SHIB currently relies on speculative narratives and ecosystem growth rather than structured financial incentives for holders. This leaves investors without yield or burn-driven token support in the near term. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat is the best meme coin to buy today. It offers massive early ROI, 721.06% upside potential from Stage 12, a 69% APY staking rate, and referral rewards, all within a transparent and secure presale ecosystem. Add to that its deflationary design and 2-year liquidity lock, and Troller Cat emerges as the most balanced meme investment currently available. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both posted gains in the last 24 hours, but neither offers the structured staking, entry-level upside, or referral incentives that Troller Cat brings to the market. To maximize your early-stage crypto potential, join the Troller Cat presale now, use a referral code to boost your token total, and secure your share before Stage 13 begins with a 30% price increase.

Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/bitcoin-solaris-offers-liquid-alternative-with-confirmed-lbank-exchange-listing/,"The post Can I Sell My BlockDAG? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet question has been circulating across Telegram and X: “When can I sell my BlockDAG?” For early supporters, the wait continues as listing timelines remain unclear and secondary liquidity hasn’t fully materialized. While the project still holds promise, some investors are beginning to wonder when theory will turn into traction. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is already showing signs of momentum. With visible liquidity, transparent updates, and a focus on accessibility and performance, it’s capturing the attention of those seeking both innovation and immediate value. BlockDAG: Good Concept, Bad Timing? To be clear, BlockDAG is far from a scam. Its directed acyclic graph architecture has genuine technical merit. The promise of scalable parallel transactions has been around for years, and if implemented correctly, it could work beautifully. But the delays are beginning to overshadow the promise. Many are finding themselves stuck, unable to cash out or even transfer tokens. And in a market where speed equals confidence, stalling is fatal. Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank and Unlocks Access On the flip side, Bitcoin Solaris is making moves fast. It has already secured a confirmed listing on LBank, which offers immediate peace of mind to investors who want real liquidity from day one. This isn’t speculative. It’s live. Listings like this mean more than just hype. They open the door to: Centralized trading pairs Broader market visibility Price discovery from launch day Safer, smoother user onboarding That kind of infrastructure doesn’t just support users. It empowers them. Why Everyone’s Watching BTC-S Now One of the best breakdowns recently came from Crypto Vlog , which highlighted the project’s upcoming features and why the LBank listing is already positioning BTC-S as a more “sellable” and usable coin than competitors still figuring out their next testnet. It’s not just influencers. Over 14,150 investors have already joined the Bitcoin Solaris presale. That’s a level of traction that demands attention. The Presale That’s Actually Delivering We are in Phase 11 of the BTC-S presale , and it’s racing toward one of the fastest closes in recent memory: Current Price: $11 Launch Price: $20 Potential Gain: 150% More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris has just introduced a Price Rollback, a temporary drop to $5 for a limited time. This isn’t a gimmick or a bonus. It’s a rare opportunity to enter at early-bird prices right before launch. And just to keep it smooth: wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens post-launch. No need to connect or transact through them during the presale. Deep Tech, Real Use So what makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just a name? Dual-consensus model (PoW + DPoS) balances security with lightning-fast performance Up to 10,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer Validator rotation improves decentralization and reduces attack vectors Smart contract execution via Rust for enterprise and DeFi scalability Built-in interoperability for cross-chain assets Mobile-first mining through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App Energy-efficient framework that uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin You can even calculate projected mining yield with their live calculator . It’s the kind of transparency and access that BlockDAG holders are still waiting on. Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense BTC-S isn’t just about the now; it’s designed for decades of sustainable use: 66.66% for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for development (including Helios DeFi layer) 2% for community rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This model ensures that 98% of tokens flow to users, miners, and the ecosystem, with zero central hoarding. The Better Exit Plan Can you sell your BlockDAG? Possibly. The potential is there, but timelines remain fluid and clarity is still developing. That’s not unusual for emerging tech, and many still believe in its long-term vision. At the same time, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is moving at a different pace. Exchange listings are already secured, transactions are flowing, and its dual-layer architecture is live and gaining traction. It’s a contrast in timing. While some projects are still preparing, BTC-S is already putting plans into action.

In tech, abstraction has long been synonymous with progress. We moved from physical servers to the cloud. From local files to APIs. From self-hosting to “serverless.” Infrastructure became invisible—outsourced, simplified, and abstracted into someone else’s computer. And for a time, it worked. The cloud brought speed, scale, and convenience to millions of developers and enterprises. But that abstraction came with a cost: control. You might also like: Big Tech is too big to win the AI future | Opinion Today, we’re seeing the limits of that trade-off. The AI boom demands compute that’s distributed, fast, and privacy-aware. IoT devices are generating localized data at an unprecedented scale. And the centralized cloud—once a solution—is showing its cracks: opaque billing, rising costs, latency issues, and growing concentration risk. The truth is, the cloud was never built for this moment. That’s why the next evolution of infrastructure is clear: edge-first, user-owned, and crypto-incentivized. In short, it’s decentralized physical infrastructure networks , or DePIN. Having spent the last few years building infrastructure in web3, I’ve seen this shift firsthand. The networks that endure aren’t the ones where users simply consume, they’re the ones where users participate, where infrastructure isn’t controlled by a single provider, but powered by collectives of contributors. Where performance, uptime, and real-world utility are rewarded, not with equity or empty dashboards, but with tokens that reflect actual impact. That’s what DePIN gets right. It aligns incentives at the protocol layer. It transforms infrastructure from a service into a shared, value-generating network. And it puts ownership and opportunity back in the hands of the participants. The cloud wasn’t built for the edge era Every time a GPU shortage hits or an LLM API throttles access, it’s a reminder that compute and, by extension, bandwidth, storage, and sensor data, aren’t infinite, especially when controlled by a few hyperscalers. Meanwhile, countless edge resources from smartphones and routers to IoT sensors and idle gaming rigs sit untapped while cloud providers rake in profits. Yet most applications don’t need hyperscale; they need proximity. Think real-time inference on a factory floor, local video processing on your router, or sensor data triggering immediate decisions without traversing continents. DePIN thrives here: it relocates compute, storage, and bandwidth to the point of origin, eliminating central bottlenecks and middlemen. This isn’t speculation. According to Gartner, over 50% of enterprise-managed data will be created and processed outside traditional data centers or clouds by 2025. That means the shift toward edge-native infrastructure isn’t just emerging—it’s accelerating. DePIN meets this moment by unlocking distributed compute power at the edge, converting idle devices into reliable infrastructure—all while ensuring performance, cost-efficiency, and resilience. Participation is the new protocol primitive In the late 1990s, projects like SETI@Home allowed individuals to donate their idle computing power to help analyze radio signals from space in the search for extraterrestrial life. In the 2000s, Folding@Home followed a similar model, crowdsourcing compute to simulate protein folding for medical research. These early initiatives proved that distributed infrastructure at a global scale was possible. But they ran on goodwill, and goodwill doesn’t scale. What they lacked was economic alignment. There were no real incentives for participants beyond altruism. That’s the gap DePIN fills by introducing tokenized, programmable rewards into the model. In DePIN networks, contributions are compensated. Share bandwidth? You get paid. Deploy a GPU? You earn tokens. Host data reliably? You’re part of the infrastructure and rewarded for it. These aren’t gamified points on a leaderboard. They’re real assets, with tangible value and liquidity. And when networks are designed to reward real-world contributions, they don’t need VC-funded hype or ad campaigns to grow. They scale organically through utility, word of mouth, and contributors with skin in the game. This isn’t just distributed infrastructure. It’s sound economics in action. The infrastructure revolution is underway When I started in decentralized computing, I wasn’t thinking about DePIN. My goal was to make the node infrastructure scalable and usable. But over time, I saw a pattern: the most engaged operators weren’t cloud-first—they were edge-native. They ran nodes on rigs they built. They wanted transparency, ownership, and performance. And they cared less about dashboards and more about sovereignty. That mindset led me to believe that the way forward was to double down on decentralized orchestration. Because if you can distribute nodes, you can distribute anything. And that’s what the best DePIN projects are doing—breaking up monoliths and turning the internet into a mesh. We often talk about DePIN in terms of scale and cost-efficiency. And while those matter, there’s a deeper layer we can’t ignore: privacy. In a digital world where every API call is tracked, every dataset harvested, and every action logged, the ability to own your infrastructure becomes existential. Edge-first, user-owned networks mean your data doesn’t have to leave your device. It’s processed locally, stored selectively, and shared deliberately. Look, clouds aren’t going away. It’ll remain critical for coordination and bulk processing. But the future won’t be cloud-only. It will be cloud and edge. Platforms and protocols. Providers and participants. And DePIN will be the connective tissue that makes that vision work, at scale, sustainably, and with aligned incentives. The next generation of infrastructure won’t be built in server farms. It’ll be built by people. One node at a time.

NEAR Protocol historic price sentiment NEAR price history The Near Protocol (NEAR) began its journey in August 2020, aiming to create a scalable and permissionless blockchain. The first recorded trade value in October 2020 was $1.072, closing the year at $1.459 after a recovery. In 2021, NEAR showed an uptrend, starting at $1.305 and reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $7.572 by March 13. A market downturn pushed the price down to $1.537 by July 19, but it rebounded to $11.776 on September 9 and further to $13.168 on October 26. By 2022, NEAR’s price crashed to below $2.00, losing over 90% of its peak value. Throughout 2023, NEAR saw low volatility, with prices remaining below $2.50 for most of the year. Since the start of 2024, NEAR has experienced a strong recovery, climbing to $7.80. However, after reaching the $8.00 mark in mid-May, it fell back to $5.60. In June, NEAR traded between $4.48 and $7.66. It rose from $5.20 to $6.04 in July but closed the month below $5.00. NEAR started August at $5.00, declining to $3.89 by the end of the month. In September 2024, the asset bounced back and closed the month above the $5.20 mark. In October, the price stumbled and fell to $4.850 in the first few days before closing the month below the $4.00 mark leaving a negative outlook at the start of November. November saw NEAR making remarkable strides as the bulls held strong control of markets during the month, a trend that was expected to continue into December. However, the month saw NEAR plummet from heights of $7.00 to fall below $5 before closing the month. In January the price could not find a stable foothold and the price continued dwindling, closing the month just above $4.00 In February the price fell significantly towards the $3.00 mark and continued to decline ending the month at $2.80. In March the price continued to decline ending the month near $2.50, a trend that continued in April ending the month at $2.35. In May the price recovered but only to the extent of reversing April’s losses as the month ended below $2.50. June saw further decay as despite the early bullish signals, bears dominated the month and NEAR closed the month around $2.12.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|NEAR|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-12 06:45:00

Is This the End of Bitcoin Dominance?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/07/bitcoin-dumped-for-ethereum-bit-digital-bets-172m-on-eth-is-this-the-end-of-bitcoin-dominance,"A major shift in the crypto world has occurred. Bit Digital has made a massive $172 million move, favoring Ethereum over Bitcoin. This bold bet raises questions about the future of Bitcoin's leading position. What does this mean for the supremacy of cryptocurrencies? Could this signal a new era for other digital coins? The answers may surprise. Analysis powered by Outset PR , a blockchain PR agency that leverages data, trends, and market timing to empower Web3 leaders to maximize every opportunity. Bitcoin Price Flirts with New Highs: Bullish Momentum Builds Source: tradingview Bitcoin is showing strong movement, with prices hovering slightly above $107,000 to $111,000. It is just under a key resistance point at nearly $114,000. If Bitcoin breaks past this, it could aim for around $119,000, a potential jump of about 7%. With a six-month growth of almost 19%, Bitcoin’s upward momentum appears solid. Indicators like the RSI suggest high interest from buyers. The current pattern suggests further gains if Bitcoin maintains its pace and crosses resistance levels. Enthusiasts are hopeful even as cautious optimism prevails, as Bitcoin continues its climb, setting sights on breaking new records. Ethereum Surges: Can ETH Break Past $3000 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently sits between $2420 and $2679, showing a positive trend with a 9.10% increase over the past week. Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range. With the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down.

Claver emphasized that “XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point.” This framing highlights a design where XRP acts as a unified bridge asset rather than a token tied to individual trading pairs. XRP doesn’t compete in many currency pair battles. Instead, it pools all liquidity into one central point. This makes XRP much more powerful than any single direct connection. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) July 10, 2025 Claver’s comment draws attention to XRP’s structural advantage in liquidity sourcing. Meanwhile, Ripple CTO, David Schwartz, had detailed how the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) auto‑bridge feature ensures XRP acts as a central intermediary , optimizing transactions between tokens and reinforcing its liquidity role on the ledger. This mechanism supports growing volumes of tokenized assets, translating into higher XRP usage for both fees and liquidity provision. XRP’s Growing Adoption and Infrastructure Over the longer horizon, the structural liquidity model Claver describes supports broader industry trends. Ripple has seen rapid adoption of its XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product and a notable increase in partnerships, currently working with hundreds of financial institutions. The ODL system uses XRP to settle cross‑border transfers without requiring banks to maintain pre-funded accounts, and this innovation reduces cost and latency in global payments, making XRP a preferred option for cross-border payments. Additionally, XRP’s role is not sidelined by new stablecoin products like RLUSD. While one commenter expressed this concern, Schwartz has previously clarified that RLUSD enhances XRP’s function by introducing alternative settlement paths without reducing XRP’s bridging utility. Higher volumes of tokenized assets on XRPL also help the ecosystem, as it leads to escalating demand for XRP for transaction fees and liquidity. This dynamic affirms XRP as integral to the ledger’s long-term economic model. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 As XRPL’s decentralized exchange (DEX), automated market maker (AMM), and other features gain traction, the digital asset’s central role in enabling liquidity becomes more pronounced. Reactions Reflect Widespread Confidence Multiple community members responded enthusiastically to Claver’s post. Many echoed his assessment by highlighting XRP’s real‑world utility, contrasting it with assets that lack tangible use cases. One commenter shared excitement about XRP’s potential to outperform Bitcoin in practical applications, and another suggested that the asset could reach triple-digit targets by the end of the year. Others reaffirmed that Claver’s liquidity framing is consistent with XRP’s design and mission. XRP enjoys structural strengths often overlooked in speculative discourse, and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has reaffirmed the importance of liquidity, predicting that it could capture 14% of SWIFT’s volume within 5 years by prioritizing liquidity provisioning.

Trading volumes surged past 1.1B during the 13:00–15:00 session, establishing resistance between $0.208–$0.213. Support held at $0.200–$0.201 through late-session volatility, with final hour price action stabilizing around $0.202. Analysts flagged the rejection at $0.211 (20:00) as evidence of systematic profit-taking by larger holders. News Background: BTC Record, Risk-On Flows Drive Meme Coin Rally Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $118,000 during the session, as crypto markets benefited from a surge in institutional inflows — estimated at $50B this week alone. Easing geopolitical tensions, improving trade relations, and dovish signals from central banks have boosted risk assets across the board. Dogecoin, typically a high-beta play during crypto rallies, surged alongside altcoins in response. Price Action Summary Range: $0.198 → $0.213 → $0.202 | Total swing: 8.6% Breakout Zone: $0.200–$0.208 cleared on strong volume Resistance: $0.208–$0.213, with reversal from $0.211 Support: $0.200–$0.201 tested and held multiple times Final Hour (04:55–05:54): Price rose from $0.200 → $0.202 (+0.5%) Volume Peak: 1.1B between 13:00–15:00; 19M during 05:00–05:10 late surge Technical Analysis Mid-session momentum broke above key resistance zones but failed to sustain above $0.213 Volume-backed reversal near session high suggests strategic exits by institutions Final-hour recovery shows $0.200 remains psychologically significant Momentum cooling; near-term consolidation expected in $0.200–$0.204 band What Traders Are Watching Can DOGE reclaim and hold above $0.208–$0.210 to retest highs? Breakdown below $0.198–$0.200 would signal trend exhaustion Consolidation above $0.202 would support a bullish continuation setup into next week Broader BTC and macro risk sentiment will continue to dictate altcoin flows Takeaway DOGE followed broader crypto markets higher with a clean intraday breakout — but its rejection at $0.213 and sharp pullback highlight the fragile nature of meme coin rallies during high volatility sessions. Institutional flows remain, but traders should watch for volume confirmation before chasing upside. $0.200 is now the line in the sand.

After holding the 100 BTC bar for over a decade, he finally cracked it open, only to lose $40K in Bitcoin Cash within minutes due to a leaked private key. Here’s what happened behind this rare piece of Bitcoin history. 100 BTC Bar Becomes a Jackpot Back in 2012, when Bitcoin was still a niche idea traded mostly among tech enthusiasts, JohnGalt got his hands on a Casascius gold bar loaded with 100 BTC. At the time, Bitcoin’s price hovered around $5, so he paid about $500 for it worth almost nothing to most people back then. But for JohnGalt, it felt special to hold Bitcoin in physical form. Over the years, he admitted he was tempted many times to sell it. He even tried to auction it a few times but found it hard to part with something so unique. The problem? Not many people trusted buying a physical Bitcoin bar for millions when you could just buy Bitcoin directly. $10 Million BTC Bar Fast forward to now, Bitcoin has smashed through $118,000 , turning JohnGalt’s 100 BTC into about $10 million. He explained that holding something worth eight figures felt too risky, so he finally decided to crack open the bar and claim his coins. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Says, “I Bought Bitcoin at $110K, I Will Buy More on SALE.” , So, he made the tough call: break open the bar, reveal the private key, and move those 100 BTC into his wallet. That simple action turned a collector’s item back into pure Bitcoin, instantly worth about $10 million. Exposed Private Key Costs Him $40K But there was a twist. Because Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash share the same private key system, someone with sharp eyes spotted JohnGalt’s partially exposed private key in a photo he posted online. Within nine minutes, they used it to drain about $40,000 worth of Bitcoin Cash before JohnGalt could claim it himself. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

John Marshall, Goldman’s head of derivatives research, says in a new interview with CNBC that the brokerages Interactive Brokers (IBKR) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are benefiting from a surge in retail trading activity, which could boost their stock prices. “The retail activity – while they may not have been buying intensely over the last couple of months, they’ve been very active, and that should be a tailwind for both of them.” Marshall also says Goldman believes the equipment and machinery giant John Deere (DE) could benefit from the agricultural cycle, which the firm believes is at a cyclical bottom. Goldman Sachs’ other tactical trades related to Q2 earnings reports include the cloud-based data storage firm Snowflake (SNOW), the aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corporation (AL), the restaurant franchise giant YUM! (YUM) and the global branded food company Hormel Foods (HRL). In terms of stocks that could slide in price due to earnings reports, Marshall mentions the furniture giant Restoration Hardware (RH). “While they don’t report until September, that’s a name which has tough compares.” Other stocks that Goldman thinks could have potential downside include the airline giant Southwest (LUV) and the Boston Beer Company (SAM).

Three digital currencies—TRX, HYPE, and XYZVerse—are vying for that potential. Which one could multiply a $1,000 investment into $1,000,000 in the next decade? This exploration delves into their prospects to identify the contender with the greatest growth potential. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity TRON (TRX): Empowering Creators in the Decentralized Internet TRON, known by its token TRX, is a platform that aims to change how we share and consume content online. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it gives full ownership rights back to digital content makers. Instead of big companies like YouTube or Facebook taking a large cut, TRON allows creators to be rewarded directly by their audience. This means artists, writers, and video makers can earn more from their work. TRON's technology supports smart contracts and lets developers build decentralized apps, also known as dApps. This makes it similar to platforms like Ethereum but with some key differences. TRON aims to build a decentralized internet where transactions are transparent and fees are low. In the current market, where decentralization and direct engagement are growing trends, TRX offers a unique approach by focusing on empowering creators and cutting out middlemen. While other coins focus on finance or contracts, TRON’s mission to reshape content sharing gives it potential in the evolving digital landscape. Hyperliquid: The High-Speed Blockchain Transforming DeFi Hyperliquid is making a bold entry into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). It's a new blockchain platform built specifically for speed and efficiency. Unlike others, Hyperliquid has its own Layer 1 blockchain designed from scratch. It uses a special system called HyperBFT to confirm transactions quickly and keep them secure. This means users can enjoy fast and reliable services without the usual delays. One of the standout features of Hyperliquid is its focus on perpetual futures trading. It allows users to trade these financial products directly on its blockchain without any gas fees. This makes trading cheaper and more accessible. Plus, Hyperliquid uses a fully on-chain order book, which adds transparency since all trades are visible on the blockchain. With a team of experts from top universities and tech companies, Hyperliquid brings fresh ideas to the DeFi space. As the market evolves, platforms like Hyperliquid that offer speed and low costs could become important players to watch. Conclusion Despite TRX and HYPE showing potential, XYZVerse's unique sports-meme blend and ambitious growth strategy position it as the standout for massive returns by 2035.

The ETFs tracking the performance of the two largest digital assets recorded a highly impressive five-day trading period, attracting billions of dollars in total. In the meantime, the prices of both skyrocketed to a multi-month and an all-time high. Bitcoin ETFs See Over $2.5B in Net Inflows Let’s begin with the most impressive numbers, which came in the last two trading days of the week. Data from FarSide shows that Thursday saw the biggest new inflow day since early November and the second-largest in the 18-month history of the funds. $1,175.6 billion went into the financial vehicles, which were distributed somewhat evenly between three of the biggest – $448.5 million into BlackRock’s IBIT, $324.3 million into Fidelity’s FBTC, and $268.7 million into Ark Invest’s ARKB. Friday was almost as impressive, with $1,029.6 billion entering the funds. This time, though, IBIT dwarfed its competition, attracting $953.5 million. ARKB, which was second, was far, far behind, with a modest $23.5 million in net inflows. Adding the $215.7 million witnessed on Wednesday, $80.1 million on Tuesday, and $216.5 million on Monday, the total for the week stands at $2,717.5 billion. Somewhat expected, these mindblowing numbers affected the underlying asset’s price, which surged by over $10,000 to a new all-time high of almost $119,000 on Friday. What’s perhaps even more impressive is that all Bitcoin ETFs have seen only one negative day (July 1) since June 9. ETH ETFs Impress, Too The spot Ethereum ETFs , which are close to celebrating their first year in existence, have also become a lot more favorable among investors in the past few months. Moreover, they set a record in terms of daily inflows on Thursday, as reported , when $383.1 million entered the funds. Friday and Wednesday were also impressive in this regard, albeit in a more modest manner, with $204.9 million and $211.3 million going into the financial vehicles, respectively. On Monday and Tuesday, investors allocated $62.1 million and $46.7 million into the ETFs, bringing the total for the week to $908.1 million, according to data from FarSide. BlackRock’s ETHA has dominated the landscape once again, gaining over $300 million out of the $383.1 million on Thursday and $137.1 million out of the $204.9 million on Friday. ETH’s price has also benefited from the substantial interest in the Ethereum ETFs, shooting up this week from $2,500 on Wednesday to a multi-month high of its own at $3,040 on Friday. It has retraced slightly to just under $3,000 now, but it’s still up by over 17% on a weekly scale. In total, the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs attracted more than $3.6 billion in one week alone.

Meet the Meme Coin Experts Say Could 65× PEPE’s 2025 Gains,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/pepe-shib-favourites-meet-the-meme-coin-experts-say-could-65-pepes-2025-gains,"PEPE and SHIB have been favorites among meme coin fans, but there's a new player on the horizon. Experts suggest this fresh contender could surpass PEPE's projected 2025 gains by an astonishing 65 times. This coin is generating buzz and curiosity. What sets it apart, and could it redefine the meme coin landscape? Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges PEPE: The Meme Coin Taking the Crypto World by Storm PEPE is a new cryptocurrency inspired by the famous Pepe the Frog meme. Launched on Ethereum, it's a deflationary memecoin that has captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts. PEPE aims to follow in the footsteps of other successful meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and no pretense about its utility, it keeps things pure and simple. It's all about embracing meme culture and having fun in the crypto space. In late April to May 2023, PEPE's value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around the coin. This surge kicked off a ""memecoin season,"" with many new meme-based cryptocurrencies popping up. PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover,"" hinting at big plans ahead. In the current market, PEPE stands out as an intriguing player. It taps into the power of memes and community spirit. While the future is uncertain, many are keeping a close eye on PEPE, wondering if it will reach new heights in the next big crypto cycle. Shiba Inu Coin: The Dogecoin Rival Making Waves on Ethereum Shiba Inu (SHIB) began as a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin, but it's forging its own path. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This lets it tap into Ethereum's vast network of apps and tools. With an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB grabbed attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ""burned"" 40% of the total supply. These moves boosted SHIB's profile and showed commitment to the community. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB is building real-world uses. It's developing ShibaSwap, a trading platform without middlemen. Plans include an NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on decisions. In the current market, SHIB's link to Ethereum could give it an edge. While meme coins often fade, SHIB's focus on useful features might help it stand out. As the crypto market changes, SHIB could become more than a meme—it might turn into a serious player. Conclusion While PEPE and SHIB have shown impressive gains, experts highlight XYZVerse (XYZ) as a memecoin poised to surpass them, uniting sports fans for significant growth.

48090521,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74129,1752304385,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Options Open Interest Reaches Peak Point. Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-options-open-interest-reaches-peak-point-heres-the-significance/,"XRP’s derivatives market is seeing a sharp rise in activity as open interest in options climbs toward $100 million. A recent CoinDesk post highlighted the development, noting that total notional open interest on Deribit reached $97.97 million on July 8. This is the highest level in over a year and just shy of the June 2024 record of $102.3 million. The increase represents a 38% jump in two weeks, driven largely by traders seeking to benefit from short-term price fluctuations. Contract volumes have also expanded, climbing 26% to 42,414 contracts according to data from Deribit Metrics. Each contract on Deribit represents 1,000 XRP, further underlining the scale of activity in recent weeks. MARKET: Open Interest in XRP options nears $100M. XRP options open interest has surged to nearly $98M million, the highest since August 2023. Traders are piling in as volatility spikes, with yields on short-term contracts drawing in speculators and yield hunters. pic.twitter.com/zoBKIHbWqr — CoinDesk (@CoinDesk) July 10, 2025 Implied Volatility Outpaces Major Tokens XRP derivatives have seen a big jump in 2025. A key factor behind the surge is XRP’s elevated implied volatility. According to Coindesk’s report , Lin Chen, Deribit’s head of Asia business development, noted that XRP’s implied volatility has surpassed BTC, ETH, and SOL. He also pointed out the token’s annual return of more than 300% as a reason for its growing appeal among options traders. High volatility raises options premiums, attracting traders who sell cash-secured puts while holding stablecoins to cover potential XRP purchases. Additionally, technical signals reinforce this sentiment, as XRP has just delivered a major technical signal by closing above its 20‑week moving average . Market Sentiment Leans Bullish Coindesk referenced data from Amberdata showing that XRP’s 25-delta risk reversals are positive across multiple expiries, reflecting bullish sentiment. Currently, over 30 million call options are open compared to 11.92 million puts, resulting in a put-call ratio of 0.39. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This skew toward call options suggests that traders expect further upward movement in XRP’s price or are hedging against potential rallies. The preference for bullish positioning has been consistent across both short-term contracts and those expiring in August and September. Momentum Builds Amid Speculative Interest The growing interest in XRP options reflects a broader trend of speculative activity in the crypto derivatives market. As traders respond to volatility, open interest levels are approaching their previous highs. Broader market narratives support this bullish momentum, as a recent Times Tabloid report outlined a historic lineup of bullish developments for XRP in 2025 , including moves by Ripple on blockchain and regulatory fronts. For now, XRP remains one of the most active tokens in options markets, with heightened volatility and the anticipation of a breakout continuing to drive investor participation. The coming weeks could see further increases in open interest as traders seek to capitalize on rapid price movements and elevated premiums.

As the market grows, certain coins could see significant gains. SUI, AVAX, FET, and ONDO are among the notable contenders. Meanwhile, an intriguing project called Codename:Pepe crypto is making waves. It's designed to cut through the noise of fake AI agents. With community backing and cutting-edge tech, it aims to bring about substantial rewards for its supporters. Codename:Pepe (AGNT) Gains Traction After Listing and Supply Burn, Eyes $2.1 Milestone Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) has recently made its entrance on Uniswap, opening the floodgates for global trading — and it didn’t come quietly. In a dramatic power move, Codename:Pepe has burned a significant portion of the tokens to tighten the supply and send a clear message: this project plays to win. $AGNT token burns mean reducing the supply and boosting scarcity, which may fuel a price surge. Source: Codename:Pepe X account If you missed the chance to grab $AGNT at a fraction of a cent during the presale, don’t worry — there’s still time to get in at a bargain price before it targets its next milestone: $2. The team is rallying the community to drive momentum and push the price higher, aligning everyone around a shared goal — collective growth through smart, unified action. Source: Codename:Pepe Telegram account The AGNT Outlook: Bullish with AI Fuel Analysts are paying attention — and some are projecting a 30,000% gain before the end of 2025. Here’s why: AI-Driven Strategy: AGENT A.I. will scan social media and blockchain data to detect trending meme coins before they explode. Automated Trading: The AI engine will be able to execute real-time trades, turning noise into signals and volatility into opportunity. DAO Utility: Token holders will gain exclusive access to insider analytics and community voting through the AGNT DAO. Momentum is building: the presale sold out early. Now with liquidity, community energy, and a shrinking supply, AGNT is poised to move. Codename:Pepe fuses cutting-edge AI with meme market psychology, and it’s already showing signs of breakout potential. With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance. Price Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now SUI's Soaring Success: A 2025 Outlook on the Rising Crypto Star SUI, the token of the Sui blockchain, has captured attention with its impressive rise since 2023. Surpassing $1 in early 2024, it hit $2.18 by March. After a dip, it rebounded to $2.36 in October and soared to a record $5.35 by the year's end, driven by a surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) exceeding $2 billion. Behind SUI's rise is the innovative technology of the Sui platform. Founded by former Meta developers, Sui aims to enhance blockchain speed and efficiency, addressing limitations of platforms like Ethereum. By using horizontal scaling and storing assets directly on-chain, Sui offers faster and cheaper transactions. Christian Williams, managing director of the Sui Foundation, expressed pride in the ecosystem's growth, highlighting the remarkable community and developer activity. With a flourishing DeFi ecosystem, Sui's growth reflects its commitment to pushing the industry forward. Price predictions suggest SUI may reach between $2.40 and $3.60 by the end of 2025, with potential highs of $9.38 in May. By 2030, projections estimate SUI could rise to between $25 and $37, based on its growth trajectory since launch. With its innovative technology and strong community support, SUI presents a promising opportunity in the current market cycle. Its focus on speed and efficiency addresses key industry challenges, making it an attractive option for those looking toward the future of blockchain technology. Avalanche (AVAX): The Rising Star in the Crypto World Avalanche (AVAX) is a blockchain network rivaling Ethereum in smart contracts, scalability, and speed. Launched in 2020, it has become popular among developers. Its compatibility with Ethereum's programming language Solidity makes migration easy, fostering innovation and growth on its platform. AVAX stands out with impressive technology. It uses subnets to boost transaction throughput, handling up to 6,500 transactions per second. Its proof-of-stake mechanism allows users to participate in governance and validate transactions. Burning transaction fees increases scarcity over time. After reaching $146.22 in November 2021, AVAX is about 70% lower. Despite this, it has grown 26% over the last year. Its strong fundamentals and continuous network improvements suggest potential for future growth in the evolving crypto market. In the current market cycle, AVAX appears promising. With increased interest in cryptocurrencies and the recent Bitcoin halving boosting sentiment, AVAX may benefit. Its lower fees and higher speeds compared to Ethereum make it attractive for developers and users alike. Analysts predict AVAX could reach around $68.72 by the end of 2025, and potentially higher by 2030. Its capped supply and strong technology underpin its potential for long-term growth. As the crypto market evolves, AVAX stands out as a noteworthy contender. Fetch.ai (FET): Bridging AI and Blockchain for a Smarter Future Fetch.ai was founded in 2017 by Humayun Sheikh and Toby Simpson. They set out to create a decentralized platform where artificial intelligence (AI) meets blockchain technology. Their Autonomous Economic Agents (AEAs) can perform tasks like negotiating contracts and managing supply chains without human help. By combining AI with blockchain, Fetch.ai allows different systems to communicate smoothly. This means processes across industries can be automated and made more efficient. For example, an AEA can order pizza for you, saving time and effort. The platform uses a proof-of-stake system, making it scalable and energy-efficient compared to other cryptocurrencies. In 2024, FET, the native token of Fetch.ai, saw significant growth. It hovered around $1 until March, then jumped to $3 within weeks. This surge was likely due to increased interest in AI and crypto technologies. The merger with SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol to form the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance also boosted its position in the market. Looking ahead, some analysts believe FET could reach $10 or more in the coming years. While exact predictions are tough, the potential of Fetch.ai’s technology and its growing adoption hint at a positive future. As businesses realize the benefits of AI and blockchain integration, demand for FET could rise. In the current market cycle, Fetch.ai appears attractive for those interested in AI and blockchain. Its innovative approach and expanding partnerships suggest it could play a significant role in the tech landscape.

Ondo Finance: Riding the Wave of Real-World Asset Tokenization Ondo Finance is making waves in decentralized finance, offering institutional-grade liquidity for tokenized real-world assets. By bridging traditional finance with blockchain, Ondo aims to democratize access to financial products. Since launching ONDO on January 18, 2024, the token's price surged until June before dipping. Interest revived later due to the real-world asset crypto boom, hitting an all-time high on December 16. This trajectory highlights ONDO's potential in the evolving market. Predictions for ONDO remain optimistic. By 2025, forecasts suggest a price between $1.50 and $3.50. In 2026, expectations rise to $2 to $6, and by 2030, projections reach $5 to $12. These estimates reflect ONDO's anticipated growth as it gains broader adoption. Ondo uses on-chain asset management for secure investments. Investors can subscribe, redeem, and transfer synthetic assets like OUSG, backed by US Treasuries. The platform is governed by a decentralized organization, with the ONDO token at its core. With a mission to make institutional-grade products accessible, Ondo Finance is poised for significant growth. As decentralized finance evolves, ONDO's innovative approach could make it a key player in the future of finance. Conclusion In the current bullish market, assets like SUI, AVAX, FET, and ONDO present some opportunities but may offer limited short-term potential. Their performance might not align with the swift gains that some traders anticipate during such dynamic times.

This shift reminds the crypto community of a past event involving a $2.5 million investment that stirred major interest. The latest move involves Shiba Inu (SHIB) and a rising star, Codename: Pepe, which promises powerful gains using real AI intelligence. Codename: Pepe aims to pierce through the clutter of fake AI agents in the crypto space. Modeled like the well-known PEPE coin, this venture garners attention for its potential explosive profit possibilities. As the crypto market experiences a bull run, all eyes are on this development, sparking curiosity and anticipation. Codename:Pepe (AGNT) Gains Traction After Listing and Supply Burn, Eyes $2.1 Milestone Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) has recently made its entrance on Uniswap, opening the floodgates for global trading — and it didn’t come quietly. In a dramatic power move, Codename:Pepe has burned a significant portion of the tokens to tighten the supply and send a clear message: this project plays to win. $AGNT token burns mean reducing the supply and boosting scarcity, which may fuel a price surge. Source: Codename:Pepe X account If you missed the chance to grab $AGNT at a fraction of a cent during the presale, don’t worry — there’s still time to get in at a bargain price before it targets its next milestone: $2. The team is rallying the community to drive momentum and push the price higher, aligning everyone around a shared goal — collective growth through smart, unified action.

Here’s why: AI-Driven Strategy: AGENT A.I. will scan social media and blockchain data to detect trending meme coins before they explode. Automated Trading: The AI engine will be able to execute real-time trades, turning noise into signals and volatility into opportunity. DAO Utility: Token holders will gain exclusive access to insider analytics and community voting through the AGNT DAO. Momentum is building: the presale sold out early. Now with liquidity, community energy, and a shrinking supply, AGNT is poised to move. Codename:Pepe fuses cutting-edge AI with meme market psychology, and it’s already showing signs of breakout potential. With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance. Price Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now Shiba Inu: From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu (SHIB) began in 2020 as a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin. It gained fame with help from Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum, SHIB was initially meant for payments and investment. Creators expanded SHIB's use by launching a decentralized exchange and NFTs. They added a metaverse, games, a magazine, and merchandise. These projects set SHIB apart from other meme coins, giving it real utility. SHIB soared in 2020 and 2021, hitting a peak of $0.00008845 in October 2021. It then settled around $0.00001 to $0.00002 for months. This stability let its ecosystem grow and develop. In 2025, SHIB keeps building its ecosystem and community. New meme coins appear, but SHIB's strong base gives it an edge. Its growth may depend on outside events like a crypto bull market. Predictions say SHIB's price could rise. Changelly expects SHIB to reach up to $0.0000526 by 2025, and higher by 2030. Though uncertain, these forecasts show SHIB's potential as a long-term crypto player. Conclusion In light of recent market movements, traditional meme coins like SHIB show limited short-term potential. Investors are looking beyond these options for assets that offer greater immediate returns. Codename:Pepe crypto stands out by providing real artificial intelligence to navigate the complex meme coin arena. By delivering advanced trading signals and automated strategies, Codename:Pepe crypto aims to maximize profits in the ongoing bull run. Its community-driven approach and capped token supply make it an attractive choice for those seeking significant gains.

The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 65% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12.1 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,100 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. While BTC’s momentum signals strength in the broader crypto market, analysts and insiders are zeroing in on Mutuum Finance. Bitcoin Reclaims Momentum Amid ETF and Macro Tailwinds Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to roughly $118,016, setting fresh highs in response to substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, declining on‑exchange supply, and growing investor optimism around potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts slated for September. Bolstered by upbeat institutional sentiment and regulatory clarity, including a strategic U.S. crypto reserve, the leading digital asset has reclaimed all‑time high territory and is eyeing a move toward the $120,000 level. With on‑chain metrics pointing to record low liquid supply, analysts suggest Bitcoin may continue its ascent into August. Amid this backdrop, sector watchers remain alert to emerging DeFi protocols, such as Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Reaches $12.1M Milestone in Presale The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13100 investors and has raised more than $12.1 million. Investors have picked up more than 65% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Starts Major Token Giveaway Event Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. How Mutuum Finance Is Transforming Lending in DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins. While Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward momentum, climbing past $118,000 amid ETF inflows and macro tailwinds, the real breakout potential may lie in the DeFi sector, where Mutuum Finance is gaining serious traction. With over $12.1 million raised and more than 13,100 early investors, Mutuum’s Phase 5 presale is already 65% sold out at a price of $0.03, offering investors a 100% ROI at listing. As excitement builds ahead of Phase 6, analysts are projecting a potential 40x upside by year-end, thanks to Mutuum’s innovative dual lending model and fully audited smart contracts.

The conversation showed Ripple’s readiness to support financial institutions in adopting its technology at a pace that could redefine cross-border transactions. According to one of the speakers in the video, the typical timeline for full implementation ranges between two and three months, encompassing onboarding, credit reviews, and technical integration. However, he noted that in some instances, the process has been completed in as little as three weeks. “How quickly can banks roll out XRP powered payments once regulations are in place?” Full implementation, including testing? 2–3 months. In some cases, as fast as 3 WEEKS. Listen closely. https://t.co/fEPOPrdyUI pic.twitter.com/wh8aeGKFTc — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 10, 2025 Ripple’s Competitive Advantage This accelerated timeline highlights a key advantage for banks considering Ripple’s infrastructure. With traditional cross-border systems often plagued by delays and inefficiencies, Ripple’s offering presents an alternative that is not only faster but also more cost-effective. Its payment system leverages XRP to eliminate pre-funding requirements, significantly reducing operational costs and freeing up trapped liquidity. XRP’s advantages have driven adoption in various systems across the globe. Strategic Positioning with a U.S. Banking License The company’s efforts to simplify integration are further supported by its recent move to secure a banking license in the U.S. Operating as a licensed bank could enable Ripple to streamline onboarding processes even further, removing additional layers of complexity for partner institutions. This strategic step signals Ripple’s ambition to embed XRP more deeply within the financial ecosystem and potentially accelerate adoption of its technology. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Road Ahead for XRP in Banking While the regulatory landscape remains a critical factor in the global rollout of XRP-based solutions, the speed of implementation offers a glimpse into how quickly change could arrive once approvals are in place. Many experts see XRP as the future of international payments , and its ability to execute payments in just three seconds, with near-zero failure rates and minimal costs to senders, positions it as a compelling solution for banks looking to modernize their cross-border operations. For institutions wary of lengthy deployment cycles, this timeline could provide reassurance. As the speaker noted, “It’s as fast as you can put resources into making it happen, and we’re here to support that.” This emphasis on collaboration shows Ripple’s focus on practical, real-world integration rather than abstract promises. Ripple is already in discussions with numerous financial institutions worldwide, and its speed and determination reaffirm its commitment to increasing XRP’s adoption and utility .

33767162,[object Object],1752305444,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"SharpLink Buys 10,000 ETH From Ethereum Foundation — What Are They Planning?",https://bitcoinist.com/sharplink-buys-10000-eth-from-ethereum-foundation/,"Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming has expanded its Ethereum holdings through a direct over-the-counter transaction with the Ethereum Foundation. The company purchased 10,000 ETH for approximately $25.7 million, pricing each token at $2,572.37. The deal, finalized on July 10, increases SharpLink’s total ETH balance to 215,634 tokens, according to data from DeFiLlama. At current market value, that brings the firm’s treasury to an estimated $558 million, positioning it as one of the largest known institutional holders of ETH. The move reflects a deepening strategy from SharpLink, which has steadily shifted its balance sheet toward Ethereum since early June. According to the company, the ETH accumulation is not just a corporate treasury play, but a broader alignment with the ETH ecosystem. Funds for the acquisition reportedly came from at-the-market share sales, part of a $425 million private raise led by Consensys, the blockchain software company founded by SharpLink Chairman and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. Strategic ETH Acquisition Aims to Support DeFi Infrastructure SharpLink emphasized that the purchase is not only about balance sheet expansion but also a commitment to long-term support for Ethereum’s decentralization. In the statement, Lubin noted that the company is actively staking and restaking ETH in an effort to reduce circulating supply and contribute to the network’s health. “SharpLink is acquiring, staking, and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem,” he said. The transaction marks a rare instance of the Ethereum Foundation transferring such a large volume of ETH directly to a public company. While the foundation has made ETH sales in the past, often viewed as macro sentiment indicators, this direct transfer to a corporate buyer is unusual and may signal evolving relationships between crypto-native institutions and traditional capital markets. The ETH Foundation, based in Zug, Switzerland, plays a central role in supporting the development and research behind ETH’s protocol. Its ETH reserves are typically used to fund research grants, developer bounties, and infrastructure projects. The sale to SharpLink suggests that it is also exploring strategic partnerships to deepen Ethereum’s integration into regulated financial ecosystems. Corporate Crypto Allocation Trends Continue to Shift SharpLink’s ETH-heavy treasury strategy follows a broader pattern of increasing institutional interest in digital assets beyond Bitcoin. While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-focused balance sheet has dominated headlines, SharpLink’s growing Ethereum position illustrates expanding diversification among public firms in the crypto space. As more institutions evaluate on-chain assets not just for speculation but as foundational infrastructure, Ethereum appears to be gaining traction. The firm’s activity may also reflect broader investor behavior amid ETH’s growing role in DeFi. With staking yields, Layer 2 adoption, and real-world asset tokenization narratives on the rise, ETH’s appeal to corporations seeking exposure to blockchain-based finance continues to evolve.

The Upgrade Everyone's Ignoring (But Shouldn’t!),https://bitzo.com/2025/07/cardano-to-outpace-ethereum-the-upgrade-everyones-ignoring-but-shouldnt,"A significant technological upgrade is brewing, stirring excitement within the crypto sphere. Often overshadowed by Ethereum, Cardano is quietly positioning itself for a potential breakthrough. Discover why this overlooked upgrade could redefine the market dynamics and spotlight the coins primed for substantial growth. Dive into the details and uncover what most are missing. Provided by Outset PR , this review comes from a crypto PR firm dedicated to leveraging data, trends, and timing to convert pivotal moments into enhanced brand influence and expansion. Cardano (ADA) Eyes Potential Growth Despite Recent Challenges Source: tradingview Cardano's price hovers between fifty-four and sixty-two cents, facing some ups and downs. Recently, it has observed a weekly rise of nearly nine percent, but it's still down about thirty-one percent over the last six months. The immediate challenge for Cardano is to break past the sixty-five-cent resistance level. Success here could push the price toward seventy-three cents, marking a potential gain of over seventeen percent from its current state. While the short-term indicators like the ten-day simple moving average suggest a bit of a climb, the long-term position shows some ground to recover. Cardano enthusiasts are hoping for a rebound to gain back confidence in the market. Ethereum Surges: Can ETH Break Past $3000 Soon? Source: tradingview Ethereum's price currently sits between $2420 and $2679, showing a positive trend with a 9.10% increase over the past week. Analysts highlight the nearest resistance level at $2787, which ETH might test soon. If it breaks through, the next target is $3047, promising a potential rise of about 14% from the current range. With the relative strength index near 68, ETH indicates strong momentum but is not overbought just yet. This suggests room for further growth. However, caution is advised as the nearest support at around $2269 could slow things down. Keep an eye on the trends as Ethereum continues its upward journey.

The upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade introduces improvements in smart contract performance and data handling, positioning Stellar to support more complex decentralized applications. Meanwhile, institutional adoption and a notable rise in tokenized asset flows are reinforcing the network’s utility in cross-border payments and DeFi. These fundamental shifts in infrastructure and use case expansion are driving renewed interest and sustained upward pressure on the XLM price. But the question remains whether the price will reach $ in 2025. Major Stellar Core Upgrade—Protocol 23 Recently, the Stellar Development Foundation published the v23.0.00rc2, which is the preliminary release of Protocol 23. The upgrade could introduce several technical enhancements, like scalability and developer functionality. A key feature is the parallel execution of the Soboran smart contracts, which boosts transaction throughput and efficiency. The upgrade also implements CAP-67, introducing Unified Assets Events that simplify asset tracking and improve dApp transparency. Additionally, Protocol 23 enhances the use of Merkle data structures, enabling more efficient data validation. Together, these improvements lay the foundation for more complex and high-performance decentralized applications, making Stellar a strong platform for DeFi, asset tokenization, and enterprise-level blockchain solutions. Growing DeFi Ecosystem Stellar was originally built to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border payments. It is now evolving into a more robust platform supporting DeFi and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Several developments are contributing to this shift. TVL Surge: Over $100M Locked As of July, Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Stellar Network has surpassed $100 million, a significant milestone indicating growing confidence and capital deployment. This growth is largely driven by Smart contract capabilities enabled by Soroban, Stellar’s custom-built smart contract platform that integrates seamlessly with the core network TVL growth has been fueled by tokenised treasuries, stablecoins, and asset-backed tokens launched by institutional partners. Institutional Adoption Driving Liquidity Franklin Templeton has tokenised part of its U.S. Government Money Fund on Stellar, allowing investors to interact with traditional financial products via blockchain rails Circle’s USDC has expanded significantly on Stellar, becoming a key medium of exchange for on-chain transactions and remittances Other players in the ecosystem include StellarX, Lobstr, and Ultra Stellar, offering decentralized trading, lending, and pooling options. Interoperability & Asset Tokenisation Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is also benefiting from its focus on interoperability, enabling seamless asset bridging across different chains and real-world applications The Network’s anchor model allows regulated financial institutions to tokenize fiat currencies, creating a bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and Defi. This has enabled a steady rise in on-chain activity in the regions where Stellar powers real-time payments and lending applications. What’s Next for Stellar (XLM) Price? Will it Reach $1 in 2025? The Stellar price has been on the rise since the past trading day, helping it to break the bearish pattern. With this, the token has officially fulfilled a bullish breakout, which is expected to attract more than 200% gains in the coming days. If this price action validates, the XLM price may eventually form new highs, breaking the current ATH at $0.9381. As seen in the above chart, the XLM price broke above the bull flag but failed to surpass 0.5 FIB at $0.4037. However, RSI has displayed a steep rise, with the weekly MACD displaying a potential bullish crossover. This was seen during the 2024 breakout, which pushed the price by over 500% from the lows around $0.08 to as high as $0.786. If the Stellar price replicates a similar price action, it may surge past $1, forming a new ATH around $1.54.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|BLOCKCHAIN|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 07:33:25

However, this time, price action isn’t just about momentum, as traders claim that market structure is evolving under the weight of institutional influence. “This isn’t a frenzied boom with no foundation,” said Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank. “It’s a measured ascent, backed up by large institutional players with the long-term in mind.” Rocca pointed to tight monetary policy and geopolitical volatility as reinforcing Bitcoin’s emerging role as a macro hedge, adding that “the momentum we’ve seen over the last 48 hours is clear. Bitcoin isn’t just growing in value, but also as a genuine asset class that is rivalling traditional finance.” Ethereum, up over 17% on the week and briefly crossed $3,000, remains a primary beneficiary. ""In Q2, corporate treasury purchases of BTC outpaced inflows into spot ETFs,"" said the analytics team at Bitcoin yield protocol TeraHash in a note to CoinDesk. ""That points to strategic positioning. At the same time, custodians like Anchorage and Fidelity are scaling institutional pipelines, while OTC desks are tightening spreads."" Solana, now trading around $163, gained over 11% on the week amid renewed demand across retail and memecoin ecosystems. The chain continues to act as a high-beta proxy for risk-on sentiment. XRP, meanwhile, jumped 25%, benefiting from both a technical breakout and rising speculation around regulatory resolution. “Price action may grab the spotlight,” TeraHash added, “but the real breakthrough this summer is structural.” The altcoin move is broad-based. Dogecoin has rallied 23% over the past week, driven by increased retail participation through platforms like Robinhood and Binance. XRP volumes have spiked on Korean exchanges, while Cardano, TRX, and AVAX are all trading firmly in the green. Meanwhile, Bitpanda Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad said that “strong bitcoin rallies are often followed by significant movements in altcoins with a slight delay — and a potential comeback of meme coins can’t be ruled out either.” But not everyone sees a straight line up. “Despite briefly touching this key milestone, BTC remains below a major resistance zone,” said Ruslan Lienkha, Chief of Markets at YouHodler, said in an email. “A decisive breakout and sustained move above this level could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the $130,000 range,” Lienkha added.",Markets|btc|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|DOGE|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-12 07:34:55

Here are the Allegations,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-binance-founder-cz-and-donald-trump-in-an-alliance-here-are-the-allegations/,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been revealed to be providing behind-the-scenes support to a crypto venture owned by the Trump family, according to Bloomberg. This aid comes at a time when Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) is seeking clemency from US President Donald Trump. According to three sources familiar with the matter, Binance wrote the underlying software code for the stablecoin USD1, launched by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial Inc. This technical support includes developing the “smart contract” that governs the creation of USD1. This coin was used in the spring when a United Arab Emirates-based investment firm purchased a $2 billion stake in Binance. More than two months after this major transaction, approximately 90% of USD1 tokens in circulation are still held in Binance wallets, according to on-chain data. The interest income generated by these assets could generate tens of millions of dollars in annual revenue for the Trump family. Binance also introduced USD1 to its 275 million user base, a privilege often coveted by stablecoin issuers. Related News: Grayscale Sends Special Letter to SEC Regarding XRP, Solana, and Cardano ETFs - Here's What It Says So, publicly available data and testimony from people familiar with the situation suggest that Binance was directly involved in the creation, promotion, and largest-ever transaction of USD1. However, it remains unclear whether Binance or Zhao received any payment from the Trump family for this service. Binance's statement said USD1 had gone through the exchange's “standard listing process.” It emphasized that CZ was no longer CEO and that the amnesty application was a “personal decision.” Zhao did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. A spokesperson for World Liberty declined to elaborate on the relationship with Binance, but said, “Your allegations are baseless and intended to feed a political agenda.” It's unclear how the companies first made contact. However, two sources familiar with the matter claimed that CZ met with Steve Witkoff, a Trump associate and co-founder of World Liberty, at a Bitcoin conference in Abu Dhabi in December. At the time, Zhao had just been released from federal custody after a short sentence for violating anti-money laundering regulations, while Binance had paid over $4 billion in fines to US authorities. A member of Witkoff's inner circle denied that the meeting took place. Witkoff, previously appointed as a diplomat by Trump, was reportedly in the process of transferring his shares in World Liberty to his sons. White House Counsel David Warrington stated that Witkoff managed this process in accordance with ethical rules. *This is not investment advice.

This new milestone has signaled the start of capital rotation into low cap crypto gems and the best new altcoin available in the market. The bull season is kicking, and thankfully, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has downsized the hundreds of project options to a reasonable number. The AI model used market trends and data to predict undervalued crypto projects that show the most promise. Here is a quick rundown of the best crypto to buy now that could hit $5 in H2. HBAR, Moving Closer to the $5 Mark HBAR is making a strong case for itself as a growth crypto asset heading into the second half of 2025. The Hedera network has recently completed a testnet upgrade , which is a key signal that its infrastructure is evolving to support more complex and scalable applications. This kind of technical refinement often sets the stage for wider adoption. As more users gain access to HBAR through a regulated, high-volume platform, the token’s visibility and demand could rise sharply. ChatGPT views these catalysts as reasons HBAR could potentially outperform and move significantly closer to the $5 mark. ChatGPT Predicts Dogecoin Will Surprise Skeptics Memecoins have enjoyed a huge boost from Bitcoin’s relentless climb, so it’s no surprise that Dogecoin, the OG memecoin, makes the list. Discussions around a potential DOGE ETF are ongoing, and that’s not all, Dogecoin continues to boast new real-world use cases especially on platforms like X and Tesla. ChatGPT argues that this top crypto under $1 could not only surprise skeptics again in H2, but also be one of the best crypto to buy now. XLM Will Grow In Relevance and Market Value Among cross-chain DeFi projects, XLM has been one of the biggest winners, posting a sharp 26% surge in the past 24 hours as market momentum picks up. The recent price action appears to be driven by a noticeable rise in DeFi activity on the Stellar network, signaling renewed user interest. ChatGPT highlights Stellar’s core strength ( i.e., its ability to streamline cross-border payments ) as a key reason for its growing relevance. The AI model predicts that XLM’s unique technological infrastructure would play a pivotal role for XLM’s price trajectory in the months to come. Remittix: The Next 100x Crypto Remittix (RTX) is the next 100x crypto on ChatGPT’s watchlist; this relatively new project is considered by the AI model as one of the best cryptos to buy now. Remittix solves a similar problem to XLM but takes it to a whole new level. ChatGPT believes this new solution edges Steller’s XLM for a few reasons, namely: The platform’s flat fee adoption allows for affordable and predictable transaction costs regardless of transfer amount or destination. Remittix allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies directly to fiat, opening the door to more diverse user adoption. As Bitcoin’s relentless rally continues to inject smart money into crypto with real utility in the market, ChatGPT rules out these four as crypto gems investors should miss in H2.

Currently priced at $117,430, the asset has gained 5% in the past 24 hours and 9% over the past week, reflecting growing investor confidence. While numerous analysts have offered varied projections, Google’s AI platform Gemini has added its voice to the broader conversation around Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Post-Tariff Rally Begins with “Liberation Day” Much of the current momentum in Bitcoin’s price can be traced back to early April, when a major geopolitical and economic development changed investor behavior. On April 2, President Donald Trump declared what he called “Liberation Day,” a sweeping policy shift involving an aggressive package of tariffs aimed at rebalancing global trade. This announcement initially triggered a downturn in traditional stock markets. However, Bitcoin moved in the opposite direction, climbing from around $70,000 to its present range. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Boosts Institutional Confidence One of the most consequential actions that followed Liberation Day was President Trump’s executive order to establish a U.S. strategic Bitcoin reserve. Describing it as a virtual Fort Knox for digital gold, the president outlined the need for a sovereign digital asset buffer in an increasingly uncertain financial world. This historic decision marked the first formal effort by the United States to incorporate Bitcoin into its national reserve strategy, signaling to the global market that the asset was now being viewed through a national security and long-term value lens. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bitcoin’s Supply Structure Reinforces Store-of-Value Status These policy moves have coincided with heightened interest from institutional investors, many of whom now view Bitcoin not only as a hedge against inflation but also as a geopolitical asset. Bitcoin’s unique structure, particularly its limited supply of 21 million coins, has always invited comparisons to gold. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be expanded at will by central banks, Bitcoin’s fixed issuance model ensures scarcity, a quality that becomes attractive in times of economic volatility or strategic financial repositioning. Google Gemini Forecasts Bitcoin to Hit $120,000 by Month-End As market participants adjust to these developments, Google Gemini has analyzed the underlying data and market indicators to offer a short-term forecast. According to its assessment, Bitcoin is expected to reach approximately $120,000 by July 31, 2025, representing a 2.1% increase from current levels. Gemini stated: “Based on current momentum and macroeconomic catalysts, Bitcoin is on track to climb approximately 2.1% to $120,000 by July 31.” This projection is grounded in a synthesis of price trends, supply-demand mechanics, and the broader policy environment. With less than three weeks until the end of the month, market observers are paying close attention to how Bitcoin performs relative to Gemini’s forecast.

The rally mirrors broader strength across the crypto market, as investors pile into risk assets amid fresh regulatory momentum and a record-breaking run for Bitcoin. The Ripple ( XRP ) token jumped as high as $2.9695 on July 11, its highest level since March 2, driven by three key factors: Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) surge to an all-time high of $118,300, accelerating inflows into the new leveraged XRP exchange traded fund, or ETF, and renewed investor optimism following Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s appearance in Washington ahead of the proposed CLARITY Act. Combined with bullish technical signals—including a breakout from a months-long triangle pattern—the rally has traders eyeing a return to the coin’s year-to-date peak of $3.3930. The recently launched Teucrium 2X Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) continued to attract investors, with its assets increasing to $248 million. It has experienced inflows in every week since its launch in April, and its daily volume has increased significantly. The XRP ETFs seeing surge in volume today, like 4-5x the norm, especially the 2x one $XXRP , which is up 27% today, 55% this week with $120m in volume.. Teucrium rewarded for getting out early.. ht @Todd_Sohn pic.twitter.com/Bk8hsNFhW1 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 11, 2025 The ongoing inflows surge into XXRP is notable because of its costs. Unlike most ETFs, which have an expense ratio of less than 0.50%, the fund’s ratio stands at 1.89%. This means that a $10,000 investment costs about $189.

For example, XRP price jumped by 24% in the last five days, while the XXRP stock jumped by 51% in the same period. XRP vs XXRP ETF stock | Source: crypto.news The price also reacted to Garlinghouse’s presentation in Washington, where politicians held a hearing on the upcoming CLARITY Act. CLARITY, a bill under consideration during the upcoming Crypto Week, aims to separate crypto roles between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ripple’s token price staged a strong rally this week, moving above the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since January. It was the upper side of the triangle pattern. The 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages have formed a bullish crossover. Additionally, the Average Directional Index has risen to 25, indicating that the trend is strengthening. Therefore, the most likely scenario is one where the coin continues to rise, with the next key target being the year-to-date high of $3.3930.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 DOGE Price Analysis July 2025 Dogecoin may have started 2025 on the back foot, but with growing optimism in H2 with much stronger DOGE ETF approval odds and increasing interest from social media, the price has broken out from the declining wedge’s upper border. If bullishness continues, then the price could surge to approximately $0.25 in July 2025. Under higher bullish momentum, it could even retest the formidable resistance at $0.39, which has proven challenging to overcome. However, if the demand zone at $0.130 – $0.150 is breached, then $0.10 could be hit. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) DOGE Price Target July 2025 0.10 0.25 0.39 DOGE Price Forecast 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture investor attention, primarily due to its history of delivering remarkable returns. One notable surge occurred in November 2024, following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, which propelled the price to a peak of $0.4846 by year-end. However, profit-taking around this peak created a supply zone, triggering a downward trend. In January 2025, bulls made an effort to sustain the gains from Q4 2024. Yet, the high volume profile resistance at $0.39 proved formidable, pushing the price down to a low of $0.130 by early April. Interestingly, april’s low is near the demand zone at $0.130 – $0.150 that has previously supported a parabolic rally, and bulls are seen active in this area. Over the past couple of months, this level has been tested several times and has proven strong for bears to break that easily. Also, the most recent support taken by DOGE is in the final week of June, and since then, the price in the past 20 days has given a breakout by July’ second week from the upper boundary of a downward wedge. A bullish continuation at this level could pump a breakout to $0.25 level in July or could even retest the $0.39 high volume zone. Additionally, optimism around a potential DOGE ETF approval is growing. If approved, it could spark significant adoption, potentially flipping $0.39 and propelling the price beyond the previous high of $0.484 and setting the stage for a new bullish trajectory. In such a scenario, DOGE reaching $1 is not out of the question. On the flip side, if DOGE is rejected at the $0.39 resistance level by the end of 2025, it may retrace back to the demand zone near $0.13, posing renewed challenges for investors.

Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

What’s next? Where will the next high-growth regions for crypto adoption be? What is the next challenge that we tackle? Parallels with traditional finance are already being drawn but where is the fine line? Is crypto becoming a tech-savvy iteration of TradFi or is there much, much more to it? In this conversation, Konstantins Vasilenko, CBDO at Paybis, tackles some of the more interesting topics around regulatory barriers, lessons learned, and what’s next. Where do you see the next high-growth regions for crypto adoption? Central and southern Asian countries like India, Vietnam, and the Philippines will most likely drive the next phase of crypto adoption. They have a strong remittance market, high mobile and internet use, and young, tech-savvy populations. African countries like Nigeria and Kenya also have high potential due to the high inflation rates and currency instability, making crypto assets, especially stablecoins, the perfect alternative to fiat. Dubai, UAE, is also one of the most crypto-friendly regions that could bring massive attention to the Middle East. Dubai is emerging as a leader in the sector, thanks to its supportive regulations, high-tech environment, tax policies, and the involvement of many high-profile crypto companies. Dubai’s biggest focus is on business-to-business (B2B) adoption and financial services rather than just mass consumer adoption. What regulatory or cultural barriers most complicate global expansion, and how do you mitigate them? Inconsistent global regulations combined with deep-rooted financial mistrust have been acting as a major barrier against mainstream crypto adoption. For example, the US SEC has been creating room for regulatory uncertainty with its unclear policies for years. However, it’s important to note that the regulatory frameworks are still evolving, which has become a challenge for many businesses in the industry. For instance, the largest stablecoin, Tether’s USDT, would need to obtain an EU E-Money license, establish an EU-regulated entity, and adhere to MiCA’s specific requirements to enter the European market. To address these challenges, we focus on implementing strong AML and KYC protocols, working closely with our legal and compliance teams to ensure we meet local regulatory requirements, and prioritizing financial education to help overcome both regulatory and cultural barriers. What lessons from traditional finance’s globalization can be applied to crypto business development? Crypto firms must prioritize licensing to navigate regulatory challenges and avoid potential shutdowns and scrutiny. This step mirrors traditional finance’s emphasis on compliance and regulation. Localization is also key — just as banks adapt their services to different languages, laws, and customs, crypto companies must do the same to build trust and drive adoption in local markets. Last but not least, the infrastructure needs much more scalability and interoperability to meet the requirements for mass adoption. Similar to SWIFT in traditional finance, the crypto industry requires shared rails — such as on/off ramps and standardized custody protocols — to enable seamless cross-border transactions and integrate with existing financial systems. How do you see stablecoins evolving in 2025, and what role will Paybis play in their mainstream adoption? Stablecoins are shifting from being just trading tools to becoming the core components of payment and remittance systems due to their wide utility, stability, and efficiency. This is why we expect this specific asset class to gain mainstream adoption. At Paybis, we’re building solutions to help businesses seamlessly accept, hold, and utilize stablecoins without going through complex regulatory challenges. Our tools are tailored to allow diverse businesses across various industries integrate digital assets into their operations with a peace of mind. How does Paybis balance the need for security with user experience, especially around KYC and onboarding? Our automated KYC process balances top-grade security and seamless user experience while maintaining full AML compliance. We only ask for the necessary documents, offer live support, and avoid any extra steps. This helps us onboard new users in less than 15 minutes and keeps fraudulent actors out without frustrating our genuine customers. We are exploring and using AI technologies to boost privacy, efficiency, and compliance for our users. AI also helps us with detecting fraudulent patterns and automating customer support — this cuts the extra costs and improves user trust while making the platform faster, safer, and transparent without facing any regulatory issues. How do you view the regulatory efforts during the Trump administration, and have you seen these lead to any meaningful changes or shifts in the crypto industry? Since President Donald Trump took office, the regulatory environment for crypto has seen significant improvements. Under his administration, the approach shifted from closely scrutinizing crypto companies to fostering a more supportive ecosystem for the industry. One of the most notable moves by the administration was the push to encourage the growth of digital assets and halt CBDC development. The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using seized crypto assets was also a significant step to make the United States the cryptocurrency center of the world. The US SEC, under Gary Gensler’s leadership, scrutinized many crypto firms like Ripple. However, recently, the SEC has started easing up on leading businesses in the industry. On May 9, for example, the regulator ended its battle with Ripple with a $50 million settlement. Binance and the SEC also came to an agreement to pause their lawsuit in February. These moves have given companies like Coinbase, Binance, and Ripple some breathing room. This not only helps in reducing uncertainty around crypto regulations, but also allows the industry to grow more confidently With Paybis being over 10 years old, what’s the most important insight that was gained in that time about the crypto industry? In my experience, trust can help the industry move faster than its tech. People adopt cryptocurrencies and stablecoins when it feels safe, simple, and useful, not because of the revolutionary products in the market. For Paybis, what brought loyal customers is transparency, support, and our strong compliance across different regions. We’ve grown not from flashy features or hype, but from delivering a consistent, reliable experience that people can count on.

Recent data points to large-scale transactions, particularly on the Bitcoin and Ethereum side. A whale with a wallet named bc1q0l, who had withdrawn 2,100 BTC from Binance after holding it for about four months, deposited 1,000 BTC (approximately $117.67 million) back into Binance just an hour ago, marking a profit. The whale had collected the Bitcoins at $84,861, a profit of approximately $68.8 million at current prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also experiencing significant activity. A wallet with the address 0x247B, reportedly affiliated with the Ethereum Foundation, sold 1,207 ETH for 3.61 million USDC five hours ago. Related News: How Much Is Satoshi Nakamoto's Fortune After Bitcoin's Latest Major Rally? Where Does He Rank Among the Richest? On the same day, SharpLink Gaming, which received 10,000 ETH ($25.7 million) directly from the Ethereum Foundation, followed up with an additional 21,487 ETH ($64.26 million) from the over-the-counter (OTC) market and Coinbase Prime. However, not every investor is bullish on the market. The rise in short positions in Ethereum is noteworthy: The wallet with address 0x8c58 deposited 3.74 million USDC in the last hour, shorting 18,394 ETH ($54.3 million) with 15x leverage. 0x2258 deposited 3.25 million USDC and shorted 16,219 ETH ($48 million) with 25x leverage. Another investor with the address 0xec4b opened a short position of 13,845 ETH ($41.07 million) with 15x leverage. Amidst all this trading, institutional activity continues. BlackRock's Ethereum ETF, ETHA, recorded its highest daily net inflow in history yesterday: 106,827 ETH (approximately $320 million). This brings BlackRock's total ETH holdings to over 2 million ETH (approximately $6 billion). *This is not investment advice.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 15.36560534 -0.61% Market Cap $ 10,419,416,524.1723 Trading Volume $ 665,703,004.8441 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June onwards LINK showed bullish reawakening in the short term with BTC rallying and its price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $15 mark after witnessing a short-term rally. Based on price action, a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if it breaks below $13, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against major currencies, closed at 94.73, just above recent lows and down 10.4% from its 2022 high.

Some want to wait, others see inflation risks that require more tightening. Markets are pricing in a 50% chance of a July rate cut—a coin flip that keeps traders on edge. In crypto, the picture is clearer. ETF hopes are building despite the SEC delaying Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF. Analysts think more crypto ETFs are coming as institutions start to treat Bitcoin like digital gold. This narrative makes BTC a better hedge against rate changes and geopolitical risk. Meanwhile, Peter Schiff is telling everyone to sell Bitcoin for silver and the market is ignoring him. BTC is up 6% after his warning and many are citing institutional inflows and strong technicals as reasons to stay long. Trade Setup and Risks to Watch Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, therefore, for a continuation trade, here’s a setup: Entry: Pullback to $116,950 (0.5 Fib) Stop-Loss: Below $112,500 (0.382) Targets: $121,378 (0.618), $124,682, $127,681 This is a Fibonacci confluence and trend play. Look for reversal signs—spinning top or Doji—at resistance levels. But risks remain. The July 12 Fed minutes could be volatile if the tone turns hawkish. And the US government’s tariff policies—especially towards BRICS countries like South Africa—will impact global risk sentiment and crypto indirectly. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s technical breakout, a weak dollar, and growing ETF hopes mean more upside could be ahead. Whether BTC gets to $300,000 this year is a confluence of events—Fed policy, institutional adoption, and macro volatility. But for now, bulls are in control.

For months, XRP had been stuck moving sideways within a tight range. But in recent sessions, the price finally managed to break above the upper boundary of its bull flag pattern, a setup that often signals the start of a stronger uptrend. XRP is now eyeing $3.20, followed by the all-important $3.40 level, which marks the previous all-time high for XRP. Crossing this would be a huge milestone and could fuel even more buying interest. This breakout has excited traders, especially since XRP is known for making sharp, straight-line moves when it starts gaining momentum. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies that typically see pullbacks along the way, XRP tends to move quickly once it gets going. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.76 and is up by more than 7% in the last 24 hours. What the Elliott Wave Patterns Are Showing Market analysts using the Elliott Wave theory had been pointing out a “one-two setup” pattern forming on the charts, which is often a reliable signal before a breakout. A similar setup helped forecast XRP’s move last year, and now the same pattern is hinting at further upside move. What’s Next for XRP? Now that XRP has cleared some important resistance levels, the next major price targets lie between $2.90 and $3.00. If the current trend continues, a quick move back toward its all-time high around $3.30 to $3.40 could also be possible. On the downside, immediate support for XRP lies between $2.39 and $2.60. This zone has acted as a reliable safety net for the price in recent days. As long as XRP stays above this range, the overall trend remains bullish.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 08:29:25

According to reports, the agency is intensifying its efforts against unauthorized brokers. In its statement, the agency said the blacklisted platforms were found guilty of offering illegal trading services in FX and digital assets without the necessary permission and authorization. In this round of blacklisting, the Cyprus SEC has also issued a new round of warnings against other unlicensed providers carrying out services in this sector of the industry. Cyprus SEC clamps down on unauthorized platforms According to the agency, some of these unlicensed firms and platforms are usually decisive users by claiming to be connected to other brokers that have been registered and under regulation in Cyprus. It noted that in other cases, these unauthorized platforms use the Cyprus Investment Firm (CIF) license awarded to these regulated firms to deceive users in the sector. In response, the Cyprus SEC published a list of blacklisted platforms associated with these unauthorized providers. Some of them include fasat-g.pro and market-trading.ltd, iqforextrade.net, metaindextrade.net, viptradersclub.com, stockforexinvestment.com, and quantoria-markets.net. As the Cyprus SEC continues to double down on its attitude of adopting the best measures in terms of guidelines and operating regulations, certain aspects of the rules and operations have started to come into sharper focus. One of the key changes to its regulation is that it has mandated every service provider dealing in digital assets to register with the Cyprus SEC. Firms of individuals that fail to adhere to the new regulation will face severe consequences. In addition, penalties for noncompliance have been pegged at a fine of up to $370,000 or custodial sentences lasting up to five years. In some cases, those found guilty may face a combination of both punishments. The agency warns of gamification and “finfluencers” According to a recent retail investment behavior research conducted by the Cyprus SEC, there has been a rise in what it considers unregulated, volatile investment products . The agency said the increase is alarming, as it shows that work still needs to be done to curb the sector of bad actors and criminal elements looking to rob unsuspecting victims of their hard-earned money. The research also showed that only a few investors spend more than enough time researching the products they intend to invest in or the firm selling them, raising concerns that most investors do not understand the risks in the crypto industry. In the retail aspect, a quarter noted that they spend only 6-7 days researching a product, with 7% saying they spend less than 30 minutes or none at all on due diligence into a company before committing their money to invest in the product. Meanwhile, only 30% of the respondents looked into the website of the country’s regulator to check if their broker’s website was licensed. 15% said they didn’t bother to check at all, while about 51% said they looked at company reviews before carrying out their transactions. With most people afraid of missing out on the chance to make money from the crypto industry, regulators in Cyprus launched a campaign to educate its citizens on the potential risks involved in online trading. The campaign was backed by the country’s financial regulator, which warned platforms of using colorful apps that make trading look empowering instead of intimidating.

Several altcoins have followed suit, while XRP, CRO, and especially XLM have charted mindblowing gains. BTC’s Rally It’s been a while since we have said this, but a lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets in the span of a few days. Recall that itcoin’s price stood within a tight range between $105,000 and $110,000 for a few weeks, and each breakout attempt in both directions was stopped in its tracks. However, that all came to an end on Wednesday evening when the asset finally broke out of the upper boundary and shot up to a new all-time high of $112,000. After a brief retracement, the cryptocurrency began an even more impressive rally that resulted in tapping $116,000 on Thursday evening, but BTC went all the way up to almost $119,000 on Friday morning. Although it has lost some traction since then and now trades just under $118,000, bitcoin has gained over 9% on a weekly scale. Its market capitalization has grown to $2.345 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has declined slightly to 62.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XLM Steals the Show Most altcoins posted mindblowing gains over the past few days as well, but have calmed since yesterday. Ethereum, for instance, went from $2,500 to over $3,000 to market a five-month peak before it corrected slightly to just under the latter. In contrast, XRP was a little sluggish at first but took the spotlight yesterday by surging to almost $3. Although it has dropped below $2.8 now, it’s still 7% up on the day, and it overtook USDT in terms of market cap. CRO has charted a similar price surge over the past day, taking it to well over $0.1. However, the day belongs to XLM, which has exploded by more than 22% and now trades above $0.37. Pi Network’s native token, on the other hand, has plunged by over 6% and struggles to remain above $0.47. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets gained over $300 billion since Wednesday and stands at $3.750 trillion on CG now. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

While Bitcoin has smashed a new all-time-high, Pi Coin keeps slipping closer to its all-time low $0.40. Many are now wondering why the Pi network coin price is dropping. Pi Network Coin Drops 9% In the past 24 hours alone, Pi Coin has dropped about 9% and now trades near $0.471, not far from its lowest level ever, $0.40. This looks worse when you compare it to the rest of the crypto market, which is all green. Bitcoin is above $118,000 and Ethereum crossed $3,000, but Pi keeps moving the other way. Even the recent Pi2Day celebration, which was supposed to boost excitement in the Pi community, couldn’t lift the price. Over the last two weeks, Pi has fallen more than 29%, showing just how deep this downtrend has become. Token Unlock Adds More Pressure One big reason behind Pi’s continued slide is the massive token unlock happening this July. Between July 8 and July 15, over 100 million PI tokens about 1.5% of the total supply will hit the market. On one day alone, 10.1 million token s will be unlocked. These unlocked tokens often end up being sold by big holders, which adds extra selling pressure when there aren’t enough buyers to balance it out. Many whales are taking profits by selling, and that weighs heavily on the price. Pi Technicals Still Look Weak The technical side isn’t offering much comfort either. Pi Coin is trading inside a clear downward channel. Each time it tries to break higher, sellers push it back down. The trading volume is also low at $19.95 million, which shows that buyers don’t have enough strength to flip the trend just yet. However, Pi Network RSI has also reflected a bearish sentiment as it is currently at 39.8 reflecting an over-sold. What’s Next for Pi Coin? For now, the risks look bigger than the chances of a sudden turnaround. With so many tokens unlocking and big holders ready to sell, Pi could easily slip back to test the $0.40 zone or even drop into the $0.35 or $0.38 range if things get worse. Until Pi sees stronger buying interest, emergency liquidity, or a big exchange listing, the price may stay stuck in this bearish phase.",News,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 08:50:07

According to SMQKE, Eastnets is deeply embedded in the fabric of international financial systems, providing critical services such as compliance, SWIFT connectivity, and ISO 20022 migration to a network that spans some of the world’s most influential financial institutions. Eastnets is a global provider of compliance and payment solutions for the financial services sector. With over four decades of experience, it enables participation in the global financial system for more than 800 institutions, including 15 of the world’s top 50 banks and 22 central banks. Furthermore, over 270 banks and corporations rely on Eastnets for outsourced SWIFT connectivity and compliance solutions. These figures alone reflect the scale and reach of the company’s operations and influence. RIPPLE AND EASTNETS PARTNERSHIP MEANS DIRECT ACCESS TO CENTRAL BANKS, SWIFT, WEF AND MORE This is one of Ripple’s most underrated partnerships and here’s why it matters: Eastnets is a global payment solutions provider that works with some of the most important institutions… pic.twitter.com/a6M1brq5WY — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 10, 2025 Integration of Ripple in Eastnets’ PaymentSafe Platform SMQKE’s tweet highlights that Ripple is integrated as a distributed ledger technology (DLT) rail within Eastnets’ “PaymentSafe” platform. This platform serves as a unified payment hub for managing domestic and international payments. According to a presentation slide shared in the tweet, PaymentSafe supports multiple messaging formats, including ISO 20022, and offers real-time integration with back-office systems and message transformations. The DLT integration features Ripple, indicating that Ripple technology is being actively utilized as part of Eastnets’ broader transaction infrastructure. This integration is not only a technical detail but a strategic connection that places Ripple in direct alignment with the high-value systems used by Eastnets’ clientele, including central banks and tier-one financial institutions. By participating in this platform, Ripple’s technology becomes accessible to a vast ecosystem of banks already interfacing with Eastnets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory and Strategic Influence Eastnets’ involvement in global regulatory and strategic initiatives adds another layer to this partnership’s significance. It is a strategic contributor to the World Economic Forum, where it engages in global financial policy dialogue. It is also a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), contributing to global efforts in standardizing blockchain technologies and promoting regulatory convergence. By association, Ripple gains indirect exposure to these high-level forums and working groups, potentially influencing the development of blockchain policies and standards on a global scale. Eastnets’ services also align closely with evolving regulatory requirements and innovations, particularly in the area of secure messaging standards such as ISO 20022, where it plays a leading role in migration and implementation support. Implications for Ripple’s Position in Global Finance SMQKE argues that this partnership provides Ripple with direct access to the infrastructure of global finance. Through Eastnets, Ripple’s technology interfaces with SWIFT systems , ISO 20022 frameworks, and the compliance architecture used by hundreds of institutions globally. This reach also extends to central banks and policy-making bodies through Eastnets’ extensive institutional relationships. The collaboration indirectly amplifies Ripple’s role in shaping the future of digital finance. Notably, Eastnets also lists companies such as American Express, FBN Bank UK, and Mastercard among its customers, some of which have also been connected with Ripple’s broader enterprise offerings. This alignment supports Ripple’s long-standing goal of becoming a foundational infrastructure for cross-border payments and digital asset integration.

Currently at $2,969, ETH is showing a sustained breakout with high volume and bullish indicators. After weeks of steady gains, Crypto Summer may have finally arrived. ETH lost 0.41% in early weekend trading, but the trend is still intact. ETH is up 9% in the last 5 days and outperforming most altcoins. This is more than a short term spike, it’s institutional demand and growing confidence in Ethereum’s long term. SharpLink’s ETH Buy is Institutional Trust A big catalyst for this momentum is the $25.72 million private OTC deal between the Ethereum Foundation and Nasdaq listed SharpLink Gaming. The esports marketing firm bought 10,000 ETH at $2,572 per token, now holds 215,957 ETH worth over $600 million. SharpLink has acquired 10,000 $ETH directly from the ethereum foundation. They are now holding 215,000+ $ETH . pic.twitter.com/tQh94jUbXS — Satoshi Stacker (@StackerSatoshi) July 11, 2025 SharpLink’s CEO Joseph Lubin said the purchase is part of the company’s long term strategy, not speculative trading. The Ethereum Foundation said the OTC route was chosen to avoid market disruption, open market sales can be heavy on the price. Deal Size: 10,000 ETH for $25.72M Average Purchase Price: $2,572 Current Holding Value: Over $600M Market Reaction: SharpLink stock up 17% So institutional confidence is high and ETH is above $3,000 without profit taking. Investors see this as a vote of long term confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its utility across Web3, DeFi and tokenization. ETF Inflows Mean Strong Demand Ahead To top it off, U.S. spot ETH ETFs saw their second-largest daily inflow of $383.1 million at the end of last week. Total 5-day inflow is $851.73 million, and total inflows are over $5 billion ahead of their 1-year anniversary on July 23. BlackRock’s ETHA drew in $300.93 million in one day. The biggest $ETH ETF inflow in history just hit: $383M in a day. $12.5B now parked in Ethereum. Institutions are front-running the next leg. Still sidelined? You’re gonna feel it at $10,000. pic.twitter.com/eXiSvP20rP — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) July 12, 2025 These ETFs are not only absorbing supply but also helping ETH find price stability in a volatile market. Since Ethereum’s 2022 proof-of-stake transition, supply has been dwindling. Over the last nine trading days, ETF inflows have outpaced ETH supply, creating a supply squeeze. With crypto conferences and ETF milestones in July, many see this as the start of Ethereum’s next leg up. Ethereum (ETH/USD) Technical and Trade From a charting perspective, Ethereum price prediction seems bullish as it has broken out of an ascending channel since March. Daily RSI is at 72, indicating strong momentum but overbought conditions. No reversal candles yet, bulls are in control. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Ethereum Trade Outlook Entry: $2,864 (pullback zone) Stop-Loss: Below $2,700 (mid channel support) Targets: $3,126 (resistance), then $3,432 (channel top) A bullish engulfing or hammer candle at support would be additional confirmation for dip buyers. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,511,140 out of a $2,846,221 target.

Some investors and bankers, including Amundi and JPMorgan Chase’s executives, say they already see signs of complacency in the market. They argued that traders are overly optimistic, betting the US president will scale back from destabilizing economic policies , a confidence they think is misplaced. For starters, JPMorgan Chase executive Jamie Dimon had commented , “Unfortunately, I think there is complacency in the market.” Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of Amundi — Europe’s biggest asset manager, shared a similar comment, warning of a growing confidence in the Taco narrative (Trump Always Chickens Out). Trump escalates tariff threats as markets gamble he’ll blink A former top Trump official expressed a similar view, noting that markets are now confident Trump will abandon his tariff policies. However, he added that he doesn’t believe Trump will back down, stating, “Trump has always liked tariffs.” The S&P 500 share index has climbed 30% since April, recovering from earlier lows brought on by Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs. The stock rally picked up after he paused the tariff policies, lowering levies on countries to the baseline 10%. This week, Trump disclosed that his administration is considering additional tariffs on multiple countries. He sent letters to at least 20 countries , including its trading allies Japan, Canada, and Brazil, informing them of possible new tariffs, unless they discuss and agree on trade deals. If Trump follows through on his threat, Brazil could easily see a 50% levy. Still, equities have largely brushed off his most recent tariff threats. Despite the markets’ stance, the US president has held firm on his plan to enforce steep “reciprocal” tariffs starting August 1, warning that no extension will be granted without trade agreements. So far, only the UK, China, and Vietnam have struck deals with the US. Research teams at several Wall Street banks expect Trump to ease his most aggressive tariffs in order to avoid further market disruption. This outlook has largely helped maintain stability in stock and bond markets while lowering borrowing costs for companies. Tariffs are not the only concern, say US investors Some bankers and investors, however, are concerned that the President may stick to his proposed levies. Robert Tipp, head of global bonds at PGIM, asserted that the Taco narrative may fail in such an unpredictable environment. He added, “The tariffs that have ended up sticking are somewhat high. And yet markets have cruised on. Will there be a day of reckoning?” Some have also argued that tariffs are not the only issue investors should be wary of. The Big Beautiful Bill that was recently signed into law has analysts worried about ballooning national debt. Some economists forecast the legislation could contribute trillions of dollars to the federal debt. A senior executive at a leading US bank argued that the Trump administration’s policies and tax legislation have eroded confidence in the US as a stable and dependable store of value. According to the executive, investors are reevaluating their exposure to US assets more seriously than ever before, with many privately conceding that the country’s traditional “risk-free premium” has faded. He insisted that his biggest concern is the growing US deficit, warning that more taxes would eventually harm the dollar. Another senior executive at a global lender agreed the US has lost its “safe haven” status. He argued that while the US is still a critical market, it’s become more expensive to do business in the country. He also raised concerns over the emerging political tensions, especially over the rule of law. In his opinion, the Trump administration’s attacks on law firms, the media, and universities have been detrimental to the country’s status. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Trump demands Fed slash rates to 1.25%. William Pulte says Powell stepping down would be “right decision” as Fed meeting approaches July 29. Powell Faces Pressure Amid HQ Spending Backlash Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing new pressure amid reports he is considering stepping down. A senior government official said that “high-level, credible sources” believe Powell is weighing whether to leave his position. The pressure comes after criticism over the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s Washington headquarters. Chairman Jerome Powell has grossly mismanaged the Fed. While continuing to run a deficit since FY23 (the first time in the Fed’s history), the Fed is way over budget on the renovation of its headquarters. Now up to $2.5 billion, roughly $700 million over its initial cost.… pic.twitter.com/lHK4cWlAvf — Russ Vought (@russvought) July 10, 2025 Senator Tim Scott described the spending as resembling the “Palace of Versailles.” The project, revealed earlier this year, has faced backlash across political lines. Powell addressed the issue in a June Senate hearing, saying that some of the more extravagant descriptions are misleading and inaccurate. Donald Trump, who nominated Powell in 2017, has again called for interest rate cuts. The current Fed Funds rate is 4.25%–4.5%. Trump said it should be between 1.25% and 1.5%. Speaking in June, he said he had called Powell “every name in the book” to try and push for lower rates. Peter Schiff, a prominent financial commentator, echoed the sentiment, saying that if Powell steps down, his successor could move quickly to slash rates. Schiff added that such a move could “put the nail in the dollar’s coffin,” driving long-term rates, inflation, and gold prices higher. Agency Head Says Powell’s Exit Would Be ‘Right Decision’ William Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and chairman of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac boards, released a public statement supporting Powell’s potential resignation. “I’m encouraged by reports that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. I think this will be the right decision for America, and the economy will boom,” he said. When asked for comment, the Federal Reserve referred to Powell’s past statements that he intends to serve out his term, which runs through May 2026. No further comment was given. Attention Turns to Fed’s July Meeting The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is scheduled for July 29–30. Futures data from the CME FedWatch tool shows a 93% chance that rates will remain in the current range. The Fed has held rates steady since early 2024 and projects two rate cuts in 2025. Powell has stated the Fed will assess how tariffs and inflation evolve before adjusting policy. A recent Supreme Court ruling has limited the president’s power to remove a Fed chair, which may delay any leadership change if Powell chooses not to resign.

Key Takeaways: The number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has reached an all-time high of 2,743. These XRP whales collectively control over 47.32 billion tokens, coinciding with a 26% price surge. Santiment indicates that the current momentum marks the start of an altcoin season. Onchain analytics platform Santiment reported on Friday that the total number of such “whale” wallets has risen to 2,743, marking a significant accumulation trend. Santiment highlighted that not only are more whales entering the market, but the total XRP supply they control is also growing, a bullish sign for the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. XRP Whales Control Over 47 Billion Tokens Data shows that wallets holding 1 million or more XRP collectively control over 47.32 billion tokens. XRP’s price reached $2.80 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap, after a sharp 10% jump within the past 24 hours. The sudden surge wiped out approximately $31.44 million in XRP short positions, as reported by CoinGlass data. Just a month ago, XRP had been consolidating between $1.90 and $2.90 for nearly 200 days, with traders uncertain about its next move. The recent rally aligns with a broader market upswing, as Bitcoin hit consecutive all-time highs, $112,000 on Wednesday, $116,500 on Thursday, and $118,780 on Friday. Ethereum also rose sharply, gaining over 17% during the week, trading near $2,960. Santiment suggests that this strong performance across multiple cryptocurrencies signals the start of an altcoin season. “The data confirms that, for now, it has,” the platform said. It added that as long as Bitcoin remains above the psychological support level of $110,000, investors are likely to continue shifting profits into altcoins like XRP, fueling further market momentum. XRP has pumped to a high of $2.97 today, breaking out to a 4-month high. This is coinciding with a major increase in network growth (new wallets created) & rise in retail interest across social media.

The announcement followed a U.S. district court decision rejecting a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to reduce Ripple’s $125 million civil penalty and overturn the ruling that classified Ripple’s institutional XRP sales as securities transactions. In her ruling, Judge Analisa Torres noted Ripple’s readiness to “push the boundaries” of the earlier summary judgment, suggesting a risk of future violations. XRP Ledger Rolls Out New Upgrade Amid Rising Interest As reported, RippleX, the development arm of Ripple, has rolled out version 2.5.0 of the XRP Ledger , introducing several protocol upgrades aimed at strengthening network functionality and security. RippleX engineer Mayukha Vadari has called the upgrade “possibly the best single lineup of amendments” ever released, introducing significant improvements to token management and transaction processing. The XLS-85 amendment upgrades the escrow system by allowing third-party issued tokens, including stablecoins, and introduces multi-purpose tokens designed for institutional applications. The new update came after the XRP Ledger recorded a surge in user activity , with the number of daily active addresses climbing from an average of 35,000 to over 295,000.

According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could hit a price of $125,000 this month and $150,000 between July and the end of September.

Turning to Ethereum ( ETH ), the widely followed analyst says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap appears bullish and could rise to levels last witnessed in November of 2021. “A vertical candle upwards. Now, some patience and then we’ll continue to the all-time highs.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Ethereum is trading at $2,980 at time of writing, up by nearly 20% over the past seven days but down by approximately 40% from the all-time high reached close to four years ago. Lastly, Van de Poppe believes that the downtrend in the total market capitalization of altcoins versus Bitcoin is about to reverse . The widely followed analyst says altcoins are forming a bullish divergence against Bitcoin on the weekly time frame – an indication that altcoins are bottoming out against the flagship crypto asset. A bullish divergence occurs when the price of an asset is forming lower lows while an oscillator like the relative strength index (RSI) is forming higher highs.

These moves mirror broader market strength, particularly evident in Bitcoin’s performance. Over the last year, Bitcoin has surged by more than 106%, rising from $57,000 to $177,800, and has climbed an additional 9% in just the last week. This sustained momentum in Bitcoin often trickles down to altcoins, historically lifting XRP and other assets during bullish market cycles. Many observers believe that continued strength in Bitcoin could create favorable conditions for XRP to test higher levels. Another factor underpinning this renewed optimism is the resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit, which had clouded XRP’s regulatory status for years, concluded favorably for Ripple, easing investor concerns about potential enforcement risks. This development has been widely viewed as removing a major overhang on XRP’s price. Regulatory Climate Has Improved In addition to the lawsuit’s resolution, a recent analysis published in the Securing the Rights of Cryptocreditors journal highlighted the shifting regulatory environment as a critical element in XRP’s resurgence. The journal observed that “the change in the U.S. administration has paved the way for XRP to continue to increase in value,” citing a more crypto-friendly approach under President Trump’s administration and an overall recalibration of regulatory priorities. This shift has helped alleviate some of the pressure that had previously restrained XRP, allowing the market to reassess its long-term potential without the same degree of regulatory uncertainty. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Gemini’s $10 Prediction by December Against this backdrop of improved fundamentals and sentiment, Google Gemini’s AI-generated forecast provides a clear target for investors. According to Gemini, XRP is expected to trade at $10 by December. The AI model’s analysis incorporates current price momentum, the bullish environment in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, and the easing of regulatory risks as significant drivers of price appreciation over the coming months. “Based on technical indicators and market trend analysis, XRP has the potential to reach $10 by the end of this year,” Gemini’s forecast states. This projection represents a significant increase from current levels, but it aligns with the prevailing optimism among market participants who view XRP as undervalued relative to its utility and market position. As market conditions evolve, investors will continue to monitor how well XRP can sustain its upward trajectory and whether the factors identified by Google Gemini and other analysts will materialize as expected. For now, the combination of strong technical performance, improved regulatory clarity , and bullish sentiment appears to support the view that XRP’s upward momentum could carry it toward the $10 mark in the months ahead.

Analysts ask whether blue-chip names will keep control or if retail traders will again sprint toward lighter, wilder tokens. Into this clash steps MAGACOIN FINANCE, an up-and-coming political meme coin that claims it can marry narrative flair with solid fundamentals. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Steal the Spotlight MAGACOIN FINANCE is an early-stage memecoin project backed by strong fundamentals and a viral community. On-chain trackers show a clear rise in unique wallets and a jump in average holding size as the project heads into Stage 3 of its presale, evidence that accumulation is replacing quick flips. Unlike many meme tokens, MAGACOIN backs its buzz with structure. The supply is permanently capped at 170 billion coins, a guardrail meant to avoid the dilution that haunts older memes. Governance remains venture-capital-free, so every material change rises and falls on community votes without risk of selling pressure due to VC unlocks. That bottom-up governance model reflects the coin’s political brand and has become a talking point in analyst notes that compare MAGACOIN’s cultural pull to Dogecoin’s early years. Bitcoin’s High-Pressure Summer Standard Chartered’s desk sees Bitcoin pressing toward $135,000 by late quarter, driven by ETF inflows and a fading dollar. Although other analysts caution that historical mid-year slumps and fresh geopolitical jitters could still derail the charge, the broader uptrend remains intact. If Bitcoin does push past the psychological $110,000 mark, past cycles suggest retail liquidity eventually trickles down the ladder, often igniting meme rallies a few weeks later. That timing matters to traders, whether to sit in the heavyweight champion or front-run the next rotation. Avalanche Looks for Its Cue Avalanche spent June around $17, with chart analysts flagging a potential breakout above $20 as a gateway to a steeper climb. Medium-term projections peg a $30–$35 band, which is plausible in early Q3 if ecosystem growth holds pace. Still, some research desks note that “smart money” has begun inching toward higher-beta plays in DeFi spin-offs, suggesting that AVAX may need fresh catalysts to keep attention once meme season revs up. Dogecoin and the Retail Pulse Dogecoin rarely stays silent for long. Although it is down more than 40% this year, experts still believe the original meme coin can have some quick turnaround with increased liquidity and spill-over energy from Bitcoin highs. History shows that liquidity splinters into newer memes within days whenever DOGE catches a bid, and there are already signs of large wallets reallocating away from DOGE toward “next-gen” meme plays with clearer narratives and tighter tokenomics. A Three-Way Tug-of-War Put side by side, Bitcoin offers perceived safety and a shot at a historic milestone. Avalanche AVAX provides a technological story and mid-cap upside, and Dogecoin and its meme entourage promise adrenaline. MAGACOIN FINANCE tries to fold parts of each recipe into one dish: the resonance of a cultural storyline, the discipline of a capped supply, and the practicality of zero transaction fees. If Bitcoin rallies first, as many expect, meme coins typically follow. Should that pattern repeat, a community-driven token with audit credentials might be the one that grabs the microphone when retail enthusiasm peaks. Did I hear someone say MAGACOIN Finance? Yes, that’s the token to eye!

In a video message, Garlinghouse confidently said, “This case has ended. It’s over.” At that time, the SEC had decided to drop its lawsuit against Ripple, and it seemed like the fight was finally finished. But months later, new developments have raised fresh questions about whether that announcement came too early. What’s Happening Now? Since March, both Ripple and the SEC have been working through final legal steps. Ripple agreed to drop its cross-appeal, while the SEC said it would drop its own appeal as well. However, nothing has been officially finalized yet. A date that’s now being talked about is August 15, when further clarity could arrive. Until then, the case isn’t fully closed in the legal sense, even though Ripple declared it so months ago. Was Brad’s Announcement Premature? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel believes Garlinghouse’s victory speech may have been too soon. Fagel explained that if the CEO of a public company made a statement like that while legal details were still unsettled, the SEC would usually be very concerned. You’re just not understanding. The parties agreed to drop their appeals contingent on the district court vacating the injunction and lowering the penalties. The district court refused to do so. So now they plan to dismiss the appeals subject to the existing injunction. Get it? — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 11, 2025 He added, “I haven’t read all his comments, and I’m sure he was careful not to say anything explicitly false, but as this conversation shows, he confused a lot of people. “ What’s the Real Situation? To clarify: Ripple and the SEC had agreed to drop their appeals, but only if a judge first agreed to change earlier rulings and lower penalties against Ripple. The judge refused to do so. Now, both sides plan to drop their appeals anyway — but the earlier ruling against Ripple will still officially stand. So, while the lawsuit’s most heated parts are essentially over, the final legal status is a bit more complicated than Brad’s March video suggested.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 09:17:16

But well-known lawyer Marc Fagel says it’s too early to expect anything and that a deal this weekend is unlikely. The community is feeling anxious, especially since the SEC hasn’t said anything after Ripple’s dismissal request. A recent closed-door meeting by the SEC has added to the buzz, but lawyers are still saying there’s no reason to believe a weekend resolution is coming. Why a Weekend XRP Settlement Is Highly Unlikely? Not on a weekend they won’t. It typically takes a month or two for a vote on an enforcement recommendation, so people need to chill. There’s a process. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 12, 2025 Fagel took to X to directly address growing rumors that Judge Analisa Torres might deliver a ruling or approve a settlement this weekend. He dismissed the idea, noting that enforcement recommendations typically take one to two months for SEC review and a formal vote. “Not on a weekend, they won’t,” Fagel responded. “There’s a process.” He clarified that any settlement or decision from the court would not happen immediately, let alone over the weekend. Fagel emphasized that Judge Torres currently has no jurisdiction over the Ripple case, backing earlier comments by legal expert James K. Filan, who pointed out that there is no pending motion before her. Fagel confirmed again that the SEC hasn’t filed to dismiss the appeal yet. Now that the appeal window has closed, the ball is in the SEC’s court. The agency must vote internally, and both parties would need to formally request to withdraw the case. This step-by-step process makes a quick weekend settlement highly unlikely. What Sparked the July 14 Speculation? The July 14 date became a talking point after some users speculated that Ripple initially aimed to end the lawsuit back in March, possibly to align with ISO 20022 updates. However, according to Fagel, there is no evidence supporting a preplanned settlement tied to that timeline. He also reiterated that recent case developments are unrelated to external standards like ISO. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For July 12 , Gensler Not Involved, Says Fagel In a follow-up to another claim, Fagel dismissed any connection between Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler and the decision to pursue the Ripple lawsuit. “The decision had nothing to do with Gensler,” he said, reiterating that the case was initiated in 2020, before Gensler assumed office. He went on to argue that if investors suffered losses, Ripple should be held accountable for allegedly selling unregistered securities, not the SEC. With Judge Torres out of the picture for now and the SEC’s internal procedures still underway, any ruling or settlement before July 14 appears highly unlikely. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP achieved a significant partial victory. While institutional sales were deemed unregistered securities, programmatic sales on exchanges were not. The SEC later dropped its appeal, largely ending the main litigation. What is the likely outcome of the XRP lawsuit? The likely outcome is that the lawsuit will formally end with the SEC’s appeal being fully dismissed. This result establishes a precedent that XRP, when sold on public exchanges, is not considered a security. When will the SEC lawsuit against XRP officially end? The lawsuit is nearing its official end. Ripple has dropped its cross-appeal, and the SEC is expected to formally withdraw its appeal after an internal vote, which would conclude the nearly five-year legal battle.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 09:27:01

Ripple’s Growing XRP Holdings Raise New Questions Ripple may be transitioning from a payments-focused company to one with deeper ties to XRP as a reserve asset. According to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, the company could be referred to as an “XRP treasury company” within the next year. This suggestion follows increasing corporate interest in holding XRP and the firm’s growing influence over the token. I wonder if in 12 months, people will call Ripple an XRP treasury company. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) July 10, 2025 Ripple’s Q1 2025 XRP Markets Report stated that the company currently holds 4.56 billion XRP. Additionally, a large portion of XRP’s total supply—roughly 42%—remains under its control through monthly escrow releases. While the escrowed XRP is managed by on-chain contracts, its long-term release structure continues to tie Ripple closely to the asset. XRP Holdings Fuel Talk of a Corporate Pivot Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has publicly questioned the company’s $11 billion valuation, suggesting it doesn’t account for Ripple’s massive XRP holdings. “That $11 billion number is very outdated,” Garlinghouse said in a previous statement, pointing to the company’s roughly $100 billion XRP-linked balance. Meanwhile, this shift comes at a time when several public companies are exploring XRP treasury strategies. Trident Digital Tech Holdings is aiming to raise $500 million worth of XRP. Webus International has outlined a $300 million goal, while VivoPower and Wellgistics Health have secured $121 million and $50 million, respectively, in XRP for corporate reserves. Stablecoin Efforts Continue with New Custody Deal Ripple’s growing interest in digital assets extends beyond XRP. Its stablecoin, RLUSD, has reached a market cap of over $500 million. The company has tapped Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) to serve as custodian for it. The oldest bank in the United States, is known for supporting digital asset custody services. Ripple’s choice adds traditional financial credibility to its stablecoin operations across XRPL and Ethereum. The post Will Ripple Shift to Full XRP Control?

Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale recently surpassed 65% sold out at $0.03. This is the cheapest the token will be, with later stages set to feature higher prices. The presale has raised more than $12.1 million and onboarded more than 13100 unique holders. Mutuum Finance is seizing headlines and investor interest with its innovative dual lending model, blending centralized stability with decentralized flexibility. MUTM is fast becoming a name to watch in the DeFi market. Ethereum Edges Higher as Market Braces for Altcoin Rotation Ethereum (ETH) has recently climbed into the upper-$2,900s, currently trading around $2,999.51, with a daily high near $3,021 and a low around $2,767. Over the past week, ETH has gained approximately 7–8%, reflecting renewed buying momentum following broader crypto market strength. This uptick in activity comes as institutional interest continues to rise and on-chain metrics show increasing transaction volume and network usage. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s roadmap remains active, with developments like Proto-Danksharding and Layer‑2 scaling solutions supporting its long-term structural growth. As attention gradually shifts toward emerging DeFi protocols, ETH maintains a steady, neutral posture, poised to react to both macro trends and evolving sector dynamics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also remains on investors’ radar as one decentralised player implementing innovative lending strategies. Mutuum Phase 5 Selling Out Quickly Mutuum Finance is gaining traction during Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from other projects since it does not rely on hype but has actual use cases. Investor interest is growing with the project already going past more than $12.1 million and having over 13100 token holders. Mutuum Finance features a liquidity protocol which allows users to maintain their full ownership of assets. The project involves a double-model strategy that involves the use of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to ensure greater flexibility as well as efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to provide automatic lending with no human involvement and instead the smart contracts respond to the market by offering variable interest rates. Through the application of this auto mechanism, borrowing and lending is stabilized and made predictable. Peer-to-Peer model lacks middlemen and thus a direct relationship between borrowers and lenders is offered. Growing Community, Growing Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway , as a token of appreciation to the early supporters and in commemoration of the presale hype. Ten winners like these will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a reward for being part of the early supporters of the project. With growing community at an exponential rate, the early supporters are rewarded, not only with the potential future gains, but with real, live rewards. With its unique leaderboard system the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders will get rewarded bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance to Launch New USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin would be market-volatility-resistant and depeg risk-resistant algorithmic stablecoins. Leading blockchain security company, CertiK, has also audited the project’s smart contracts. In addition to putting investors at ease about the code base’s integrity and transparency, the conducted audit shows that the project believes in building a secure DeFi protocol. To make this guarantee tangible, the project has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The bounty runs on four levels of vulnerabilities, that is, critical, major, minor and low. Ethereum (ETH) remains stable near $3,000, but investor focus is shifting fast to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now 65% sold out in Phase 5 at $0.03, MUTM has raised over $12.1M from 13,100+ holders. Lock in your presale spot now before prices rise.

This date isn’t just any day; it lands right in the middle of Crypto Week , a key event that could bring major momentum to the entire crypto market . JUST IN: ProShares XRP ETF set to begin trading July 18, 2025. Documented. pic.twitter.com/7sUmG8i2oy — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 11, 2025 This approval rumor is getting air with the recent ‘ Crypto Blue Chip ETF ’, tied to Trump’s Truth Social, is reportedly in development, with XRP as a key holding. Meanwhile, on the ground, real money is already flowing in. Teucrium’s 2X XRP ETF (XXRP), launched in April, is nearing $160 million in assets, despite its high 1.89% fee, signaling strong investor interest. The XRP ETFs seeing surge in volume today, like 4-5x the norm, especially the 2x one $XXRP , which is up 27% today, 55% this week with $120m in volume.. Teucrium rewarded for getting out early.. ht @Todd_Sohn pic.twitter.com/Bk8hsNFhW1 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 11, 2025 ETF Launch Could Spark Price Surge ProShares filed its final amendment for the ETF under Rule 485(b)(1)(iii), and the fund has already appeared on the DTCC platform, signaling full readiness. Analysts believe this ETF could attract large institutional investors, adding fresh liquidity and pushing XRP’s price higher. This launch adds to the growing list of XRP-related ETFs. Teucrium launched its 2X Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP) earlier, which is now seeing strong inflows, almost $160 million so far. Other firms like Volatility Shares and Tuttle Capital are also preparing to release leveraged and standard XRP ETFs. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas recently praised Teucrium for catching market momentum early, with XXRP soaring 27% in a single day and weekly gains hitting 55%. Crypto Week + ETF Launch = Perfect Timing? The ProShares ETF launch happening during Crypto Week (July 14–18) has everyone talking. This Washington D.C. event is expected to cover key crypto bills like the Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Together with the ETF news, this may reignite the lost bullish sentiment not just for XRP but for the entire market. Meanwhile, other firms, such as Turtle Capital and Volatility Shares, are preparing leveraged and non-leveraged XRP funds for July 21, while a spot XRP ETF like REX‑Osprey may come into play by July 25 if the SEC review remains smooth. Bloomberg analysts peg the odds of these approvals at roughly 95%. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit Won’t End by July 14, Says Former SEC Attorney , What’s Next for XRP?

This shift marks a significant milestone for XRP, highlighting renewed investor confidence and growing momentum in the market. While USDT has traditionally held its place due to its stablecoin status, XRP’s rise is primarily driven by increasing adoption, positive regulatory developments, and strong network fundamentals. The on-chain activity indicates rising demand and accumulation by whales, while the technicals point towards a sustained rally towards the double-digit figure. Here are the top reasons why the XRP price is at the foothill of a massive explosion. Legal Clarity and Regulatory Progress XRP’s price rally is significantly influenced by improved regulatory clarity. The prolonged SEC lawsuit created uncertainty, keeping many investors cautious. However, recent court rulings have started to favor Ripple, providing a clearer legal framework around XRP’s classification. This shift has alleviated fears of XRP being labeled as an unregistered security, encouraging institutional investors and traders to increase their exposure. Regulatory progress often acts as a catalyst for price action, and the easing of legal pressure has restored confidence in XRP’s long-term viability within the crypto ecosystem. Expanding Use Cases & Partnerships Ripple’s continued focus on real-world adoption plays a crucial role in XRP’s growth. The company’s blockchain solutions facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments, attracting banks and financial institutions worldwide. These partnerships not only drive demand for XRP as a bridge currency but also demonstrate practical utility beyond speculative trading. By expanding its global payment network and securing agreements with key players, Ripple strengthens XRP’s market position and prospects. This tangible adoption creates a fundamental value proposition, supporting sustained price appreciation driven by increased transactional volume and network activity. Is the $10 Milestone Within Reach for the XRP Price Rally? The idea of XRP reaching $10 has circulated for years but seemed distant given its historical price range. However, surpassing USDT signals a strong bullish momentum, supported by: Supply and Demand Factors : XRP’s total supply and circulating supply dynamics can amplify price moves when demand spikes. Technical Breakouts : Recent price action shows XRP breaking key resistance levels, indicating a potential bullish trend. Market Sentiment : Positive news, combined with broader crypto market recovery phases, can fuel rapid price appreciation. Still, reaching $10 will require sustained buying pressure, wider adoption, and possibly further positive regulatory clarity. While the run to $10 might not be immediate, this milestone is now more plausible than ever. The long-term price action of XRP suggests the latest price action has not only helped the price to rise above the consolidation but also has laid the foundation for a strong upswing. The weekly MACD is about to undergo a bullish crossover, while the price has broken above the bull flag. Therefore, the next price action is expected to mirror the 2024 breakout, which may push XRP towards the ascending trend line at $9.23, which could be the peak of the upcoming bull run. Meanwhile, there are a few points to look at in the coming days that may heavily influence the XRP price rally, like regulatory updates, Ripple’s business developments, market sentiment and technicals.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|USDT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 09:37:27

As of press time on July 12, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $163.98 billion, up from $131.41 billion a week earlier, an increase of about $32.57 billion. Notably, XRP peaked at $171.88 billion on July 11. XRP one-day market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap This momentum has also lifted XRP’s price, which is now testing the $3 resistance zone. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $2.77, up nearly 25% over the last seven days and more than 7% on the daily chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Why XRP is rallying XRP’s rally has been fueled by its ability to track broader market sentiment, which has seen Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high above $118,000. Technically, XRP’s break above the $2.30 resistance level helped unlock further capital inflows. At the same time, on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment shared on July 11 shows that with XRP approaching $3, market interest has picked up notably. For example, 6,939 new XRP wallets were created in a single day, the highest daily figure since March 1. Additionally, social media activity has also spiked, with XRP now featuring in over 5.5% of all cryptocurrency-related discussions, a level last seen on March 18. XRP network activity chart. Source: Santiment XRP fundamentals Beyond technical drivers, institutional developments have buoyed sentiment. For instance, Ripple’s stablecoin , RLUSD, is seeing increased adoption in cross-border remittances, highlighted by Visa’s partnership with Yellow Card to facilitate settlements in Africa. In addition, XRP’s momentum has been supported by growing anticipation of a potential resolution in the long-running legal battle between Ripple and the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), with signs the two parties are moving closer to a settlement. Speculation around the possible approval of an XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) has further fueled interest, as institutional investors eye the asset’s potential.

The purchase is the first direct acquisition of ETH by a publicly listed company from the Ethereum Foundation. The company may be positioning ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset, and plans to stake and restake the acquired ETH, effectively removing it from circulation. SharpLink Gaming Acquires 10,000 ETH The Ethereum Foundation has sold 10,000 ETH to SharpLink Gaming in an OTC deal worth $25 million. The deal is the first time a publicly-listed company has directly acquired ETH from the foundation. SharpLink Gaming completed the purchase at an average price of $2,572 per token. The transaction was settled on-chain via the Ethereum Foundation’s multisig wallet on July 10. The Ethereum Foundation plans to use all proceeds from the sale to support its core activities. SharpLink described the purchase as a commitment to Ethereum’s long-term mission. The firm plans to use ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset and plans to stake and restake the ETH, removing it from circulation. Joseph Lubin, Chairman of SharpLink and a co-founder of Ethereum, stated, “This isn’t a trade — it’s a commitment. SharpLink is acquiring, staking, and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards, removing supply from circulation and reinforcing the health of the Ethereum ecosystem.” Lubin added that SharpLink views the acquisition as a model for how mission-driven organizations can work to advance shared goals. “Moreover, we see this as the start of something bigger – a model for how mission-driven organizations can work to advance our ecosystem’s shared goals of decentralization, economic empowerment, and protocol-native finance. At a time when Ethereum is entering a new era of institutional relevance, we are proud to support the network’s long-term strength and decentralization mission.” Ethereum Foundation Acknowledges Sale The Ethereum Foundation , the entity in charge of funding the research and development associated with Ethereum, acknowledged the sale on X, stating, “Earlier this week, the EF finalized the terms of a 10,000 ETH sale at an average price of $2,572.37 via OTC. For this sale, our OTC counterparty was @SharpLinkGaming.” The foundation has come under scrutiny for its use of funds, with market participants complaining that the sale of ETH to fund initiatives impacts the asset’s price. However, because OTC sales are private, the ETH sold to SharpLink didn’t hit the secondary market. Market watchers called the sale a creative way to address the issue flagged by the Ethereum community. Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of blockchain analytics company Nansen, stated, “Guess that’s one way to fix [Ethereum Foundation] dumping.” SharpLink Shares Jump SharpLink shares rose following the acquisition, and have jumped over 50% in the past week. The stock was changing hands around $20 per share, a 71% increase. The stock’s exceptional performance coincides with ETH’s push above $3,000 earlier this week. SharpLink aims to maximize shareholder value by growing the number of digital assets (ETH) it owns per fully diluted share. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Crypto analyst Virtual Bacon believes this is the beginning of a major bull cycle. However, he warns that altseason has not yet arrived. Here’s what’s happening, what to watch for, and why investors should stay patient. Bitcoin Bull Run Over the last seven days, Bitcoin has climbed 8.8%. So far this month, the price has jumped nearly 10%, touching a new all-time high of $118,000 . Virtual Bacon considers this breakout a major bullish signal and believes it marks the start of a new bull market. He points out that Bitcoin typically leads during early bull phases, with altcoins following once liquidity shifts. “Bitcoin’s breakout confirms the beginning of a new cycle,” he wrote on X . Bitcoin’s current support levels: 50-week Simple Moving Average (SMA): $86,982 20-week SMA: $96,719 (a proven dip-buying zone) Altcoin Season Is Close, But Not Confirmed Bitcoin dominance currently stands at 64.58%, down from 65.50% on July 1. While this slight drop is a good sign, altseason typically begins after a sustained fall in BTC dominance. Virtual Bacon points out early indicators: E thereum’ s price against BTC has jumped 10.53% this month ETH/BTC now trades at 0.02516, up from 0.02276 A strong weekly close above 0.024 could signal a true breakout From July 5 to 10, ETH/BTC surged by 9.49%, although it saw a minor correction of 1.08% afterward. The strength in ETH and SOL is encouraging, but not yet a confirmation of full altcoin rotation. Fed Quietly Injecting Liquidity into Markets A major factor supporting the crypto rally is the Federal Reserve’s quiet liquidity injection. Virtual Bacon outlines two major moves: $11 billion repo injection on June 30 A proposal to reduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for large banks. These actions boost bank reserves and allow for more lending, which increases liquidity in the broader financial system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : BitcoinTalk User Turns $500 to $10M After Unlocking 2012 Bitcoin Bar , Additionally, the Global Liquidity Index is making a higher low. If it breaks above its April and September 2024 highs, it could confirm expanding liquidity—another condition needed for altseason. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for September 17. Reports suggest there is a 64% chance of a rate cut in Q4 2025, which could further fuel crypto momentum. Final Thoughts: Wait for Confirmation Before Diving Into Altcoins While Bitcoin’s breakout is undeniable and the early signs for altcoins are positive, Virtual Bacon advises caution. A confirmed altseason requires: Sustained BTC dominance drop Breakout in ETH/BTC Full expansion in global liquidity Investors are advised to avoid jumping into low-cap altcoins prematurely. Instead, focus on large-cap coins showing early strength and wait for more macro confirmation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The outlook for July 2025 is optimistic. Bitcoin has already hit a new all-time high, and analysts forecast it could reach $120,000 in the coming months. The total crypto market cap exceeding $3.5 trillion signals strong momentum. How are altcoins performing today? Altcoins are showing mixed but generally positive performance. While some are consolidating, major ones like XRP are up significantly (around 7-8%), and Stellar (XLM) has seen a surge of over 20% today, indicating a broader altcoin rally. How is the Federal Reserve impacting the current crypto rally? The Federal Reserve is quietly injecting liquidity into markets through actions like an $11 billion repo injection and a proposal to reduce the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR), boosting bank reserves and lending.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 09:57:15

This disclosure came from Chad Steingraber, a game developer and prominent figure within the XRP community. Notably, over the past few days, Steingraber has been identifying massive spikes in XRP netflows and volume on Upbit , South Korea's largest crypto exchange by volume. Previous Strides in Volume and NetflowsInterestingly, each update on this discovery has been more impressive than the previous one, with volumes and inflows consistently increasing on Upbit. The Crypto Basic first called attention to this trend four days ago, confirming in a July 8 report that XRP saw $1.98 billion volume over a 1-hour period on July 7.The report also highlighted a more impressive net inflow figure of $1.58 billion within an hour on the same day, a metric also identified by Steingraber. Now, the game developer has spotlighted more remarkable net inflow figures that appear to be setting records in the XRP market.XRP Sees $2.39B Net Inflows Within an Hour on UpbitSpecifically, he stressed in a recent commentary that XRP had never observed up to $1 billion worth of net inflows over an hour until now. While the $1.58 billion net inflow on July 7 confirms this disclosure, Steingraber pointed to a more impressive figure when someone asked for evidence of his claims.Notably, the community pundit had on July 11 revealed that Upbit saw a massive $2.39 billion worth of XRP net inflows in the hour leading to 3:27 PM (UTC). This was unarguably one of the largest hourly net inflows observed by XRP in recent times. In addition to this, Upbit also saw a whopping $9.11 billion in XRP volume over an hour.https://twitter.com/ChadSteingraber/status/1943693678549025216Speaking on the recent trend, XForceGlobal, a South Korean certified Elliott Wave analyst, revealed that XRP now boasts a higher volume in Korea than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. According to him, these volumes are even higher than what the market saw last December, when XRP soared beyond $3. He suggested that Korean retail was now entering the market en masse.What's Happening?However, Steingraber and other pundits have insisted that such large volumes are unlikely to be driven by retail. Instead, they argue that institutions could be entering the Korean XRP market. In a post, he noted that Upbit appears to be moving millions of XRP, which has contributed to the recent volume uptick. He attributed this to ODL ( now Ripple Payments ).Meanwhile, order book expert Dom noted that investors have also consistently bought more XRP on Upbit. According to him, the recent XRP pump to $2.8 was partly fueled by Korean traders on Upbit. He showed that investors procured nearly $30 million in XRP over an hour globally, and Upbit accounted for nearly $13 million.https://twitter.com/traderview2/status/1943672244783161761",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,XRP|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-07-12 09:57:44

According to the update, the firm intends to raise $200 million to fund business operations as well as its further Solana purchases. The fund is expected to come from two separate financing vehicles, per the company’s statement. Upexi is a brand that specializes in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of consumer products, diversifying into the cryptocurrency industry. The company took to blogging platform X to announce how the funds would be raised. “Today we announced a blockbuster deal with a $150m in kind convertible note led by @BigBrainVC and a $50m equity private placement,” the firm said . Upexi also added that net proceeds will be used to purchase more Solana. Upexi set to raise $200 million to purchase SOL According to its statement, Upexi mentioned that the $150 million convertible note offering would be collateralized via locked, spot SOL provided by the purchasers of its convertible notes, which is expected to have a two-year maturity and a 2% interest rate that is payable every quarter. After the completion of the note offering, the tokens are expected to be added to the SOL treasury maintained by the company. The firm had previously announced its intention to build a digital assets treasury filled with Solana in April, raising $100 million to back its purchase at the time. The company said about 95% of the raised funds would be used to set up, fill, and operate its Solana-based treasury reserve, marking its diversification into the crypto space. Following the announcement, Upexi shares skyrocketed, finishing the day at $9.89, up by 335%. The share previously rose as high as 22%, marking its highest price in a year. With its latest purchase, Upexi will push its treasury balance to 1.65 million SOL worth around $270 million. With the firm holding such an amount of tokens, it now boasts twice the amount of Solana as another prominent, publicly traded Solana treasury, DeFi Development Corporation (DFDV). Shares of Upexi are yet to react as much as they did when the news of the first raise broke, with the stock only seeing a 7.8% rise to hit $5.39 after the announcement was made. The stock, UPXI, is down about 58% in the last month after its first jump, which saw it peak at $22.57, according to data from Google Finance. Nevertheless, the shares are still up by 53% year-to-date. Solana is also on the rise, with the asset trading at $162.47, a drop of 0.92% in the past day. SOL experienced a price rise on Friday, with Bitcoin also hitting a new all-time high at the same time. Meanwhile, Grayscale has called out the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for pausing the debut of its exchange-traded funds that hold several assets including Solana. The company alleged that its investors are suffering harm as a result of the SEC’s decision. The company asked the SEC to allow its Digital Large Cap Fund to begin trading.

48098415,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74052,1752314410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Crypto News: Avalanche (AVAX)’s DeFi Push Makes Waves, Yet Wallets Are Accumulating This Cheaper Ethereum (ETH) Alternative",https://timestabloid.com/crypto-news-avalanche-avaxs-defi-push-makes-waves-yet-wallets/,"Avalanche (AVAX) has made major inroads into the DeFi sector this summer, attracting developers and liquidity alike. Its strong ecosystem growth has drawn attention, but gas-conscious investors are now watching a more affordable and earlier-stage alternative that is already showing strong traction on-chain: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Being designed to solve inefficiencies in lending protocols while preparing for a Layer-2 future, this under-the-radar DeFi project is positioning itself for significant upside as it nears the end of its fifth presale phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.03 in Phase 5, with 72% of the allocation already sold, over 13,000 holders, and more than $12.15 million raised. With a confirmed 20% price jump to $0.035 coming in the next phase, the window for entry at this level is quickly closing. One DeFi-focused investor who exited Avalanche (AVAX) during a recent rally and entered Mutuum Finance in Phase 1 with $10,000 is now looking at a projected 4X return when the token lists at $0.06—and is targeting a 10X gain based on early accumulation and growing social metrics. Avalanche (AVAX) Latest Updates Avalanche (AVAX) surged 8% in 24 hours to $21.08, with its DeFi ecosystem crossing $5B in Total Value Locked (TVL), driven by subnets doubling transaction throughput. The ACP-181 upgrade, enhancing validator sync and VM speed, and partnerships like California DMV and Alipay, boost adoption. Weekly trading volume spiked 60.95%, with 515M+ transactions in June, outpacing Base and Arbitrum. Avalanche (AVAX) eyes a $22 breakout, supported by bullish technicals. Avalanche (AVAX)’s DeFi growth fuels optimism for Layer-1 tokens, potentially lifting SOL and SUI in crypto markets. In stocks, blockchain firms may gain, but U.S.-BRICS trade tensions could spark volatility. In forex, a stronger dollar may cap Avalanche (AVAX)’s upside, yet institutional interest and subnet scalability could drive sustained demand, positioning Avalanche as a top DeFi contender. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) won’t be just a new token on the scene—it will be a full-featured non-custodial lending protocol with real DeFi use cases and a unique architecture. Built around a dual-model lending system, Mutuum will allow users to earn or borrow in two key ways: P2C (peer-to-contract) and P2P (peer-to-peer). The P2C model will be designed for blue-chip asset lenders. Users will be able to deposit ETH, DAI, MATIC, or other top-tier assets into decentralized liquidity pools, earning variable APY based on supply and demand. These interest rates will be automatically adjusted by pool utilization, rewarding users who provide capital to heavily borrowed pools. For example, depositing Ethereum (ETH) into a high-demand pool will offer consistent and attractive returns as long as borrower demand remains elevated. On the P2P side, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will unlock powerful utility for meme token holders. Assets like PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE—often dismissed as speculative—will gain new purpose through Mutuum’s peer-to-peer (P2P) layer. Users will be able to post these volatile tokens as overcollateralized backing and borrow assets directly from other users. The platform will allow each loan agreement to be custom-tailored, letting borrowers choose repayment terms and interest rates in open-market conditions. All loans will be overcollateralized, ensuring that even volatile assets remain secured, while lenders maintain downside protection. When users lend, they will receive mtTokens—ERC-20 compliant tokens that represent their deposits and automatically accrue interest over time. These mtTokens can also be staked in designated smart contracts, allowing holders to receive a share of protocol-generated revenue in the form of MUTM token dividends. This creates a double reward stream: one from interest earned, and another from platform fees redistributed via staking. In addition to lending mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing its own decentralized stablecoin, backed entirely by on-chain collateral and governed by protocol rules. Minted only when loans are taken and burned when they’re repaid or liquidated, the stablecoin will maintain a $1 peg using algorithmic interest rate adjustments and arbitrage mechanisms. It will also enhance Mutuum’s treasury operations, allowing for better liquidity flows and platform-wide stability. Roadmap, Security, and Imminent Upside The 4-phase roadmap behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outlines the foundation for a fully-featured DeFi ecosystem. A major part of Phase 1 has already been completed, including the presale initiation, initial audit, marketing launch, and helpdesk implementation. The project is now progressing through Phase 2, focusing on core smart contract development, infrastructure setup, and risk parameter integration. Upcoming phases will introduce the demo version, extensive audits, exchange listing preparation, and regulatory alignment. Later stages of the roadmap are set to include the launch of a decentralized stablecoin, integration of Layer-2 scalability, multichain expansion, and institutional-grade platform enhancements. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also taking its security framework seriously, already undergoing an audit with CertiK, receiving a Token Scan Score of 95.00. To further ensure a secure launch, the protocol has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, offering rewards to ethical hackers who help secure its infrastructure during testing phases. For those looking to get in early, the clock is ticking. With Phase 5 nearly sold out and a 20% price jump to $0.035 approaching fast, entry at $0.03 will not last long. Smart wallets are already moving in, and with the final listing price expected at $0.06, even 2x–3x returns before exchange debut remain well within reach. While Avalanche (AVAX) continues its DeFi push, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as the next big Ethereum (ETH) alternative that gas-saving investors are racing to secure.

With both coins often seen as complementary in the payments and remittance space, investors are now speculating whether Stellar can ride XRP’s bullish momentum to new highs. As excitement spreads and trading volumes increase, we examine XLM’s recent rally and explore whether this wave of optimism could fuel a broader breakout for related altcoins. Stellar on the Rise: XLM Poised for Growth After Big Gains Source: tradingview Stellar’s cryptocurrency, XLM, is now trading between 23 to 26 cents. Recent trends show a strong upward move, with a weekly gain of nearly 67% and a monthly rise of around 44%. The coin is approaching a resistance level at 27 cents, with potential to climb to 29 cents. This level is close to the 100-day moving average, indicating further growth is possible. However, if it retraces, the support sits around 21 cents. Despite a dip over six months, Stellar’s momentum is promising, with its indicators hinting at continued upward potential. XRP Eyes Potential Breakout, Targets Higher Levels Source: tradingview XRP is experiencing upward movement with its price range between $2.17 and $2.35. The coin has seen a weekly rise of over 27% and a monthly increase of 24.56%. Its nearest resistance stands at $2.43, but with momentum building, it could aim for the second resistance at $2.61. If it touches this point, the price could rise by more than 10% from its current levels. Since the 10-day moving average remains higher, there is a likelihood for further growth. However, it must maintain support above $2.07 to keep its bullish outlook. As interest in XRP continues, its potential for climbing higher levels is evident. Conclusion Stellar’s breakout mirrors the enthusiasm surrounding XRP’s ETF-driven rally, with both coins showing strong short-term momentum. XLM now eyes key resistance at $0.27 and beyond, while XRP continues to build toward higher levels. If market sentiment remains bullish and ETF excitement persists, both assets could see continued gains—making them prime candidates for altcoins to watch in the near term.

48102412,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74148,1752319676,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dark Defender Says XRP Has Not Even Started Yet. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/dark-defender-says-xrp-has-not-even-started-yet-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst Dark Defender has released a technical update on XRP’s market structure, drawing attention to current price and momentum indicators that mirror conditions preceding a major surge in November. The analysis, shared via a tweet accompanied by a chart, emphasized that XRP’s current Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels align closely with those seen just before a notable rally late last year. According to the chart, XRP has successfully eliminated a significant weekly resistance trendline that had previously constrained price movement. This downward sloping resistance, illustrated in orange, has been broken, potentially clearing the way for a bullish continuation The strength is currently at the same level as it was in November. XRP has not even started yet. Exciting. Watch. pic.twitter.com/eSm8EG4ujq — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) July 10, 2025 Dark Defender’s visual analysis marks the resistance as invalidated, suggesting that the price is no longer hindered by this overhead supply zone. The chart also includes Fibonacci retracement levels measured from a previous move, with the 38.2%, 50%, and 61.8% retracement levels shown at $1.95, $2.07, and $2.19, respectively. The target price projection labeled on the chart sits at $2.46, reflecting an 85.4% potential move from the identified breakout point. A longer-term Fibonacci extension level of 161.8% is shown near $3.61, suggesting that this level could represent a more distant technical objective should upward momentum sustain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Momentum Indicators Reinforce the Setup The RSI indicator on the weekly time frame is a key feature of Dark Defender’s analysis. The RSI strength line, plotted below the candlestick chart, currently sits at a level nearly identical to where it was in early November 2024. At that time, XRP experienced a substantial rally, and the similarity in relative strength levels now suggests to the analyst that the asset may be in the early stages of a comparable upward move. Dark Defender draws this comparison explicitly, marking both November and the current RSI levels with blue dots connected by a curved green line. The annotation on the chart states, “RSI strength levels are the same as November,” highlighting what the analyst views as a critical similarity in market conditions. The tweet accompanying the chart further supports this view, reading: “The strength is currently at the same level as it was in November. XRP has not even started yet. Exciting. Watch.” This comment suggests a belief that the asset’s current consolidation is merely a prelude to a broader breakout, pending confirmation through price action. Technical Targets and Market Outlook In terms of technical targets, the chart suggests that $2.07 is a key Fibonacci pivot, with additional levels at $2.19 and $2.46 forming part of the bullish structure. The longer-term extension to $3.61 remains speculative but is noted as a potential upper boundary should market conditions strongly favor XRP in the weeks or months ahead. Dark Defender’s analysis aligns with broader bullish sentiment among some technical traders in the XRP community, particularly those monitoring momentum indicators and historical fractals. With XRP currently positioned just above the eliminated resistance line, further weekly closes above this level may be interpreted as confirming the trend reversal indicated in the analysis.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. With the $166.56 resistance now tested, SOL could trend higher if momentum holds. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

BTC bulls have set their eyes on the $120,000 mark as the flagship cryptocurrency heads into a crucial week with the price at record levels. Price action has slowed down over the past 24 hours, with the price marginally down, trading around $118,139. Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Triggers $1.2 billion in Liquidations Bitcoin’s (BTC) record-breaking rally has led to over $1 billion in bearish positions liquidated over the past 24 hours. Over 279,000 traders were liquidated as the flagship cryptocurrency raced to its latest all-time high. According to data from Coinglass, the largest liquidation, valued at around $88 million, occurred on HTX. Augustine Fan, partner at crypto trading platform SignalPlus, stated, “The conditions for a slow grind higher have been in place for some time. Today’s move appears to be a product of that setup.” Bitcoin was trading in a tight range since May but broke out of it on Thursday after President Trump unleashed his latest trade salvo, sending stocks into a tizzy. BTC crossed $115,000 by Thursday and surged past $118,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment returned to crypto. Several factors are fueling the latest rally, including record ETF inflows and a Congressional committee declaring next week as “Crypto Week.” There are also indications that China is rethinking its stance on digital assets. A Crucial Week For Bitcoin (BTC) And Crypto Bitcoin (BTC) heads into a landmark week for the crypto industry, with the US House of Representatives set to discuss three crucial crypto bills, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity. Lawmakers will discuss the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, with signs that recently strained ties between Washington and the crypto industry are beginning to thaw. A regulatory framework could encourage companies to adopt Bitcoin into their treasury strategy, following the lead set by firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR). The GENIUS Act will allow private companies to issue stablecoins. President Trump has already announced his support for the bill on social media. Meanwhile, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act will establish a framework for crypto regulation. The third bill, the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act, aims to prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Investors are lining up to take positions ahead of next week. Analysts expect that capital previously sidelined due to regulatory uncertainty will re-enter the market. Jag Kooner, head of derivatives at Bitfinex, believes even if the final passage of the bills stalls, the optics of legislative engagement could push the market higher. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) reached new highs on three consecutive days, with the flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance sitting around 64%, down 1.53% over the past week. However, altcoins also registered significant price jumps as BTC reached record levels, with Ethereum (ETH) reclaiming $3,000 and Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) breaking past key levels. With Bitcoin dominance remaining steady, analysts believe fresh capital is flowing into the wider market, helping prominent altcoins gain market share. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 1.09% on Monday and 1.33% on Tuesday to settle at $105,740. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,637, ultimately registering an increase of 0.73%. It lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% and settling at $108,097. The price recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and rising almost 1% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,231.

Notably, ADA has broken above its 200‑day moving average near $0.64, signaling a potential shift toward bullish momentum. On‑chain data also shows strong accumulation by large holders and improved volume dynamics, setting the stage for a possible breakout toward the $0.70–$0.75 resistance band. Price forecasts remain cautiously optimistic, suggesting that if ADA sustains this upward trend, it could test the $0.80–$1.00 range later this cycle. As Cardano steadies near $0.71, investors watch closely for confirmation of trend continuation, while also eyeing emerging coins like Mutuum Finance at the periphery. Mutuum Finance Presale Surpasses $12.1M, Momentum Continues Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already has over 13100 investors on board and has raised $12.1 million, with its revolutionary two-way lending paradigm. MUTM currently costs $0.03, but will increase further in the next phases and launch at $0.06. This guarantees all phase 5 investors a 2x return at launch. In addition, MUTM is set to climb past $3, delivering a 100x ROI. Mutuum Hits 95 Trust Score in CertiK Audit, Built on Confidence Mutuum Finance is turning momentum into credibility.

This latest acquisition underscores a growing trend of traditional companies strategically integrating digital assets into their financial frameworks. It’s not just about buying crypto; it’s about a calculated, long-term vision that could redefine corporate treasuries. What Drives SharpLink Gaming’s Bold Ethereum Investment? The recent announcement, first highlighted by Lookonchain on X, revealed that SharpLink Gaming purchased an additional 21,487 ETH, valued at an impressive $64.26 million. This substantial acquisition was executed through a combination of over-the-counter (OTC) trading and Coinbase Prime, indicating a sophisticated approach to large-volume transactions. This isn’t SharpLink’s first foray into significant ETH holdings; the company had previously acquired 10,000 ETH, worth $25.72 million at the time, directly from the Ethereum Foundation. SharpLink Gaming has been vocal about its intention to strategically accumulate ETH. This isn’t merely speculative trading but a deliberate move to diversify its corporate treasury and potentially leverage the Ethereum ecosystem for future business initiatives. For a company like SharpLink, known for its technology-driven sports betting and iGaming solutions, a deep dive into the blockchain space could unlock new avenues for innovation and growth. Understanding the ETH Accumulation Strategy When a company like SharpLink engages in such significant ETH accumulation , it signals a deeper strategic intent beyond short-term gains. Here’s what typically underpins such a strategy: Long-Term Value Proposition: Ethereum, as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3, offers a robust ecosystem with immense growth potential. Companies accumulating ETH often believe in its long-term appreciation and its foundational role in the future of the internet. Diversification of Assets: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, digital assets like Ethereum can serve as a powerful hedge and a means to diversify traditional corporate portfolios, reducing reliance on conventional assets. Access to Liquidity and Privacy: The choice of OTC trading and Coinbase Prime for these large purchases is crucial. OTC desks provide the necessary liquidity for massive transactions without causing significant market price impact. Coinbase Prime, on the other hand, offers institutional-grade security, execution services, and compliance, catering specifically to the needs of large corporate clients. This method allows SharpLink to execute its strategy efficiently and discreetly, minimizing market disruption and ensuring best execution for its substantial Ethereum investment . The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s latest move is a compelling testament to the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . Once considered a fringe asset class, cryptocurrencies are increasingly being embraced by publicly traded companies, investment funds, and even sovereign wealth funds. This shift marks a significant maturation of the digital asset market. Why are more institutions stepping in? Increased Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is becoming clearer in many jurisdictions, providing a more stable environment for institutional participation. Growing Market Maturity: Improved infrastructure, sophisticated trading platforms, and better risk management tools have made it easier and safer for institutions to engage with crypto. Demand for Digital Exposure: Clients and shareholders are increasingly seeking exposure to the digital economy, prompting institutions to explore and offer digital asset solutions. The entry of companies like SharpLink Gaming adds significant legitimacy and capital to the crypto space, paving the way for broader acceptance and innovation. It also indicates a strategic recognition of digital assets as a legitimate component of a forward-thinking investment portfolio. Why a Corporate Crypto Strategy Matters Now Developing a robust corporate crypto strategy is no longer just for tech giants or early adopters; it’s becoming a critical consideration for businesses across various sectors. For SharpLink Gaming, this strategy likely encompasses more than just holding ETH as a treasury asset. It could involve: Web3 Integration: Leveraging Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities to build new products or enhance existing services, potentially creating tokenized loyalty programs, decentralized gaming platforms, or secure data management solutions. Future-Proofing Business Models: As the digital economy evolves, companies that understand and integrate blockchain technology are better positioned to adapt and innovate, staying ahead of competitors. Attracting Talent and Innovation: Being at the forefront of digital asset adoption can make a company more attractive to top talent in the blockchain and tech sectors, fostering a culture of innovation. However, implementing such a strategy also comes with its challenges, including navigating market volatility, ensuring robust cybersecurity measures, and addressing complex accounting and tax implications. Companies must carefully weigh these factors and develop a comprehensive risk management framework. Conclusion: A Bold Bet on the Digital Future SharpLink Gaming’s latest, massive Ethereum investment is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the company’s belief in the future of digital assets and blockchain technology. This strategic ETH accumulation by a Nasdaq-listed entity highlights the accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption and the growing importance of a well-defined corporate crypto strategy in today’s evolving economic landscape. As more companies follow suit, the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized digital world will continue to blur, ushering in a new era of corporate treasury management and innovation.

48102640,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=764772,1752319855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48102640.jpeg,xAI is aiming for $200 billion valuation through a new fundraise,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/200b-xai-valuation-new-fundraising/,"xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company, is reportedly getting ready to raise more money from investors. If it succeeds, it could push its value as high as $200 billion, 10 times its valuation from early last year, according to sources in the know. The fundraising is still being discussed and could start next month, becoming the company’s third large share sale in less than two months, as it was able to secure $10 billion via loans and cash investments in July, and $300 million via the sales of shares in a secondary stock offering. Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, PIF, will play a large role in the deal If xAI is able to lock in a deal, it would cement a rapid rise in its valuation from the $18 billion set in its “Series B” fundraising in May 2024. According to three people familiar with the process, the new fundraising would target a valuation of between $170 billion and $200 billion. However, they warned that things are still in the preliminary stages, with the details subject to change. Two of the sources also alleged that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, PIF, will potentially play a large role in the deal. The PIF is known to have an indirect stake in xAI via Kingdom Holdings Company, which has invested $800 million in xAI. When xAI acquired X in March for $45 billion, the combined company was valued at $113 billion, a value that would grow to about $245 billion if the latest xAI fundraising goes through. The news of his plans to raise more money for xAI has directed interest towards it, but it is not the only Musk venture that has surged in value recently. SpaceX has as well. Reports claim the rocket and satellite group is getting ready to sell about $1 billion of its shares in a deal that would push its valuation to $400 billion. These developments are coming at a critical time for Musk after his public spat with Trump last month. Musk gets good news after public falling out with Trump All of Musk’s companies initially profited from his link to US President Donald Trump following the November election, which some argue Trump may have lost without Musk’s support. The financial aspect of Musk’s support amounted to more than $250 million for Trump’s campaign. The very public fight triggered concern among investors who expected blowback on some of his businesses. However, the current valuation of his private companies suggests investors have gotten past their initial shock and fears and are now looking past the risks of Trump targeting Musk’s empire. While their spat has cooled off, it is clear they are no longer on the same camp, with Musk even going as far as floating the launch of a third party in America to end what he sees as the tyranny of the democrats and republicans.

The move has stirred fresh excitement across the altcoin market, with rising trading volume hinting that a new altseason might be underway – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin and deliver bigger gains. With Ethereum reclaiming major technical levels and a strong new narrative building, many investors are starting to ask: Is ETH stepping into a much bigger role in the global financial system? “Blue Money” Revolution: Ethereum’s Bold Rebrand Ryan Sean Adams, founder of Mythos Capital, is one of the most vocal supporters of Ethereum’s evolving identity. In a recent post on X, he credited the community’s efforts: “The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months.” Adams’ “blue money” concept recasts Ethereum not just as infrastructure for decentralized apps , but as a yield-generating, store-of-value asset backed by a real on-chain economy. While Bitcoin is seen as digital gold and oil remains a classic store of value, ETH offers something more – security and productivity. His big idea? Ethereum has the potential to become a global reserve asset and that’s now catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The ETH community has executed blue money gospel marvelously over the past 2 months. We are emphasizing ETH the asset now. A store of value like gold, oil, and bitcoin – but backed by an economy with yield. It's made a huge difference. Keep going. ETH = world reserve asset https://t.co/e9GD4YeKNQ — RYAN SΞAN ADAMS – rsa.eth (@RyanSAdams) July 11, 2025 Breaking Out: ETH Regains Key Support Zones After weeks of moving sideways, ETH has broken through with strength, reclaiming both the 100-week and 200-week moving averages , currently sitting at $2,644 and $2,428. This kind of technical reclaim often signals that a downtrend could be over and a new bullish phase is beginning. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 12 July, 2025 , The $2,850 level has long been a major zone of resistance and support. With ETH now trading above it, analysts are eyeing the next targets at $3,300 to $3,600. If momentum holds, a push toward $4,000 is well within reach. Despite this progress, ETH is still trading about 60% below its all-time high of nearly $4,900 from November 2021, leaving plenty of room for upside if this rally continues. Ethereum’s Comeback Opportunity Since 2022, Ethereum has lagged behind Bitcoin, frustrating many holders. While BTC has hit fresh all-time highs, ETH is still playing catch-up. But that underperformance is now being seen as a potential opportunity. Adams believes the market is starting to take a fresh look at ETH. “We are emphasizing ETH, the asset now,” he wrote on X, urging the community to keep building on this momentum. If the idea of Ethereum as a reserve asset gains wider support, it could help ETH close the gap with Bitcoin and even shift the balance of power across the crypto market. Altcoins Follow Ethereum’s Lead Ethereum’s breakout is lifting the rest of the altcoin market too, with several tokens showing strong gains in its wake. This kind of broad move often signals confidence returning to riskier parts of the market and positions ETH as the trendsetter for the altcoin space. Still, the rally isn’t without risk. If ETH drops back below $2,850, the recent momentum could fade, and lower support levels may be tested again. But for now, Ethereum is leading the charge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This extraordinary request adds another layer of intrigue to a case that has already highlighted the complex and often challenging landscape of crypto regulation and enforcement, particularly concerning illicit financial activities. Who is Anatoly Legkodymov and What is Crypto Exchange Bitzlato ? Anatoly Legkodymov, a Russian citizen, was at the helm of Crypto exchange Bitzlato , a platform that found itself in the crosshairs of US authorities. In January 2023, the US Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) publicly identified Bitzlato as a “primary money laundering concern.” This designation wasn’t just a label; it pointed to serious allegations of the platform’s involvement in illicit Russian financial activities, effectively painting a picture of a crypto platform allegedly facilitating the movement of dirty money across borders. Allegations: Bitzlato was accused of processing over $700 million in illicit funds, a significant portion of which was linked to darknet markets and scam operations. Key Users: Connections to Hydra Market, a notorious darknet marketplace that was a hub for drug trafficking and money laundering before its takedown. International Operation: Despite being operated by a Russian citizen, Bitzlato served users globally, highlighting the cross-border nature of crypto transactions and the challenges for regulators. What Exactly Constitutes an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business ? Legkodymov’s legal troubles culminated in December 2023 when he pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business . This charge is significant because it underscores a fundamental principle of financial regulation: any entity facilitating the transfer of money, whether traditional or digital, must be properly licensed to ensure transparency and prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. His admission of guilt acknowledged that Bitzlato operated without the necessary licenses required by US law, making it a conduit for transactions that bypassed established financial oversight and reporting mechanisms. The sentence handed down was 18 months in prison, a term that Legkodymov had already served during his pre-trial detention. This meant that upon sentencing, he was effectively free, having spent his time behind bars awaiting trial. However, the legal saga, and its significant reputational fallout, continued to cast a long shadow over his future and the platform he once led. Why an Anatoly Legkodymov Pardon Request? The decision by Anatoly Legkodymov to seek a federal pardon from Donald Trump, as reported by the Russian state-owned news agency TASS, is highly unusual. Pardons are typically sought by individuals who believe they have been wrongfully convicted, or whose sentences are deemed overly harsh, or who seek to restore their civil rights after conviction. In Legkodymov’s case, having already served his time, the motivation for an Anatoly Legkodymov pardon might extend beyond immediate freedom. It could be an attempt to clear his name, restore his reputation, or potentially alleviate future legal or financial repercussions, such as asset forfeiture or civil penalties that might still loom. The request also highlights the political dimension that sometimes intertwines with high-profile financial crime cases, especially when a former President known for controversial pardons is involved. Trump, during his presidency, issued numerous pardons and commutations, often to individuals with political connections or those who garnered public support from his base. Whether Legkodymov’s plea will gain traction in the current political climate remains to be seen, adding an unpredictable element to this already complex legal narrative. Navigating the Labyrinth of Crypto Legal Challenges Legkodymov’s case is just one example in a growing list of crypto legal challenges facing the digital asset industry. Regulators worldwide are grappling with how to oversee a rapidly evolving technology that often operates across borders, blurring traditional jurisdictional lines. The Bitzlato case serves as a stark reminder of several critical issues that the crypto ecosystem must address: Regulatory Gaps: The inherent difficulty in applying existing financial laws, designed for traditional finance, to novel crypto business models and decentralized technologies. International Cooperation: The absolute necessity for global law enforcement agencies to collaborate seamlessly on cross-border crypto investigations, as criminals exploit jurisdictional arbitrage. Compliance Imperatives: The non-negotiable need for all crypto businesses to adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, regardless of their operational model. Consumer Protection: The significant risks posed to users when platforms operate outside established regulatory frameworks, leading to potential loss of funds or involvement in illicit activities. The US government, through agencies like FinCEN, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has been increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of illicit activities within the crypto space. This includes targeting mixers, darknet markets, and exchanges that allegedly facilitate criminal enterprises, signaling a clear shift towards stricter enforcement. The Role of FinCEN and Global Crackdowns FinCEN’s designation of Bitzlato as a “primary money laundering concern” was a powerful signal to the global financial community. Such designations allow the US Treasury to impose special measures, including prohibitions or conditions on financial institutions’ ability to open or maintain correspondent accounts for foreign banks that facilitate transactions involving the designated entity. This effectively isolates the targeted entity from the global financial system, making it incredibly difficult to operate. This isn’t an isolated incident. We’ve seen similar crackdowns globally, with authorities in various countries intensifying their efforts to combat crypto-related financial crime. The Bitzlato case involved extensive international collaboration, with law enforcement agencies from multiple countries participating in the operation that led to Legkodymov’s arrest and the dismantling of Bitzlato’s infrastructure, demonstrating a united front against crypto-enabled crime. What Does This Mean for Crypto Businesses? For legitimate crypto businesses, the Bitzlato case, and Legkodymov’s pardon request, serve as a potent warning. Operating without proper licenses or robust AML/KYC controls is a direct path to legal peril. The message from regulators is clear: innovation in crypto must not come at the expense of financial integrity and security. Companies are urged to: Prioritize Compliance: Invest heavily in legal and compliance teams, viewing them as essential rather than optional. Understand Jurisdictional Requirements: Be aware of the specific licensing and operational rules in every region they serve, as these can vary significantly. Implement Robust AML/KYC: Utilize advanced tools and processes to identify and report suspicious activities, going beyond mere checkboxes. Engage with Regulators: Foster open communication and proactive engagement with financial authorities to build trust and navigate evolving regulations. Will the Pardon Be Granted? The likelihood of an Anatoly Legkodymov pardon being granted by Donald Trump, should he return to office, is a matter of pure speculation. While Trump has a history of unconventional pardons, the specifics of this case—involving international money laundering, Russian connections, and a plea deal already served—make it a complex consideration. A pardon could be perceived in various ways, from a move against the “deep state” to an act that undermines efforts to combat financial crime. Only time will tell if this bold plea finds a sympathetic ear in the corridors of power. In conclusion, the saga of former Bitzlato CEO Anatoly Legkodymov and his unprecedented request for a presidential pardon from Donald Trump encapsulates many of the tensions and complexities within the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. From the critical need for platforms to avoid operating as an unlicensed money transmitting business to the broader spectrum of crypto legal challenges , this case serves as a powerful reminder of the global push for greater accountability and regulation in the digital asset space. As the industry matures, the spotlight on compliance and transparency will only intensify, making such high-stakes legal battles increasingly common and crucial for the future of crypto.

Is it same like Crypto Purpose? 8 Key Uses Explained Beyond Investment For many, the term “crypto” immediately brings to mind images of volatile charts and high-risk investments. While its role as an investment vehicle is significant, the true crypto purpose extends far beyond speculation. Cryptocurrency is a revolutionary technology with a multifaceted mission to reshape finance, enhance privacy, and provide access to a global digital economy. This article delves into the core functions of cryptocurrency, moving past the hype to explore its fundamental uses. From acting as a new form of money to empowering the unbanked, we will unpack the eight key purposes of crypto and also address the critical risks that every user must understand. Table of Contents What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher The Core Crypto Purpose: 8 Key Functions Unpacked Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is Cryptocurrency? A Quick Refresher Before diving into its purpose, let’s clarify what “crypto” is. Short for cryptocurrency, it’s a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (like the U.S. Dollar or the Indian Rupee), crypto operates on a decentralized system called a blockchain. Bitcoin, launched in 2009, was the first, but thousands of others, known as “altcoins,” have since been created. Each has unique features, but they all share the foundational principle of operating independently from a central bank or single authority. The Core Crypto Purpose ( crypto pur ): 8 Key Functions Unpacked Understanding the true crypto purpose requires looking at its diverse applications. Here are eight of its most important functions: 1. A Modern Medium of Exchange At its most basic level, crypto is designed to be a form of digital cash. It can be used to purchase goods and services online and, increasingly, at physical stores. This peer-to-peer system allows value to be transferred directly from one person to another without needing a bank to process the transaction. 2. A High-Growth Investment Vehicle This is the most well-known use. Many people buy cryptocurrencies hoping their value will appreciate significantly over time. While highly volatile, the potential for high returns has attracted millions of investors worldwide, making crypto a prominent, albeit risky, asset class. 3. A Tool for Global Financial Inclusion Billions of people worldwide lack access to traditional banking services. The only requirements to use crypto are an internet connection and a digital wallet. This opens the door for underserved populations to participate in the global financial system, save money, and make transactions securely. 4. Faster & Cheaper Global Transactions Traditional international bank transfers can take 3-5 business days and often involve high fees. Cryptocurrency transactions can be settled in minutes, regardless of geography, and typically at a fraction of the cost. This makes it a powerful tool for remittances and international trade. 5. Power Through Decentralization Because cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any single government or company, they offer users a degree of financial autonomy. This decentralization makes the network resistant to censorship or manipulation by a central authority, a key philosophical pillar of the crypto movement. For more on this, major financial publications like Forbes often discuss the implications of decentralization. 6. A Potential Hedge Against Inflation Some cryptocurrencies, most notably Bitcoin, have a fixed supply limit. For Bitcoin, only 21 million coins will ever exist. This scarcity leads some investors to believe it can act as a “digital gold”—a store of value that is resistant to inflation, which erodes the purchasing power of traditional, government-issued currencies. 7. Radical Transparency with Blockchain Most cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, which is a public, distributed ledger. Every transaction is recorded on this ledger and is visible to anyone. This transparency can help prevent fraud and corruption, as all movements of funds are open for public scrutiny. 8. Enhanced User Privacy While all transactions are public, the identities of the parties involved are pseudonymous—represented by a cryptographic wallet address, not personal information. This provides a layer of privacy that is often greater than traditional banking systems, where personal data is collected and stored by a central institution. Navigating the Risks: The Critical Considerations of Crypto No discussion of the crypto purpose is complete without addressing its significant risks. Before engaging with digital assets, it’s crucial to be aware of the following: Extreme Volatility: Prices can and do fluctuate dramatically in very short periods. It’s not uncommon for a cryptocurrency’s value to swing by over 10% in a single day. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments around the world are still deciding how to regulate cryptocurrencies. New laws could significantly impact their value and legality. Security Risks: If you lose your private keys (the password to your digital wallet), you lose access to your funds forever. Hacking of exchanges and scams are also prevalent threats. Environmental Impact: The “mining” process for some major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is energy-intensive and has raised significant environmental concerns. If you are considering investing, it is essential to conduct thorough research. You can [ read our detailed guide on “How to Invest in Cryptocurrency Safely” ]([Internal Link Placeholder]) to learn more. Conclusion: A Technology of Potential and Prudence The purpose of crypto is rich and varied. It is simultaneously a new financial system, an investment asset, a political statement about decentralization, and a practical tool for global transactions. Its potential to reshape our digital world is immense, but it is accompanied by equally significant risks. Understanding both sides of this powerful technology is the first step toward navigating its landscape safely and effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What is the main purpose of cryptocurrency? The main purpose of cryptocurrency is to act as a secure, decentralized digital currency that can be used for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority like a bank. It also serves as an investment asset and a tool for financial inclusion. Is crypto only for investment? No. While many people use crypto for investment, its core functions include acting as a medium of exchange for goods and services, enabling cheaper and faster international remittances, and providing financial services to those without access to traditional banks. What are the biggest risks of using crypto? The biggest risks include extreme price volatility, the potential for total loss of funds through security breaches or losing private keys, and an uncertain regulatory environment where new laws could negatively impact the market. How does crypto provide privacy? Crypto provides privacy through pseudonymity. While transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, they are tied to a cryptographic address, not a person’s real-world identity. This makes it more private than traditional banking, which requires sharing personal information. This post What is crypto pur?

Shiba Inu price, with a potential surge, could go as high as $0.000321 by 2030. With increasing volatility in the crypto market, marketers are keen on stacking some meme coins. And Shiba Inu, being the second biggest memecoin by market cap, is on the bucket list of investors and traders. What has intrigued investors is the constant rise in the burn rate of SHIB. In a recent move, the burn rate rose by over 4000% in 24 hours, eliminating 1.3 billion tokens from circulation. That’s not all, a massive 111.8 billion SHIB outflow from exchanges has led to the burning questions on every SHIB enthusiast’s mind: “Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) reach 1 cent ?” or “Will Shiba Inu go up?” or “Is Shiba Inu a good investment?” Furthermore, we’ve crafted a comprehensive Shiba Inu price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030, with all the latest metrics to address these pressing queries.

That being said, with an altcoin season, the price of SHIB could reach an annual high of $0.00006392. However, if the community drives the price with typical buying and selling pressures, SHIB could settle at an annual price of $0.0000191.

The digital asset world is buzzing with anticipation and a healthy dose of tension as Washington D.C. gears up for what’s being dubbed “Crypto Week.” This isn’t just another week in Congress; it’s a pivotal moment where the deep-seated congressional crypto divide is set to be on full display, with Republicans pushing forward a trio of significant US crypto bills aimed at shaping the future of digital asset regulation. Will this bring much-needed clarity or further deepen the chasm between the two parties? What Are the Republicans Bringing to the Table with Their US Crypto Bills ? Next week, the Republican-led House Financial Services Committee is planning to advance three key pieces of legislation. These bills represent a significant push to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the burgeoning digital asset industry, addressing areas that many in the crypto space have long argued are in dire need of definition and guidance. Let’s break down what each bill aims to achieve: The Payment Stablecoin Clarity Act (GENIUS Act): This bill aims to create a comprehensive regulatory framework specifically for payment stablecoins . The goal is to provide clarity for issuers, ensure consumer protection, and prevent illicit use, while fostering innovation in this critical segment of the crypto market. Proponents argue that clear rules for stablecoins are essential for the US to maintain its leadership in financial innovation. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21 Act) / Crypto Market Structure: Often referred to as the Crypto Market Structure bill, this legislation seeks to define the roles of various regulatory bodies, primarily the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), regarding digital assets. It aims to clarify which digital assets fall under securities laws and which are commodities, thereby providing a predictable regulatory environment for developers, exchanges, and investors. This is crucial for reducing regulatory uncertainty that has hampered growth in the US. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act: This bill reflects growing concerns among some lawmakers about the potential implications of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The legislation aims to prohibit the Fed from issuing a retail CBDC directly to individuals, citing worries about privacy, government surveillance, and the potential for a CBDC to become a tool for financial control rather than an enhancement of financial freedom. These legislative efforts highlight a Republican desire to foster innovation and provide a clear path for the crypto industry to grow within defined boundaries, believing that a proactive approach is better than reactive enforcement. Why Are Democrats Raising Alarms About the Congressional Crypto Divide ? While Republicans are keen to push their agenda, Democrats, particularly influential figures like House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters and Digital Assets Subcommittee Ranking Member Stephen Lynch, have voiced strong opposition. Their concerns are rooted in what they perceive as significant gaps in consumer protection and national security safeguards within the proposed bills. Maxine Waters has been particularly vocal, criticizing the bills for potentially aligning Congress with what she described as a “crypto scam linked to President Donald Trump.” While this specific accusation is politically charged, her broader point emphasizes a fear that current legislative proposals might not adequately shield everyday Americans from fraudulent schemes or market volatility, or that they could inadvertently legitimize questionable practices. She argues that any legislation must prioritize robust consumer safeguards to prevent financial harm. Stephen Lynch echoed these sentiments, highlighting worries about the “potential for abuse and oversight gaps” in the rapidly evolving crypto space. Democrats generally advocate for a more cautious approach, emphasizing the need for comprehensive regulatory oversight to mitigate risks such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and market manipulation. They believe that without stringent protections, the crypto market could become a breeding ground for illicit activities, posing threats to both individual investors and national financial stability. The core of this congressional crypto divide lies in a fundamental disagreement over the balance between fostering innovation and ensuring robust consumer and national security protections. Republicans often prioritize the former, arguing that over-regulation stifles growth, while Democrats lean towards the latter, emphasizing the need to prevent harm before innovation runs wild. Navigating the Future of Crypto Market Structure : What’s at Stake? The debate over crypto market structure is perhaps the most critical aspect of this legislative push. Currently, the lack of clear definitions for digital assets has led to a regulatory “wild west,” where the SEC and CFTC often battle over jurisdiction. This ambiguity creates significant challenges for crypto businesses operating in the US, leading to: Uncertainty for Innovation: Companies are hesitant to build and launch new products without knowing which regulatory body they need to satisfy, or if their product will be deemed an unregistered security years down the line. Investor Confusion: Retail investors often struggle to understand the risks associated with various digital assets when regulatory classifications are unclear. Competitive Disadvantage: The US risks falling behind other jurisdictions that have already established clearer crypto regulatory frameworks, potentially driving talent and capital overseas. The proposed legislation aims to provide this clarity, but the partisan divide makes its passage uncertain. A clear market structure could unlock significant investment and innovation, positioning the US as a leader in the digital economy. Conversely, continued stalemate could further entrench the current state of regulatory limbo, to the detriment of the industry. The Battle Over Payment Stablecoins : Stability or Surveillance? Payment stablecoins , designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, are seen by many as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. They facilitate fast, low-cost transactions and are integral to the functioning of decentralized finance (DeFi). Republicans, through the GENIUS Act, seek to establish a framework that would allow these assets to flourish under clear rules, potentially enabling their widespread adoption for everyday payments. They envision a future where stablecoins can offer efficient alternatives to traditional payment rails, benefiting consumers and businesses alike. However, the Democratic opposition often raises concerns about the stability of stablecoins, especially after events like the Terra/Luna collapse, and their potential use in illicit finance. They advocate for stringent reserve requirements, robust auditing, and strong anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) provisions to ensure that stablecoins do not pose systemic risks or become tools for criminals. The debate here is not just about financial innovation, but also about the integrity of the financial system and the balance between privacy and oversight. Understanding the Fear: The Pushback Against Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) The “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act” highlights a significant philosophical divergence regarding the role of government in financial transactions. While some see a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a natural evolution of money, offering benefits like increased efficiency, financial inclusion, and potentially lower transaction costs, others view it with extreme skepticism. Republican concerns primarily revolve around: Privacy: A retail CBDC could potentially give the government unprecedented access to and control over individual financial transactions, raising fears of a “surveillance state.” Government Control: There are worries that a CBDC could be programmed to limit spending on certain goods or services, or even to expire, giving the government undue power over personal finances. Disintermediation of Banks: A direct CBDC could bypass commercial banks, potentially disrupting the traditional financial system. This bill reflects a strong desire to protect financial privacy and limit government overreach, particularly in an era where digital footprints are constantly expanding. Democrats, while often more open to exploring CBDCs, also acknowledge the need for careful consideration of privacy and security implications, though their approach might be less outright prohibitive. What Does “Crypto Week” Mean for You? For anyone involved in or interested in cryptocurrencies, “Crypto Week” is more than just political theater; it’s a critical indicator of the direction of US digital asset policy. The outcomes, or even the debates themselves, will influence: Investment Landscape: Clarity (or lack thereof) can impact market sentiment and the flow of institutional capital. Business Operations: Crypto companies will gain insight into the regulatory hurdles or pathways they face. Consumer Protection: The extent of safeguards for retail investors will be determined. Global Competitiveness: The US’s stance will affect its position in the global race for digital asset innovation. While the immediate passage of these bills is far from guaranteed given the stark congressional crypto divide , their advancement signifies a growing recognition within Congress that the crypto industry cannot be ignored. The discussions will lay the groundwork for future legislation, shaping how digital assets are regulated, integrated, and perceived in the United States. The Road Ahead: Compromise or Continued Conflict? The upcoming “Crypto Week” will be a litmus test for the possibility of bipartisan cooperation on digital asset regulation. Given the current political climate and the deep ideological differences highlighted by the debate over US crypto bills , a quick resolution seems unlikely. However, the very act of bringing these bills to the floor forces a conversation that is long overdue. The industry, investors, and consumers alike will be watching closely. Will lawmakers find common ground to create a balanced framework that fosters innovation while protecting consumers? Or will the partisan divide continue to impede progress, leaving the US crypto landscape in a state of prolonged uncertainty? The stakes are incredibly high, and the outcome will undoubtedly shape the future of digital finance in America.

One crypto billionaire, known for turning early bets on Dogecoin and Solana into a fortune, has revealed a carefully constructed portfolio centred around five high-conviction tokens. Unlike the scattergun approach of most retail traders, this portfolio is laser-focused, aiming not only for gains but also for industry dominance. According to insiders close to the investor, two of these tokens are poised to break into the top 10 by market cap before the end of 2025. Here’s a breakdown of the five tokens shaping the next chapter of this billionaire’s crypto empire—and why two could soon join the industry’s most elite ranks. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the high-risk, high-conviction sleeper At first glance, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) might look like just another meme coin, but it’s much more. Currently in Stage 4 of its presale at $0.0013, LILPEPE is positioning itself as the first Layer-2 blockchain dedicated entirely to meme coins. LILPEPE represents the ultimate asymmetric bet for this billionaire: a small-cap with the potential to grow 500 times in two years. What sets LILPEPE apart is its infrastructure vision. It’s building a high-speed, sniper-bot-resistant chain with a native meme coin launchpad, specifically designed for the fast-paced world of microcap tokens. With confirmed listings on two major centralized exchanges at launch and hints of future listings on the world’s biggest exchange, momentum is growing fast. Why It’s in the Portfolio: While the other holdings are about preservation and steady growth, LILPEPE is the billionaire’s calculated moonshot—designed to capture the next SHIB or DOGE-style breakout before the mainstream catches on. Why It Could Enter the Top 10: If LILPEPE’s Layer-2 becomes the go-to platform for meme tokens—and the ecosystem grows accordingly—it could command billions in market cap and move from meme to infrastructure in record time. Solana (SOL): the next-gen powerhouse Solana is the first of two tokens in the portfolio that experts say will move into the top 10 or close to it by the end of 2025. Due to its unparalleled transaction processing speed, low fees, and increasing number of developers in the ecosystem, Solana is now a rival to Ethereum. What makes SOL stand out now is its ecosystem maturity. From the BONK and WIF meme coin explosion to enterprise-level DePIN and gaming integrations, Solana is evolving beyond hype. And with new ETF filings and robust validator expansion, institutional interest is growing rapidly. Why It Could Enter the Top 10: Solana is already in the top 10 by market cap. However, the billionaire expects it to rise even further, potentially reaching the top 5 as it captures the next wave of developer and user adoption. Ethereum (ETH): the long-term engine No surprise here—Ethereum remains the centrepiece of this billionaire’s portfolio. Despite market volatility, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake and its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 ecosystems make it a no-brainer for long-term holding. With upcoming scalability improvements, such as Proto-Danksharding, and continued adoption of rollups, Ethereum remains the beating heart of Web3. While ETH is already in the top 10, this investor believes it could reclaim a more substantial lead and eventually challenge Bitcoin’s dominance as utility-based use cases eclipse store-of-value narratives. Why It Stays: Ethereum is not a moonshot—it’s the foundation. Every Layer 2, DeFi protocol, and Web3 platform requires Ethereum infrastructure. Chainlink (LINK): the oracle layer for everything Chainlink is often overlooked during meme coin mania, but this investor sees LINK as critical infrastructure. As real-world assets (RWAs), DeFi and cross-chain protocols continue to expand, data integrity and oracle services become non-negotiable. Chainlink’s CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) is gaining institutional attention, and the team continues to push integrations across multiple blockchains. LINK is the quiet achiever—rarely flashy, but deeply embedded in the tech stack of Web3. Why It’s in the Portfolio: Every major protocol relies on accurate, decentralized data. Chainlink is the backbone of that service, and it’s expanding into TradFi integrations, giving it huge upside potential. Injective (INJ): the dark horse DeFi contender Rounding out the portfolio is Injective (INJ), a project that sits at the intersection of high-performance finance and decentralized infrastructure. Built on Cosmos, Injective offers low-latency, high-throughput trading for derivatives, synthetics, and other advanced DeFi instruments. The billionaire was attracted to Injective because of its focus on building tools for institutions and developers, not just retail traders. With an emphasis on composability and scalability, Injective is becoming a favorite among serious builders. Why It’s in the Portfolio: It’s a DeFi-native platform that feels like TradFi, and that hybrid positioning could drive massive adoption in the coming financial cycle. Conclusion: the strategy behind the selections This billionaire’s crypto strategy isn’t just about chasing momentum—it’s a balance between foundational infrastructure (Ethereum, Chainlink), emerging dominance (Solana, Injective), and explosive asymmetry ( Little Pepe ). While ETH and SOL anchor the portfolio with stability and upside, LILPEPE is the “next big thing” bet that could turn small capital into generational wealth. With crypto markets heating up again and macro conditions stabilising, this portfolio is well-positioned for resilience and potentially legendary gains. And if the predictions hold, Little Pepe and Solana could be the next two names added to the top 10 leaderboard by the time 2025 wraps up.

Ripple grabbed headlines again, Ethereum got a corporate boost, and the Fed may be facing a shake-up of its own. It’s a mix of regulation, big money, and even bigger signals about where the market could be headed. Here are the top stories you need to know. #1 Fed Chair Jerome Powell May Resign Jerome Powell may be preparing to step down as Chair of the Federal Reserve. Fannie Mae Chairman William Pulte said he’s “encouraged by reports” of Powell’s possible resignation, adding it would help the economy “boom.” The pressure has been building. President Trump has sharply criticised Powell’s refusal to cut rates, calling it a costly mistake, and saying he is “terrible”. Powell also faces accusations of misleading Congress over a $2.5 billion Fed renovation. Lawmakers are now calling for a formal investigation. A decision could impact both markets and crypto flows. #2 Justin Sun Commits $100M to Trump Memecoin Justin Sun plans to buy $100 million worth of Donald Trump’s memecoin, just days before a $474 million token unlock. The Tron founder made the announcement on X, calling it a step to “grow the crypto landscape with communities such as GetTrumpMemes.” The move comes as the token prepares to launch on the Tron blockchain. Sun’s history with Trump-linked projects runs deep – including over $90 million spent across earlier ventures. It’s still unclear whether the funds will come from him directly or through the Tron DAO. We are committed to buying $100M of $TRUMP ! Together, $TRUMP and #TRON are the future of Crypto. This move highlights our belief in collaborating across ecosystems to grow the crypto landscape with communities such as @GetTrumpMemes . $TRUMP on #TRON is the currency of #MAGA !… — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) July 9, 2025 #3 Ripple CEO Becomes One of Crypto’s Wealthiest Leaders Brad Garlinghouse is now among crypto’s richest figures, with an estimated net worth of $10 billion. The Ripple CEO’s equity and XRP holdings saw a sharp boost following Ripple’s partial legal win against the U.S. SEC. The company settled for $50 million – far less than the original demand. Garlinghouse, who has led Ripple since 2016, continues to push for crypto-friendly regulations and stronger global partnerships. #4 Musk Names Bitcoin in America Party Agenda Bitcoin gained fresh momentum after Elon Musk confirmed it will be part of his new America Party’s official platform. “Fiat is hopeless so yes,” he said when asked about supporting BTC, a remark that quickly pushed Bitcoin close to $110,000. Dogecoin also jumped 6%. The move follows Musk’s split from the Republican Party over Trump’s controversial $3.3 trillion tax bill. With Tesla still holding over 11,500 BTC, Musk’s stance adds new political weight to Bitcoin’s future in the U.S. #5 Japan’s Metaplanet to Use Bitcoin for Business Acquisitions Japan’s Metaplanet is entering the next phase of its Bitcoin strategy. After adding 2,205 BTC this week, the Tokyo-based company now holds 15,555 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder outside North America. Metaplanet will now use its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finance acquisitions of profitable businesses. “We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can… to reach escape velocity,” said CEO Simon Gerovich. The company has set a bold target: 210,000 BTC by 2027. #6 WazirX, Binance Face Heat as FIU Flags Terror Finance Concerns India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) is investigating Binance and WazirX over concerns that crypto transfers may be linked to cross-border terror financing. The focus is on unhosted wallets possibly connected to Pakistan, with increased activity flagged in sensitive regions like Jammu & Kashmir. Binance is cooperating with authorities, a year after settling a ₹18 crore penalty to resume operations in India. WazirX is also under scrutiny, with an upcoming Singapore court hearing and claims that TRX tokens may have been used to fund ISIS-linked activity. #7 Ripple Picks Top U.S. Bank to Strengthen RLUSD Trust Ripple has partnered with BNY Mellon to custody reserves for its stablecoin, RLUSD – a move that boosts regulatory credibility and institutional trust. The announcement came as RLUSD crosses a $500 million market cap just seven months after launch. BNY Mellon will handle reserve assets like cash and U.S. Treasuries. “We are thrilled to support the growth and adoption of RLUSD,” said BNY Mellon’s Emily Portney. Ripple is also pursuing a U.S. banking charter and Fed master account. #8 Nasdaq Firm Goes All-In on Ethereum, Dumps BTC Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has sold off all 280 of its Bitcoin to build a massive Ethereum treasury. After raising $172 million in a public offering, the company now holds over 100,600 ETH, aiming to become the largest corporate holder of Ether. CEO Sam Tabar said the move reflects Ethereum’s long-term value, citing smart contracts and staking rewards. Bit Digital’s stock jumped nearly 18%, as markets responded to the strategy. #9 TON’s Viral Golden Visa Pitch Got Denied by UAE Toncoin surged nearly 12% after TON Foundation’s CEO claimed that staking $100,000 worth of the token could get investors a UAE Golden Visa. But UAE authorities quickly denied it. The country’s top regulators – ICP, SCA, and VARA – issued a joint statement calling the claim false, clarifying that TON is not licensed or approved in Dubai. No such visa route exists for crypto investors. #10 Tokenized Securities Still Count as Securities, Says SEC SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” has warned that tokenizing assets doesn’t change their legal status. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she said. Her comments come amid rising interest in blockchain-based stocks, with firms like Coinbase seeking approval to offer tokenized equities. Peirce also flagged risks tied to third-party tokens, saying buyers could face added legal and financial uncertainty. In the Spotlight Here’s a few quick hits you shouldn’t miss!

While speculators chase quick wins on SOL-based tokens, seasoned investors are asking a deeper question: what is the best crypto to buy now when the market feels one headline away from a blow-off top? Many keep pointing to Remittix , the PayFi newcomer that has already moved more than sixteen million dollars in early funding and now trades at just $0.0811. Solana steals the show in the meme-coin arena Source: TradingView “Solana, Solana, Solana,” chanted a live-stream host as real-time data showed futures volume spiking to eight billion dollars, ETF inflows nudging eighty million and DeFi Development Corp purchasing another 153,225 SOL for its staking plan. This surge pulls on three levers at once: low gas fee crypto transfers, rising institutional interest, and retailers hunting the next 100x crypto during meme-season. Analysts note that Solana’s real-world asset realm is up to four-hundred-eighteen million in value, its user base has grown six-hundred percent and its NFT floors are climbing again. Quick SOL metrics: Futures open interest above four billion signals high growth crypto appetite ETF approval odds improving, pushing fresh capital into centralized exchanges On-chain speed plus rising TVL crown Solana as a leading Layer 2 Ethereum alternative Meme-coin mania returns but where is the smart money going? Shiba-themed tokens and quirky frogs might top today’s trending list, yet on-chain watchers spot whales rotating some gains into lower-cap plays. A flood of Reddit threads asks for the best crypto presale 2025 or a top crypto under $1 that still carries real utility. The consensus is that buying Solana after such a vertical move could be risky short term, so many are studying upcoming crypto projects with smaller market caps and strong fundamentals. Remittix: Best Crypto Presale of 2025 or Real-World Payment Game Changer? Remittix is not another meme play, it is building a cross-chain DeFi project that lets users move Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins straight into fiat bank accounts within minutes. Developers confirmed this week that Solana support will be added at wallet launch, giving RTX holders exposure to both ecosystems. Early buyers can buy RTX tokens on the project site and insiders whisper that secondary listings on centralized exchanges are already in discussion. Key reasons veterans call Remittix the best crypto to buy now: Real-world utility crypto: targets the 190-trillion-dollar market of payments in the world Low cap crypto gems appeal: sub-one-dollar price leaves room for upside Passive income potential: staking module teased for Q4 release Cross-chain rails planned for Polygon and BNB Smart Chain, widening reach Could RTX outshine Solana’s meme frenzy? Solana headlines grab clicks, but valuation matters. Many view Remittix as an undervalued ticket to the same payment narrative that lifted XRP and XLM. If the team hits its roadmap, RTX could ride high once risk-on sentiment rotates to fresh catalysts. The sprint toward eighteen million dollars implies strong community traction and social sentiment trackers show RTX trending above other low gas fee crypto names. For traders deciding on the best crypto to buy now, diversifying some gains from a hot Solana run into Remittix may be the balanced play heading into August.

In a video shared on X, Brewer emphasized that XRP is not merely a digital asset; it is the foundation of a coming financial revolution. His message comes as XRP trades at $2.84, having gained over 30% in the past 10 days, outperforming much of the altcoin market and even outpacing Bitcoin’s recent growth. With Bitcoin currently at $118,500.16, investor attention is once again shifting toward Ripple’s ecosystem. XRP’s Role in the New Financial System According to Brewer, the global financial structure is on the brink of transformation, with XRP playing a pivotal role in this shift. He argues that the legacy financial system, built on fiat currency and central bank control, is being phased out in favor of a tokenized, blockchain-driven future. XRP- Holders listen very carefully! This is bigger than you! DO NOT SELL! pic.twitter.com/IQpntaVfry — Sidney M Brewer (@SidneyMBrewer) July 11, 2025 “Cash is not king,” Brewer asserted. “Your promissory notes aren’t worth the paper or plastic they’re printed on. What’s coming down the pipeline is XRP.” Brewer claims his network of private banking institutions across Canada and the U.S. has spent the last two years preparing for this shift, establishing Special Purpose Corporations (SPCs) and private loan trust companies. Their goal is to create a parallel financial system that enables interest-free loans, replaces debt-based financing, and allows for the tokenization of assets on the blockchain. Why Selling XRP Could Be a Critical Mistake Brewer’s central message is a clear and urgent warning: under no circumstances should holders sell their XRP . He argues that doing so not only weakens the position of the XRP community but also hands control of the asset back to the very financial powers that have perpetuated global debt systems. “There are two sides to this game,” he explained. “On one side are the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and traditional central banks. On the other hand, our side is building a system to empower people. If you sell your XRP, you’re giving them control.” He urged every XRP holder to store a minimum of 10,000 XRP units in cold storage, insisting that those who do will be “grandfathered” into a new private trust system that allows for strategic leveraging of XRP without selling it. Brewer believes XRP should be used as collateral to access liquidity, rather than being cashed out for short-term gains. Education, Tokenization, and Long-Term Wealth Brewer highlighted the importance of education in this new economic era. He criticized retail investors for chasing profits without understanding the long-term implications of their actions. “They’ll think they’re rich, buy houses and cars, then get slammed with taxes and regret,” he said. “They don’t know how to play the game.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Brewer advocates for asset tokenization, where homes, businesses, and other assets are converted into digital tokens as a means to preserve and grow wealth. This approach would allow individuals to access value without selling assets, thereby avoiding traditional finance’s debt traps. A Warning for the Impatient As XRP approaches the critical $3.00 resistance level, Brewer warned that many will panic sell during short-term price spikes, only to lose out on the full potential of what’s to come. “You’re going to panic when it jumps a couple of bucks,” he said. “ But if you sell now, you’ll miss the transfer of wealth that’s coming, and your children will pay the price. ” With thousands of new millionaires expected to emerge in the coming weeks, Brewer’s final advice is resolute: “Even if you get a letter from God signed by Jesus and approved by Moses, do not sell. Hold your XRP outside the system. We got this.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The Core Team posted a video yesterday explaining a few of those that might have stayed under the radar. Pi App Studio is one attempt to attain a vision shared by many technologists: a world where anyone can create and run apps using human languages, not code, without needing a technical background. Read the full Pi2Day blog to learn more https://t.co/rMc0MPu9tT — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) June 29, 2025 New Node Versions Beyond the launch of Pi App Studio, which aims to bridge the two worlds of AI and Pi Network, the Core Team decided to reiterate on what the Node’s latest versions are, which also arrived on and after Pi2Day. In the video , they explained that the key update in version 0.5.2, which was released on June 28, involved a rename: Pi Node was changed to Pi Desktop. It was followed shortly by 0.5.3, which fixed a few bugs and included Pi Node, Pi mining app, and certain utilities like the aforementioned Pi App Studio. According to the team, this change was needed for the app to become more accurate, easy to use, and open to future integrations into different devices like mobile and desktop. Pioneers (users, developers, and everyone in between in the Pi Network ecosystem) were advised to download the new Pi Desktop version and “take advantage of these additions.” The video reiterated that users who run Pi Nodes will continue to receive mining rewards since running Nodes helps the protocol’s security, decentralization, and longevity. PI’s Price Update Despite these updates, the release of new versions, and the launch of innovative products, Pi Network’s native token continues to struggle. In fact, even the overall market resurgence in the last several days couldn’t really propel a notable price surge for PI. In times when BTC charted a new all-time high, while altcoins like XLM , XRP , HYPE, and others are posting double-digit gains, PI is down by over 4% in the past day. Its rally from under $0.45 to over $0.52 was quickly halted, and the asset was pushed south to under $0.47, which is essentially the same level as last week. According to certain users, this sluggish price performance is due to several factors, including low liquidity, concerns over centralization, weak investor confidence, and worrying token unlocks.

While the foundation is mostly complete, the ecosystem still isn’t ready to fully support large-scale DApp use or economic activity. At the same time, many users are frustrated by delays in KYC approvals, migrations, and promised rewards. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Dr Altcoin believes these delays might be part of a bigger plan to protect Pi’s future. Real Reason for the Hold-Up According to Dr Altcoin , the Pi Core Team (PCT) has finished most of the groundwork needed to run the network. It took them over six years to reach this point, but the project is not yet fully ready to handle large-scale DApps or true peer-to-peer transactions at a larger scale. Another important factor is the so-called “price discovery phase.” Right now, Pi Coin is still finding its true market price. The price has fallen from around $3 down to as low as $0.40 . Meanwhile, Dr Altcoin says the Pi Core Team wants to see Pi trading above $10 before allowing full peer-to-peer use. Until that happens, they’re holding off to avoid a market crash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Pi Network Coin Price is Dropping , Strategic Delay to Prevent Mass Selling It’s no secret that many people are holding onto Pi just because of pending rewards, KYC approvals, and migration. If all those coins were released today, a huge number of users might immediately sell, causing a big drop in price and weakening the community. By delaying these, the team is buying time for Pi’s value to grow stronger. Dr Altcoin even hints that long-term token locking or burning some coins might be used in the future to push the price up. Playing the Long Game However, Dr Altcoin suggests that he’s focusing on the long run, believing Pi’s big promise will be worth it. If the plan works, the network could reach real peer-to-peer utility, stronger prices, and maybe help loyal holders achieve financial freedom. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Dr. Altcoin, the Pi Core Team (PCT) has completed the network’s foundation but is delaying full DApp and peer-to-peer functionality because the ecosystem isn’t ready for large-scale use and Pi Coin hasn’t reached its target “price discovery phase” of over $10. What is the long-term vision for Pi Network? Dr. Altcoin believes the long-term plan aims for Pi Network to achieve real peer-to-peer utility, stronger prices, and potentially help loyal holders achieve financial freedom. Future strategies might include long-term token locking or burning. Is Pi coin a good investment?

The prominent altcoin, which is tipped to be a major player in a potential altseason, has maintained a remarkable price performance in the present market cycle rising by 352.04% in the last year alone. Based on technical indicators, renowned market analyst Ted Pillows postulates SUI may be gearing up for parabolic rally following recent market gains. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Through 50EMA After Rejection, ETH Dominance Sees Resurgence SUI Market Structure Signals Potential Breakout In an X post on July 11, Ted Pillows shares an insightful price analysis on the SUI market identifying a series of technical signals that precedes explosive market gains. These include a well-defined price movement within a well-defined ascending channel on the weekly timeframe, combined with an imminent bullish MACD crossover. In analyzing the ascending price channel, SUI has shown a strict adherence to both resistance and support zones. Notably, a healthy correction from its previous highs near $5.00 resulted in the altcoin finding support around $2.50 before initiating another rebound. As the altcoin presently consolidates, historical data indicates a potential return to the channel upper’s boundary between $10.50 and $13.00. However, the major strength in Pillows’ bullish thesis is the MACD setup that shows an impending bullish crossover i.e. when the MACD line (white) crosses above the signal line (orange), often interpreted by traders as an early sign of trend reversal or strengthening bullish momentum. Historically, the last time a decisive bullish MACD cross occurred on the weekly chart, it induced a six-month rally that delivered over 400% in gains. Going by this precedent, SUI bulls may be eying a potential price target of $13.76 by end of 2025. Related Reading: SUI Explodes Higher, Climbing Above 20-Day MA — But Can The Rally Hold? SUI Market Overview At the time of writing, SUI trades at $3.42 reflecting a 1.16% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the market trading volume is up by 17.68% and valued at $1.95 billion. On a monthly scale, SUI has recorded a marginal loss of 0.11%, suggesting that bearish forces still maintain a subtle grip on the market. Nevertheless, data from CoinMarketCap shows the Sui community remains bullish on the altcoin’s future. Contributors to this market optimism includes the potential of SUI spot ETF following applications by prominent asset managers such as Grayscale, Canary Capital and 21 Shares. Meanwhile, the potential of an altseason remains valid amidst continuous speculations by market analysts.

The digital asset market is once again capturing headlines, and a key indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has just sent a powerful signal. Surging to a striking 79, this crucial metric has officially entered the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone. What does this dramatic shift mean for your portfolio, and more importantly, for the future trajectory of the crypto landscape? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, serves as a fascinating barometer for the prevailing mood in the cryptocurrency market. It’s designed to give investors a quick snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful or excessively greedy. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 denotes ‘Extreme Greed’, this index provides invaluable insights into collective investor psychology. Think of it as a temperature gauge for the market. When the needle points towards ‘Fear’, it often suggests that prices are low and potentially represent buying opportunities for the brave. Conversely, a move into ‘Greed’ or ‘Extreme Greed’ can indicate that the market might be overheated, possibly signaling a time for caution or profit-taking. The recent jump to 79, up eight points from the previous day, is a significant shift that demands our attention. How is This Powerful Index Calculated? The accuracy and relevance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stem from its sophisticated methodology, which aggregates data from six distinct market factors. Each factor contributes a specific weight to the overall score, ensuring a holistic view of market sentiment. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market, but rapid upward swings can also contribute to greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volumes and strong positive momentum typically signal a greedy market. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A high volume of positive sentiment and engagement often correlates with rising greed. Surveys (15%): Historically, Alternative conducted weekly polls to gauge investor sentiment. However, it’s important to note that this factor is currently paused. When active, it provided direct insights into what individual investors were thinking. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is a key indicator. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be flocking to the perceived safety of BTC during uncertain times. Conversely, a falling dominance, with altcoins gaining traction, might indicate a more speculative, greedy market. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “best altcoins to buy” could signal growing greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index provides a nuanced perspective on the collective psyche of crypto investors, helping to explain the current shift towards Extreme Greed . The Surge to Extreme Greed: What Does 79 Mean? A score of 79 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory. This is a significant psychological milestone. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections or significant price pullbacks. It suggests that investors are becoming overly optimistic, potentially leading to irrational exuberance and speculative buying. When the market is gripped by Extreme Greed , it’s common to see phenomena such as: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): New investors, or those who have been on the sidelines, jump into the market, fearing they will miss out on further gains. High Leverage Trading: Traders take on increased risk, using borrowed funds to amplify their positions, betting on continued upward momentum. Ignoring Fundamentals: Less attention is paid to the underlying technology, adoption, or economic realities, with focus solely on price action. Rapid Price Increases: Assets, especially altcoins, can experience parabolic price movements, driven by speculative fervor rather than intrinsic value. While the immediate feeling might be euphoric, seasoned investors often view ‘Extreme Greed’ as a cautionary signal. It’s a time to review portfolios, consider taking profits, and prepare for potential shifts in the market dynamic. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: Why It’s Crucial for Your Strategy Understanding crypto market sentiment is paramount for any investor navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Unlike traditional markets, cryptocurrencies are heavily influenced by psychological factors due to their relatively nascent stage and decentralized nature. The collective mood of participants can dictate short-term price movements more than fundamental analysis alone. When sentiment shifts from fear to greed, it typically fuels upward price momentum. Positive news, regulatory clarity, or even influential tweets can quickly turn the tide. Conversely, negative news, security breaches, or major sell-offs can plunge the market into fear. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a quantitative measure of this often-qualitative aspect, allowing investors to objectively assess the prevailing mood. Key aspects of market sentiment: Contrarian Indicator: Many use the index as a contrarian indicator: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” A high ‘Extreme Greed’ reading might suggest it’s time to be cautious. Market Cycles: Sentiment often moves in cycles, from despair to hope, then optimism, and finally euphoria (greed), followed by complacency, anxiety, denial, and panic (fear). Recognizing where the market is in this cycle can inform investment decisions. Impact on Adoption: Positive sentiment can attract new users and institutional investors, driving further adoption and potentially long-term growth. By closely monitoring crypto market sentiment , investors can avoid making emotional decisions and instead align their strategies with a more informed understanding of market psychology. The Impact on Bitcoin Price and Beyond: What’s Next? The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 79 has direct implications for the Bitcoin price and the broader altcoin market. As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin often sets the tone for the entire ecosystem. When the market enters ‘Extreme Greed’, Bitcoin typically experiences significant price pumps, attracting new capital and reinforcing the bullish narrative. For Bitcoin: Potential for Continued Upside: The immediate effect might be continued price appreciation as FOMO kicks in. Increased Volatility: While prices rise, volatility can also increase, leading to sharp corrections as traders take profits. Liquidation Risks: High leverage in a greedy market can lead to cascading liquidations if a sudden downturn occurs, amplifying price drops. For Altcoins: “Altcoin Season” Potential: When Bitcoin performs well, capital often flows into altcoins, leading to even more explosive gains for smaller cap assets. This is often a characteristic of an ‘Extreme Greed’ phase. Higher Risk/Reward: While altcoins offer higher potential returns during such periods, they also carry significantly higher risks due to their lower liquidity and greater sensitivity to market sentiment shifts. It’s crucial for investors to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. While ‘Extreme Greed’ can signal exciting times, it also calls for a disciplined approach to risk management, especially concerning your exposure to the Bitcoin price and other digital assets. Navigating Market Volatility: Strategies for Extreme Greed In a market defined by ‘Extreme Greed’ and surging market volatility , adopting a strategic approach is more critical than ever. While the allure of quick gains is strong, uncontrolled enthusiasm can lead to significant losses if the market suddenly reverses course. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these choppy waters: Don’t Chase Pumps: Resist the urge to buy into assets that have already experienced parabolic rises. These often lead to “bag holding” when corrections occur. Take Partial Profits: If your portfolio has seen significant gains, consider taking some profits off the table. This could mean selling a portion of your holdings to secure initial investment or a percentage of your gains. Reinvesting these profits into less volatile assets or stablecoins can be a wise move. Rebalance Your Portfolio: As some assets surge, they might disproportionately increase their weight in your portfolio. Rebalancing by selling some of the outperformers and reallocating to underperformers (or simply reducing overall exposure) can help maintain your desired risk level. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can limit potential losses if the market turns. This is particularly important in high-volatility environments. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on social media hype. Understand the fundamentals of the projects you invest in. During ‘Extreme Greed’, many low-quality projects can pump alongside legitimate ones. Maintain a Cash Position: Having some stablecoin or fiat reserves allows you to capitalize on potential dips or corrections, which are common even in bull markets. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between your long-term investment strategy and any short-term trading activities. Don’t let short-term greed compromise your long-term goals. Managing market volatility during periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ is about balancing optimism with prudence. It’s about being prepared for both continued upside and potential downturns. Benefits and Challenges of a High Greed Environment The current state of ‘Extreme Greed’, as indicated by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 79, presents both exciting opportunities and significant risks for investors. Understanding these dual aspects is key to making informed decisions. Benefits: Profit Potential: The most obvious benefit is the potential for rapid and substantial gains. Assets can appreciate quickly as more capital flows into the market. Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and increased participation mean better liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell assets. Innovation and Adoption: Bull markets often spur greater interest in the underlying technology, attracting talent and fostering innovation within the crypto space. Mainstream Attention: High prices and positive sentiment draw mainstream media attention, which can further accelerate adoption and understanding of cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Risk of Correction: The primary challenge is the heightened risk of a sharp market correction. When everyone is greedy, there are fewer buyers left, and a small trigger can lead to a significant sell-off. Irrational Exuberance: Investors may make decisions based on emotion rather than sound analysis, leading to poor investment choices in speculative assets. Scams and Rug Pulls: Periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ often see a proliferation of scams and fraudulent projects looking to capitalize on investor FOMO. Difficulty in Entry/Exit: For new investors, entering at peak greed can mean buying at inflated prices. For existing holders, knowing when to exit can be challenging due to the psychological pull of continued gains. Market Volatility: While opportunities exist, the inherent market volatility can lead to significant swings, requiring strong emotional discipline. Navigating this environment requires a balanced perspective, acknowledging the upside while remaining acutely aware of the inherent risks that come with pervasive Extreme Greed . Conclusion: Riding the Wave with Caution The surge of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 79, placing the market firmly in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone, is a clear signal that optimism is currently at an all-time high. This improved crypto market sentiment has undeniably fueled the recent rally in Bitcoin price and the broader altcoin market, creating exciting opportunities for many. However, history has shown us that periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ are often inflection points. While the current momentum is strong, it’s also a time when market volatility can be at its peak, and irrational decisions are more likely to occur. As an investor, your goal should be to leverage the positive sentiment while safeguarding against potential downturns. By understanding how the index is calculated, recognizing the psychological drivers behind ‘Extreme Greed’, and implementing disciplined strategies like profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing, you can navigate this thrilling yet precarious phase of the crypto market with greater confidence. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always prioritize risk management. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

What is the Ethereum Foundation, and Why Does it Hold Such Significant ETH? The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in funding research, development, and community initiatives that drive the innovation of the Ethereum blockchain. As a foundational entity, the Foundation holds a significant treasury of ETH, primarily acquired during the network’s initial crowdsale or through subsequent contributions and grants. These holdings are essential for sustaining its operations, funding critical projects, and ensuring the long-term health and decentralization of the Ethereum network. Unlike a traditional company, the Ethereum Foundation’s treasury management is often under scrutiny, as its actions can be interpreted as signals for the broader market. Their sales are typically conducted to cover operational expenses, fund grants for developers, or strategically diversify their assets. Transparency around these movements is key to maintaining community trust. Unpacking the Specifics of the Recent ETH Sale Details According to Onchain Lens, a prominent on-chain analytics provider on X, a wallet associated with the Ethereum Foundation recently executed a substantial ETH sale . The initial reported transaction involved the sale of 1,206.7 ETH for 3.61 million USDC. However, further tracking revealed that this was part of a larger divestment, with the wallet offloading a total of 2,416.7 ETH over the past 24 hours, cumulatively valued at approximately $7.1 million. This scale of transaction is significant and warrants closer examination. Such large sales from entities like the Ethereum Foundation are often planned and executed with specific goals in mind. They are not typically spontaneous reactions to market volatility but rather calculated moves as part of their broader digital asset management strategy. The use of USDC, a stablecoin, indicates a clear intention to convert ETH into a less volatile asset, likely for operational expenses or future strategic investments. Key Figures of the Sale: Total ETH Sold: 2,416.7 ETH Total Value (Approx.): $7.1 million USD Recipient Stablecoin: USDC Source: Wallet linked to Ethereum Foundation Timeframe: Within 24 hours What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact of Such a Sale? Any large ETH sale from a prominent entity like the Ethereum Foundation can naturally cause ripples in the market. The immediate concern for many investors is whether such a sale could trigger a downward price movement due to increased supply. While $7.1 million is a substantial sum, it’s crucial to put it into perspective relative to Ethereum’s multi-billion dollar market capitalization and daily trading volume. In a highly liquid market, this amount might be absorbed without significant long-term price depreciation. However, the psychological crypto market impact can be more pronounced. News of a major holder selling can sometimes induce “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD) among retail investors, leading to panic selling. Conversely, more informed investors might view it as a routine treasury management activity, especially if the funds are earmarked for ecosystem development, which ultimately strengthens Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Possible reasons for the sale and their market implications: Operational Expenses: The Foundation requires fiat or stablecoins to pay salaries, fund grants, and cover administrative costs. This is a normal part of running any organization. Diversification: Strategic diversification of assets to manage risk, especially given the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Funding Initiatives: Proceeds might be allocated to new research, development projects, or community events that require stable funding. Ultimately, the long-term crypto market impact depends less on the sale itself and more on the Foundation’s overall transparency and the productive use of the generated funds. How Does On-Chain Data Empower Us to Track Such Movements? The ability to track the ETH sale from the Ethereum Foundation wallet is a testament to the power of on-chain data . Unlike traditional financial markets where large institutional movements can remain opaque, blockchain technology provides unparalleled transparency. Every transaction, including the movement of ETH from one address to another, is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. On-chain analytics platforms, like Onchain Lens mentioned in the report, specialize in interpreting this vast amount of raw data. They identify patterns, link addresses to known entities (where possible and publicly disclosed), and provide insights into market dynamics. This transparency is a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ethos, allowing anyone with the right tools to verify claims and understand market flows. Key benefits of leveraging on-chain data: Transparency: See exactly where funds are moving, when, and in what quantities. Market Intelligence: Gain insights into whale movements, institutional activity, and exchange flows. Risk Management: Identify potential market shocks or accumulation/distribution phases. Accountability: Hold entities accountable for their public statements regarding their holdings. This level of open information empowers investors to make more informed decisions, moving beyond mere speculation based on news headlines to data-driven analysis. What Are the Challenges in Digital Asset Management for Large Organizations? Managing substantial cryptocurrency holdings, like those of the Ethereum Foundation , presents unique challenges compared to traditional finance. Effective digital asset management involves a complex interplay of security, compliance, liquidity, and strategic allocation. For an organization responsible for the well-being of an entire ecosystem, these challenges are amplified. Key aspects of managing large digital asset portfolios: Security: Protecting multi-million dollar crypto holdings from hacks, phishing attempts, and insider threats requires robust security protocols, multi-signature wallets, and cold storage solutions. Liquidity: Executing large sales without causing significant market disruption requires careful planning and often involves over-the-counter (OTC) desks or strategic timing on exchanges to ensure optimal execution prices. Compliance & Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto landscape evolves, organizations must navigate complex and often ambiguous regulatory frameworks related to digital assets, taxation, and financial reporting. Treasury Strategy: Deciding when to sell, what to sell into (stablecoins vs. fiat), and how to allocate funds requires a sophisticated treasury strategy that balances long-term ecosystem needs with short-term operational demands. Public Perception: Every major transaction is scrutinized by the community. Maintaining transparency and clearly communicating the rationale behind sales is vital for public trust and mitigating negative sentiment. The recent ETH sale highlights the Foundation’s ongoing efforts in navigating these intricate aspects of digital asset management to ensure the continued growth and stability of the Ethereum network. The recent $7.1 million ETH sale by a wallet linked to the Ethereum Foundation is more than just a transaction; it’s a window into the sophisticated world of institutional digital asset management and the transparent nature of blockchain technology. While such sales can momentarily capture headlines and spark discussions about immediate crypto market impact , understanding the underlying motivations – typically operational funding and strategic diversification – is crucial. The power of on-chain data allows the community to verify these movements, fostering a level of transparency rarely seen in traditional finance. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, the Foundation’s strategic financial decisions will remain vital for its sustainability and growth. This event serves as a reminder that even foundational entities engage in routine financial activities, and these activities, when viewed through the lens of data, can offer valuable insights into the health and direction of the broader crypto market.

Among the most widely discussed are MAGACOIN FINANCE , Shiba Inu (SHIB) , Chainlink (LINK) , and Solana (SOL) . Each brings distinct narratives, evolving technical roadmaps, and community-driven dynamics that could shape their roles in the next phase of market growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Different Take on Meme Coins With Community Control MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out in the current altcoin landscape by combining meme-level visibility with a political and governance-focused framework. Billing itself as a meme-powered altcoin and decentralized political memecoin , the project merges the cultural appeal typical of meme assets with structures that allow direct community participation in guiding future decisions. Its zero-tax model supports frictionless trading, while its ideological positioning continues to draw comparisons to governance-driven ecosystems such as Cardano. As a result, MAGACOIN FINANCE is frequently highlighted among early-stage crypto projects that blend viral potential with substantive community oversight , a mix that could help it attract outsized attention when the market cycle shifts. Shiba Inu: Privacy Upgrades and Expanding Layer 2 Network Shiba Inu has steadily evolved beyond its initial meme reputation. Its Layer 2 network, Shibarium, now integrates fully homomorphic encryption, enhancing privacy by allowing secure computations directly on encrypted data. This upgrade underscores the project’s push into broader utility, while its ecosystem continues to diversify through decentralized exchange platforms, metaverse land developments, and ecosystem tokens such as BONE and LEASH. Regular community-led token burns and active large holders add to the narrative that Shiba Inu could remain prominent when renewed market flows return. Chainlink: Strengthening as DeFi’s Core Data Provider Chainlink maintains its position as the leading decentralized oracle network, critical to bringing off-chain data into on-chain smart contracts across DeFi, insurance, and emerging blockchain-based services. Its continued rollout of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) highlights a strategic push to connect disparate blockchain ecosystems, further anchoring its status within multi-chain environments. This role as foundational infrastructure continues to keep Chainlink on the radar of investors tracking assets that could be among the first to rebound alongside broader DeFi activity. Solana: Targeting Near-Instant Transaction Settlement Solana is preparing for major protocol improvements through its upcoming Alpenglow upgrade, aimed at reducing transaction finality to near real-time speeds. This could bolster Solana’s suitability for latency-sensitive applications like algorithmic trading, gaming, and advanced financial platforms. At the same time, institutional interest continues to rise with the launch of dedicated Solana staking investment vehicles, reinforcing its profile as a scalable Layer 1 platform ready to support enterprise-grade use cases. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Shouldn’t Be Overlooked While many investors remain focused on established names like Shiba Inu, Chainlink, and Solana, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing increased attention for its combination of meme-driven momentum and community-first governance. As a project explicitly designed to give holders influence over future direction, paired with a zero-tax structure that simplifies participation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a unique candidate among altcoins frequently mentioned on watchlists for the next market rotation. For those looking to position early in projects that merge cultural relevance with more deliberate decentralized frameworks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a development that market participants may not want to miss as sentiment begins to turn.

As of Saturday, July 12, 2025, the interbank exchange rate stands at approximately PKR 284.46 for one US Dollar. This figure, however, is more than just a number; it represents the complex interplay of global and domestic factors that have a direct and profound impact on the wallets of everyday Pakistanis and the health of the nation’s economy. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the USD to PKR rate, exploring the key drivers behind its fluctuations, its historical context, and the significant effects it has on imports, exports, and inflation in Pakistan. What is the Current USD to PKR Rate? The exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Pakistani Rupee is dynamic, changing daily based on activity in the foreign exchange market. The rate is primarily determined by supply and demand. Interbank Rate: This is the rate at which banks trade currencies with each other. As of July 12, 2025, it is around PKR 284.46 / $1 . Open Market Rate: This is the rate available to the general public through currency exchange companies. It is often slightly higher than the interbank rate and can be found at approximately PKR 284.60 (buying) / PKR 286.80 (selling) . Minor daily fluctuations are normal, but significant trends in the USD to PKR rate are driven by deeper economic forces. Key Factors That Influence the USD to PKR Exchange Rate The value of the Pakistani Rupee against the US Dollar is not arbitrary. It is influenced by a combination of several powerful economic factors: Current Account Balance: This is the difference between a country’s imports and exports. Pakistan has historically run a current account deficit, meaning it imports more than it exports. This increases the demand for US dollars to pay for imports, putting downward pressure on the rupee. Foreign Exchange Reserves: These are reserves of foreign currency held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Healthy reserves provide a buffer to manage the currency’s value. Low reserves weaken the SBP’s ability to support the rupee, causing it to depreciate. Inflation Rates: A higher inflation rate in Pakistan compared to the US erodes the purchasing power of the rupee, causing its value to fall relative to the dollar. Interest Rates: The SBP sets the key policy rate. Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment (inflows of USD), which strengthens the rupee. Conversely, lower rates can have the opposite effect. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Remittances: Inflows of foreign investment and remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis are a major source of US dollars. Strong inflows support the rupee’s value. Political and Economic Stability: Uncertainty and instability can deter foreign investors and lead to capital flight, increasing demand for dollars and weakening the rupee. The Economic Impact of the USD to PKR Rate on Pakistan The fluctuation of the USD to PKR rate has far-reaching consequences for the Pakistani economy: Impact on Imports: When the rupee depreciates (the USD becomes more expensive), the cost of importing essential goods like fuel, edible oil, machinery, and raw materials rises. This directly translates to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Impact on Exports: A weaker rupee makes Pakistani exports cheaper and more competitive in the international market. This can boost export volumes and help earn more foreign currency. Inflationary Pressure: As the cost of imported goods (especially fuel) increases due to a weaker rupee, it leads to cost-push inflation, raising the prices of transportation, food, and utilities for everyone. External Debt: Pakistan’s external debt is denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the US dollar. When the rupee depreciates, the value of this debt in rupee terms increases, making it more expensive for the government to service. For more detailed analysis, reports from institutions like the World Bank on Pakistan’s economy provide valuable insights. A Brief History of the Rupee’s Fluctuation Historically, the Pakistani Rupee has seen significant depreciation against the US Dollar. In the early 2000s, the rate was below PKR 60 to a dollar. Over the past two decades, due to persistent economic challenges, including trade deficits and growing external debt, the rupee has steadily lost value, crossing the 100, 200, and now approaching the 300 mark. The Role of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is the central bank responsible for managing the country’s monetary policy and foreign exchange reserves. While Pakistan officially operates under a flexible, market-determined exchange rate system, the SBP can intervene in the market to smooth out excessive volatility. It does this by buying or selling US dollars from its reserves to influence the supply-demand dynamic. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What does a higher USD to PKR rate mean? A higher USD to PKR rate means the Pakistani Rupee has depreciated or weakened. It takes more rupees to buy one US dollar. This makes imports more expensive but can make Pakistani exports cheaper for foreign buyers. Why is the US Dollar so important for Pakistan’s economy? The US Dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency. International trade, particularly for key commodities like oil, is conducted in US dollars. Therefore, Pakistan needs a stable supply of dollars to pay for its imports and service its foreign debt. How can the USD to PKR rate be stabilized? Stabilizing the exchange rate requires long-term structural reforms. This includes increasing exports, attracting more foreign direct investment, boosting remittances through official channels, and managing the country’s trade deficit and fiscal policies effectively. Where can I find the official USD to PKR rate? The official interbank rate is published daily by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Reputable financial news outlets and currency exchange websites also provide up-to-date open market and interbank rates.

The notion of Bitcoin hitting half a million dollars might seem extraordinary, yet it’s a figure gaining traction among seasoned analysts. A significant Bitcoin price prediction comes from anonymous crypto analyst apsk32, who points to BTC’s current position relative to its long-term power curve trendline. This mathematical model is crucial because it tracks Bitcoin’s inherent exponential growth, acting as a historical roadmap for its price trajectory. Currently, BTC finds itself two years ahead of this trendline, a position historically associated with what analysts term the ‘extreme greed’ zone. Historically, this ‘extreme greed’ phase has preceded euphoric market peaks, specifically observed in the bull runs of 2013, 2017, and 2021. If the established four-year market cycle continues to repeat its pattern, apsk32 anticipates a substantial surge, projecting BTC to reach between $200,000 and $300,000 by Christmas. This momentum is then expected to gradually recede in early 2026, marking the potential end of this particular cycle’s peak. Decoding the BTC Price Analysis: The Power Curve and Historical Cycles To truly grasp the potential outlined in this audacious BTC price analysis , it’s essential to understand the underlying principles driving these predictions. The ‘long-term power curve trendline’ isn’t just a fancy term; it’s a robust mathematical framework that has, with remarkable accuracy, mapped Bitcoin’s exponential ascent over its lifetime. This curve suggests that despite its volatility, Bitcoin adheres to a predictable growth trajectory over extended periods. The concept of a ‘four-year cycle’ is equally pivotal in this BTC price analysis . This cycle, often correlated with Bitcoin’s supply shock events, has historically dictated periods of accumulation, rapid price appreciation (the bull run), and subsequent consolidation. The ‘extreme greed’ zone, as identified by apsk32, represents the latter stages of this rapid appreciation phase. Past cycles have shown that when Bitcoin enters this zone, it signifies a period of intense speculative interest and widespread FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), driving prices to new all-time highs before a natural cooling-off period. Here’s a look at how Bitcoin has historically performed during these peak cycle years: Cycle Peak Year Approximate Price Peak Historical Context 2013 ~$1,100 Early adopter euphoria, first major parabolic surge. 2017 ~$20,000 Retail investor boom, widespread media attention. 2021 ~$69,000 Institutional adoption, corporate balance sheet inclusion. 2024/2025 (Projected) $200K – $500K Global macroeconomic shifts, continued institutional integration. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Fueling Bitcoin Growth: What to Watch? Beyond the technical charts, a powerful confluence of macroeconomic factors is also poised to ignite significant Bitcoin growth . Satraj Bambra, CEO of perpetual trading platform Rails, emphasizes that shifts in global monetary policy and economic indicators could serve as potent catalysts for further gains, particularly looking ahead to 2025. Bambra highlights three critical macroeconomic signals that historically favor risk assets like Bitcoin: An Expanding U.S. Federal Reserve Balance Sheet: When the Fed expands its balance sheet, it typically involves quantitative easing (QE), injecting more liquidity into the financial system. This increased money supply often seeks higher returns, flowing into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. A Pivot to Lower Interest Rates: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing and make traditional savings less attractive, pushing investors towards assets with higher potential yields, including digital currencies. This encourages both institutional and retail investors to deploy capital into growth-oriented sectors. A Falling U.S. Dollar Index (DXY): A weaker U.S. dollar often correlates with stronger commodity prices and increased investment in alternative assets. As the dollar loses purchasing power, investors seek hedges, and Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ becomes an appealing option. These combined factors signal a renewed era of stimulus and a ‘risk-on’ sentiment across global markets. Such an environment is precisely what could propel Bitcoin to the upper echelons of predictions, potentially sending its value soaring to an astonishing $300,000 to $500,000. Navigating the Crypto Market Forecast: Opportunities and Challenges While the crypto market forecast paints an incredibly optimistic picture, it’s crucial to approach these predictions with a balanced perspective. The potential for substantial gains is undeniable, but so are the inherent challenges and risks that characterize the volatile world of digital assets. Key Opportunities Driving the Forecast: Growing Institutional Interest: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has opened doors for traditional finance, bringing in significant capital and legitimacy. This institutional embrace is expected to continue, providing a stable foundation for future price appreciation. Increasing Utility and Adoption: Beyond its role as a store of value, Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues to evolve, with developments in scalability solutions and broader integration into payment systems. Global Economic Rebalancing: As nations grapple with inflation and debt, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and limited supply make it an attractive hedge against traditional financial instability. Potential Challenges and Risks: Regulatory Headwinds: Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable legislation could introduce significant market uncertainty and impact the positive crypto market forecast . Market Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its dramatic price swings. While these can lead to massive gains, they also carry the risk of substantial losses. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events, technological exploits, or major geopolitical shifts could trigger sudden and sharp market downturns, disrupting even the most optimistic forecasts. Profit-Taking and Correction: Even in a strong bull market, healthy corrections are inevitable. As prices surge, early investors may take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks that can test investor conviction. Preparing for the Next Bitcoin Bull Run: Actionable Insights With the potential for an unprecedented Bitcoin bull run on the horizon, many investors are wondering how best to position themselves. While financial advice should always come from a qualified professional, here are some general actionable insights based on historical market behavior and common investment principles: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Understand the technology, the market dynamics, and the risks involved. Relying solely on a single Bitcoin price prediction can be risky. Consider a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history shows that its most significant gains are realized over multi-year cycles. Short-term volatility can be jarring, but a long-term ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) strategy has often proven effective for patient investors during past bull runs. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This strategy averages out your purchase price over time, mitigating the risk of buying at a peak and smoothing out volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and avoid putting all your capital into a single asset, no matter how promising it appears. A diversified approach helps mitigate risks associated with any single asset’s performance. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technical analyses, and macroeconomic developments. The crypto space evolves rapidly, and staying informed is key to making timely and informed decisions throughout the potential Bitcoin bull run . The audacious predictions of Bitcoin reaching $200,000, $300,000, or even an incredible $500,000 by year-end are certainly captivating. Driven by both robust technical indicators like the long-term power curve and favorable macroeconomic shifts, the stage appears set for a potentially historic Bitcoin bull run . While no prediction is guaranteed, the confluence of historical patterns and external catalysts provides a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s continued ascent. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these driving forces becomes paramount for anyone looking to navigate its complexities. Whether Bitcoin hits these exact targets or not, the underlying trends suggest a vibrant and dynamic future for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.

To this end, trading expert Michaël van de Poppe forecasts that Bitcoin will reach a record high of $250,000 by Q4 2025, according to his July 11 post on X. He expects the maiden digital asset to reach $125,000 in July, climb to $150,000 by the end of the quarter, and ultimately target $250,000 by year-end. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Poppe’s outlook is guided by Bitcoin’s ability to break decisively above the $110,000 and $112,000 resistance zone, which had capped previous rallies. He noted that late June saw liquidity sweep below $105,000, followed by accumulation around $100,400 and $105,000, paving the way for the breakout. The recent move above $110,000 was accompanied by rising volume, indicating strong buying momentum. While a short-term pullback is possible as liquidity above $112,000 is absorbed, Poppe sees $125,000 and $150,000 as near-term targets, with a potential parabolic run to $250,000 if these levels give way. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch Separately, pseudonymous analyst BitBull, in a July 12 X post , echoed similar targets. He noted that after breaking $117,000, Bitcoin could push toward $120,000 in the coming days, followed by a period of consolidation. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: BitBull This pattern, he said, resembles February 2024, when Bitcoin paused after a sharp rally, giving altcoins room to catch up before resuming its climb. BitBull projects Bitcoin could then advance to $135,000 and $140,000, marking a potential local top. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $117,810, representing a gain of more than 8% over the past week. Bitcoin price chart.

The development was communicated to the general public by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who gave reasons for another pushback. The latest postponement comes after the first one earlier in the summer. According to Altman, the company is pushing the release back indefinitely because it intends to carry out further safety testing. “We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. we are not yet sure how long it will take us,” said Altman in a post on X. “while we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.” OpenAI halts release of open source model for further testing OpenAI’s open source model release has been one of the most anticipated events of the summer, alongside the release of its GPT-5 model. Unlike GPT-5, the company’s open model will be available for free, and developers can download and run it locally. With the launches, OpenAI intends to show that it is still leading Silicon Valley when it comes to artificial intelligence. The race for the lead in the artificial intelligence industry in Silicon Valley has taken a new shape, with companies now making moves to cement their position as the leader of the sector. The development can be seen in investments worth billions of dollars made by AI firms and labs such as Anthropic, Google DeepMind , and xAI. While it is hard to see which company is making the best strides, all of them are making commendable moves in the sector. The move has proven to be a success for some of these companies, with Meta’s Llama open source AI family model a typical example. The company, which has invested heavily in the models, said in March that it had recorded over one billion downloads. DeepSeek , on the other hand, has also amassed a large global user base, attracting the attention of investors. The delay of OpenAI’s open source model means that developers will have to wait for a while to try the first open source model that the company is set to release in years. According to a report by TechCrunch, the new open source model is expected to have the same reasoning abilities as OpenAI’s o-series models, and the company has planned for it to be the best-in-class compared to the other open models. Meanwhile, the open source AI model ecosystem became a little intense this week, with Chinese AI startup Moonshot AI launching Kimi K2, an open source AI model that it claims outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic coding benchmarks. After Altman announced the first delay in June, he added that the company had recorded something amazing, but refused to go into details on what he meant. “Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we’re releasing a model we’re proud of along every axis,” said Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research who is leading the open source model team, in a post on X. A previous report mentioned that leaders at OpenAI have been discussing the likelihood of connecting the OpenAI mode to the company’s AI models hosted on the cloud for complex queries. However, it remains unknown if the feature will make it to the final stage. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

For those tracking the pulse of technological advancements, the latest announcement from OpenAI regarding its highly anticipated AI model release is a significant development, raising questions about the balance between innovation speed and responsible deployment. Understanding OpenAI’s Latest Delay: Sam Altman’s Commitment to Safety For the second time this summer, OpenAI has announced a delay in the release of its groundbreaking open AI model . Originally slated for next week, the launch has been pushed back indefinitely. Sam Altman , CEO of OpenAI , confirmed the decision, citing the critical need for additional safety testing and thorough review of high-risk areas. In a post on X, Altman emphasized, “We need time to run additional safety tests and review high-risk areas. We are not yet sure how long it will take us.” This cautious approach highlights the company’s commitment to ensuring the model’s integrity before it becomes widely accessible. Altman added, “While we trust the community will build great things with this model, once weights are out, they can’t be pulled back. This is new for us and we want to get it right.” Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Capability wise, we think the model is phenomenal — but our bar for an open source model is high and we think we need some more time to make sure we’re releasing a model we’re proud of along every axis.” What Makes This OpenAI AI Model So Anticipated? The delayed open AI model from OpenAI is one of the most keenly awaited events in the AI community this summer, alongside the expected release of GPT-5 . This new open model is anticipated to possess reasoning capabilities similar to OpenAI ‘s ‘o-series’ of models, promising a significant leap forward in accessible AI technology. Bitcoin World previously reported that OpenAI leaders have even discussed enabling this open AI model to connect to the company’s cloud-hosted AI models for complex queries, though it remains uncertain if these advanced features will be included in the final release. The expectation is that this model will set a new benchmark, becoming best-in-class compared to other open models currently available. Its release could empower developers with unprecedented tools, fostering innovation across countless applications. Navigating the Intense AI Competition Landscape The decision to delay comes at a time of escalating AI competition within Silicon Valley. OpenAI is striving to maintain its leadership position against formidable contenders like xAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, all of whom are investing billions into their own AI initiatives. The competitive landscape became even more dynamic recently with the launch of Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2, a one trillion parameter open AI model that has demonstrated superior performance over OpenAI ’s GPT-4.1 AI model on several agentic-coding benchmarks. This intensified rivalry underscores the pressure on OpenAI to not only innovate but also to ensure the robustness and safety of its products before public release. The delay, while frustrating for developers, might be a strategic move to ensure the model is truly groundbreaking and secure, safeguarding OpenAI ‘s reputation and competitive edge. The Broader Implications for the AI Ecosystem The indefinite postponement of OpenAI ‘s open AI model has broader implications for the entire AI ecosystem . Developers eager to integrate OpenAI ‘s latest capabilities into their projects will have to wait, potentially slowing down certain innovation cycles. However, this delay also highlights a growing industry trend: prioritizing safety and ethical considerations over rapid deployment. In a world where AI’s power is rapidly expanding, the responsible development of these technologies is paramount. The challenges of ensuring an AI model’s safety, especially one whose weights cannot be recalled once released, are immense. This cautious approach by OpenAI could set a precedent for the industry, encouraging other developers to adopt similar rigorous testing protocols. While the wait is extended, the commitment to a safer, more reliable AI model could ultimately benefit the community in the long run. What’s Next for OpenAI and the AI World? The delay of OpenAI ‘s open AI model is a stark reminder of the complexities and responsibilities inherent in developing advanced artificial intelligence. While the anticipation for this model, and for GPT-5 , remains high, Sam Altman ‘s emphasis on safety underscores a mature approach to innovation. The coming months will be crucial for OpenAI as it navigates the final stages of development, aiming to deliver a model that is not only powerful but also impeccably safe and reliable. The broader AI ecosystem will undoubtedly watch closely, as OpenAI ‘s decisions continue to shape the future trajectory of AI development and its impact on technology and society.

With his vocal support for digital assets and the launch of his token, the industry is buzzing again. His recent pledge to create a supportive environment for cryptocurrencies has been widely seen as the ignition spark for the next big bull cycle. And guess who’s riding the wave? Meme coins. That’s right—tokens that blend humor, hype, and heavy returns are back, and this time, they’re aligning with politics. From rising stars like LILPEPE to cult favorites like FLOKI and WIF, here are the top five meme coins worth buying into before the market explodes. LILPEPE: the frog leading the meme charge Let’s start with the coin that’s stealing the spotlight: LILPEPE . This isn’t just another meme coin trying to ride the coattails of Dogecoin. LILPEPE is combining meme magic with cutting-edge blockchain tech by building on a next-gen Layer 2. And the hype is real. The project is already in its fourth presale stage, selling at $0.0013 and over 91% filled, with more than $4,051,508 raised. Once it hits 100%, the price jumps to $0.0014, and when it lists at $0.003, early buyers are instantly sitting on 130.76% gains. But it doesn’t stop there—analysts expect LILPEPE to soar as high as $0.231 by the end of Q3 2025, marking a potential 178x return, or 17,786% price explosion. Big wallets have already arrived, and with deep-pocketed investors fueling demand, FOMO is setting in quickly. Investors who got in at $0.0010 are already sitting on 30% gains. Buying now at $0.0013 could be like buying Ethereum at $5. Even better, LILPEPE is running a massive $770,000 giveaway , with 10 lucky winners, each getting $77,000 worth of tokens. It’s a win-win for early backers. Official Trump ($TRUMP): the politician-turned-crypto icon What better way to bet on Trump’s bullish crypto stance than through his coin? The TRUMP token surged to an impressive valuation after its launch and continues to be a symbol of the intersection between politics and blockchain. With exclusive dinners for top holders and real-world marketing momentum, $TRUMP has gone beyond memes and entered the cultural crypto zeitgeist. Trump’s increasing influence in the space could see this token become a fixture in portfolios. PENGU: the NFT-meme fusion PENGU is a sleeper pick with a huge upside. Born from a popular NFT collection, Pudgy Penguins, it’s now branching into meme coin territory. With a devoted community, Solana-based performance, and a growing ecosystem, PENGU is one of those tokens that could explode—and you wish you were in early. The fusion of NFT legacy and meme appeal makes it a rare breed, and it’s still priced under $0.02—a bargain for what could be the next breakout star. WIF (Dogwifhat): Solana’s meme darling WIF , also known as Dogwifhat, is Solana’s top meme coin by traction. With over $1 billion in market cap, WIF is less about hype and more about community power. It has meme flair, massive reach on social platforms, and strong organic growth. Dogwifhat became a sensation because of its simplicity—a dog in a hat—and that’s precisely the kind of meme energy that performs well in bull markets. As Solana’s momentum builds, WIF could deliver another parabolic run. FLOKI: the meme coin with real utility FLOKI was once dismissed as a Dogecoin clone, but it has evolved into a legitimate project with a thriving ecosystem. With initiatives like FlokiFi (DeFi tools), a metaverse game (Valhalla), and its educational crypto platform, FLOKI, the project is now well-rounded and continues to deliver meme-level virality. Trading at a fraction of a dollar, FLOKI still holds enormous upside potential, especially if the retail crowd returns in full force. Why Trump’s support means everything for meme coins Trump’s vocal endorsement of crypto—paired with policy proposals supporting self-custody and low regulation—could lead to a bullish regulatory climate. According to FinanceFeeds , his administration could make crypto easier to access, invest in, and use. That kind of support doesn’t just lift Bitcoin or Ethereum—it fuels the kind of community-driven hype meme coins thrive on. As the industry prepares for a new cycle, tokens like LILPEPE and $TRUMP are perfectly positioned to take off. Final thoughts The combination of politics and meme culture is a unique blend, one that generates substantial profits. LILPEPE is already proving to be the hottest new ticket, while $TRUMP, WIF, FLOKI, and PENGU are all poised for incredible runs. If Trump truly opens the door to mainstream adoption, we could be entering the most meme-fueled bull run in history. Savvy investors aren’t waiting—they’re getting in now, before the next stage fills, before the listings happen and before the rest of the world catches on. Ready to ride the wave? Now’s the moment.

On Friday, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) had reached an important milestone at the close of trading on the previous day, becoming the fastest ETF to get to $80 billion in assets under management (AUM). The second fastest ETF to get to this level was Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which got there in 1,814 days. On Friday, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $118,667. During interviews with CNBC and Yahoo Financ e, Bitwise Asset Management CIO said his firm expects the BTC price to reach over $200,000 by the end of this year. As for how high bitcoin could go, hedge fund manager James Lavish says that the bitcoin price is similar to the U.S. debt ceiling in that ultimately there is no limit. Technical Analysis Bitcoin displayed a consolidation pattern throughout the 23-hour timeframe from 11 July 11:00 to 12 July 10:00, operating within a comprehensive range of $1,633.46 representing 1% from the peak of $118,226.29 to the trough of $116,592.83, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The most significant price movements occurred during the initial hours, particularly around 13:00 and 15:00 on 11 July, when elevated volume above the 24-hour average of 7,291 accompanied pronounced intraday swings, forming key support near $116,726.00 and resistance around $118,226.00. Following this early turbulence, BTC demonstrated exceptional stability with decreasing volume, consolidating mainly between $117,400.00-$117,900.00, before exhibiting renewed strength in the final hours with a recovery toward $118,025.00, suggesting potential bullish momentum developing for the subsequent trading session. Throughout the final 60 minutes from 12 July 09:57 to 10:56, Bitcoin encountered heightened volatility with a notable downward movement from $118,121.16 to a low of $117,835.74 at 10:14, followed by a strong rebound that established the $118,000.00-$118,070.00 range as a new consolidation zone. The period displayed classic support and resistance dynamics, with volume spikes of 392.48 and 382.49 during the 10:12-10:14 selloff confirming institutional participation, while the subsequent recovery above $118,035.00 on diminishing volume suggests underlying strength and potential for continued upward momentum.

Given BTC’s response to the initial such threats in April, the question now arises whether the asset’s recent resurgence and jump to uncharted territory will come to an end. BREAKING: President Trump announces 30% tariff on the European Union and Mexico. Trump says if they retaliate, these tariffs will be raised by the same amount as the retaliation. pic.twitter.com/JQ1HsLeseO — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 12, 2025 The letter sent to “Her Excellency” – EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, reads that it’s Trump’s “great honor” to demonstrate the strength and commitment of the two parties’ trading relationship, even though the US has “one of the largest trade deficits” with the Union. Consequently, the POTUS has described the 30% tariffs, which will go into effect on August 1, as a “more balanced and fair trade” that will allow the US to continue its relationship with the EU. At the same time, Trump’s letter reads that the EU will “allow complete, open market access to the United States, with no tariff being charged to us, in an attempt to reduce the large trade deficit” and issue the following warning: “If for any reason you decide to raise your tarrifs and retaliate, then, whatever the number you choose to raise them by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.” The letter to the Mexican President, Dr. Claudia Pardo, carried a similar message and the same threat. Recent history from earlier this year shows that bitcoin’s price tends to be highly affected by tariffs imposed or even threatened by the US President against other countries. Back in April, as Trump was slapping tariffs against essentially every country, BTC tumbled from over $100,000 to under $75,000 to mark a five-month low . It has recovered a lot of ground since then, and it skyrocketed to a new all-time high earlier this week at over $119,000. It would be interesting to follow whether the latest set of tariffs will hinder its progress or will BTC rise above them. BTCUSD.

It is presented in response to slam the “crypto week’s” initiative of the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC bill. Anti-Crypto Corruption Week in US Slams Trump’s Corruption In an official notice , Maxine Waters and Congressman Stephen Lynch introduced the “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” bill, aiming to unite the democrats to block the three crypto regulatory bills set for deliberation in Crypto Week, slated for the week of July 14th. Both democrats called the bills “dangerous pieces of crypto legislation” and emphasized that these bills would encourage President Trump’s corruption in crypto. Waters reiterated that these bills only aim to enrich Trump, his entire family, and the billionaire insiders in his cabinet at the cost of investors’ protection. Waters stated– “These bills would make Congress complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam – one that has personally enriched himself all while defrauding investors.” Key Highlights of Anti-Corruption Week Both democrats claimed that crypto ventures linked to Trump’s family are corrupt and have generated over $1.2 billion for the president, which they aim to stop. To block Trump’s crypto crimes, democrats are presenting amendments to block stablecoin bills and the crypto market structure bills. Democrats offered nearly 30 amendments to lessen the harm of the CLARITY Act bill and block Trump from profiting from the expense of crypto bills at the cost of consumers’ funds. The bill also highlighted the risk to consumer protection and stated that the Republican-led anti-CBDC bill will have devastating consequences on Americans’ financial lives. Conclusion Congressman Lynch criticized Republican leaders and called them cowards by stating, “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto.” Repeatedly, these US leaders have voiced their opinions, confronting Trump’s criminality in terms of cryptocurrency and digital assets in the country. Now, with the anti-crypto corruption bill, the democrats affirmed once again that they are not afraid and will keep reminding the public of the true cost of this corruption.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 13:07:56

Despite this significant surge, the market has witnessed no pressure from investors looking to lock in profits. The low pressure is evident in exchange inflows for both BTC and altcoins. Analysts at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant said BTC, XRP, and ether (ETH) investors have been on the sidelines this week, despite their holdings seeing substantial profits. Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Plummet According to CryptoQuant, total daily Bitcoin exchange inflows have fallen to 18,000 BTC, the lowest level since April 2015. This metric rose to 81,000 BTC in November 2024, when BTC first neared the $100,000 level. Large BTC holders are also sending fewer assets to crypto exchanges. The daily amount coming from this cohort of investors has plummeted from 62,000 BTC in November to 7,000 BTC currently. Less BTC flows from both large and small investors to exchanges, signaling less selling pressure, further implying that the market is not in overheating mode yet. Ether is witnessing similar exchange flows as BTC. The daily inflows for this asset have plunged to their lowest since October 2024. Investors are sending 584,000 ETH to exchanges today, compared to 1.57 million in February 2025. These low inflows coincide with ether’s 87% surge since early April. Low Pressure on Altcoins Additionally, XRP inflows to Binance have declined from the November spike of 10 billion XRP to 4 million XRP currently. At the time of the spike, there were several positive developments around the coin’s issuer, Ripple. Among them are the possible approval of the company’s stablecoin, RLUSD, and optimism surrounding an XRP-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). XRP had rallied at least 400% from $0.50 to $2.60 at the time, triggering a profit-taking frenzy among market participants. Currently, the opposite is the case. Even whales are on the sidelines following the coin’s rally above $2.90. Notably, XRP whale inflows have fallen 85% from 1.1 billion in February to 169 million today. CryptoQuant further revealed that the lack of selling pressure can be seen in the broader altcoin market as their exchange inflows have been muted. Daily inflows to exchanges usually spike following strong rallies as traders take profits. However, the figure has fallen to 21,000 from roughly 120,000 in March and December 2024.

Recently, attention has turned to the 1inch team following a substantial 1inch token acquisition. This strategic purchase, involving millions of dollars, has sparked considerable discussion and optimism within the community. But what does this mean for the DeFi ecosystem , and why is this particular transaction drawing so much interest? Understanding the 1inch Token Acquisition Strategy The recent news, first highlighted by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, reveals that a wallet believed to be associated with the 1inch team made a significant purchase. Over a 16-hour period, approximately 11.81 million 1INCH tokens were acquired for $3.3 million. This substantial transaction immediately caught the eye of market observers, signaling a strong internal conviction. The address in question now holds a staggering 83.97 million 1INCH tokens, valued at approximately $23.72 million. This accumulation represents a considerable stake, reinforcing the team’s commitment to the project’s long-term vision. Such a direct investment from the core team is often interpreted as a powerful vote of confidence, suggesting they believe the token is currently undervalued or poised for future growth. Why Does This Token Acquisition Matter? A strategic token acquisition strategy by a project’s team can have several implications: Signal of Confidence: It demonstrates the team’s belief in the project’s future and its native token’s value proposition. This can reassure existing holders and attract new investors. Reduced Circulating Supply: While not a direct burn, large acquisitions by core teams or foundations can effectively reduce the perceived circulating supply available on exchanges, potentially creating upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Alignment of Interests: When the team holds a significant portion of the tokens, their financial interests become more closely aligned with those of the token holders, fostering a sense of shared destiny. Strengthening the Treasury: These tokens might be used for future ecosystem development, liquidity provision, or strategic partnerships, enhancing the overall health of the DeFi ecosystem . The Power of On-Chain Data in Crypto Market Trends This entire discovery was made possible through meticulous on-chain data analysis. On-chain analysts meticulously track public blockchain transactions, identifying patterns, large movements, and wallet activities that can provide invaluable insights into market dynamics. This transparency is a cornerstone of the crypto world, allowing anyone with the right tools to monitor significant events. For instance, the analyst @ai_9684xtpa was able to trace the wallet, identify the timing and volume of the purchases, and link it back to the suspected 1inch team. This level of transparency is largely absent in traditional finance, where insider trading often operates behind closed doors. In crypto, while identities might be pseudonymous, the transactions themselves are public and verifiable. How On-Chain Analysis Informs Investment Decisions: Understanding on-chain data can offer several benefits for investors: Benefit Description Early Signals Detecting large buys/sells by whales or project teams can be an early indicator of market sentiment shifts. Transparency Verifying supply, demand, and network activity directly from the blockchain. Risk Assessment Identifying potential centralization risks or large token unlocks that could impact prices. Market Structure Gaining insights into liquidity pools, exchange flows, and overall market depth. 1INCH Token: A Pillar of the DeFi Ecosystem The 1inch token is central to the 1inch Network, a leading DEX aggregator that sources liquidity from various decentralized exchanges to offer users the best possible swap rates. The 1INCH token serves multiple purposes within this ecosystem: Governance: Holders can vote on key protocol parameters, such as swap fees, referral rewards, and liquidity mining programs, giving them a voice in the network’s evolution. Utility: It is used for gas refunds and as a staking reward within the network. Liquidity Mining: Users can earn 1INCH tokens by providing liquidity to various pools on the 1inch platform. The team’s decision to acquire more 1INCH tokens underscores their belief in the token’s intrinsic value and its crucial role in the ongoing development and success of the 1inch Network. This reinforces the idea that the token is not just a speculative asset but a functional component of a robust DeFi ecosystem . Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends This token acquisition strategy by the 1inch team occurs within a broader context of evolving crypto market trends . While the market has seen periods of volatility, there’s a continuous underlying development in the DeFi space. Projects are innovating, building, and expanding their user bases, even during quieter market cycles. The 1inch team’s move could be seen as a counter-cyclical investment, leveraging current market conditions to accumulate more assets at what they might consider a favorable price. This kind of long-term thinking is common among established projects that are confident in their fundamentals and future growth trajectory, irrespective of short-term price fluctuations. What Does This Mean for Investors? For current and prospective investors in the 1inch token , this acquisition offers several actionable insights: Due Diligence is Key: Always conduct your own research (DYOR). While team purchases are positive signals, they don’t guarantee future price appreciation. Understand Tokenomics: Familiarize yourself with the token’s utility, supply, and distribution schedule. Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on significant whale movements or team wallets for further insights. Consider Long-Term Potential: Evaluate the project’s roadmap, community engagement, and competitive landscape within the broader DeFi ecosystem . Challenges and Considerations While the acquisition is largely positive, it’s also important to consider potential challenges. The crypto market remains highly volatile, and even strong fundamentals don’t insulate assets from broader market downturns. Additionally, while on-chain data provides transparency, interpreting it requires expertise and context. A large acquisition, while signaling confidence, could also be part of a broader treasury management strategy that may or may not directly translate to immediate price gains. Furthermore, the concentration of a large number of tokens in a few wallets, even if controlled by the team, raises questions about centralization and governance power. However, for a project like 1inch, which champions decentralization, such acquisitions are typically viewed through the lens of strengthening the protocol’s long-term viability and development. A Lasting Impression on the DeFi Landscape The 1inch team’s significant 1inch token acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement of confidence in their project and the future of the DeFi ecosystem . Backed by transparent on-chain data , this strategic move provides valuable insights into internal conviction and potential future directions for the token. As crypto market trends continue to evolve, such proactive and strategic moves by core teams play a crucial role in shaping investor sentiment and the long-term health of decentralized protocols. This demonstrates a clear token acquisition strategy aimed at reinforcing the project’s foundation and signaling a bullish outlook to the wider community.

According to a Friday report by Russian state media outlet TASS, Legkodymov’s legal team formally submitted the pardon request, arguing that he became a “target in a political campaign against the crypto market and talented Russian programmers.” Legkodymov was indicted in January 2023 and pleaded guilty in December to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was sentenced to time served in July 2024 after spending about 18 months in custody. Ivan Melnikov, vice president of the Russian branch of the International Committee for Human Rights, stated that Legkodymov’s decision to seek a pardon was rooted in the hope that the US would return to “a more balanced and fair approach to digital finance.” Ties to Hydra and Ransomware Funds According to court documents, Legkodymov was accused of facilitating the transfer of illicit funds through his role at Bitzlato. US authorities alleged that Bitzlato was linked to the dark web Hydra Marketplace, with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through the platform, and that the exchange received approximately $15 million connected to ransomware-related transactions. French authorities have also sought to extradite Legkodymov to face related charges after the completion of his prison term in the United States. It remains unclear whether President Trump has received the pardon request or if he intends to take action. Trump’s Crypto Pardon Cases Gain Attention Since returning to office in January, Trump has issued at least 58 presidential pardons, including notable figures in the crypto space. Among them were Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who had been serving two life sentences , and four former BitMEX executives: Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, Gregory Dwyer, and Samuel Reed. In May, former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao also confirmed he applied for a pardon from Trump after serving a four-month sentence following his 2023 guilty plea as part of Binance’s settlement with US authorities. Reports have also suggested that Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the collapsed exchange FTX, is attempting to secure a pardon by speaking on conservative platforms and distancing himself from the Democratic Party. Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year prison sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Terminal Island.

Zhao described the report as “FUD” (spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and indicated he might sue for defamation. “I may have to file a defamation lawsuit again,” CZ said on social media platform X. “Another smear campaign, supported by a rival, with so much untrue information in it that I don't even know where to begin.” A Bloomberg report published yesterday alleged that Binance wrote the smart contract code for the USD1 stablecoin, launched by World Liberty Financial, a group affiliated with the Trump family. It also alleged that Zhao applied for a US presidential pardon after the cryptocurrency was used in a $2 billion UAE investment fund deal. Related News: Big Crypto Whales Make Big Trades as the Market Rises - Here's What They Trade According to the information in the report, more than 90% of USD1's supply is currently held in Binance wallets, and it is suggested that this could generate tens of millions of dollars in interest income for the exchange annually. Zhao, recalling his past legal battle with Bloomberg, brought up an apology published in July 2024. Bloomberg's Chinese-language publication admitted that a 2022 report accusing Binance of running a Ponzi scheme was “false and baseless” and decided to make a donation to charity in lieu of compensation. *This is not investment advice.

In a post on X, CZ slammed the article as a “hit piece sponsored by a competitor,” claiming it was filled with “so many factual errors” that he “doesn’t even know where to begin.” His fiery response has reignited debate over media accountability, crypto’s political ties, and the rising pressure surrounding digital finance. 4. FUD. Bloomberg just wrote another hit piece (sponsored by a competitor) containing so many factual errors I don't even know where to begin. Might have to sue them again for defamation. https://t.co/FevGMArHj8 — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 11, 2025 Zhao Denies Ties to Trump-Linked Stablecoin The Bloomberg report claims Binance developed the original smart contract code for USD1 – a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial (WLF), a company reportedly tied to Trump. It also states that over 90% of USD1 tokens remain in Binance wallets, potentially generating tens of millions of dollars in interest every year. On top of that, it alleges Zhao requested a presidential pardon shortly after a $2 billion deal involving a UAE-based fund investing in Binance. CZ rejected all these claims, hinting that he may sue Bloomberg for defamation. He also pointed to his past legal win against the publication, when Bloomberg’s Chinese-language edition publicly apologized in July 2024 for a false 2022 article accusing Binance of running a Ponzi scheme. Trump’s Crypto Moves Face Rising Scrutiny This controversy comes as Trump’s crypto ambitions draw more attention from U.S. lawmakers. His ventures – like World Liberty Financial, a memecoin, and crypto-friendly campaign funding – have raised concerns across both political aisles. Three major crypto bills are currently under review in the House, including the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate payment stablecoins. While Democrats were initially against the bill due to Trump’s involvement, it still passed in the Senate with bipartisan support, showing how far crypto has entered the political mainstream. Zhao Pushes Back on WSJ Claims Too This isn’t the first time CZ has clashed with the media. Back in April, he called out The Wall Street Journal over a report suggesting he agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with U.S. authorities. “WSJ is really TRYING here,” Zhao wrote on X, sarcastically pointing out that government witnesses usually don’t serve time. He had already completed a four-month prison sentence in 2023 after pleading guilty to a felony in a U.S. settlement. CZ even suggested WSJ journalists were paid to damage his reputation. Crypto Twitter Stands With CZ Zhao’s post triggered strong reactions on Crypto Twitter. Many users backed his decision to push back against Bloomberg, while crypto influencer Wendy O questioned why the outlet seems so fixated on CZ. The response reflects ongoing distrust between crypto communities and mainstream media. What Lies Ahead for CZ As Zhao fights to clear his name and Binance navigates regulatory hurdles, the crypto industry remains a battleground of legal, political, and financial tensions. With Trump’s crypto ventures under the microscope and Zhao’s potential lawsuit on the horizon, this saga highlights the turbulent dynamics shaping the future of digital finance.",News,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 13:17:03

This follows a string of other tariff actions earlier this week against Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Brazil , as well as a separate 50% tariff placed on imported copper. The European Union, which had been trying to secure a full trade agreement with the U.S. for its 27-member bloc, is now facing a new wall of tariffs. Trump made it clear in his letter to Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, that the U.S. would not accept what he called decades of non-reciprocal trade practices. “Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, anti-American policies over decades, have cost the United States jobs, companies, and industries,” Trump wrote . He said the U.S. had given the EU enough time to fix the trade imbalance, and claimed that the EU had created barriers to American goods while enjoying unrestricted access to U.S. markets. Trump targets EU for trade deficit and restricted market access In the letter to Ursula, Trump accused the EU of maintaining “significant barriers to U.S. exports” and warned that “a Tariff of 30% is sufficient at this time,” but that higher tariffs were possible if retaliation followed. “If you decide your Tariffs and retaliate, then whatever number you choose to raise by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge,” he wrote. He argued that U.S. openness has been met with protectionism from Europe, and framed the issue as one of national security, not just economics. The letter also included a demand for the EU to begin manufacturing products inside the United States if it wanted the tariffs lifted. Trump said that any European companies interested in doing so would be given fast-track approvals: “We will be everything possible to approvals quick, professionally, and routinely – in other words, a matter of weeks.” He warned that unless Europe gives U.S. exports full access, the tariffs will stay. He added that “Tariffs are necessary to which came the large and insurmountable Trade Deficits against the United States. This is a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!” Mexico faces identical demands and retaliation threat In a separate letter, Trump wrote to Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the President of the United Mexican States, to deliver the same 30% tariff policy. “You will recall, the United States has had a persistent Trade Deficit with Mexico for decades,” the letter said, blaming the imbalance for lost American “jobs, companies, and industries.” Just like with the EU, Trump said the tariff will remain unless Mexico begins to manufacture and build within the U.S. and reduces barriers on American exports. He told Claudia that if Mexico decides to retaliate with its own trade penalties, then “whatever number you choose to raise by, will be added onto the 30% that we charge.” He accused Mexico of following trade policies that were “anti-American” for decades, and repeated that the American government had been too patient. “We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with Mexico,” he said, but insisted that discussions had led nowhere. The letter also included the same approval fast-tracking offer made to the EU. Mexican companies willing to relocate production to the United States were promised quick processing: “We will be everything possible to approvals quick, professionally, and routinely.” Trump said this would be “a matter of weeks.” He ended the letter by calling the growing trade deficit with Mexico “a major threat to our Economy and, indeed, our National Security!”—the same phrase used in the letter to Ursula.

On July 11, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed an extraordinary milestone, raking in over $1.02 billion in total net inflows. This remarkable surge marks the seventh consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling a powerful wave of institutional interest and confidence in the leading digital asset. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, this development is not just a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and appeal to mainstream investors. Understanding the Phenomenon of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs For years, direct investment in Bitcoin for traditional financial institutions and retail investors was often complex, involving navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, and dealing with regulatory uncertainties. The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs changed the game entirely. These exchange-traded funds allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Here’s why they are so pivotal: Accessibility: They make Bitcoin investment as simple as buying a stock through a traditional brokerage account. Regulatory Clarity: Operating under the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), they offer a regulated and secure investment vehicle. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity for buying and selling. Institutional Gateway: They serve as a crucial bridge, allowing large institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers to allocate capital to Bitcoin within their existing compliance frameworks. The consistent positive inflows are a clear indicator that this gateway is being utilized heavily, reflecting a broader shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows : Who’s Leading the Charge? The $1.02 billion net inflow on July 11 was not just a collective effort; it was dominated by a few key players, showcasing significant conviction from major asset managers. This day alone surpassed many previous daily records, highlighting an accelerating pace of adoption. Let’s break down the contributions from the top performers: ETF Ticker Asset Manager Net Inflow (July 11) IBIT BlackRock $951.54 million ARKB ARK Invest $23.51 million Mini BTC Grayscale $20.93 million HODL VanEck $20.01 million BITB Bitwise $6.41 million BTCO Invesco $5.30 million BlackRock’s IBIT, once again, demonstrated its formidable market presence, accounting for the vast majority of the day’s inflows. This consistent dominance by BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, sends a powerful message about the long-term viability and attractiveness of Bitcoin as an investment asset. The fact that this marks the seventh consecutive day of positive Bitcoin ETF Inflows underscores a sustained, rather than sporadic, interest from investors. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption on Market Dynamics The steady stream of capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. It’s not just about the price of Bitcoin; it’s about its fundamental position in the global financial landscape. Key impacts include: Price Stability and Growth: Increased demand from large, long-term institutional investors can contribute to greater price stability and upward pressure on Bitcoin’s value, potentially reducing its historical volatility. Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: The embrace by major financial institutions lends significant credibility to Bitcoin, paving the way for broader public and corporate acceptance. Market Maturation: As more regulated products emerge, the crypto market begins to resemble traditional financial markets, attracting a wider range of participants and capital. Reduced Supply on Exchanges: As ETFs accumulate Bitcoin, they effectively remove supply from the open market, which can create scarcity and further upward price pressure if demand continues to rise. This Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is a critical step in Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital asset to a recognized store of value and a legitimate asset class alongside gold, real estate, and equities. Navigating Future Crypto Market Trends : What’s Next? The consistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are setting a precedent for future Crypto Market Trends . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it represents a significant shift in investor sentiment and capital allocation. What should investors and enthusiasts watch for next? Continued ETF Performance: Monitor daily and weekly inflow data. Sustained positive flows will reinforce the bullish narrative. Regulatory Developments: Keep an eye on global regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Favorable regulations could unlock even more institutional capital. Broader Digital Asset ETFs: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, further broadening the market. Corporate Treasury Adoption: As institutional comfort grows, more corporations might consider holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, following in the footsteps of early adopters. Retail Investor Sentiment: While institutional flows are dominant, a sustained bullish trend could reignite retail interest, creating a powerful synergy of demand. The current momentum suggests a strong foundational shift, but market watchers should remain vigilant for any shifts in global economic conditions or regulatory headwinds that could impact these trends. Strategies for Digital Asset Investment in a Maturing Landscape For individual investors looking to participate in this evolving landscape, understanding the dynamics of Digital Asset Investment is crucial. The advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs offers a new avenue, but it’s important to consider your personal investment goals and risk tolerance. Consider these strategies: Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading the charge, a diversified portfolio across various digital assets and traditional investments can mitigate risk. Long-Term Horizon: Institutional adoption often implies a long-term investment horizon. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, so patience is key. Research and Due Diligence: Understand the underlying technology, market dynamics, and regulatory environment of any digital asset or ETF you consider investing in. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For those investing directly in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, regular, smaller investments can help average out the purchase price over time, reducing the impact of short-term price swings. Leverage ETFs Wisely: If choosing Bitcoin ETFs, understand their fee structures, liquidity, and how they track Bitcoin’s price. They offer convenience but also come with their own set of considerations compared to direct ownership. The market is maturing, but it’s still a relatively new asset class. Informed decisions, based on thorough research, are paramount. In conclusion, the astounding $1.02 billion in net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 11, marking seven consecutive days of positive movement, is a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Led overwhelmingly by BlackRock’s IBIT, these figures underscore a powerful and accelerating trend of institutional adoption. This influx of traditional capital is not merely boosting Bitcoin’s price; it is fundamentally reshaping its perception, solidifying its role as a legitimate and increasingly indispensable asset in global finance. As these trends continue, we can expect a more stable, mature, and widely accepted digital asset ecosystem, truly ushering in a new era for Bitcoin and beyond.

In a new interview on the White Crypto YouTube channel, Hougan says Bitcoin could reach a price “north of $200,000” by the end of this year. According to the Bitwise CIO, demand for the crypto king is currently outstripping supply. “If you look at the amount of Bitcoin on exchange, it’s at record multi-year lows. We think those sellers are almost exhausted. At the same time, we think the institutional demand from companies, governments, and [exchange-traded funds] ETFs is increasing. So you have available supply decreasing and institutional demand increasing and rising concerns about the fiat system. We think that is a recipe for a significant end-of-the-year rally. So, our prediction is above $200,000.” By 2030, Hougan says the total market cap of Bitcoin could reach parity with that of gold. “Gold keeps going up. So that number keeps going up. I think it was like $800,000 when we made that prediction and maybe it’s $1.2 million by now. But we think parity with gold is about where we should end this cycle, which we think stretches for the rest of the decade. There are things that could increase that, and there are things that could decrease that. But we think that’s a reasonable pattern matching from historical cyclical growth. And I know that’s a long way, but I think Bitcoin could do it.” Bitcoin is trading at $117,110 at time of writing.

Besides ADA, some other contenders could reach the $1 mark this year. We’ve zeroed in on three projects with strong momentum and potential: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , Dogecoin (DOGE) , and Sei (SEI). Little Pepe (LILPEPE): the Sub-$0.002 token quietly targeting $1 in 2025 While ADA battles to return to its $1 milestone, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a surprising contender, is quietly building the infrastructure and momentum to get there. It’s currently priced at just $0.0013 in its fourth presale stage. What makes Little Pepe stand out is its ambitious Layer-2 blockchain, explicitly built for meme coin creation and trading. It’s the first Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 focused entirely on meme culture. It combines lightning-fast transactions, ultra-low gas fees, and protection against sniper bots. In a space often plagued by scams and failed launches, LILPEPE offers structure, utility, and security. Key features of Little Pepe: Layer‑2 Blockchain: Tailored for meme trading with near-zero fees, instant settlements, and 0% trading tax. Pepe’s Pump Pad: A built-in meme coin launchpad offering auto-liquidity lock, anti-rug mechanisms, and seamless token deployment. Utility-Backed Tokenomics: Includes staking rewards, volume-based fees, and a DAO structure for governance. No Trading Taxes: Encourages high-frequency trading and large community adoption without penalty. The presale has already raised over $4 million, with Stage 4 nearly sold out. The confirmed listing price of $0.003 offers early backers a 2.3× upside even before public trading begins. But it’s the long-term projections that are catching attention. Analysts estimate that if LILPEPE captures even 5–10% of the meme coin market, it could exceed a $5 billion market cap, pushing its token price well beyond $1. With major centralized exchange listings confirmed and a $777,000 giveaway campaign underway, viral momentum is also firmly on LILPEPE’s side. It’s not just aiming to join the $1 club—it’s aiming to become the infrastructure for the next generation of meme coins, much like what Polygon did for Ethereum dApps. And if it delivers on roadmap execution, community adoption, and exchange traction, $1 in 2025 may be more than just a meme—it could be a reality. Dogecoin (DOGE) — OG meme royalty DOGE is trading near $0.167, teasing a breakout to $0.20. A decisive breakout past $0.18–$0.19 could lead to $0.22–$0.25 levels. DOGE/USD 1D Price Chart|Source: TradingView DOGE’s bullish structure remains intact, and support around $0.162–$0.165 is holding firm. RSI trends indicate renewed strength, while trading days have become increasingly positive. Speculation around a DOGE ETF adds fuel to the fire. Initially a joke in 2013, DOGE experienced a surge during the 2021 bull market, reaching a high of $0.45. Its longevity and deep liquidity offer a reliable meme bet. If a DOGE ETF materializes and alt-season heats up, $1 is achievable. However, propelling it to $1 by year-end would require external wind, such as high-profile endorsements or unprecedented market demand. Sei (SEI) — DeFi rocket on the rise SEI is trading around $0.264 after a 70% rally from June lows of $0.15, signaling a robust resurgence. SEI/USD 1D Price Chart|Source: TradingView On-chain trength TVL now exceeds $1 billion. Daily transactions exceeded 1.6 million. Its active user counts have risen in recent months. SEI is holding above its 200-day EMA, indicating a sustainable bullish structure. Projected support lies between $0.24 and $0.28. Meanwhile, resistance targets approach $0.33 to $0.35. A breakout above these could propel further gains in the lead-up to Q1 2026. SEI’s rapid growth and utility adoption put it in a rare high-upside class. While doubling shortly is realistic, a rally to $1 by 2025 would require SOL-like adoption of its ecosystem, including real-world use cases and developer traction. These are factors SEI is currently building. If it meets this goal, SEI could deliver a strong rally to $1. Final take While Cardano remains a solid bet, Little Pepe, Dogecoin, and Sei each offer differentiated opportunities for 2025. However, LILPEPE is an exciting pick, merging meme culture and infrastructure. With plans already outlined for its listing on exchanges and investors’ interest at a high, LILPEPE could race past $1 in no time. Don’t miss out on this opportunity.

Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Project Immediate 150% Surge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-happens-when-bitcoin-solaris-hits-lbank-ethereum-price-prediction-2025-experts-project-immediate-150-surge/,"The crypto market has always loved a plot twist. Just when investors were tracking Ethereum’s slow and steady rise to a projected $3,296 by 2030, another player has stepped onto the stage with a bolder promise and a tighter timeline. Bitcoin Solaris, a coin that once hovered quietly beneath the surface, is now commanding attention with a powerful presale, explosive demand, and a confirmed LBank listing that could change the game overnight. The question is no longer whether BTC-S can make noise. It’s how loud that noise will be when the listing bell rings. Ethereum Holds Its Ground, But BTC-S Is Racing Ahead Ethereum has proven itself as a cornerstone of the Web3 world. With thousands of DApps, smart contracts, and Layer 2 integrations, it’s not going anywhere. Predictions showing a price near $2,712 in 2026 and $5,370 by 2040 give it long-term credibility. But that kind of climb requires patience. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is offering a different timeline altogether. It’s not built to follow the market’s rhythm. It’s built to skip ahead of it. With the LBank listing on the horizon, users are treating BTC-S not just as an investment, but as a chance to relive the early Bitcoin days, only faster. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Go Beyond Bitcoin Solaris is not just another altcoin. It’s a dual-layer blockchain ecosystem engineered for scale, speed, and user empowerment. At the heart of BTC-S is a two-tiered structure that separates base-level consensus from high-speed application execution. The Base Layer operates on Proof-of-Work, securing the network with real computational effort. The Solaris Layer runs on Delegated Proof-of-Stake, offering blazing-fast transactions with 2-second finality. Combined, they deliver over 10,000 transactions per second and 99.95% less energy usage than traditional PoW chains. Smart contracts are built for DeFi, gaming, and cross-chain interoperability using Rust for added security. And through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, users will mine BTC-S directly from their mobile devices, making the coin accessible and inclusive. The mining calculator shows just how much passive power lies in your pocket. Presale Momentum and the Unexpected Price Rollback The Bitcoin Solaris presale is in its 11th and final phase. Currently priced at $11, it’s scheduled to launch at $20 on July 31, making the potential return a clean 150 percent. Over 14,150 unique users have already joined, with more than $6.6 million raised. Not Just Scalable Designed to Be Unstoppable That’s BTC-S But here’s the twist: for a very limited time, Bitcoin Solaris has announced a Price rollback, temporarily reducing the entry price to $5. Not a bonus. Not a discount. A rollback. A strategic move that turns heads and rewards fast movers. Given the tech and momentum, it’s rare to see a project this strong offer one last low-price window. And to ensure seamless delivery on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended, not for buying, but for receiving your tokens after July 31. LBank Listing: A Catalyst Waiting to Detonate When a coin with this much hype hits a major exchange, movement happens. LBank brings BTC-S to a global audience, with high liquidity and massive visibility. Combined with the speed and energy efficiency BTC-S offers, this listing is set to serve as a rocket booster. That’s why many are calling it the “Bitcoin of 2025”, a rare second chance for those who missed the early BTC days. The infrastructure is ready. The roadmap is bold. And the price point is still within reach. Verified and Reviewed: What Experts Are Saying Crypto analysts aren’t the only ones buzzing. Influencers are lighting up YouTube with detailed breakdowns of BTC-S. A Crypto Show video calls Bitcoin Solaris “the most complete presale project of 2025,” highlighting its dual-consensus architecture. Token Galaxy breaks down the technical innovations that make BTC-S stand out even in a crowded launch year. On top of that, investors are reassured by two major smart contract audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins , both confirming the project’s security and robustness. Bitcoin Solaris Roadmap: From Launch to Global Impact BTC-S is not a one-hit wonder. The project roadmap reveals a long-term vision that includes: Testnet launch, wallet development, and exchange integration in early 2026 A full mainnet with governance features and partnerships by mid-2026 Hardware wallet integration, Layer 2 scaling, and enterprise adoption by 2027 Education, innovation labs, and global collaborations from 2028 onward This isn’t just a coin. It’s an evolving financial ecosystem with a clear execution plan. Final Verdict: Get In Before the Window Closes While Ethereum inches forward on its long-term curve, Bitcoin Solaris is racing to break the charts before the year ends. With a confirmed LBank listing, a powerful presale structure, and game-changing technology, BTC-S is delivering on every front. And with the Price rollback live for a short time, this may be the last moment BTC-S is available under $10 ever again.

If SHIB closes above $0.00001383 with increased volume, it could test $0.00001400 in the short term, and potentially target $0.00001420 as the next upside level. However, failure to break resistance could see SHIB drifting back toward $0.00001307, and a breach of that level might expose it to a move toward $0.00001280. For now, price action remains range-bound, and traders should watch closely for a decisive breakout or breakdown to confirm the next direction.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades in a tight consolidation range, showing signs of cautious accumulation with gradually higher lows. While short-term momentum appears neutral and constrained by strong resistance at $0.00001383, the structure suggests growing interest from buyers. SHIB’s all-time high of $0.00008845 remains significantly higher than current levels, presenting long-term upside potential. However, its price remains highly speculative, driven more by market sentiment than fundamentals. For investors, SHIB may offer short-term trading opportunities within defined levels, but it carries high volatility and risk. Why is Shiba Inu up today? Shiba Inu is up 0.5% today, trading at $0.00001348 on July 12, 2025, due to renewed buying interest within a key support zone at $0.00001307. The price has formed higher lows on both the daily and 4-hour charts, indicating accumulation by short-term traders. Despite broader market uncertainty, SHIB’s ability to hold above support has attracted attention, with traders positioning for a possible breakout above the $0.00001383 resistance. Though trading volume remains modest, current price action reflects cautious optimism driven by range-based buying activity and technical positioning near resistance. Recent News on Shiba Inu The Shiba Inu ecosystem has announced a major performance upgrade to its metaverse project, SHIB: The Metaverse, reinforcing its commitment to real development with the mantra “ We’re deploying, not dreaming .” The update significantly improves three core hubs—Bark Park, Tech Trench, and Shib Station—by reducing lag, fixing crashes, and cutting load times. Developers achieved this by optimizing over 200 texture files, merging redundant texture maps, standardizing shaders, and applying smarter mip-streaming, resulting in a 15–25% drop in GPU memory usage and smoother gameplay, even on mid-range PCs. The enhancements ensure a crash-free, stutter-free experience without sacrificing visual quality. Currently available on Windows PCs and web browsers, the metaverse is also developing a mobile version and a fishing mini-game tied to a future in-game economy. Since its early access launch in December 2024, SHIB: The Metaverse has steadily progressed, signaling that Shiba Inu aims to evolve beyond meme coin status by delivering functional and immersive products in the metaverse space. Will Shiba Inu recover? Buyers are vigorously defending a drop below the immediate support channels on the price chart. If the SHIB price holds its momentum above the $0.000014 level, we might see further surges. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term SHIB price prediction, the current Shiba Inu price is projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2027. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to crypto experts’ long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? SHIB’s goal of reaching $100 is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market. Additionally, to get the $100 mark, SHIB would require a strong push in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? The Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments. You are advised to do your own research and form expert opinions before investing in the highly volatile crypto market.

The analyst suggested that this could be the final leg up for the foremost meme coin and advised market participants not to miss it. Dogecoin Eyes Parabolic Rally With Megaphone Pattern In a TradingView post, TradingShot predicted that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $1.25. He noted that the meme coin has been trading in a bullish Megaphone pattern within a channel up. The analyst added that the recent rebound on June 16 on the weekly MA200 is a higher low at the bottom of both patterns. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts Dogecoin Price To Jump Double-Digits To $0.2 With the 1-week Relative Strength Index (RSI) also rebounding on its long-term support zone, TradingShot declared that Dogecoin is most likely at the start of a new bullish leg. He noted that this could be the final rally that will shape this cycle’s top. Meanwhile, the analyst claimed that DOGE is targeting $1.25 because the previous two bullish legs peaked on the 3.618 Fibonacci extension of the last decline. He told market participants that they can settle for $0.8 if they wish to pursue a target within the Channel up. A rally to both $0.8 and $1.25 would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for Dogecoin, whose current ATH is at $0.73. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach these targets in the first half of next year. Dogecoin is expected to maintain a steady climb from now till then as it reaches those targets. The meme coin has already begun another uptrend following Bitcoin’s rally to a new ATH. DOGE has again reclaimed the $ 0.20 psychological price level and could potentially reach its last local high at around $0.26. DOGE Against Its Bitcoin Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that the DOGE/BTC chart is sitting in a historical zone of support with the monthly time frame indicators fully reset. The analyst indicated that this was possibly the best setup for Dogecoin, one that could spark a massive run for the meme coin.

The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could rally to as high as $9 during this period. Meanwhile, he highlighted the $0.2 support level as being crucial for this lift-off for the meme coin.

This isn’t just a simple change of avatar; it’s a powerful signal, a nod to a rapidly evolving culture, and a potential harbinger of new trends in the NFT Marketplace . What exactly does this strategic adoption signify for the broader Web3 ecosystem, and why are these adorable, flightless birds capturing the attention of industry giants? Pudgy Penguins Taking Over X: A Strategic Move? The recent profile picture changes by OpenSea and Coinbase featuring Pudgy Penguins have sparked considerable discussion within the crypto community. OpenSea, the world’s leading NFT marketplace, made the switch first, followed by crypto exchange giant Coinbase. This isn’t the first time a brand has adopted an NFT as its face, but the prominence of these two entities lends significant weight to the action. Pudgy Penguins, a collection of 8,888 unique NFTs, have long been a beloved project in the NFT space, known for their vibrant art, strong community, and increasing real-world utility through initiatives like their toy line and licensing deals. So, why Pudgy Penguins? It’s more than just aesthetics. The project has cultivated a reputation for: Strong Community Engagement: The ‘Huddle’ (Pudgy Penguins community) is known for its passionate and loyal members. Innovative IP Expansion: Beyond digital collectibles, Pudgy Penguins have ventured into physical toys and broader intellectual property (IP) licensing, bridging the digital and physical worlds. Resilience in Bear Markets: While many NFT projects struggled, Pudgy Penguins maintained a relatively strong floor price and continued to build, demonstrating robustness. This move by OpenSea and Coinbase is a public endorsement, signaling alignment with a project that embodies resilience, community, and innovation – qualities highly valued in the Web3 space. What Does This Mean for the OpenSea NFT Ecosystem? As the dominant NFT Marketplace , OpenSea’s choice of a Pudgy Penguin as its public face on X carries immense weight. OpenSea is not just a platform; it’s often seen as a barometer for the health and direction of the NFT market. By adopting a Pudgy Penguin, OpenSea is: Signaling Confidence: It’s a vote of confidence in the long-term viability and cultural impact of the Pudgy Penguins collection. Community Alignment: It demonstrates OpenSea’s understanding and alignment with the preferences and aesthetics of its core user base – the NFT collectors and enthusiasts. Driving Attention: This simple act draws immediate attention to the Pudgy Penguins collection, potentially increasing trading volume and interest on the OpenSea platform itself. For an OpenSea NFT , being endorsed by the platform itself is akin to a major brand featuring a specific product on its homepage. It legitimizes the collection further and solidifies its status as a blue-chip NFT project. This strategic move by OpenSea reinforces its position not just as a trading hub, but as a cultural participant in the Web3 narrative. The Strategic Play for an NFT Marketplace: Beyond a Profile Picture For an NFT Marketplace like OpenSea, every public action is scrutinized. Changing a profile picture to a specific NFT collection is far from a casual decision. It’s a calculated Web3 Marketing strategy designed to achieve several objectives: Brand Affinity: By aligning with a popular and respected NFT collection, OpenSea strengthens its brand affinity within the NFT community. It shows they are ‘in tune’ with the culture. Trendsetting: Major platforms often set trends. This move could encourage other Web3 companies or even traditional brands looking to enter the space to consider similar NFT-based branding strategies. Engagement & Virality: The move itself generates buzz and discussion, providing free marketing and increasing visibility on platforms like X. It’s a highly shareable moment. This type of organic, community-driven marketing is often more effective in the Web3 space than traditional advertising. It speaks directly to the audience’s values and interests, building trust and loyalty. The Power of Web3 Marketing: A New Era of Brand Building? The adoption of Pudgy Penguins by OpenSea and Coinbase is a prime example of the evolving landscape of Web3 Marketing . In the decentralized world, traditional advertising methods often fall flat. Instead, authenticity, community engagement, and genuine participation are key. This move showcases: Traditional Marketing Web3 Marketing Top-down, broadcast messaging Community-led, interactive engagement Focus on external messaging Focus on internal cultural alignment Paid advertising campaigns Organic brand endorsement via digital assets Limited audience participation High audience participation and co-ownership By embracing an NFT collection as a brand identity, companies are not just buying an image; they are buying into a community, a narrative, and a shared cultural artifact. This creates a deeper connection with their audience, transforming passive consumers into active participants and advocates. It’s a testament to the power of digital identity and collective ownership in the new internet. Crypto Brand Adoption: Setting New Standards for Identity The decision by major players like OpenSea and Coinbase to integrate Pudgy Penguins into their brand identity marks a significant moment for Crypto Brand Adoption . It moves beyond simple partnerships or sponsorships and into a realm where digital assets become intrinsic to a brand’s public persona. This trend could set new standards for how crypto-native and even traditional brands approach their digital presence. It suggests that: NFTs are Maturing: Certain NFT collections are no longer just speculative assets but are becoming legitimate cultural symbols and brand assets. Authenticity is Key: Brands that genuinely participate in and understand Web3 culture will resonate more strongly with the community. Identity is Fluid: Digital identity, represented by NFTs, can be a powerful tool for brands to express their values and connect with specific subcultures. This is not merely a fleeting trend but an indication of how digital ownership and community-driven projects are reshaping corporate branding in the Web3 era. It challenges conventional marketing wisdom and highlights the unique opportunities presented by blockchain technology. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? While this move is largely seen as positive, it’s worth considering the nuances: Challenges: Not all NFT projects are created equal. Associating with a volatile or controversial project could backfire. The ephemeral nature of trends means a brand needs to be agile. Opportunities: For strong, community-backed projects like Pudgy Penguins, this kind of endorsement can lead to increased visibility, demand, and potentially higher floor prices. For brands, it’s an unparalleled way to demonstrate Web3 native understanding and connect with a passionate audience. Actionable Insights for the Web3 Enthusiast For collectors, this reinforces the idea that holding blue-chip NFTs can offer more than just potential financial returns; it can provide cultural capital and community access. For aspiring NFT creators, it underscores the importance of building strong communities and unique intellectual property. For other Web3 platforms, it serves as a powerful case study in authentic marketing and brand alignment. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Digital Identity The embrace of Pudgy Penguins by OpenSea and Coinbase is more than just a change of profile pictures; it’s a profound statement about the growing influence of NFTs in mainstream digital identity and Web3 Marketing . It underscores the maturity of certain NFT collections and their potential to become powerful brand assets. As the lines between digital and physical identities continue to blur, such strategic moves by industry leaders will undoubtedly shape the future of brand engagement, community building, and Crypto Brand Adoption in the decentralized world. It’s an exciting time to witness how digital assets are not just traded, but truly lived and embodied by leading entities in the space.

A significant FTX asset transfer has caught the attention of market observers, as a staking address associated with these entities moved a staggering 189,800 SOL tokens, valued at approximately $31.17 million, to BitGo Custody. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a crucial step in the ongoing saga of asset recovery and redistribution for the collapsed crypto empire, signaling strategic moves by the FTX estate. What Does This FTX Asset Transfer Mean for the Market? According to data from Arkham, this substantial transfer of SOL tokens occurred about eight hours ago, highlighting the continuous efforts by the FTX bankruptcy estate to consolidate and secure its remaining assets. For many, this move brings back memories of the dramatic collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, which sent shockwaves through the entire crypto ecosystem. The estate’s primary objective remains clear: recover as much value as possible for the defrauded creditors. Moves like these are pivotal in that complex process. Understanding the implications of such a large transfer requires looking beyond just the numbers. It speaks to the estate’s strategy for managing its vast and varied digital asset holdings. Is this a precursor to liquidation, or simply a measure to ensure the security of funds while other legal and financial processes unfold? The market watches closely, as any major movement from the FTX estate can trigger speculation and price fluctuations, especially for the assets involved. Alameda Research’s Legacy and Asset Management Challenges The name Alameda Research is synonymous with the speculative and often high-risk trading strategies that ultimately contributed to the downfall of the FTX empire. As the sister company to FTX, Alameda held a diverse and often complex portfolio of digital assets, including significant stakes in various blockchain projects and tokens like SOL. The current task of the FTX estate involves untangling this intricate web of assets, identifying legitimate holdings, and bringing them under secure, centralized control. Managing the assets of a bankrupt entity of this scale presents unique challenges: Identification and Recovery: Locating all digital assets, which were often spread across various wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols. Valuation Volatility: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies means the value of recovered assets can fluctuate wildly, impacting the total amount available for creditors. Security Concerns: Protecting recovered assets from further hacks or mismanagement, a critical lesson learned from FTX’s original collapse. Legal Complexities: Navigating various legal jurisdictions and claims from creditors worldwide. This latest transfer of SOL tokens indicates progress in addressing these challenges, moving assets from potentially less secure or less controlled environments into institutional-grade custody. The Significance of the SOL Token in FTX’s Portfolio The SOL token , native to the Solana blockchain, has a particularly intertwined history with FTX and Alameda Research. Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of both entities, was an early and vocal supporter of Solana, investing heavily in its ecosystem and integrating it deeply within FTX’s operations. This strong historical connection meant that FTX and Alameda accumulated a substantial amount of SOL, making it one of their most significant holdings. The sheer volume of SOL involved in this transfer – nearly 190,000 tokens – underscores its importance to the FTX estate. While the movement to a custodian like BitGo suggests a focus on security rather than immediate sale, the market remains sensitive to any indication of future liquidation. Large sales of SOL by the FTX estate have previously exerted downward pressure on the token’s price, given the potential for supply shock. However, the use of a qualified custodian could also be seen as a sign of a more methodical and less disruptive approach to asset management, aiming to maximize recovery value over time. Why BitGo Custody? The Importance of Institutional-Grade Security The choice of BitGo custody for this substantial transfer is not arbitrary; it speaks volumes about the FTX estate’s commitment to secure and compliant asset management. BitGo is a leading provider of institutional-grade digital asset security and custody solutions, trusted by major financial institutions and crypto businesses worldwide. Their services typically include: Multi-Signature Wallets: Requiring multiple keys for transactions, significantly reducing the risk of single points of failure. Cold Storage: Keeping a significant portion of assets offline to protect against cyber threats. Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to stringent regulatory standards, which is crucial for a bankruptcy estate under intense scrutiny. Insurance: Offering insurance policies for digital assets, providing an additional layer of protection. In the wake of FTX’s catastrophic failure, largely attributed to mismanagement and lack of proper internal controls, entrusting assets to a reputable third-party custodian like BitGo is a vital step towards restoring confidence and ensuring the integrity of the recovery process. It demonstrates a move away from the risky, self-custody practices that plagued the former exchange and towards industry best practices for institutional asset protection. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact of Major FTX Moves Any significant movement of assets from the FTX/Alameda estate inevitably generates discussion about its potential crypto market impact . While a transfer to a custodian is distinct from a sale, it often precedes future liquidation events. The market’s primary concern revolves around the possibility of a large supply of tokens, particularly SOL, being dumped onto exchanges, potentially driving down prices. However, the FTX estate has shown signs of a more measured approach in previous liquidations, often opting for over-the-counter (OTC) deals or structured sales to minimize market disruption. The transfer to BitGo could be part of a strategy to prepare for such controlled sales, rather than an immediate market dump. This measured approach aims to maximize returns for creditors, acknowledging that sudden, large-scale liquidations can devalue the very assets they are trying to recover. For investors, it’s crucial to differentiate between a transfer for security purposes and an an actual liquidation. While the former is a necessary step in asset management, the latter directly affects market supply. Keeping an eye on official announcements from the FTX estate and monitoring on-chain movements remains key to understanding the evolving situation and its potential effects on the broader crypto market. Challenges and the Road Ahead for FTX Asset Recovery The path to full creditor repayment for FTX is long and fraught with challenges. Market volatility remains a significant hurdle, as the value of the recovered assets can swing dramatically. Legal battles, conflicting claims, and the sheer complexity of managing a multi-billion dollar bankruptcy across various jurisdictions add layers of difficulty. However, the consistent efforts to consolidate and secure assets, as exemplified by this SOL transfer, indicate a determined approach by the new management to fulfill its obligations. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the FTX bankruptcy estate and reputable on-chain analytics providers. Distinguish Between Transfer and Sale: Understand that moving assets to a custodian is often a security measure, not an immediate sale. Assess Market Sentiment: Observe how the broader crypto market reacts to news of FTX asset movements and potential liquidation plans. Consider Long-Term Outlook: While short-term volatility can occur, the long-term impact of FTX’s recovery efforts on the market might be more about regulatory clarity and institutional trust. In conclusion, the FTX asset transfer of $31.17 million in SOL to BitGo Custody is more than just a data point; it’s a critical indicator of the FTX estate’s methodical progress in its immense asset recovery mission. It underscores the ongoing efforts to secure and manage the legacy of Alameda Research ‘s holdings, particularly the substantial stake in the SOL token . The choice of BitGo custody highlights a commitment to institutional-grade security and compliance, aiming to restore trust in a process that has been marred by historical mismanagement. While the potential for crypto market impact remains a key concern, the measured approach adopted by the estate suggests a strategic effort to maximize creditor recovery while minimizing disruption. This move is a testament to the complex, yet crucial, journey of restoring order from the chaos of one of crypto’s most significant collapses.

The President slapped 30% levy on the two trading partners, which will take effect from Aug. 1, according to letters Trump posted on his Truth Social account. ""Mexico has been helping me secure the border. BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,"" Trump wrote in a letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. In another letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Trump called the relationship with the EU far from reciprocal. Early this week, Trump issued new tariffs for several countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada and Brazil, along with a 50% tariff on copper, triggering volatility in the market for the red metal. Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded around $17,400 following Trump's announcement, down 0.6% from the European session high of $18,200. Prices have failed to establish a foothold above $118,000 multile times since Friday's early Asian trading hours, CoinDesk data show. Ether (ETH), the second-largest token, traded 1% lower on the day (UTC) at $2,930, having put in an indecisive doji candle Friday. Solana's SOL and DOGE traded over 2% lower while BNB was down 0.7%. Meanwhile, payments-focused XRP traded relatively resilient, flashing a 1.78% gain as of writing. The weak tone followed intense bullish price action mid-week that saw BTC blow past the long-held resistance at $110K, prompting renewed risk-taking in the broader crypto market. Some analysts anticipated a continued indecisive price action over the weekend. ""Expectations this weekend are we chop around in tight range today.

On-chain data shows an emerging imbalance in supply and demand reminiscent of late 2020. BTC price is now up by 105% over the last year and leading the altcoins with massive bullish sentiments. The cumulative crypto market cap is nearing the $3.7 trillion mark with a 24-hour trading volume of around $163 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin dominance is on the high side of 64%, and the fear and greed index is flashing “Greed” among traders. Miners can’t keep up with demand As per the Glassnode data, wallets holding less than 100 BTC are now accumulating Bitcoin at a combined pace of 19,300 BTC per month. This number is already 6,000 more BTC than miners are issuing monthly (13,400 BTC). It added that this wide base of retail and high-net-worth holders is absorbing more than 100% of the net new supply. If some Bitcoin remains in the market, then ETFs , institutions, or treasuries are gobbling up the rest. Bitcoin balance on exchanges is also dropping, and the supply shock is getting real. Exchange balances are falling, long-term holders are growing, and miner issuance is unable to keep up. Long-term holders (LTHs) are absorbing more BTC than miners can mint, and they’re not even thinking about selling. Source: Coinglass The Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) for long-term holders is currently sitting at 0.69, which is below the threshold red zone of 0.75. In the last cycle, the market spent 228 days in the euphoria zone, and this cycle, just 30 days. Even short-term holders, the classic profit-takers, are yet to show any signs of dumping. Their average entry price is around $100,000, which means they’re sitting on 17-18% gains. Bitcoin boom turns corporate heads There’s the macro picture, which implies that Bitcoin isn’t just gaining in price, it’s gaining legitimacy. Institutional investors are leaning in while corporates are converting cash into BTC. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) turns out to be the poster child of corporate Bitcoin accumulation. It now owns nearly 600,000 BTC and holds a $28 billion paper profit. Only Satoshi and BlackRock hold more than MSTR. But unlike BlackRock, which holds BTC via its ETF ( IBIT ) on behalf of investors, Strategy holds BTC outright on its balance sheet. Saylor isn’t shy about it, and when BTC hit an all-time high yesterday, he posted: “The halls of eternity echo with the cries of those who sold their Bitcoin.” Other companies are riding the same wave. Japan’s Metaplanet owns over 15,500 BTC, now worth nearly $1.83 billion, up from $284 million. El Salvador, the original Bitcoin nation, now holds 6,234 BTC, valued at $733 million, with a $232 million paper profit. Semler Scientific (SMLR) has followed the BTC-on-balance-sheet strategy too. It hodls 4,636 BTC and $160 million in gains. France’s Blockchain Group is in the mix with 900 BTC, up $30.5 million on paper. This rally wasn’t isolated to Bitcoin. Ethereum broke the $3,000 mark again, and XRP, SOL, DOGE are all rallying with it. XRP price spiked by 25% in the last 7 days. It is trading at an average price of $2.78 at press time.

Top Analyst Says Soo! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s native token, XRP, has just climbed to the third spot in the global crypto rankings, sitting right behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, with its market cap reaching $164.29 billion. At the same time, popular crypto influencer Alex Cobb has made a bold prediction, saying XRP could hit $22.54 by December 2025. But what makes him so confident that XRP can reach this level? Analyst Predicts XRP Price to Hit $22 In his recent post, Cobb used humor to send a serious message. He shared a meme showing XRP skeptics regretting their decision as the coin rises above $22.54. It was a playful way to say something clear, don’t ignore XRP’s potential. If XRP reaches that price, it would mean a massive 8X jump, or about 767% gain from where it is now. Such a rise could push XRP’s market value to around $1.32 trillion, possibly putting it ahead of Ethereum as the second-largest crypto.

Between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP surged by 7X, forcing well-known critics to rethink their positions. Even Davinci Jeremie, a die-hard Bitcoin fan, admitted XRP could climb past $20, recognizing the community’s strong push and Ripple’s progress. Whales Buying More XRP Recently, XRP whales have accumulated a massive amount of XRP. Right now, 2,743 wallets each hold over 1 million XRP, the highest number ever. These wallets now control nearly half of all XRP in circulation. Meanwhile, this big buying wave comes as XRP hit $2.80 after a strong 10% daily jump. The price spike also forced $31 million in short positions to close, catching bearish traders off guard. After hitting $2.97 , XRP pulled back but found support at $2.70.

In a recent development that underscores this growing trend, Bitcoin Treasury Capital , a Swedish-listed company dedicated to holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, announced another significant purchase. This time, the firm added an additional 4.4 BTC to its reserves, bringing its total holdings to 152 BTC as of July 11. This seemingly modest acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal of sustained confidence and a testament to the ongoing trend of institutional integration of Bitcoin into corporate balance sheets. Understanding Bitcoin Treasury Capital and Its BTC Accumulation Strategy Bitcoin Treasury Capital isn’t your average investment fund. It’s a company specifically designed to provide investors with exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly listed entity. This unique structure offers a regulated and transparent way for individuals and institutions to participate in the Bitcoin market without directly managing the complexities of self-custody or navigating less regulated exchanges. Their consistent BTC Accumulation strategy, exemplified by this latest 4.4 BTC purchase, highlights a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. Why do companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital opt for this strategy? Here are a few key reasons: Long-Term Vision: They believe in Bitcoin’s potential for significant appreciation over time, viewing it as a superior asset for treasury management compared to traditional fiat currencies, which are susceptible to inflation. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional stocks, bonds, and cash, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Institutional Appeal: By operating as a listed company, they offer a familiar and accessible entry point for institutional investors who might otherwise be hesitant to directly engage with the crypto market. Transparency: Regular announcements of their holdings, like the one made via X, provide transparency to their shareholders and the broader market, building trust and confidence. The Broader Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital is part of a much larger and increasingly significant global trend: the adoption of Bitcoin by corporations for their treasury reserves. While pioneers like MicroStrategy famously led the charge, accumulating tens of thousands of BTC, a growing number of public and private companies are following suit, albeit often on a smaller scale. This shift represents a maturation of the Bitcoin ecosystem, moving beyond individual retail speculation to legitimate corporate financial strategy. Consider the impact of these Corporate Bitcoin Holdings : Validation of Bitcoin: Each company that adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet lends further credibility to the asset, transforming it from a niche digital curiosity into a recognized financial instrument. Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more companies hold Bitcoin for the long term, it can contribute to market stability by reducing the circulating supply available for short-term trading. New Investment Avenues: The existence of treasury companies creates new, regulated investment vehicles for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin without direct ownership. This trend is not without its challenges, including Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and evolving regulatory landscapes. However, the benefits of potential long-term growth and inflation hedging are proving to be compelling enough for forward-thinking companies to embrace this new asset class. Sweden’s Progressive Stance: A Hub for Swedish Bitcoin Investment? It’s particularly interesting that Bitcoin Treasury Capital hails from Sweden. Sweden has a unique position in the global financial landscape, often lauded for its technological adoption and progressive approach to digital innovation. While the country’s central bank, the Riksbank, has been exploring its own central bank digital currency (CBDC), the e-krona, its private sector has also shown a notable openness to decentralized digital assets. This environment fosters a fertile ground for Swedish Bitcoin Investment . The presence of a listed company like Bitcoin Treasury Capital suggests a level of regulatory clarity or at least acceptance that allows such ventures to thrive. This contrasts with some other nations where regulatory uncertainty can stifle innovation in the crypto space. Sweden’s digital-first mindset and high rates of digital payment adoption may also contribute to a greater understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies among its populace and businesses. Unpacking the Significance: What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The consistent purchases by companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital are critical indicators of the broader movement towards Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . While 4.4 BTC might seem like a small amount compared to the vast sums traded daily, it’s the consistency and the underlying strategic intent that truly matter. It signifies that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset but is increasingly viewed as a legitimate component of a well-diversified corporate treasury. Key takeaways for the future of institutional adoption: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: Institutions are actively seeking alternatives to traditional fiat and bonds, especially in an era of quantitative easing and inflation concerns. Growing Confidence in Custody Solutions: The rise of secure, institutional-grade custody solutions makes it safer for companies to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. Maturing Regulatory Frameworks: As regulations slowly become clearer in various jurisdictions, it reduces risk and encourages more traditional financial players to enter the space. Educational Shift: There’s a growing understanding among corporate boards and financial managers about Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and its potential long-term value. Each new company, big or small, that publicly adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to a network effect, making it more acceptable and even expected for others to consider doing the same. This incremental accumulation by various entities builds a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term integration into the global financial system. Conclusion: A Steady March Towards Digital Asset Integration The latest acquisition of 4.4 BTC by Bitcoin Treasury Capital , while a single data point, is a compelling piece of evidence in the larger narrative of Bitcoin’s journey into mainstream finance. It reinforces the idea that companies, particularly those with a forward-thinking approach, are increasingly comfortable with and committed to holding digital assets as part of their treasury strategy. This ongoing BTC Accumulation by entities like Bitcoin Treasury Capital from Sweden signifies not just a belief in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, but a strategic decision to embrace a new paradigm of corporate finance. As more companies follow this path, the landscape of global treasury management will undoubtedly continue to transform, with Bitcoin playing an ever more central role.

With ecosystem upgrades pending voting, rising institutional interest, and experts being very optimistic, the project is very attractive. Even experts believe XLM price action also turned attractive and appears poised for a potential move toward $1.59. XLM Price Action Signals Strong Momentum According to the most recent data from XLM’s daily chart, its price soared by 35% in just 24 hours, reaching $0.4021 and touching a key resistance level that was previously seen in early 2025. Confirming the bullish momentum, even its trading volume recently jumped past $2.73 billion, and the market cap amounted to $12.50 billion, which reflects rising trader and investor demand. Much of this momentum is attributed to growing market-wide optimism following the recent Bitcoin price rally to an all-time high around $118K. But beyond general sentiment, Stellar’s price spike has been accelerated by technical and fundamental developments within its own ecosystem. Protocol 23 Upgrade Triggers Bullish Sentiment The upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade on Stellar’s Soroban smart contract platform is a fundamental factor within its own ecosystem, driving recent investor interest. The proposal will be voted on August 14, 2025, for the Soroban smart contract platform. Once approved via voting in Q3, it will introduce optimizations to transaction execution and state management, aiming to enhance the overall network performance. This anticipated upgrade comes amid a broader expansion of Stellar’s real-world applications. Similarly, Stellar has recently become an increasingly popular choice for cross-border payroll, thanks to its low fees, fast settlement, and programmable asset issuance. Even institutions like Franklin Templeton tokenized a massive amount worth $446 million in U.S. Treasuries on Stellar. Also, integrations like PayPal’s PYUSD are driving demand for XLM. Additionally, Stellar’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi rose to an all-time high in the last 24 hours alone, reaching $122.4 million, according to DeFiLlama . Technical Indicators and Analyst Forecasts Technically, the XLM price has broken above a multi-year descending trendline dating back to 2021, which has triggered what analysts describe as an impulsive rally. Analyst Javon Marks identified $0.681 as the next resistance level, with the potential to extend to $1.2918 if bullish pressure continues. $XLM en route to $1.59 https://t.co/BTBuL4d7Y9 pic.twitter.com/FKxHgOX21f — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) July 12, 2025 Complementing this view, ChartNerdTA recently shared a chart on X, showing a breakout from a flag formation.

Its latest price surge recorded earlier this week allowed it to create history by charting a new all-time high close to $119,000. Although this move has seen some resistance and BTC is now down by over a grand, its market cap has overtaken the second-largest precious metal and one of the most influential companies in the world. BTC Above Silver, Alphabet Who could have predicted such a development 15 years ago when a peer-to-peer electronic system was launched by an unknown creator? Or a decade ago when it was being ridiculed by countless traditionalists. Or even three years ago, when it had become more mainstream after a surge to roughly $70,000 but then crumbled under pressure to under $20,000 within months amid industry-wide wipeouts, scams, failures, and everything in between. Fast forward to July 2025, this same network, which was once a mere decentralized system for sharing value over the Internet, has become a global phenomenon. It has been adopted by countries, world leaders use it in their election campaigns, the largest wealth managers have launched ETFs tracking its underlying asset, and more. And speaking about that underlying asset, its price just made history this week by skyrocketing to a fresh all-time high (for the third time this year) at almost $119,000. Naturally, this pushed its market capitalization to new peaks of its own as the metric stands close to $2.350 trillion now (that’s a trillion with a T). Data from CompaniesMarketCap shows that this same asset, which was not that long ago worth pennies, has now become the sixth-largest global asset by market capitalization. Its most recent victims on the way up include Alphabet (market cap of $2.192 trillion) and silver ($2.2 trillion). Assets by Market Cap. Source: CompaniesMarketCap The graph above shows that Amazon stands next in line if bitcoin’s price ascent continues, while Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA are way further ahead. Gold remains the indisputed leader, with a market cap of well over $22.5 trillion. Where’s ETH? The second-largest cryptocurrency also experienced a substantial price revival this week, hitting $3,000 for the first time since February. Its market capitalization climbed to over $350 billion, which places it near the top 30 assets by this metric. In fact, ETH has surpassed the likes of Bank of America and SAP, while another precious metal (platinum) stands in its way next, with a market cap of almost $370 billion. Assets by Market Cap.

Cybercriminals stole approximately $140 million from six Brazilian financial institutions by using the credentials of a C&M Software employee. The incident occurred on June 30, when the attackers bribed João Nazareno Roque and gained access to the system using his credentials. According to police, he also relayed instructions to perform certain actions that ensured the attack's success. Roque initially received $920 for his involvement. Later, following the attackers' recommendations, he ran commands inside C&M's infrastructure and earned an additional $1,850, according to reports. Roque attempted to conceal his activities by changing cell phones every 15 days. However, on July 3, he was detained in São Paulo. It is estimated that at least $30–40 million of the stolen funds were converted into crypto-assets. According to an investigation by on-chain detective ZachXBT, the attackers converted the funds into BTC, ETH, and USDT through Latin American OTC and crypto exchanges. Basketball Player Suspected of Cyber Extortion On July 9, news emerged of the detention of Russian professional basketball player Daniil Kasatkin. According to media reports, he was arrested on June 21 at Charles de Gaulle Airport in France, at the request of U.S. authorities. The athlete is accused of acting as a negotiator in a hacker network that used ransomware. Kasatkin remains in custody, and U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition to face charges. His lawyer has declared the athlete's innocence. The name of the hacker group has not been disclosed. Between 2020 and 2022, the attackers reportedly carried out more than 900 attacks on various organizations, including two federal agencies. McDonald's AI Bot Vulnerability Led to Leaked Employee Hiring Database According to Wired, researchers Ian Carroll and Sam Curry discovered critical vulnerabilities in the McHire system on June 9. The platform, which hires employees for McDonald's, uses an AI bot named Olivia. Using simple passwords like ”123456,” the researchers gained access to the admin panel of the platform's developer, Paradox.ai. It contained a database with 64 million records, including job seekers' names, emails, and phone numbers. Since 2019, the platform had been accessible without two-factor authentication. Paradox.ai acknowledged the leak and stated that the account was not used by third parties other than the researchers themselves. The company promised to implement a bug bounty program to prevent similar incidents in the future. McDonald's, for its part, said it fixed the vulnerability the day it was discovered. Carroll said he only found out about this ”appalling level of security” because he was interested in the decision to vet potential employees through an AI bot and a personality test. ”It seemed particularly dystopian to me compared to the normal hiring process, right? That's what prompted me to dig deeper. I started applying for the job, and within 30 minutes we had full access to virtually every application form ever submitted to McDonald's in recent years,” he emphasized in a comment to Wired. Bitcoin Depot Failed to Keep Track of 27,000 Customers' Data Bitcoin Depot, an operator of a Bitcoin ATM network with more than 17,000 devices in the US, Canada, and Australia, has notified customers of a personal data leak.

According to sources familiar with the matter, the Elon Musk-led firm plans to tap into the potential demand in the region. Over the past few months, Tesla has recorded a decline in sales of its electric vehicles. However, with India’s status as the third-largest automobile market globally, the company could use the region to counter sales that have slowed in other markets. The opening of the showroom in Mumbai will mark the formal entry of Tesla into the market, allowing potential customers to view and price available variants. Tesla set to begin deliveries in India by August According to documents examined by Bloomberg and a source that asked not to be identified, the showroom is expected to provide adequate options for potential customers when it eventually opens. However, deliveries are expected to start in late August, another source familiar with the matter said. The person added that customers can configure and order their Tesla EVs starting next week. Earlier in March, reports claimed that the company had finalized the lease agreement of its first showroom location in Mumbai. Last month, Bloomberg mentioned that the Mumbai showroom was gradually being prepared for its opening this month, and the first set of cars, Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs, shipped from Tesla’s factory in China, were billed to arrive in the country soon. According to reports, the Tesla vehicles were valued at Rs. 2.7 million ($31,988), with an import duty of about Rs. 2.1 million. The duty is in line with the standard 705 tariff levied by India, plus additional levies on imported vehicles below the $40,000 mark. The company had already started recruitment some months ago, intensifying it over the last few weeks in line with the opening which is scheduled to happen next week. Slowed global sales push the EV maker to India The Model Y remains the top-selling electric vehicle globally, and its popularity in India will help its acceptance despite the high import duties. The issue of the tariffs has been a major factor that Tesla has been considering in its plan to enter the Indian market, according to a statement from its Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja during its first-quarter earnings call. The sources also mentioned that the company is working on another showroom, which is expected to be located around the New Delhi area. The second showroom will open towards the end of July. Tesla’s foray into India comes at a time when the company is recording a decline in global sales in the second quarter. The slump countered Musk’s claim that the company has recovered from the blow it suffered as a result of his work with the Trump administration. Last month, India’s Heavy Industries Minister Kumara Swamy confirmed that Tesla has not shown an indication that it intends to set up electric vehicle production in India. He added that the company only showed interest in setting up showrooms within the country. United States President Donald Trump has always voiced his opposition to Tesla’s possible manufacturing ventures in India, saying the move is very unfair. Tesla has also had limited engagements with electric vehicle manufacturing programs in India. Although the electric vehicle maker participated in the initial stakeholders meeting about a scheme to promote the manufacturing of electric cars in India, it did not attend the next two consultation sessions. However, it is expected that the company will send a representative to subsequent sessions after its showroom is set up in the coming week.

On July 11, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs achieved a remarkable milestone, pulling in a staggering $204.9 million in total net inflows. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the sixth consecutive day of positive flows, signaling a robust and growing investor appetite for Ethereum-backed investment vehicles. What does this consistent influx of capital mean for the future of cryptocurrencies and traditional finance? Understanding the Surge: A Closer Look at Spot Ethereum ETFs The recent data from Farside Investors paints a clear picture of escalating interest in Spot Ethereum ETFs . These investment products allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This bridge between conventional finance and the crypto world has proven incredibly appealing, offering a regulated and accessible pathway into the digital asset space. Let’s break down the key players driving these significant inflows: BlackRock’s ETHA: Leading the pack with an impressive $137.1 million in inflows, BlackRock’s offering demonstrates strong institutional backing and confidence. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Following with $25.5 million, showcasing continued interest in Grayscale’s diversified product suite. Fidelity’s FETH: Contributing $12 million, highlighting Fidelity’s commitment to expanding its digital asset offerings. Grayscale’s ETHE: Adding another $10 million, indicating sustained interest in its flagship Ethereum product. Bitwise’s ETHW: Securing $8.6 million, reinforcing Bitwise’s position as a key player in the crypto ETF market. VanEck’s ETHV and ARK 21Shares’ CETH: Also saw notable inflows of $6.6 million and $5.1 million respectively, underscoring broad participation across various issuers. The fact that most other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day further emphasizes the concentrated interest in these top-performing funds. This trend is not merely about numbers; it reflects a deeper shift in how investors perceive and engage with digital assets. Why Are Ethereum Inflows Consistently Positive? The streak of six consecutive days of positive Ethereum inflows is a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics. Unlike the often volatile and unpredictable nature of direct crypto markets, the consistent inflows into ETFs suggest a more strategic, long-term investment perspective from a broader range of investors. But what’s fueling this sustained momentum? Several factors are at play: Regulatory Clarity: The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided a significant boost in legitimacy and regulatory clarity. This reduces perceived risks for institutional investors and wealth managers. Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through brokerage accounts. This eliminates the complexities of setting up crypto wallets, managing private keys, or dealing with less regulated crypto exchanges. Diversification: For many institutional portfolios, Ethereum offers a unique diversification opportunity beyond traditional assets and even Bitcoin. Its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts makes it a compelling asset. Growing Ecosystem: The Ethereum network continues to evolve and expand, with ongoing developments like the Dencun upgrade enhancing its scalability and efficiency. This fundamental growth underpins investor confidence in its long-term value. This consistent demand underscores a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly seen as legitimate components of diversified investment strategies. How Do These Inflows Impact Crypto Market Trends? The substantial Ethereum inflows are not just isolated events; they send ripples throughout the entire crypto ecosystem, influencing broader Crypto market trends . Ethereum, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often acts as a bellwether for the altcoin market. When Ethereum gains traction, it tends to pull other digital assets with it. Here’s how these inflows are shaping the market: Price Appreciation for ETH: Increased demand from ETF purchases directly contributes to upward price pressure on Ethereum. As more capital flows into these funds, issuers need to acquire more underlying ETH, reducing the available supply on exchanges. Positive Sentiment Spillover: The success of Ethereum ETFs can foster a more optimistic sentiment across the entire crypto market. It signals that institutional money is flowing in, validating the asset class and potentially attracting more retail investors. Altcoin Rally Potential: Historically, a strong Ethereum often precedes or accompanies rallies in other altcoins. Investors might rotate profits from ETH into other promising projects, or simply gain confidence in the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 sectors built on Ethereum. Increased Market Liquidity: The influx of capital through ETFs can enhance overall market liquidity, making it easier for large trades to occur without significant price slippage. While the immediate impact on price can be volatile, the long-term implications point towards a more stable and institutionally supported market structure for Ethereum and, by extension, other major cryptocurrencies. The Evolution of Digital Asset Investment The advent of Spot Ethereum ETFs represents a significant leap in the evolution of Digital asset investment . For years, investing in cryptocurrencies was largely confined to early adopters, tech enthusiasts, and risk-tolerant retail investors. The landscape has drastically changed, paving the way for mainstream adoption. Consider the benefits these ETFs offer: Feature Direct Crypto Ownership Spot Ethereum ETF Accessibility Requires crypto exchange account, wallet setup. Available through traditional brokerage accounts. Security Self-custody risks (lost keys, hacks) or exchange risks. Managed by regulated custodians, insured. Regulation Varies by jurisdiction, often less regulated. Regulated by SEC, subject to traditional financial oversight. Taxation Complex reporting for individual transactions. Simpler, like traditional stock investments. Liquidity Depends on exchange volume. High liquidity on major stock exchanges. However, it’s also crucial to acknowledge potential challenges. While ETFs mitigate some risks, they do not eliminate market volatility inherent to cryptocurrencies. Investors are still exposed to price fluctuations, and the fees associated with managing ETFs can eat into returns. Furthermore, while regulatory approval is a positive step, the broader regulatory framework for digital assets is still evolving, which could introduce future uncertainties. Fueling Institutional Crypto Adoption: A New Era Perhaps the most profound impact of these consistent inflows is their role in accelerating Institutional crypto adoption . For years, major financial institutions, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds largely remained on the sidelines, deterred by regulatory ambiguity, custody challenges, and market volatility. Now, with the availability of regulated Spot Ethereum ETFs, the narrative is shifting dramatically. Institutions are increasingly viewing Ethereum not as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate asset class with long-term growth potential. This newfound comfort is driven by several factors: Familiar Investment Vehicle: ETFs are a well-understood and trusted investment product for institutions. They integrate seamlessly into existing portfolio management systems and compliance frameworks. Reduced Operational Burden: Institutions no longer need to navigate the complexities of direct crypto custody, security, and trading infrastructure. The ETF issuer handles these operational aspects. Fiduciary Responsibility: For fiduciaries, investing in a regulated ETF is often more aligned with their mandates to protect client assets and adhere to strict compliance standards. Growing Demand from Clients: As retail and high-net-worth individuals express greater interest in crypto, institutions are compelled to offer regulated products to meet this demand. This surge in institutional interest is not just about capital; it’s about legitimization. When major financial players commit significant funds, it sends a powerful message that digital assets are here to stay and will play an increasingly important role in the global financial system. This marks a new era where crypto is no longer a niche investment but a recognized component of diversified portfolios. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor What do these developments mean for you, whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or a curious newcomer? Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep an eye on inflow data, regulatory updates, and technological advancements within the Ethereum ecosystem. Diversify Wisely: While Ethereum ETFs offer excellent exposure, consider how they fit into your overall investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Understand the Risks: Despite the positive trends, cryptocurrencies remain volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose and conduct thorough due diligence. Consider Your Access Point: Evaluate whether direct crypto ownership or an ETF is better suited for your investment goals, risk tolerance, and technical comfort level. Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Ethereum and Digital Assets The consistent and substantial inflows into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs , culminating in the impressive $204.9 million on July 11, represent a watershed moment for Ethereum and the broader digital asset space. This isn’t just about impressive numbers; it’s a clear signal of burgeoning investor confidence, accelerated institutional crypto adoption, and the undeniable maturation of the digital asset investment landscape. As traditional finance continues to embrace these innovative products, the lines between conventional and decentralized finance will blur further, paving the way for unprecedented growth and integration. The future of finance is unfolding before our eyes, and Ethereum ETFs are playing a pivotal role in shaping it.

In a detailed chart shared via X, Egrag outlines a long-term bullish setup that suggests XLM is gearing up for a major breakout. With XLM currently trading around $0.395 as of report time, the technical and fundamental indicators appear to be aligning, prompting the analyst to issue a clear call to action: “Be ready.” Egrag Crypto’s Macro Chart: The Cup and Handle Formation Egrag’s chart presents a compelling long-term structure that spans nearly a decade. At the heart of the analysis is a massive cup and handle pattern, a formation often associated with powerful bullish reversals. The “cup” is defined by a rounded base stretching from 2018 to 2023, while the emerging “handle” forms the final phase before a potential breakout. #XLM – Next Move: Be Ready pic.twitter.com/bk6DmygYS6 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 11, 2025 According to Egrag, XLM has repeatedly bounced from a reliable diagonal support trendline, marking key accumulation zones along the way. Each previous bounce has led to significant rallies, and XLM’s current position suggests another move is building. The price is now approaching the upper boundary of this structure, signaling a potential breakout point. Egrag identifies three major upside targets: Target 1 near $0.45 Target 2 around $0.65 Target 3 extending to $1.11, with an ultimate Fibonacci extension near $1.51 With XLM currently holding above the $0.39 mark, the asset appears to be entering the breakout phase highlighted in Egrag’s forecast. Market Momentum: XLM Price Surges Past Key Resistance Over the past week, XLM has surged by more than 25%, outperforming many other mid-cap cryptocurrencies. The rally comes as Bitcoin soars past $118,000, lifting broader market sentiment. XLM’s breakout above the $0.37 resistance level has brought renewed confidence to traders, many of whom now see $0.45 as the next technical target. The price has also re-entered the upper zone of a multi-year ascending channel, adding further credibility to Egrag’s projection. If current momentum holds, a move toward the $0.65 and $1.10 zones may follow in the medium term.

Notably, Franklin Templeton recently tokenized over $445 million in U.S. Treasuries on the Stellar network, marking one of the largest real-world asset integrations in crypto to date. Adding to the momentum, Stellar’s upcoming Protocol 23 upgrade, which will introduce Soroban, its native smart contracts platform, is set for release in August 2025. Soroban is expected to enable advanced DeFi capabilities and programmable assets, broadening Stellar’s utility and appeal to developers and institutions alike. Stellar Aligns for Breakout, Are You Ready? Egrag Crypto’s long-range analysis presents a technically and fundamentally supported case for a major move in XLM . With the price nearing critical resistance and institutional activity on the rise, Stellar may be on the verge of a breakout not seen since its previous cycle highs. While nothing in crypto is ever certain, the combination of historical support, bullish technical patterns, and real-world use cases makes one thing clear: this could be Stellar’s moment.

Minnesota Vikings linebacker Dallas Turner was duped out of $240,000 by a scammer who seemed to have intimate knowledge of his account, reports the Star Tribune. Someone posing as a Chase banker called Turner and made him think his account was under attack. Authorities are asking Chase to determine whether bank employees are involved because the scammer “was able to obtain sensitive account details including Turner’s full name, linked phone numbers and [his] LLC account info.” The fraudster called Turner on February 19th, alleging an impostor was attempting a wire transfer. Turner, convinced of the threat, rushed to a Chase branch and wired $120,000 to “Island Food Truck LLC.” That same day, he visited a separate Chase branch and transferred $120,000 to “CNL FL LLC.” Police say they have several suspects and charges are pending. To date, around $2,500 of Turner’s cash has been recovered.

This was announced by specialists at Santiment. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high of over $118,000. Against this backdrop, most of the leading cryptocurrencies outperformed Bitcoin in terms of price performance over the past seven days. The largest Ethereum wallets (10,000 ETH or more) collectively own 75.74% of the coin's total supply. This is the highest level of concentration of the asset among whales since May 2017, and it acts as a ”powerful bullish signal,” the company's experts noted. The number of XRP wallets storing more than 1 million coins reached an all-time high of 2,743. The volume of cryptocurrency they hold has also increased. Both trends are a ”very positive sign” for the asset from Ripple, Santiment emphasized. Analysts estimate that the altcoin season will continue as long as Bitcoin holds above the key psychological level of $110,000. In such a situation, traders are comfortable redistributing profits from the growth of digital gold into other coins, they added. Experts advised remaining cautious The value of the MVRV metric for Bitcoin is one of the alarming signals. The ratio of market price to realized value of the asset has already surpassed the value recorded in May, which was followed by a correction after the previous all-time high. Santiment also drew attention to the leadership in weekly growth by the meme-coin segment—plus 17%. This potentially points to the concluding phase of the market rally, experts believe. ”When speculative assets lead the market, it could mean that greed is peaking,” they noted. For Ethereum, an alarming signal is the extremely optimistic sentiment regarding the asset. This usually indicates that a short-term price peak is approaching, Santiment said. CoinMarketCap's altcoin index is at 27. The value indicates that traders still favor Bitcoin. The dominance of the first cryptocurrency is 62.5%. Analyst Matthew Hyland noted that despite this, altcoins have shown impressive growth. However, the real rally will begin after Bitcoin's dominance is reduced to 45%, he believes.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-12 14:10:04

In a recent development that has captivated the crypto market, Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance has demonstrated remarkable resilience, holding firm despite significant surges across the altcoin landscape. This intriguing phenomenon challenges traditional market interpretations and raises a pivotal question: What exactly is driving this unique market behavior, and what does it signal for the future of digital assets? Bitcoin Dominance: Unpacking Its Enduring Grip For many seasoned observers, a drop in Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has historically been a strong precursor to an “altcoin season”—a period where alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin significantly. However, as crypto analyst Matthew Hyland pointed out, and as reported by Cointelegraph, the current scenario paints a different picture. Despite recent impressive rallies from various altcoins, BTC.D has not seen the expected dramatic decline. Data from TradingView indeed shows a slight dip of merely 1.53% last week, a relatively minor fluctuation given the substantial gains recorded by many altcoins. This steadfastness in Bitcoin’s market share suggests a robust underlying strength. It implies that while altcoins are attracting considerable attention and capital, Bitcoin continues to be the primary gateway and holding asset for a large segment of investors. This stability in dominance, even amidst a vibrant altcoin surge, is a crucial indicator of the overall health and maturity of the digital asset space. Decoding the Altcoin Season: Is This Time Different? Traditionally, an altcoin season kicks off when investors rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, causing BTC.D to fall sharply. This current cycle, however, presents a compelling deviation. The altcoin rally has occurred concurrently with Bitcoin maintaining its strong market position. This simultaneous growth suggests that the market isn’t merely reallocating existing capital from BTC to altcoins. Instead, a more significant trend appears to be at play: the inflow of new capital into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Consider this: if existing capital were simply moving from Bitcoin to altcoins, Bitcoin’s dominance would plummet. The fact that it hasn’t, even with altcoins posting double-digit or even triple-digit gains in some cases, strongly supports the theory of fresh money entering the market. This new capital is not exclusively flowing into Bitcoin, nor is it solely targeting altcoins; it’s expanding the entire market pie, allowing both segments to grow in parallel. New Capital Inflows: Fueling the Broader Cryptocurrency Trends The concept of “new capital” is pivotal in understanding current cryptocurrency trends. This could stem from various sources: Institutional Investors: Increased adoption of crypto by traditional finance firms, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries. Retail Enthusiasm: A renewed wave of interest from individual investors, perhaps spurred by positive news cycles or mainstream adoption. Stablecoin Inflows: A rise in stablecoin market capitalization, often indicating sidelined capital waiting to be deployed into volatile assets. When new money flows into the market, it has the potential to elevate the valuations of both Bitcoin and altcoins. This broad-based liquidity can sustain rallies across the board, creating a more inclusive bull market where the gains are not zero-sum between BTC and its smaller counterparts. It’s a sign of a maturing market, where different segments can thrive simultaneously, rather than one at the expense of the other. What Does This Mean for BTC Price and Your Investment Strategy? For investors, understanding this dynamic is key. If new capital is indeed the primary driver, it bodes well for the long-term outlook of the entire crypto space, including the BTC price. A rising tide lifts all boats, and a continuous influx of fresh funds could push Bitcoin to new highs while also providing ample room for altcoins to flourish. However, it also presents a nuanced challenge: how to position your portfolio. While the “new capital” theory is optimistic, market dynamics can shift rapidly. A sudden decrease in new inflows or a rotation of existing capital could still impact dominance and altcoin performance. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors Given these unique market conditions, what steps can investors take? Monitor Bitcoin Dominance Closely: While it’s holding strong, a significant break below key support levels could still signal a more aggressive altcoin rotation. Diversify Wisely: Consider a balanced portfolio that includes both Bitcoin for its foundational strength and well-researched altcoins with strong fundamentals and innovative use cases. Research Beyond Hype: In a market fueled by new capital, it’s easy for less robust projects to get carried away in the general euphoria. Focus on projects with clear utility, active development, and solid communities. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and major industry developments that could influence capital flows. Practice Risk Management: As always, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital during volatile periods.

On July 4, WLFI development team proposed trading its non-transferable governance token as a tradable asset pending community approval. Pre-market listing of WLFI has already emerged on MEXC, BingX, and LBank, attracting investor interest. Arkham Intelligence data shows Trump’s publicly tagged crypto wallet rose by nearly 2.5% in 24 hours, reaching $1.41 million—driven largely by renewed WLFI activity. WLFI: A Token with Presidential Ties Though WLFI’s tokens are not yet openly tradable, the project’s roadmap suggests approval could come by Q3 2025. Trump is identified as the platform’s “chief crypto advocate,” and he stands to gain significantly from the token’s future liquidity. Media reports and public revelations put Trump and his relatives at control of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens—over half the total. A family-affiliated entity is also due 75% of all token sales proceeds over $30 million. A Billion-Dollar Difference Between Public and Private Crypto Trump’s public wallet may show only a modest $1.41 million, but Forbes estimates his true crypto riches to be over $246 million of post-tax proceeds. That difference is a function of the composition of Trump’s crypto exposure. His public wallet is full of supporter-donated meme tokens like TROG and TRUMP, while his underlying assets appear to be held in private corporate vehicles. If trading on WLFI were to ever become de-locked, Trump’s exposure would one day be worth almost $1 billion, more than the combined value of Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower together. Politics Meets Profits in a Regulatory Gray Zone The evolution of the WLFI token from a governance tool to a tradable asset breaks new ground in crypto innovation and political authority. Trump’s methodology—branding, speculation, and structural opacity—is familiar from his real estate and media playbook. But lawmakers are taking note. Last week, Senator Jeff Merkley proposed an amendment to restrict presidents from holding or promoting digital assets. Ethics groups like Public Citizen warn that Trump’s engagement with crypto sets a dangerous precedent for political profiteering in the decentralized economy.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-07-12 14:10:39
