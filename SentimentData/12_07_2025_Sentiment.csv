The Paris prosecutor’s office has confirmed that the national gendarmerie’s cybercrime unit will spearhead the probe. In a statement , Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau confirmed that the investigation targets both X as a corporate entity and unnamed individuals connected to the platform. The probe is centered on two serious potential offenses: the “alteration of the operation” of an automated data processing system, and the “fraudulent extraction of data” from such a system, allegedly carried out “by an organized group.” These charges suggest authorities are examining whether coordinated efforts were made to manipulate the platform’s algorithm and extract data that could compromise national or democratic integrity. French MP claims against X In February, two reports came in from the cybercrime section of the Paris prosecutor’s office about how the social network was allegedly using algorithm manipulation for foreign interference. This made Laure Beccuau’s office start its first investigation into X. Also, both an unnamed senior official from a French public institution described by French media as a cybersecurity manager and a member of parliament called Éric Bothorel made these claims. On Friday, Eric Bothorel welcomed news of the investigation moving forward, saying that they come “at a time when the new Grok update seems to be tipping over to the dark side of the force, with a predominance of questionable, even nauseating, content.” Suite à la communication du @parquetdeParis relative au dossier #X #Twitter et la nouvelle orientation que prend l’enquête notamment sur l'usage des algorithmes de X ""à des fins d'ingérence étrangère"", voici mon communiqué ⤵️ pic.twitter.com/GWXNw1B2GR — Éric Bothorel #FreeCécileKohler (@ebothorel) July 11, 2025 X took down the automatic account for its AI chatbot on July 9 after it spread antisemitic stories on Tuesday afternoon, which wasn’t the first time it happened. Eric Bothorel said that he filed his report as an MP, but also as a citizen who does not want Moscow, Silicon Valley, or anyone else to distort democratic conversations. “I was convinced that information bias, which is particularly strong on the X platform, was serving Elon Musk’s political opinions, and that this could only be achieved through algorithmic manipulation,” the elected official stated. As the prosecutor for Paris, Beccuau has led cases involving the hacking site BreachForums. She is also in charge of the ongoing legal investigation into Telegram and its CEO, Pavel Durov, who was arrested on suspicion of helping criminals use the app. Since then, Durov has been permitted by the court to leave France for Dubai, but the probe is still going on. This is proof that Musk and X are up for a run. European Commission to open investigation into Grok Meanwhile, the European Commission is in touch with X about this issue. Some European lawmakers and the Polish government pressed the European Commission to open an investigation into Grok under the EU’s flagship online safety rules. In Turkey, Grok has been banned for insulting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his late mother. The reason for this is that there is also a lot of damaging and offensive content in these sets, like hate speech and even material about sexually abusing children on the internet. Because the data sets are so big, getting rid of all of this information would be very hard and time-consuming. Grok can also see all of X’s data, which is something other robots can’t do. This makes it more likely that it will repeat content from the platform. Still, Musk has not been swayed. On Thursday, as CEO of Tesla, he revealed that Grok would soon be available in all of its cars. Some people think that the events are in line with Musk’s history of pushing the limits to bring about new ideas. The CEO of a tech company, Katie Harbath, says, “Elon has a reputation of putting stuff out there, getting fast blowback and then making a change.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This isn’t just a casual tweet; it’s a direct challenge to journalistic integrity and a spotlight on the often-contentious relationship between traditional media and the rapidly evolving crypto space. What exactly did CZ claim, and why does this accusation resonate so deeply within the community? CZ ‘s Fiery Accusation: Unpacking the ‘Hit Piece’ Claim On a prominent social media platform, CZ didn’t mince words. He asserted that Bloomberg had once again targeted him with an article, going as far as to suggest it was ‘sponsored by a competitor.’ Furthermore, he highlighted that the piece contained ‘so many factual errors I don’t even know where to begin.’ This isn’t the first time CZ has voiced strong opinions about media coverage, but the direct accusation of a ‘sponsored’ attack elevates this particular incident to a new level of concern for those following crypto news . Let’s break down the core elements of CZ’s claim: The ‘Hit Piece’ Label: This term implies an article designed to damage reputation, often with a biased or incomplete portrayal of facts. It suggests malicious intent rather than objective reporting. ‘Sponsored by a Competitor’: This is a grave accusation, implying a conflict of interest and a breach of journalistic ethics. If true, it would mean Bloomberg’s reporting was influenced by external, vested interests. ‘Factual Errors’: This is perhaps the most actionable part of the accusation. Identifying and correcting factual inaccuracies is a standard part of journalistic accountability. However, without specific examples provided by CZ at the time of his initial statement, the community is left to speculate. Understanding the Context: Bloomberg ‘s Role in Financial Reporting To fully grasp the weight of CZ’s words, it’s crucial to understand who Bloomberg is. Bloomberg LP is a privately held financial, software, data, and media company headquartered in New York City. It’s renowned for its Bloomberg Terminal, a sophisticated software system that provides financial data, analytics, and trading tools to financial professionals. Its news arm, Bloomberg News, is one of the world’s largest financial news organizations, known for its extensive global network of reporters and its focus on market-moving information, economics, and business. Given Bloomberg’s stature and influence, an accusation of a ‘hit piece’ or being ‘sponsored’ is not taken lightly. It raises questions about: Journalistic Integrity: Is a reputable news organization compromising its standards for external influence? Trust in Information: If such claims are true, how can readers trust the information they consume, especially in volatile markets like crypto? Power Dynamics: It highlights the immense power media outlets wield in shaping public perception and market sentiment. The Broader Challenge of Media Bias in Crypto CZ’s accusation isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a symptom of a larger, ongoing tension surrounding media bias in the coverage of cryptocurrencies. For years, the crypto community has often felt that mainstream media outlets, including prominent ones, approach the industry with a skeptical, often negative, or ill-informed bias. This perceived bias can manifest in several ways: Focus on Negatives: Overemphasis on scams, hacks, illicit activities, and price crashes, while underreporting technological advancements, adoption, and positive use cases. Lack of Understanding: Journalists sometimes struggle with the technical complexities of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, leading to misinterpretations or oversimplifications. Traditional Finance Lens: Applying traditional financial paradigms to a revolutionary technology that often defies them, leading to critical assessments based on outdated frameworks. Regulatory Uncertainty: Reporting often highlights regulatory crackdowns or warnings, contributing to a narrative of risk and instability. This perceived bias creates a feedback loop: negative coverage can fuel public distrust, potentially impacting adoption and regulatory attitudes, which then can be cited in further negative reporting. It’s a challenging environment for any entity operating in the crypto space, particularly a dominant player like Binance . The Impact on Binance and the Crypto Ecosystem As the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance is constantly under the microscope. Its operations span the globe, making it subject to diverse regulatory frameworks and intense scrutiny from governments, financial institutions, and media alike. When its founder, CZ , makes such a public statement against a major media outlet, it has several potential repercussions. Binance has faced its share of regulatory challenges and media scrutiny in the past, making CZ’s response understandable within that context. The exchange has been working to enhance its compliance frameworks and engage more proactively with regulators, making accurate and fair media representation crucial to its ongoing efforts. Navigating the Information Landscape: Actionable Insights for Consuming Crypto News In an era where information spreads rapidly and accusations fly, how can individuals interested in crypto discern truth from noise? CZ’s claims against Bloomberg serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of critical media literacy. Here are some actionable insights: Verify Sources: Don’t just read the headline. Who published the article? What is their reputation? Do they have a track record of balanced reporting? Look for Evidence: Does the article cite specific data, quotes, or documents? Are claims substantiated with verifiable facts, or are they based on anonymous sources or speculation? Consider Multiple Perspectives: Read articles from various news outlets, including those with different editorial slants. Compare their narratives and factual reporting. Follow Original Statements: If a public figure like CZ makes a claim, try to find their original statement (e.g., on their social media, official press releases) rather than relying solely on third-party interpretations. Understand Motivations: Consider the potential motivations of both the reporter/outlet and the subject of the article. Is there a financial interest, a competitive angle, or a desire to shape public opinion? Engage with the Community (Critically): Online crypto communities can offer valuable insights and different viewpoints, but also be aware of echo chambers and misinformation within these groups. Always cross-reference. By adopting a more discerning approach to crypto news , readers can better navigate the complex and often polarized information landscape, making more informed decisions about their investments and understanding of the industry. The Ongoing Saga: What’s Next for CZ , Bloomberg , and Binance ? The accusation by CZ against Bloomberg is more than just a public spat; it’s a reflection of the intense scrutiny and high stakes involved in the cryptocurrency industry. Whether Bloomberg will issue a formal response, provide clarification, or simply stand by its reporting remains to be seen. What is clear is that this incident highlights the delicate balance between journalistic freedom and the potential for perceived or actual bias to influence public perception. For Binance , maintaining a strong public image and fostering trust among its vast user base is paramount. For the broader crypto community, it’s a call to arms for greater media literacy and a deeper understanding of the forces that shape narratives around digital assets. As the crypto space continues to mature, the relationship between its key players and traditional media will undoubtedly evolve, hopefully towards more balanced, informed, and constructive dialogue.

After reaching an unprecedented all-time high, many are wondering: what’s next for the king of crypto? A recent insightful observation from a prominent industry expert suggests that the stage might be set for even greater heights. This isn’t just about celebrating past achievements; it’s about understanding the underlying market dynamics that could propel Bitcoin into a new phase of growth. Prepare to delve into the fascinating world of market indicators and expert analysis that points towards significant Bitcoin upside potential . Unlocking the Mystery: What Drives Bitcoin Upside Potential? In a recent revelation that has sparked considerable discussion across the crypto community, Jeff Park, the astute head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, shared a compelling perspective on Bitcoin’s current market standing. Despite Bitcoin unit price recently establishing a new all-time high, Park highlighted several intriguing observations on X (formerly Twitter): Low Open Interest: This suggests that there isn’t an excessive amount of speculative capital currently tied up in Bitcoin derivatives contracts. A low open interest can indicate that the market isn’t overheated with leveraged bets, leaving room for fresh capital to enter. Low Implied Volatility: Implied volatility reflects the market’s expectation of future price swings. When it’s low, it suggests that options traders are not anticipating large, sudden movements. While counterintuitive, this can sometimes precede significant price action, as the market might be underestimating an impending shift. Low Liquidity: A market with low liquidity means that large orders can have a more significant impact on price. While it can lead to increased volatility during sell-offs, it can also amplify upward movements if strong buying pressure emerges. Park succinctly summarized his analysis, stating, “All you need is a catalyst. No promises, but the probability is [Bitcoin goes] higher now than at any point this year.” This statement is a powerful beacon of hope for many investors, suggesting that the current calm might be the precursor to a storm of positive price action. It implies that the foundational elements for a substantial move are in place, awaiting the right trigger. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook: What Do the Indicators Say? Understanding the broader crypto market outlook requires more than just glancing at price charts. It involves deciphering complex market indicators that offer clues about investor sentiment and potential future movements. Jeff Park’s analysis zeroes in on three critical metrics that, when combined, paint a picture of a market poised for a significant shift, rather than one on the verge of exhaustion. Why Low Open Interest Matters Open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts (like futures or options) that have not yet been settled. High open interest often correlates with high speculative activity and can sometimes signal an overheated market, vulnerable to a sharp correction. Conversely, a low open interest, as observed by Park, can indicate a less crowded trade, meaning there’s less leveraged money that needs to be flushed out. This leaves ample room for new capital inflows to drive prices higher without immediate resistance from over-leveraged positions. The Significance of Low Implied Volatility Implied volatility (IV) is derived from the prices of options contracts and reflects the market’s expectation of future price fluctuations. When IV is low, it means options are cheaper, and traders are not pricing in large swings. Historically, periods of low implied volatility have often preceded significant price movements in Bitcoin. It’s akin to a coiled spring – a period of relative calm before a powerful release. This “calm before the storm” scenario suggests that the market might be underestimating Bitcoin’s true potential for an upward surge. The Double-Edged Sword of Low Liquidity Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without significantly impacting its price. Low liquidity means that even relatively small buy or sell orders can cause noticeable price movements. While this can exacerbate downward pressure during corrections, in an environment ripe for a catalyst, low liquidity can amplify upward momentum. If a wave of buying interest emerges, the limited supply available at current prices can quickly push Bitcoin’s value higher, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. Decoding Bitcoin Price Prediction: Are We Headed Higher? The core of Jeff Park’s statement lies in his Bitcoin price prediction : the probability of Bitcoin going higher now is greater than at any point this year. This isn’t just a hopeful wish; it’s an assessment based on the confluence of these specific market conditions. For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding the methodology behind such predictions is crucial. Analysts like Park often look for divergences between price action and underlying market health indicators. When Bitcoin hits a new all-time high, but speculative metrics like open interest and implied volatility remain subdued, it suggests that the rally isn’t fueled by irrational exuberance or excessive leverage. Instead, it implies a more organic, sustainable growth, potentially driven by spot market demand and long-term conviction. Consider the following: Healthy Consolidation: The current market structure might be a period of healthy consolidation after reaching an ATH, rather than a top. This allows new buyers to enter and previous holders to take profits without crashing the market. Reduced Speculative Overhang: With low open interest, there’s less risk of a massive cascade of liquidations if the price were to dip slightly, making the market more resilient to minor corrections. Anticipation of Catalysts: The market is effectively a dry tinderbox, waiting for a spark. Potential catalysts could include: Further institutional adoption (e.g., new ETF approvals, corporate treasury allocations). Significant regulatory clarity or positive legislative developments. Macroeconomic shifts favoring scarce assets (e.g., inflation concerns, weakening fiat currencies). Technological advancements or network upgrades (though less direct for BTC price action, it can boost overall crypto sentiment). Embracing the BTC All-Time High: A Foundation for Future Growth? Reaching a BTC All-Time High is often seen as a significant psychological and technical milestone. For some, it signals the peak, while for others, it’s merely a stepping stone. Jeff Park’s analysis suggests the latter. Instead of being a point of exhaustion, this ATH, coupled with the subdued derivatives market, might represent a robust foundation for the next leg up. Historically, Bitcoin has often consolidated after hitting new highs before embarking on further parabolic runs. What makes this particular ATH different, according to Park, is the absence of the typical speculative frenzy that often accompanies such milestones. This indicates that the current price discovery is perhaps more fundamentally driven, allowing for a more sustainable climb. Key takeaways from the current ATH scenario: Indicator Current State (per Park) Implication for Upside Open Interest Low Less leverage, more room for fresh capital. Implied Volatility Low Market underestimating future price moves, coiled spring. Liquidity Low Amplifies price movements with strong buying pressure. Price Action New All-Time High Strong underlying demand, not overleveraged. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Analysis? The insights from Jeff Park, coming from Bitwise – a prominent institutional crypto asset manager – carry significant weight. His perspective offers a glimpse into how sophisticated players conduct their institutional crypto analysis . For institutional investors, risk management and understanding market structure are paramount. The observations of low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity are not just technical points; they are crucial signals for deployment of large capital. Institutions typically seek markets that offer both potential for growth and manageable risk. A market that has hit an ATH but isn’t showing signs of speculative overheating can be particularly attractive. It suggests that the price appreciation is more “real” and less prone to sudden, violent corrections driven by leveraged liquidations. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor not just price, but also key on-chain and derivatives metrics. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, market volatility is inherent. Always practice sound risk management, including setting stop-losses and only investing what you can afford to lose. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s journey is often characterized by significant corrections within broader bull markets. A long-term perspective often yields the best results. Identify Catalysts: Keep an eye on potential catalysts mentioned earlier, as these could be the triggers for the next major move. Are There Any Challenges or Counterarguments? While Jeff Park’s analysis is compelling, it’s essential to consider potential challenges. The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. A “catalyst” might not materialize as expected, or unforeseen macroeconomic events could shift sentiment. Regulatory crackdowns, significant exchange hacks, or sustained FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) could also impact price action. Moreover, low liquidity, while amplifying upside, can also amplify downside if a strong selling wave emerges. Investors should always conduct their own due diligence and consider a balanced perspective. Conclusion: The Path Ahead for Bitcoin Jeff Park’s insightful analysis from Bitwise provides a powerful bullish argument for Bitcoin’s immediate future. By highlighting the subdued nature of speculative indicators despite a new all-time high, he paints a picture of a market that is consolidating healthily and preparing for its next major move. The low open interest, implied volatility, and liquidity suggest a market that is not over-leveraged, but rather poised for an “explosive” surge once the right catalyst emerges. While no one can promise future returns, the confluence of these factors significantly enhances the probability of further Bitcoin upside potential . As Bitcoin continues to mature and gain wider acceptance, understanding these nuanced market signals becomes increasingly vital for navigating its exciting journey.

Pulte has reacted to reports that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is considering resigning. Pulte posted on his official X account that he is encouraged by the reports of Chair Powell considering to resign. “I’m encouraged by reports that Jerome Powell is considering resigning. I think this will be the right decision for America, and the economy will boom,” Pulte noted . The Beef Between Chair Powell and President Donald Trump Although not officially confirmed, the reports that Fed Chair Powell is considering to resign stems from the misalignment with the Donald Trump administration. In the past few months, President Trump has urged Chair Powell to lower the interest rates to bolster the country’s economic growth. “Tech Stocks, Industrial Stocks, Nasdaq, hit all-time high, record high! Crypto through is the roof, Nvidia is up 47% since Trump tariffs. USA is taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs … .The Fed should rapidly lower rates to reflect this strength,” Trump noted on TruthSocial. According to President Trump, the Fed ought to have cut its benchmark rate by 3 points, since the inflation has declined. However, the Fed Chair has reiterated several times that the tariffs will likely increase inflation amid weakening U.S. dollar. What Next for Crypto? If Fed Chair Powell resigns in the coming days as predicted by Pulte, President Trump will replace him with his team members. As a result, the odds of several rate cuts in the United States before the end of 2025 will skyrocket.With the crypto market already in the early stages of a parabolic rally, several rate cuts could further fuel the underlying bullish outlook.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-11 22:26:32

Florida AG subpoenaed internal records to verify Robinhood’s claim of being the cheapest crypto trading platform. Despite scrutiny, Robinhood pushes global crypto growth with $200M Bitstamp acquisition completed. Florida Launches Investigation into Robinhood Crypto Robinhood Crypto LLC is facing a state-level investigation in Florida over how it promotes its trading costs. The state’s Attorney General, James Uthmeier, said the platform’s claim to offer “the least expensive way to purchase crypto” doesn’t appear to be backed by evidence. “Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive,” Uthmeier said. The AG’s office has issued a subpoena for internal documents, including any records supporting the claim that Robinhood offers the lowest trading costs on average. Marketing vs. Actual Costs Robinhood operates as a commission-free platform but earns from routing trades to third-party firms through payment for order flow. Florida officials say this practice may mean users pay more than expected, even if they aren’t charged upfront fees. The state’s probe will look at whether customers are given a full picture of what they pay. Uthmeier added, “When consumers buy and sell crypto assets, they deserve transparency in their transactions.” SEC Closes Separate Probe into Robinhood Crypto While Robinhood now faces scrutiny in Florida, it recently cleared a federal regulatory hurdle. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ended its long-standing investigation into the company’s crypto unit without taking action. That decision removes a major obstacle for Robinhood as it pushes deeper into digital assets. The company also sent a proposal to the SEC last month, calling for updated rules around tokenized real-world assets. It asked regulators to treat blockchain-based versions of assets like real estate or stocks the same as their traditional forms, rather than as derivatives. Despite the state investigation, Robinhood is moving ahead with its global expansion. As CryptoPotato reported , the company has completed a $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, gaining access to customers across Europe, the UK, and Asia. The move marks a shift toward serving larger institutions alongside retail users. Meanwhile, Robinhood shares ended Thursday at $98.70, up 4.4% for the day, according to Yahoo Finance .

While Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, smashing through its previous all-time highs and setting new records, a curious phenomenon is unfolding across the broader market. Despite Bitcoin’s triumphant ascent, a significant portion of the altcoin market remains surprisingly subdued, exhibiting what many are calling a distinct altcoin lag . This unusual divergence raises crucial questions for investors and enthusiasts alike: Is this a sign of a healthier, more sustainable rally, or a precursor to further market shifts? Let’s delve into the data and unravel what this unique market dynamic truly signifies for the future of cryptocurrency trends . Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Phenomenon Bitcoin’s journey to a new all-time high has been nothing short of spectacular. This latest surge has cemented its position as the undisputed leader of the crypto realm. Data cited by The Kobeissi Letter, referencing Sentimentrader on X, highlights this dominance starkly: despite Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high, nearly 0% of other cryptocurrencies are trading within 5% of their respective 252-day highs. This statistic underscores a highly concentrated rally, where capital seems to be flowing almost exclusively into Bitcoin. What’s driving this singular focus on Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Institutional Inflow: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large investment firms, pension funds, and wealth managers now have a regulated, accessible vehicle to gain exposure to Bitcoin, which was previously challenging. This influx of significant capital naturally prioritizes the most liquid and established asset. Halving Narrative: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, continues to be a powerful narrative. Historically, halvings have preceded major bull runs, creating anticipation and driving demand. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and traditional financial instability. This perception attracts a broader range of investors seeking a safe haven. First-Mover Advantage: As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin possesses unparalleled brand recognition, network security, and liquidity, making it the primary choice for new capital entering the crypto space. The Curious Case of Altcoin Lag : Why Aren’t They Following? The stark contrast between Bitcoin’s stellar performance and the subdued state of altcoins is perplexing to many. In previous bull cycles, a Bitcoin rally typically served as a precursor, pulling the entire market upwards, with altcoins eventually experiencing even larger percentage gains. So, why the current altcoin lag ? The Sentimentrader statistic – almost zero altcoins within 5% of their 252-day highs – paints a clear picture of underperformance. Here are key reasons contributing to this divergence: Liquidity Concentration: The immense capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs has absorbed a significant portion of the new money entering the crypto market. This means less liquidity is immediately available to trickle down into altcoins. Investors are opting for the most direct and regulated exposure to the asset class, which is currently Bitcoin. Risk Aversion: During the initial stages of a bull market, or when macroeconomic conditions are uncertain, investors tend to be more risk-averse. They prefer to allocate capital to Bitcoin, perceived as the safest and most established crypto asset, before venturing into the higher-risk, higher-reward altcoin space. Lack of Dominant Altcoin Narratives (Yet): While some altcoin sectors like AI, DePIN, or Real World Assets (RWAs) are gaining traction, a broad, compelling narrative that captures widespread retail and institutional attention for altcoins, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF story, has not fully materialized. Market Maturity: The crypto market is maturing. Institutional participants are more discerning. They conduct deeper due diligence, focusing on fundamental value, regulatory clarity, and sustainable tokenomics, rather than simply chasing speculative gains across all altcoins. Phased Market Cycles: Historically, crypto bull markets unfold in phases. Bitcoin often leads the charge, followed by large-cap altcoins (like Ethereum), and then smaller-cap altcoins and meme coins. The current market might simply be in the ‘Bitcoin-first’ phase. Historical Context: Past Rallies and Bitcoin All-Time High Behaviors To understand the current market, it’s crucial to look at historical precedents. Past rallies often provide clues, though every cycle has its unique characteristics. The original report notes that in previous rallies, Bitcoin highs coincided with stronger altcoin performance, citing examples where 75% (likely referring to the Feb 2021 period) and 40% (perhaps Nov 2021) of altcoins showed robust gains. Consider the 2017 and 2021 bull runs: 2017 Bull Run: Bitcoin’s initial surge to its then all-time high was followed by an explosive ‘altcoin season’ in early 2018, where many altcoins saw parabolic gains, some even outperforming Bitcoin significantly. 2020-2021 Bull Run: Bitcoin broke its 2017 high in late 2020 and continued its ascent into 2021. This was again followed by a broad altcoin rally, particularly strong in spring 2021, driven by DeFi, NFTs, and other emerging narratives. Ethereum, in particular, saw substantial growth. The current cycle, while exhibiting Bitcoin’s leadership, shows a more pronounced and prolonged altcoin lag at this stage. This suggests a potentially more deliberate and perhaps more institutionally-driven market. The ‘smart money’ might be consolidating positions in Bitcoin before strategically diversifying into select altcoins with strong fundamentals or compelling narratives. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis : What Does This Divergence Mean? This unusual divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins presents both challenges and opportunities for investors. A thorough crypto market analysis is essential to interpret these signals correctly. Potential Interpretations: More Upside for Bitcoin: The initial report suggests that the current divergence implies Bitcoin’s rally may still have room to run. If altcoins haven’t caught up yet, it could mean that the broader market has not yet reached its peak euphoria phase, and Bitcoin’s ascent is still in its primary stage. A Healthier, More Sustainable Rally: Some analysts argue that a Bitcoin-led rally, rather than a speculative altcoin frenzy, indicates a more mature and sustainable market. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin provides a strong foundation, potentially leading to less volatile, more gradual growth across the ecosystem. Impending Altcoin Season: Many seasoned investors view the current lag as a sign that an ‘altcoin season’ is merely delayed, not canceled. Once Bitcoin consolidates its gains or its momentum slows, capital could rotate into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. Increased Market Bifurcation: It’s also possible that the market is becoming more bifurcated, with Bitcoin establishing itself as a premier, lower-risk asset, while altcoins remain a higher-risk, higher-reward play. This could lead to a permanent shift in how different segments of the crypto market behave. Actionable Insights for Investors: Patience is Key: For altcoin holders, patience may be paramount. Historical patterns suggest that altcoins often follow Bitcoin’s lead, albeit with a delay. Strategic Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing portfolios. If Bitcoin has significantly outperformed, taking some profits and reallocating to fundamentally strong altcoins that have lagged could be a strategy, assuming you believe in their long-term potential. Focus on Fundamentals: When considering altcoins, prioritize projects with strong technology, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. Avoid purely speculative plays. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to use DCA strategies to accumulate positions in both Bitcoin and chosen altcoins, mitigating volatility risks. Risk Management: Understand that altcoins carry higher risk. Diversify your altcoin holdings and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Future Cryptocurrency Trends : What to Expect Next? Predicting the future of cryptocurrency trends is always challenging, but the current market dynamics offer some clues about potential paths forward. The divergence between Bitcoin and altcoins sets the stage for several interesting scenarios: Rotation into Large-Cap Altcoins: Once Bitcoin’s initial surge cools, capital may first rotate into established large-cap altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and others with significant ecosystems and development activity. Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades, particularly those related to scalability and efficiency, could serve as a major catalyst. Sector-Specific Rallies: Instead of a broad altcoin season, we might see more targeted rallies in specific sectors that are gaining traction. This could include AI-related tokens, DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), GameFi, or Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization projects. Investors will need to be highly selective. Increased Volatility for Altcoins: As capital moves more strategically, altcoins might experience more pronounced swings. Those with weak fundamentals or limited utility could struggle to regain their previous highs, while strong projects could see significant gains. Regulatory Impact: The evolving regulatory landscape will play a crucial role. Clearer regulations could attract more institutional money into altcoins, while uncertainty could continue to dampen enthusiasm. Innovation Driving Adoption: Continued innovation in blockchain technology, such as advancements in layer-2 solutions, cross-chain interoperability, and user-friendly applications, will be critical for driving broader adoption and, consequently, altcoin growth. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these potential shifts is paramount. The current Bitcoin-led rally could be laying the groundwork for a broader market expansion, but it may unfold differently than in past cycles, demanding a more nuanced investment approach. In conclusion, while Bitcoin’s ascent to new highs is a cause for celebration among its holders, the accompanying altcoin lag is a notable characteristic of the current market cycle. This divergence, as highlighted by Sentimentrader, suggests that while Bitcoin may still have significant upside potential, the broader market’s full rally might be yet to come, or it may unfold in a more selective and mature manner than previously observed. Understanding the forces driving Bitcoin’s dominance and the reasons behind altcoin’s current underperformance is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto landscape. Patience, strategic analysis, and a focus on fundamental value will be key for investors looking to capitalize on the next phase of cryptocurrency trends .

Thanks to the coin’s sharp rise this week, Satoshi’s fortune has grown by billions of dollars. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, the recent Bitcoin price rally has boosted the mysterious creator’s net worth. Satoshi Nakamoto is now reportedly richer than Amancio Ortega, the founder of fashion giant Zara. He is now ranked as the 12th richest person in the world. Bitcoin’s Price Rally Sends Nakamoto’s Net Worth Soaring On Thursday, July 10, the top coin reached a record high of $116,842, sparking even more excitement in the crypto market. By Friday, Bitcoin ‘s price climbed further to hit $118,909, a new all-time high. However, the market has pulled back slightly, now trading at $117,690, but up by 5.78% in the last 24 hours according to CoinMarketCap data. This substantial rise followed a massive $1.18 billion inflow into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This marked the most significant single-day investment into the investment funds in 2025 so far. As a result of this surge, Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash, believed to be about 1.096 million BTC, grew significantly in value. In just 24 hours, the worth of these coins jumped by more than $8 billion. As of now, his holdings are valued at approximately $129.42 billion. Satoshi Nakamoto: One of the Richest, But Still Unknown Despite this staggering wealth, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. The individual or group behind the name has never revealed their identity. Even more intriguing, the Bitcoin linked to Satoshi has never been moved or spent since the cryptocurrency’s early days. His crypto wallets have remained dormant for over 15 years. This silence has fueled endless debate in the crypto world. Some believe Satoshi is gone, while others think he is choosing to stay hidden forever. His untouched fortune adds to the legend of Bitcoin’s creation. Many see it as a sign that Satoshi wanted the digital to be for the people, not for personal gain. Bitcoin’s Big Week The flagship crypto has seen one of its strongest weeks in 2025. Reportedly, it is on track for nearly a 10% weekly gain. The crypto market has responded strongly to rising demand, especially from institutional investors pouring money into Bitcoin ETFs. Recently, 10x Research analyst Markus Thielen said many traders haven’t bought enough Bitcoin after last month’s options expiry. He believes this could lead to a rally that pushes BTC up to $133,000 by September. As the crypto asset grows and gains mainstream acceptance, so too does the value of Satoshi Nakamoto’s hidden fortune.

48064040,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=177288,1752273648,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48064040.jpeg,Binance Stablecoin: Unpacking the Explosive USD1 Allegations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-stablecoin-usd1-allegations/,"The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to controversy, but a recent Bloomberg report has sent shockwaves through the industry, pointing fingers at crypto giant Binance. At the heart of the matter lies a stablecoin named USD1, reportedly tied to the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLF). This report suggests a deep involvement from Binance in the creation and distribution of this particular Binance Stablecoin , raising significant questions about political influence, business ethics, and the very fabric of the digital asset space. Binance Stablecoin: Did the Crypto Giant Help Launch USD1? According to a bombshell report from Bloomberg, crypto exchange powerhouse Binance allegedly played a pivotal role in the development and deployment of USD1, a stablecoin linked to the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial (WLF). The publication, citing three individuals familiar with the situation, claims that Binance assisted in writing the smart contract for USD1. This is a significant technical undertaking, as smart contracts are the foundational code that governs how a digital asset operates on a blockchain, dictating its rules, issuance, and transfer mechanisms. If true, this involvement would mean Binance provided core technological infrastructure for WLF’s stablecoin ambitions. Beyond just the technical development, the report further alleges that Binance facilitated the stablecoin’s availability for use through a massive $2 billion transaction. While the exact nature of this transaction remains somewhat opaque in the initial report, it suggests a substantial financial commitment or arrangement that would have enabled USD1 to gain significant liquidity and reach within the crypto ecosystem. This level of alleged involvement, both technical and financial, paints a picture of a much deeper partnership than mere listing or advisory roles, thrusting the Binance Stablecoin narrative into an entirely new light. Unpacking USD1 Stablecoin: What Are Its Controversial Ties? The USD1 Stablecoin itself is a central figure in this unfolding drama. Stablecoins are a crucial component of the cryptocurrency market, designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They aim to combine the benefits of blockchain technology (such as fast, low-cost transactions) with the stability of traditional currencies, making them ideal for trading, remittances, and hedging against crypto volatility. However, the controversy surrounding USD1 stems not from its technical design, but from its reported associations. USD1 is linked to World Liberty Financial (WLF), an entity associated with the Trump family. This connection immediately raises eyebrows, especially given the current political climate and the increasing scrutiny on the intersection of politics and finance. The idea of a stablecoin, a digital asset meant to be neutral and universally accessible, having direct ties to a prominent political family introduces a layer of complexity and potential conflict that is rarely seen in the crypto space. The report’s implication that political influence was potentially leveraged for business gain through this stablecoin further complicates the narrative, prompting a deeper look into the transparency and governance of such ventures. World Liberty Financial: Is Political Influence Shaping Crypto? The involvement of World Liberty Financial and its alleged ties to the Trump family introduces a critical dimension to this story: the potential for political influence to shape the trajectory of a cryptocurrency project. The Bloomberg report explicitly highlights a ‘conflict of interest issue,’ suggesting that political sway may have been used to advance business interests within the digital asset sphere. This isn’t just about a company launching a stablecoin; it’s about who that company is connected to, and how those connections might impact the broader market and regulatory landscape. In an industry that often champions decentralization and independence from traditional financial and political structures, such allegations are particularly potent. They challenge the perception of crypto as a purely meritocratic or technologically driven space, suggesting that real-world political capital could be a significant factor in a project’s success or adoption. For regulators, this scenario could underscore the urgent need for clearer guidelines on political lobbying, transparency in stablecoin reserves, and the prevention of undue influence in the burgeoning digital economy. The very notion of a politically connected stablecoin, whether through direct involvement or indirect influence, sparks debate about the future integrity and perceived neutrality of digital finance. Crypto Conflict of Interest: How Did CZ Respond to the Allegations? The allegations of a Crypto Conflict of Interest involving Binance and the USD1 stablecoin naturally drew a swift response from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). Known for his direct communication style, CZ took to social media to address the claims, stating unequivocally that the article’s claims are ‘groundless.’ This direct denial from one of the most influential figures in the crypto world adds another layer of complexity to the narrative, pitting a major financial news outlet’s investigative reporting against the public statements of a powerful industry leader. CZ’s denial highlights the challenge of verifying information in the fast-paced and often opaque world of cryptocurrency. On one hand, investigative journalism plays a vital role in holding powerful entities accountable. On the other hand, the crypto industry has frequently been the target of misinformation or sensationalized reporting, leading to a climate of skepticism. Binance, under CZ’s leadership, has faced numerous regulatory challenges and legal battles globally, making any new allegation, especially one involving political ties, a significant point of concern for its reputation and ongoing operations. The market and public will now watch closely to see if further evidence emerges to substantiate or refute Bloomberg’s claims. Beyond the Headlines: What Does This Mean for Blockchain News and Trust? This Bloomberg report is more than just a piece of breaking Blockchain News ; it’s a potent reminder of the growing pains and evolving challenges within the digital asset industry. Allegations of a major exchange facilitating a stablecoin for a politically connected entity, coupled with claims of a conflict of interest, underscore several critical themes that the crypto world must confront: Regulatory Scrutiny: As crypto moves further into the mainstream, it inevitably attracts more attention from regulators. Reports like this will likely intensify calls for stricter oversight, particularly concerning stablecoins, their reserves, and the entities that issue or facilitate them. Governments are increasingly concerned about financial stability, consumer protection, and preventing illicit activities, and politically charged collaborations could accelerate regulatory actions. Industry Transparency: The incident highlights the ongoing need for greater transparency within the crypto ecosystem. While blockchain technology itself is transparent, the operations of centralized exchanges and the relationships between various crypto projects and traditional entities often remain opaque. Increased transparency regarding partnerships, funding, and governance structures could help build greater trust. Trust and Reputation: For Binance, a company that has worked to navigate a complex global regulatory landscape, these allegations could impact its reputation and perceived trustworthiness. For the broader crypto industry, such stories can erode public confidence, making it harder to attract new users and institutional adoption. Maintaining trust is paramount for the long-term growth and legitimacy of digital assets. The Interplay of Power: The report clearly demonstrates how traditional power structures—political influence and established media—are increasingly intersecting with the nascent world of crypto. This dynamic will continue to shape the industry’s future, as crypto projects navigate not just technological hurdles but also complex political and economic landscapes. Ultimately, this situation serves as a critical test for the crypto industry’s maturity and its commitment to principles of fairness and transparency. How these allegations are resolved, and how the industry responds to the challenges they present, will be vital for its future trajectory. The Bloomberg report on Binance’s alleged involvement with the USD1 stablecoin and World Liberty Financial has ignited a firestorm of debate. From claims of Binance’s direct role in smart contract development and a massive $2 billion transaction to the contentious issue of political influence, the narrative is complex and fraught with implications. While Binance founder CZ has vehemently denied the allegations, the story underscores the growing intersection of cryptocurrency, traditional finance, and political power. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, issues of transparency, regulatory compliance, and potential conflicts of interest will remain at the forefront, shaping the future of blockchain technology and public trust in this dynamic space. The crypto community awaits further developments in this intriguing and potentially industry-defining saga.

On Friday, July 11, 2025, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Jim Banks sent a joint letter to Nvidia’s CEO, Huang. They urged him not to meet with companies suspected of working around US export controls or those believed to be aiding China’s defense or intelligence agencies. The pair pressed Huang to avoid any talks with organizations listed under the United States government’s export restrictions. Their request extends not only to firms that might chip away at American technology safeguards but also to any entity officially banned from receiving U.S. semiconductors. “We are worried that your trip to the PRC could legitimize companies that cooperate closely with the Chinese military or involve discussing exploitable gaps in U.S. export controls,” the letter states. It adds, “There is a new bipartisan consensus that the hardware powering advanced AI, which includes NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs), is of immense strategic importance.” Huang was due for his China visit on Friday. In response to the letter, a spokesperson from NVIDIA said that when U.S. technology becomes the world standard, “America wins.” The spokesperson noted that China hosts the largest number of software engineers globally and argued that AI applications “should run best on the U.S. technology stack, encouraging nations worldwide to choose America.” Earlier this year, at Taipei’s Computex trade show during May 2025, Huang praised former President Donald Trump’s move to lift certain AI chip export curbs. He called the previous diffusion rules a “failure” and said they ultimately spurred Chinese firms to build their own high-end chips. In April 2025, Washington tightened export restrictions on advanced AI chips. Huang warned that those rules would slash NVIDIA’s revenue by about $15 billion, noting that the company had modified its products to comply with U.S. regulations. In their letter, Banks and Warren pointed out that chips used for cutting-edge AI have become a rare issue that unites lawmakers from both parties in favor of looser export paths. They warned that AI can “accelerate the PRC’s effort to modernize its military.” Congress is worried about China dodging the U.S. controls Congressional concern has also grown over efforts to dodge U.S. controls. Lawmakers have proposed requiring chipmakers to track and verify the final destination of the products. In June 2025, Reuters revealed that DeepSeek was working with China’s military and had used third parties to bypass U.S. export limits. Reuters also reported earlier that NVIDIA plans to release a lower-cost version of Blackwell chips specifically for the Chinese market. In their letter, the senators highlighted NVIDIA’s new Shanghai research facility as one sign that the company’s moves could strengthen China’s domestic AI and semiconductor industries. According to the Financial Times , earlier in July 2025, Huang is set to attend Beijing’s International Supply Chain Expo, which kicks off this coming Wednesday. Sources familiar with the matter said that the CEO hopes to meet Premier Qiang and Vice-Premier Lifeng. Those meetings are still being finalized and require Beijing’s approval. At Computex in Taipei, Huang argued that U.S. export curbs had only pushed companies in China to speed up their AI projects. He noted that NVIDIA’s share of the China AI-chip market had fallen from roughly 95 percent in 2021 to about 50 percent today, and he predicted that China’s AI sector could soon be worth $50 billion. During his trip, Huang would stress NVIDIA’s continued focus on China despite various export restrictions resulting in losses worth several billion for the company. A person with knowledge of the plans said the cheaper Blackwell chip will not ship before September 2025, after NVIDIA secures a green signal from the US government.

In a stunning display of market power, XRP has surged, leading the charge among the top 10 cryptocurrencies and sparking immense interest. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a significant move that signals shifting tides in the broader digital assets landscape. What’s Fueling the Remarkable XRP Price Surge? In a move that caught many by surprise, XRP experienced an impressive surge of over 12% within a mere 24 hours, climbing to $2.79. This outstanding performance positioned it firmly ahead of market giants like Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies, showcasing its individual strength and renewed investor confidence. Over the past week alone, XRP has clocked nearly a 27% gain, demonstrating consistent upward momentum. While still approximately 18% below its ambitious 2018 all-time high of $3.40, this recent rally indicates a strong recovery trajectory. The question on everyone’s mind is: what’s behind this sudden burst of energy? It’s a combination of market dynamics and a renewed focus on regulatory clarity, particularly concerning crypto policy . Decoding XRP Open Interest : A Bullish Indicator? One of the most compelling metrics underpinning XRP’s recent ascent is the dramatic increase in its futures open interest. According to data from CoinGlass, open interest for XRP futures soared to $7.2 billion, bringing it tantalizingly close to its January peak of $8.3 billion and marking a significant six-month high. But what exactly does this mean for the average investor? Open interest represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially when coupled with a rising price, is often interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that new money is flowing into the market, and traders are opening new long positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset’s future price direction. For XRP, this surge in open interest points to: Increased Market Confidence: More traders are willing to bet on XRP’s continued rise. Growing Liquidity: A healthier market with more participants. Potential for Further Momentum: As long as open interest continues to climb alongside price, the rally could sustain. This metric provides a crucial glimpse into the sentiment of professional traders and institutions, whose collective actions often dictate short-to-medium term price movements. Ripple Crypto ‘s Strategic Plays and Political Engagement It’s no secret that Ripple, the company behind XRP, has been at the forefront of advocating for regulatory clarity in the United States. Their protracted legal battle with the SEC has been a defining feature of XRP’s journey, and any hint of a more favorable regulatory environment can significantly impact its valuation. The recent rally aligns with a renewed interest in crypto policy under the potential Trump administration, as reported by Decrypt. Ripple has consistently engaged in political outreach and lobbying efforts, aiming to shape a regulatory framework that fosters innovation rather than stifles it. This proactive approach, coupled with potential shifts in the political landscape, could be a game-changer. A more permissive or clearer regulatory stance from the U.S. government could: Reduce Regulatory Uncertainty: Making XRP a more attractive asset for institutional investors. Boost Adoption: Paving the way for broader use of Ripple’s payment solutions. Improve Market Sentiment: Dispelling the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) that has long plagued XRP. Ripple’s continued political engagement underscores its commitment to navigating the complex regulatory maze, a factor that investors are increasingly weighing when evaluating digital assets . Navigating the Broader Crypto Policy Landscape Under Trump The discussion around XRP’s surge cannot be separated from the wider discourse on crypto policy . The prospect of a Trump administration has injected a new layer of optimism into the crypto community, with many hoping for a more industry-friendly approach compared to the current regulatory climate. Former President Trump has recently expressed more favorable views towards cryptocurrencies, signaling a potential shift from previous stances. Why does this matter? Regulatory clarity is the bedrock upon which institutional adoption and mainstream integration of digital assets will be built. Ambiguity or outright hostility from regulators can deter significant investment and hinder innovation. A more defined and supportive policy framework could: Attract Institutional Capital: Big players need certainty to commit large sums. Foster Innovation: Companies can build and scale without fear of sudden regulatory crackdowns. Protect Consumers: Clear rules can also lead to better consumer safeguards. The interplay between political developments and market movements is becoming increasingly evident, with XRP serving as a prime example of how policy signals can translate into significant price action. XRP’s Position in the Evolving Digital Assets Market Beyond the immediate catalysts, XRP’s long-term value proposition lies in its unique role within the digital assets ecosystem. Designed for fast, low-cost international payments, XRP aims to be a bridge currency for financial institutions. Its underlying technology, the XRP Ledger, offers speed and efficiency that traditional banking systems often lack. While Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ and Ethereum as the backbone for decentralized applications, XRP carves out its niche in the realm of cross-border remittances and liquidity solutions. This specialization, combined with Ripple’s enterprise focus, positions XRP distinctly among its peers. However, it also faces challenges: Competition: Other blockchain projects and traditional payment systems are also vying for market share. Regulatory Hurdles: Despite recent positive developments, the path to full regulatory clarity remains ongoing. Centralization Concerns: Some critics point to the concentration of XRP holdings and Ripple’s influence over the network. Despite these challenges, the recent XRP price surge and renewed interest highlight its enduring relevance and potential in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights The current surge in XRP, driven by a confluence of market interest and shifting crypto policy , offers several takeaways for investors and crypto enthusiasts alike: Stay Informed on Policy: Regulatory developments, especially concerning digital assets , are becoming increasingly influential on market prices. Keep an eye on political statements and proposed legislation. Monitor Open Interest: For those trading futures, understanding XRP open interest can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Diversify and Research: While XRP is performing strongly, the crypto market remains volatile. Always conduct thorough research and consider diversifying your portfolio. Understand Ripple’s Strategy: Ripple’s corporate and political actions directly impact XRP. Following their announcements and partnerships can offer foresight. A Compelling Future for XRP? XRP’s recent performance is more than just a fleeting rally; it’s a powerful indicator of renewed confidence and the profound impact of regulatory dynamics on the crypto market. The surge in XRP open interest , coupled with Ripple’s strategic political engagement and the evolving crypto policy landscape, paints a promising picture for this unique digital asset . While challenges remain, the current momentum suggests that XRP is firmly back in the conversation as a significant player shaping the future of finance.

You might also like: RICH Miner simplifies cloud mining with real-time passive returns Storage ≠ appreciation: The limitations of traditional coinbase strategies Many investors choose to store cryptocurrencies in centralized exchanges, such as Binance, Coinbase or decentralized wallets, such as MetaMask, SafePal. This frozen asset method ensures security but lacks the ability to increase value. In a bull market, price increases may bring profits, but in a consolidation period or a bear market, assets not only cannot appreciate, but may even depreciate. Simple storage means missing the opportunity for active returns. The rise of cloud mining: a passive income tool that breaks the technical threshold Traditional mining used to be the patent of technology geeks and large mining farms. Ordinary people who want to participate are often limited by high hardware costs, electricity costs and technical maintenance barriers. However, the emergence of cloud mining has changed everything. Through platforms such as RICH Miner, users do not need to purchase equipment. They only need to register, select contracts, and invest in mainstream assets such as USDT or BTC to obtain stable cryptocurrency income every day, truly realizing using assets to generate assets. RICH Miner: An efficient, secure and transparent asset appreciation engine As a leader in the field of cloud mining, RICH Miner provides a variety of mainstream cryptocurrency mining contracts including Bitcoin (BTC) and DOGE, with a yield rate far higher than the industry average. Some contracts have a daily yield of up to $4,850, suitable for investors seeking high returns. The platform’s advantages include: Zero technical threshold: No need to deploy mining machines, suitable for all users. Daily settlement, transparent income: All mining income can be checked and withdrawn in real-time. Multi-wallet compatibility: Supports withdrawals from mainstream wallets such as Coinbase, Trust Wallet, and SafePal. The platform operates stably: With global server and mining pool support to ensure maximum mining efficiency. From passive waiting to active appreciation: How do you cash out assets? Suppose someone holds $10,000 worth of Bitcoin or USDT, which is stored in the coin library for a long time. After choosing RICH Miner, they can invest part of their assets in the cloud mining project, and realize a stable crypto value-added channel every day while ensuring the safety of the principal. 1: Create an account: Users can get $15 computing power by registering an account on the official website . 2: Contract selection: Choose a mining plan according to budget.

This isn’t just a simple aesthetic choice; it’s a powerful statement that reverberates through the realms of Coinbase NFT strategy, Web3 culture, and the broader acceptance of digital collectibles . What might seem like a small detail to an outsider is, in fact, a loud endorsement of a specific segment of the crypto ecosystem, hinting at deeper strategic shifts within the industry. Why Did Coinbase Embrace Pudgy Penguins for its X Profile? Coinbase’s decision to adopt a Pudgy Penguin as its public face on X is a calculated move that speaks volumes about its evolving relationship with the Web3 space. The Pudgy Penguins collection isn’t just another set of profile picture (PFP) NFTs; it represents a vibrant community, a successful brand, and a testament to the power of intellectual property (IP) in the decentralized world. Here are a few compelling reasons behind this strategic alignment: Community Connection: Pudgy Penguins boast one of the most loyal and active communities in the NFT space. By featuring a Pudgy Penguin, Coinbase instantly signals its understanding and appreciation for this crucial aspect of Web3. It’s a nod to the ‘degens’ and long-term holders who form the backbone of the NFT market. Brand Strength and IP: Unlike many NFT projects, Pudgy Penguins have successfully extended their brand beyond digital art, notably with their popular toy line sold in major retail outlets like Walmart. This demonstrates tangible real-world utility and broad appeal, aligning with Coinbase’s ambition to bridge the gap between crypto and mainstream adoption. Cultural Relevance: Pudgy Penguins have become a symbol of resilience and fun within the NFT bear market. Their consistent innovation and positive outlook make them an ideal ambassador for a company looking to project stability and forward momentum in a dynamic industry. This move is more than just an image change; it’s a strategic embrace of a successful digital collectible brand, showcasing Coinbase’s commitment to staying at the forefront of crypto culture. What Does This Bold Move Mean for Web3 Adoption? The embrace of a prominent NFT collection by a leading exchange like Coinbase carries significant implications for Web3 adoption . It acts as a powerful signal, not just to the crypto native community, but also to institutional investors and mainstream audiences considering their entry into the decentralized world. Historically, major financial entities have been cautious about associating with NFTs, often viewing them as speculative or niche. Coinbase, by proudly displaying a Pudgy Penguin, is effectively saying that digital collectibles are a legitimate and integral part of the future financial landscape. This can: Boost Mainstream Confidence: When a regulated and widely trusted entity like Coinbase publicly endorses an NFT project, it lends credibility to the entire sector. This can encourage more traditional investors and brands to explore opportunities within Web3. Accelerate Integration: It sets a precedent for other exchanges and financial institutions to consider deeper integrations with NFT ecosystems, potentially leading to more NFT-focused products, services, and partnerships. Demystify NFTs: For many, NFTs remain a complex concept. Seeing a familiar brand like Coinbase use one simplifies the idea, making it more approachable and less intimidating for newcomers. This action is a tangible step towards making Web3 concepts less abstract and more integrated into everyday digital interactions, propelling the broader agenda of Web3 adoption forward. How Does This Impact Coinbase’s NFT Strategy? Coinbase has been steadily building its presence in the NFT space, most notably with the launch of its own Coinbase NFT marketplace. While it hasn’t yet reached the dominance of OpenSea, moves like adopting the Pudgy Penguin PFP are crucial for establishing its credibility and appeal within the NFT community. This move suggests a multi-faceted approach to its NFT strategy: Coinbase’s X profile proudly displaying a Pudgy Penguin. Aspect of Strategy Potential Impact of Pudgy Penguin PFP Marketplace Engagement Draws attention to Coinbase’s NFT marketplace, potentially increasing traffic and trading volume for digital collectibles . Community Building Signals a deeper understanding and appreciation for NFT communities, fostering trust and loyalty among collectors. Brand Positioning Positions Coinbase as a forward-thinking, culturally relevant player in the Web3 space, beyond just being a traditional exchange. Future Collaborations Opens doors for potential official partnerships, integrations, or exclusive drops with leading NFT projects like Pudgy Penguins . This strategic update reinforces Coinbase’s commitment to not just facilitate crypto trading but also to actively participate in and shape the emerging Web3 economy, with NFTs playing a central role. Is This the New Frontier for Crypto Exchange Marketing? In the highly competitive world of cryptocurrency exchanges, standing out is paramount. Traditional marketing often focuses on security, low fees, and user experience. However, the Pudgy Penguins adoption by Coinbase points towards a new frontier in crypto exchange marketing : cultural alignment and community-driven branding. By leveraging an iconic NFT, Coinbase is employing a sophisticated marketing tactic that: Resonates with the Niche: It directly appeals to the passionate and influential NFT community, turning them into potential advocates. Generates Buzz: A simple profile picture change has generated significant discussion across social media and crypto news outlets, providing organic reach and brand visibility. Showcases Authenticity: It demonstrates that Coinbase isn’t just building Web3 products; it’s living and breathing Web3 culture, which can build deeper trust with users who value authenticity in decentralized spaces. This approach could inspire other exchanges to rethink their branding strategies, moving beyond conventional advertising to embrace more organic, community-centric forms of engagement that leverage the power of digital collectibles and Web3 culture. Actionable Insights for the Community What does Coinbase’s embrace of Pudgy Penguins mean for you, whether you’re an investor, a collector, or just curious? For NFT Collectors: Keep an eye on projects with strong IP, engaged communities, and potential for mainstream crossover. The Pudgy Penguins’ success story is a blueprint. The increased visibility from Coinbase could also indirectly benefit the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. For Aspiring Web3 Projects: Focus on building genuine communities and developing compelling utility or brand narratives that can transcend the digital realm. Major players are watching for projects that demonstrate longevity and real-world applicability. For Crypto Investors: Recognize that the lines between traditional crypto assets and digital collectibles are blurring. Understanding the NFT market is becoming increasingly important for a holistic view of the crypto economy. Pay attention to how exchanges like Coinbase integrate these new facets. The Future is Playful and Pixeled Coinbase’s adoption of a Pudgy Penguin is more than a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful symbol of the evolving landscape where major financial platforms are increasingly integrating with the vibrant, community-driven world of Web3. It underscores the growing importance of digital collectibles not just as speculative assets, but as cultural touchstones and valuable brand assets. This pivotal move by Coinbase not only validates the burgeoning NFT space but also sets an exciting precedent for how crypto exchanges will engage with their communities and market themselves in the future. As the boundaries between traditional finance and decentralized innovation continue to dissolve, we can expect to see more such creative and culturally resonant strategies from industry leaders.

Since its peak of $0.00004567 in March 2024, SHIB has experienced lower highs and lower lows, confirming a bearish structure. Following that peak, the token dropped to $0.00003074 and has remained within a descending triangle pattern ever since, with price action gravitating toward the lower boundary of the formation. However, recent market activity suggests that SHIB may be nearing a reversal. MasterAnanda pointed out that the token has posted a strong green weekly candle, indicating a possible shift in sentiment. Over the past week, SHIB has increased by approximately 19%, marking one of its strongest weekly performances since the first week of May, when it gained 25%. Despite the current price improvement, SHIB remains below the 200-day moving average (MA200), a key technical indicator used to determine overall trend direction. As long as the price remains under the MA200, which currently stands at $0.00001634, analysts generally view the broader trend as bearish. Breaking above this level would be a critical step in confirming sustained upward momentum. Analyst Targets Multiple Fibonacci Levels in 2025 Outlook MasterAnanda has outlined a set of potential price targets for Shiba Inu based on Fibonacci retracement and extension levels. The first target is $0.00003203, which corresponds to the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level and would represent a breakout from the current triangle formation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If SHIB maintains its momentum, the next significant price levels are $0.00006767 (1.618 extension) and $0.0001032 (2.618 extension). The analyst regards $0.0001032 as the baseline for a new all-time high this cycle. Beyond that, the analysis includes further bullish targets: $0.0001743 and $0.000220491, which reflect the 3.618 and 4.618 Fibonacci extensions, respectively. These projections represent gains of approximately 1,183% and 1,529% from the current trading price of $0.00001360. Notably, this optimistic outlook aligns with previous assessments from other market commentators. Analyst Alan Santana previously suggested a similar potential breakout from SHIB’s descending triangle formation, reinforcing the view that substantial upside could still lie ahead for the meme-based token. While Shiba Inu has experienced a prolonged period of downward movement, current technical indicators and renewed market interest suggest a potential shift in trend. However, a confirmation above key resistance levels, particularly the 200-day moving average, remains essential before a sustained bullish trajectory can be validated.

That tiny window between uncertainty and opportunity — it’s where fortunes are made or missed. As Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) surges to its 31st stage — Frigid Fortress — it’s not just another meme project. It’s turning heads and snowballing momentum with serious community energy and clever tokenomics. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins is catching fire with a trading volume of over $1.3B, and FLOKI continues to draw eyes with a massive spike in activity. But while those coins move, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is racing toward its final stages. With a micro-entry of just $0.00047 per token and gains projected up to $0.008, hesitation now could mean regret later. The clock is ticking — and this window won’t stay open forever. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Pudgy Penguins, and FLOKI. Earn While You Share: The Viral Power of Arctic Pablo’s Referral Engine What if spreading the word could boost your portfolio? Arctic Pablo Coin’s referral incentives are doing just that — encouraging holders to become brand ambassadors and earn real rewards. It’s not just marketing; it’s a strategy designed to reward early believers. How many coins are offering a chance to build a bag while growing the hype? The system is simple: share your unique referral link, invite new users, and get rewarded in Arctic Pablo Coin. This model aligns perfectly with the spirit of meme coins — driven by community, memes, and movement. Unlike standard airdrops or static bonus structures, Arctic Pablo Coin fuels a growing fire through community engagement. Could your successive crypto win come from simply spreading the word? Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 , and its referral system is one of the many reasons. Frigid Fortress Entry Is Freezing Over — 1,602% ROI Still on the Table for Arctic Pablo Welcome to Frigid Fortress, the 31st icy checkpoint on Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale journey — and perhaps your last chance to get in before the thaw melts away your shot at exponential gains. The current price is just $0.00047, but the projected listing is locked at $0.008, promising a 1,602% ROI. Imagine investing $1,500 now and walking away with over 3.1 million APC — worth $25,531.92 at launch. Raised funds? Already soaring past $2.91 million, and climbing faster with every hour. The real kicker? With each new phase, the price ticks higher, meaning hesitation costs you tokens. This isn’t about speculation anymore — it’s about timing. Will you watch from the sidelines as early buyers ride this wave into 2025? Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025, and Frigid Fortress may be your final low-cost access point. Pudgy Penguins Makes Waves with Over $1.3B in Trading Volume Pudgy Penguins has officially joined the elite ranks of meme coins, breaking trading volume records — posting a jaw-dropping $1.3 billion in 24-hour volume with a live price of $0.021395. The beloved penguin-themed token has long held a place in the hearts of NFT and meme investors, but this surge is different — it’s bringing serious liquidity and eyes to the project. With major centralized exchanges listing it and a growing narrative around its digital collectibles, Pudgy Penguins is evolving into more than just a meme — it’s a movement. But with such massive inflows, how long can this momentum last before late entries start seeing diminishing returns? Don’t wait for the iceberg to melt — strike while the price is still manageable. As they say, the early bird gets the worm, but in this case, the early penguin might just catch the moon. FLOKI Roars Back With Renewed Momentum and $200M+ Volume FLOKI, long considered a top-tier meme contender, is back in the headlines — this time, with a staggering $200,589,615 in 24-hour volume and a current price of $0.000104. The token, named after Elon Musk’s dog, is more than just a hype play — it’s doubling down on real-world utility, decentralized finance tools, and ecosystem expansion. Traders are clearly taking notice. The increased volume signals strong institutional and retail interest, potentially setting FLOKI up for a breakout moment. Could FLOKI reclaim its throne and ignite a fresh meme coin season? In crypto, timing is everything, and FLOKI’s charts are pulsing with momentum. Don’t be the one looking back wondering why you didn’t act when the trail was heating up. Bottom Line: 3 Coins, 1 Opportunity — Arctic Pablo Stands Tall Amid Meme Momentum Pudgy Penguins is dominating charts with billion-dollar activity, and FLOKI is roaring back with a vengeance. But one coin — Arctic Pablo Coin — stands poised at a critical junction between obscurity and viral success. Its referral engine is winning over investors organically, and the Frigid Fortress phase at $0.00047 offers a rare, low-cost, high-reward opportunity that’s disappearing by the day. Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 — not just because of the presale numbers, but because of its innovative mechanics, community-first approach, and built-in hype loop. As the presale crosses milestones and the token nears launch at $0.008, every moment of hesitation risks missing out on potentially life-changing gains. So here’s the question — when the ice melts and APC hits the open market, will your wallet be holding millions, or will you just regret it? For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What is Arctic Pablo Coin, and why is it trending now? Arctic Pablo Coin is a new meme coin in presale, offering referral rewards and a massive ROI potential as it climbs through its launch phases. How much can people earn with Arctic Pablo Coin at the current presale price? At $0.00047 per token, a $1,500 investment could return over $25,000 when APC lists at $0.008. What’s special about the Frigid Fortress phase? It’s the 31st stage of Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey — and likely one of the last low-entry points before price skyrockets. Is Pudgy Penguins a good investment right now? Pudgy Penguins recently saw over $1.3B in volume and continues gaining traction with its NFT and meme ecosystem. What’s driving FLOKI’s recent surge? FLOKI has regained momentum with a trading volume exceeding $200M and expanding use cases across DeFi and metaverse projects. Article Summary Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming the most talked-about presale in the meme coin universe. With referral incentives, exponential ROI potential, and a rapidly escalating presale at Frigid Fortress, it presents a unique opportunity to get in before the crypto world catches on. While Pudgy Penguins and FLOKI surge, Arctic Pablo steals the spotlight as the Best Crypto To Invest in 2025 — and those acting now may thank themselves later.

48067417,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=764604,1752277615,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48067417.jpeg,Roblox is turning teenagers into young millionaires,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/roblox-teenagers-young-millionaires/,"A teenager sold a soccer game on Roblox for $3 million+ just months after it hit the platform. The deal highlights a growing secondary market for games on the platform. The unnamed developer, aged 19, said he and several co-developers took only 3 months to build the game. After its release last year, it drew more than one million players at once and brought in about $5 million each month in in-game purchases for the company. Do Big Studios, a firm that owns several Roblox titles, purchased the game. Roblox, which started almost 20 years ago, offered a digital platform for creators to build and share simple, low-resolution games. Now, with close to 100 million daily users, the platform has become a place where people can earn real money by selling games for prices reaching into the 7 and 8 figures. David Taylor from Naavik, an analytics company, stated, “We’ve seen a real shift in Roblox’s ecosystem.” He found that 7 among the top 15 most-earning Roblox titles were purchased from the owners in June. The trend of selling Roblox games increased after a December update Before December, Roblox had said selling games was against Roblox’s service terms and rules. A spokesperson said the company is not taking part in these secondary-market deals. Do Big continues to build momentum. The firm acquired a piece of Grow a Garden, a farming game, in May. Grow a Garden set a new mark later in June by drawing 21 million+ players simultaneously, outpacing Fortnite. Splitting Point, another Roblox game company, had taken over Grow a Garden in April from a teen developer who chose to remain anonymous. Similarly, an unnamed developer sold the top game at the time, Brookhaven RP, to Voldex Entertainment in February. Voldex’s founder and chief executive, Alex Singer, mentioned that the deal was much “bigger” in comparison to what was reported at that time. He also added, “When there are more dollars paid out to creators, it attracts more people.” Roblox reports that, over the year ending in March, its ten highest-earning developers each made about $36 million. For the very first time, it could pay out over $1 billion to its game creators this year. Several firms now purchase, create, or flip games on Roblox. The deal-making often happens on Discord, a messaging app popular among gamers, according to Connar Rhicards. Richards is a lawyer who has handled a dozen such deals.

In 2028, Floki Inu is predicted to reach a maximum price of $0.000708. FLOKI price can reach a maximum level of $0.000381 and an average trading price of $0.0032 in 2031. Floki Inu is a meme coin driven by its community, the Floki Vikings. Inspired by Shiba Inu, Floki Inu aims to democratize power in the crypto space, pivoting the crypto market away from traditional financial entities. The Floki project ecosystem is diverse. It includes Valhalla, a blockchain combat game that rewards players with Floki tokens, and Floki Places, a store for merchandise and NFTs where purchases can be made using Floki tokens. Additionally, Floki University provides educational resources on the cryptocurrency market and blockchain technology. The recent launch (June 30, 2025) of the Valhalla mainnet of opBNB, coupled with DeFi partnerships like Chainlink, collectively enhances Floki Inu’s value and future potential by driving demand and expanding its use. Having attained its all-time high of $0.0003462 on June 5, 2024, can FLOKI reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Floki Inu Token FLOKI Price $0.00009605 Market Capitalization $916.62M Trading Volume $210.47M Circulating Supply 9.54T FLOKI All-time High $0.0003462 (Jun 05, 2024) All-time Low $0.00000002 (Aug 08, 2021) 24-hour High $0.0001043 24-hour Low $0.00009465 Floki Inu price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility (30-day Variation) 9.49% 50-Day SMA $0.00008375 14-Day RSI 67.67 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.00009663 Floki Inu price analysis Key Insights: Floki’s price is down 6% today, despite broader upside. The coin will likely consolidate between $0.00009000-$0.00011000 before the next major move. FLOKI on the daily timeframe: FLOKI Inu breaks above key resistance with strong volume The FLOKI daily chart for July 11 shows the coin breaking above the crucial $0.00009000 resistance level that had been capping price action for weeks. The token’s current position at $0.00009615 represents a significant technical breakthrough, supported by an exceptional volume of 48.07M that confirms genuine buying pressure. FLOKIUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The Williams Alligator indicator shows all three lines converging and beginning to separate upward, typically signaling the start of a trending move, while the moving averages align bullishly. However, the recent red candle formation after the breakout suggests some profit-taking, which is normal behavior after such a significant move. However, the overall structure remains constructive with higher lows being established. FLOKI on the 4-hour timeframe: The coin sees momentum exhaustion after recent rally The 4-hour chart displays a concerning pattern, with FLOKI currently experiencing a -5.04% decline. The token had been riding a strong uptrend, but recent price action suggests momentum is waning as it approaches critical resistance levels around $0.00010500. The Bollinger Bands show expansion with price touching the upper band before retreating, indicating potential volatility ahead, while the 20-period simple moving average at $0.00009489 provides immediate support. FLOKIUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The MACD indicator reveals a bearish divergence with the histogram showing negative momentum. However, the signal line remains slightly positive, suggesting the trend may be losing steam rather than completely reversing. Floki Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00007905 BUY SMA 5 $0.00008327 BUY SMA 10 $0.00008055 BUY SMA 21 $0.00007600 BUY SMA 50 $0.00008375 BUY SMA 100 $0.00008157 BUY SMA 200 $0.00009663 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00008009 BUY EMA 5 $0.00008031 BUY EMA 10 $0.00007760 BUY EMA 21 $0.00007244 BUY EMA 50 $0.00007556 BUY EMA 100 $0.00009496 BUY EMA 200 $0.000119 SELL What to expect from FLOKI FLOKI is in a transitional phase where short-term weakness meets longer-term strength. The daily breakout above $0.00009000 with strong volume suggests momentum toward $0.00011000-$0.00012000, but the 4-hour chart warns of potential consolidation first. Traders should watch out for a successful retest of $0.00009000 as support to confirm the breakout, while failure to hold above $0.00008500 could signal a return to the previous range. Is Floki Inu a good investment? FLOKI INU could be a big win or a big loss. It’s backed by a strong Floki community and consistent ecosystem developments, which can drive short-and long-term gains. But it’s risky, with price swings and unclear long-term value. Only invest if you’re comfortable with the risk. Will FLOKI reach $0.001? Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up ~9x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $100 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 100x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

Meanwhile, the Kaspa (KAS) price today continues to move sideways between $0.0735 and $0.0775, held back by ongoing miner activity. Both coins remain contenders on the list of best cryptos to buy today, but BlockDAG (BDAG) is outshining them with its growing momentum. With new partnerships involving Seattle’s top rugby and cricket teams, the Seawolves and Orcas, BlockDAG is making strides in real-world adoption. These moves are pushing its presale beyond expectations, now at over $336 million. BDAG remains available at a low $0.0016 until August 11th, creating a time-limited entry point ahead of its official listing. Cardano Price Pushes Forward with Signs of Recovery The Cardano (ADA) price recovery is taking shape after its recent dip to $0.5650. ADA has regained some ground, moving just under a key resistance near $0.5925. If ADA breaks through this level, it could open the door for further gains in the short term. If the price fails to hold current levels, however, there’s a chance it may test support again at $0.5650. Despite some caution, many traders still view Cardano as one of the best cryptos to buy today, waiting for confirmation of a breakout before increasing exposure. Kaspa Price Faces Range-Bound Movement with Miner Pressure The Kaspa (KAS) price today remains flat near $0.075, unable to find a clear direction. It continues trading within a tight range, with minor support and resistance preventing major shifts. Reports suggest miner selling is contributing to this pressure, keeping the price from gaining traction. The RSI remains weak and leans slightly bearish, while the MACD remains flat, showing little buyer strength. To move higher, KAS needs to break past current resistance levels. Without new demand, it could drift lower toward its $0.060 support. For now, momentum is neutral and will need a spark to shift upward. BlockDAG’s Sports Deals Drive Record-Breaking Presale Growth BlockDAG’s presale is rapidly gaining momentum, with over $336 million raised and 23.7 billion coins already sold across 29 batches. Early buyers from batch 1 have seen gains of 2,660%, underlining the strength of this crypto project. Much of this growth comes from recent partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves in rugby and the Seattle Orcas in cricket. These collaborations are introducing blockchain to fans in new and exciting ways. With the Seawolves, BlockDAG will offer digital collectibles and behind-the-scenes content, blending sports with tech. Its partnership with the Seattle Orcas adds another layer of global exposure. The team’s recent victory over the Los Angeles Knight Riders adds excitement to the announcement, as BlockDAG brings NFTs and branded content to a global cricket audience. For now, BDAG remains priced at just $0.0016 until August 11 as part of the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With its confirmed listing price set at $0.05, buyers locking in today could see a potential 3,025% return. With momentum building, many view this as a rare window to join a project at an early and promising stage. Final Thoughts While the Cardano (ADA) price recovery continues to build above support and the Kaspa (KAS) price today stays in a holding pattern, BlockDAG is emerging as a frontrunner. With a $336 million presale and strong backing from the Seattle Seawolves and Orcas, BDAG is turning heads. The current $0.0016 price remains active until August 11, giving early supporters one of the best possible entry points. With its mix of global partnerships, expanding user base, and strong presale demand, BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the best cryptos to buy today , especially for those looking ahead to major returns in 2025.

48068067,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74111,1752278437,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitwise CEO Sparks Debate on Ripple’s Future Identity: Details,https://timestabloid.com/bitwise-ceo-sparks-debate-on-ripples-future-identity-details/,"Hunter Horsley, the Chief Executive Officer of Bitwise Asset Management, has drawn attention to a developing narrative in the digital asset space, the idea that Ripple may transform into an XRP-centric treasury entity within the next year. In a recent post on X, Horsley publicly contemplated whether Ripple could soon be described not just as a blockchain company, but as an XRP treasury institution. I wonder if in 12 months, people will call Ripple an XRP treasury company. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) July 10, 2025 Growing Conversation on XRP Treasury Use Horsley’s remarks have emerged amid increased institutional interest in XRP for treasury purposes. Notably, firms such as Trident Digital and Webus are reportedly raising close to $1 billion in XRP-linked treasury products, underlining the token’s expanding role beyond cross-border payments. These developments suggest that XRP could be maturing into a strategic reserve asset for certain institutions. In this context, Horsley’s observation appears to reflect an evolving narrative. Ripple, a company historically focused on building global payments infrastructure, may be poised to transition into an entity that leverages its XRP reserves more directly, potentially adopting a model similar to MicroStrategy’s with Bitcoin. Ripple’s XRP Holdings and Speculations of Strategic Intent Ripple currently controls approximately 40.92 billion XRP, which represents around 41% of the total circulating supply. Much of this amount is locked in escrow, with scheduled releases meant to manage liquidity and market impact. Despite the escrow mechanism, some industry voices suggest that Ripple’s sizable XRP holdings function similarly to a reserve strategy. Supporters believe this reserve could be used to support institutional partnerships or broader financial initiatives. In particular, some XRP community members, such as Edoardo Farina, speculated that Ripple’s escrowed XRP may be earmarked for collaboration with global institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, no official confirmation supports this theory. On the other hand, skeptics such as entrepreneur Gary Cardone argue that if Ripple genuinely views XRP as a high-value long-term asset, it should formally adopt a treasury-based approach and publicly acknowledge its strategic intent. This line of thinking questions whether Ripple’s current structure reflects its actual vision for XRP’s future role. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Community Torn Between Critique and Endorsement The debate has not gone unnoticed within the broader XRP community. One user, Ojo Oluwani, noted that Ripple assuming the role of an XRP treasury entity would represent a major shift, particularly after years of emphasizing the legal and operational separation between Ripple and XRP. Oluwani further argued that, based on the company’s large holdings alone, Ripple already functions like a treasury institution in practice, even if not in name. However, some commentators pointed out an apparent contradiction in public opinion; critics often blame Ripple for maintaining a disproportionately large share of XRP, while also suggesting it should double down and formalize this model as part of a strategic balance sheet. As the utility and market perception of XRP continue to grow, questions surrounding Ripple’s future direction remain open. With major institutional initiatives underway and its substantial XRP reserves under scrutiny, Ripple may face increased pressure to clarify its position.

Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on how the altcoin has broken through a crucial moving average (MA). Meanwhile, ETH’s dominance is again on the rise. Ethereum Price Breaks 50EMA On Weekly Chart In an X post, Doctor Profit stated that after 9 weeks of constant rejection at the EMA50 on the weekly chart, the Ethereum price has finally broken through. He claimed that it was a very good sign, as it suggests that ETH will reach higher targets in the coming weeks. The break above the 2,600 EMA50 level came as the broader crypto market rallied. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here? This rally has been led by the Bitcoin price, which has reached new all-time highs (ATHs). Based on this, the Ethereum price is expected to also reach new highs, with the yearly high of $3,600 already in sight. A reclaim of this level could also pave the way for ETH to reclaim the psychological $4,000 level. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital alluded to the rising dominance of the Ethereum price. He noted that this ETH dominance fractal will not be a copy-paste version of what happened between 2019 and 2020. However, the analyst claimed that the recent rise to 10% of the dominance level shows that Ethereum wants to become more market-dominant in the coming months. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also believes that it is time for the Ethereum price to make its move. In an X post, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $10,000 on this upward trend. He made this prediction while highlighting ETH’s chart against its BTC pair, suggesting that he also agrees that Ethereum’s dominance will rise in the coming months. ETH’s Move To Trigger Altcoin Season In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto stated that the Ethereum price is following the Wyckoff re-accumulation schematic. He further remarked that this massive move will trigger altcoin season after ETH reaches the “SOS” level around $3,000. His accompanying chart also showed that he expects Ethereum to reach as high as $3,200 in the short term. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Targets $3,000 As Analyst Calls It A ‘Powder Keg’ In another X post, Mikybull Crypto alluded to the fact that Bitcoin’s dominance was dumping even as the BTC price rises. The analyst remarked that this development means something, hinting at a potential altcoin season on the horizon. This is bullish for the Ethereum price and other altcoins as they would outperform BTC during this period. It is worth mentioning that Mikybull Crypto has also predicted that ETH can reach $10,000 in this market cycle. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,988, up over 7% according to data from CoinMarketCap.

A Wells Fargo customer for nearly four decades says the lender refused to make him whole after scammers drained $20,000 from his account. Scott Merovitch says he received a call from someone claiming to work at the bank, warning his account was flashing suspicious activity, reports FOX 26 Houston. According to Merovitch, the caller was able to provide information about his recent transactions. After the call, a woman pretending to work at Wells Fargo showed up at Merovitch’s front door, asked for his card and cut it into pieces. Two hours later, Merovitch says $20,000 exited his account at ATM locations just a few miles from his residence. When he filed for a reimbursement claim, Merovitch says the lender issued a letter telling him that the transactions were made by him or someone who had his permission. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase is refusing to reimburse a man scammed by a fake Apple support text, reports the CBS-affiliated news station KOLD. The phishing text, posing as Apple’s billing department, claimed unauthorized activity was underway. The victim says he quickly called the number, and the scammer likely installed malware on his iPhone to tap into his bank account. Chase says reimbursement is not happening. “After further review, our claim denial stands as we found these transactions were authorized by the customer with no evidence of fraudulent account takeover or of a compromised device.” Lastly, Bank of America refused to reimburse a customer who lost $450 to a taxi scam in Panama. Keith Lee says he was charged $450 for a $10 cab ride, according to the Elliott Report. The driver claimed Lee’s card didn’t process, so he paid cash. Bank of America denied his dispute, saying a chip-verified “card-present” transaction was executed. Consumer advocate Christopher Elliott then stepped in, contacting BofA on Lee’s behalf. After hearing from Elliott, Bank of America finally reversed the charge. Elliott says the bank acknowledged such taxi scams are well-known.

While Solana is riding a wave of institutional momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly capturing attention with its community-first model and impressive presale ROI projections. Solana Rallies on ETF Momentum and Technical Breakout Solana is continuing its upward trajectory after breaking out of a long-term falling wedge and holding key support at $144 earlier this week. Despite broader market softness yesterday, SOL dipped just 3%, signaling resilience that analysts attribute to strong investor confidence. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $147, marking a 1.9% daily loss. According to CoinGlass, the long-to-short ratio among Binance’s top traders is 2.49, meaning they hold 2.5 times more long positions than shorts on SOL. Adding to the bullish narrative, crypto strategist Ali Martinez has identified a textbook cup-and-handle formation on Solana’s higher timeframes. He projects a breakout could push SOL toward $3,000 and potentially higher. Institutional interest is also gaining traction. The recently launched REX Shares Solana Staking ETF recorded strong trading volume within its first 48 hours. Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts estimate between $3 billion and $6 billion in potential inflows once spot Solana ETFs receive SEC approval. Further underscoring investor appetite, CME Solana Futures open interest surged to a record $167 million following the ETF’s debut. If Solana can break through resistance levels at $180 and $240, analysts believe a path toward a new all-time high is within reach. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as Q3’s Breakout Layer-1 Project While Solana dominates headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum as one of the most promising and overlooked Layer-1 tokens of Q3 2025. The project is currently progressing through its presale and has rapidly expanded its community base. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its community-first approach. A significant portion of its total token supply was allocated to presale participants, deliberately avoiding venture capital or institutional pre-allocation. This structure promotes fair ownership, decentralization, and a grassroots foundation. Its political relevance and rapidly expanding online presence on Telegram and X have amplified its visibility and attracted ideologically aligned investors. Unlike meme coins built solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is merging crypto fundamentals with cultural identity and long-term utility. Conclusion As the MAGACOIN FINANCE presale continues, the current entry point offers one of the most attractive setups for retail and early-stage investors ahead of its exchange listing. For traders scouting the next breakout altcoin of Q3, MAGACOIN may be the one to watch.

Democrats Push Back On GOP Crypto Week According to the Friday notice posted on the House Financial Services Committee’s website, Democratic lawmakers will be pushing against the Republican Party’s planned “Crypto Week” in opposition to their political opponents’ mobilization to pass crypto legislation. NEW: To counter the GOP’s “Crypto Week,” Reps. @RepMaxineWaters & @RepStephenLynch are launching “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week,” rallying Dems to block the GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act & Anti-CBDC bill — warning they pave the way for what they call Trump’s crypto corruption. pic.twitter.com/kpT6JpTEKx — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) July 11, 2025 Specifically, Waters and Lynch called out both the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act by name in the notice, going so far as to call the proposed rulemaking “dangerous pieces of crypto legislation.” The two U.S. lawmakers also took aim at U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures , claiming his dive into the world of digital assets is merely a part of his “evil and corrupt crypto empire.” “Aside from lacking urgently needed consumer protections and national security guardrails, these bills would make Congress complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam – one that has personally enriched himself, his entire family, and the billionaire insiders in his cabinet, all while defrauding investors,” Waters said. Donald Trump’s Digital Asset Ventures Questioned Trump has garnered increased scrutiny in recent months over his affiliation with novel crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, over their new USD1 stablecoin as well as his the launch of his namesake memecoin $TRUMP. Critics of Trump’s ties to the blockchain sector allege that his Trump-affiliated cryptocurrencies may pose ethics concerns as anyone – including those involved in foreign governments – may purchase and hold the coins. “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto – especially given President Trump’s acceptance of billions of dollars in investment in his family crypto business from foreign governments and his blatant conflicts of interest,” said Congressman Lynch.

This move highlights a broader shift by EU authorities toward stronger oversight of the crypto industry. Under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation—a unified EU law aimed at streamlining rules for digital assets and related services—investor protections include clear standards for asset custody and complaint resolution, ESMA noted. Crypto regulators call for investor protection in the crypto ecosystem For years, regulators worldwide have expressed concerns about the crypto-related risks to digital asset investors. This was after various crypto platforms left several investors bankrupt after investing millions of their assets in them. An example is FTX , which failed in 2022. To address this, ESMA tried to unmask various factors that could lead to risks to which investors could be exposed. An example involves crypto asset service providers (CASPs) offering regulated and unregulated products on the same platform at once. The regulators explained how risky this was to investors, stating that customers might be unaware of which products lack MiCA’s protection. ESMA exposed additional risks linked to Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). The regulator pointed out that some CASPs promote their MiCA-regulated status to attract customers, which can create confusion about which aspects of their offerings are regulated. Following this, ESMA has urged crypto firms to stop using their regulatory status as a tool for promotion and suggesting to their clients that crypto products and services are regulated when, in reality, they are not covered by the EU’s rules. Notably, MiCA does not regulate products and services that include direct investments in commodities like gold and lending involving crypto-assets. The EU releases new guidelines in the crypto market The EU has introduced new guidelines for the cryptocurrency sector, requiring crypto firms to secure a CASP license from a national regulator. This license will serve as a passport, enabling companies to offer crypto services across all EU member states. ESMA also issued regulations on staff employment in crypto companies. According to the regulators, t he staff should be knowledgeable and skilled in evaluating crypto services. ESMA’s remarks come a day after it investigated Malta’s process for issuing the license and discovered that Malta’s Financial Services Authority did not do a complete job in evaluating the risks of a specific unnamed crypto company. The review showed that the Maltese regulator had the knowledge and resources to approve and oversee crypto companies. However, its approval process only met expectations “partially.” In response to these accusations, the Maltese regulator said it took pride in being one of the first to adopt digital asset rules. At the same time, it avoided directly addressing the criticisms. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that ESMA was not the first to raise concerns on Malta’s process for issuing the license; some of the regulators had expressed fears behind closed doors about the swiftness with which some EU member states were issuing crypto licenses.

House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters and subcommittee colleague Stephen Lynch announced their intention to oppose a package of bills that Republicans plan to fast-track starting Monday. According to Waters, the proposed laws lack crucial consumer safeguards and threaten to expose the U.S. financial system to new vulnerabilities. Accusations of Favoring Industry Interests “[Republicans are] doubling down by fast-tracking a dangerous package of crypto legislation through Congress,” Waters said. She further claimed that the bills would make lawmakers “complicit in Trump’s unprecedented crypto scam,” referencing the former president’s ventures in the digital asset space. Legislative Package Includes Three Key Bills The crypto package includes the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate payment stablecoins and has already passed the Senate. Also on the table are the CLARITY Act, which would establish digital asset market structure, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to block any development of a U.S. government-issued digital currency. While Republicans hold a slim House majority, it remains uncertain whether they can gather enough support to pass all three bills, particularly in the face of unified Democratic opposition. Concerns Over National Security and Oversight Lynch criticized the GOP for prioritizing crypto industry interests over consumer protection. “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto,” he said. Many Democrats argue the legislation would reduce oversight by shifting regulatory authority away from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and toward the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Trump’s Crypto Ties Complicate Debate Trump’s connections to the crypto sector are also drawing attention. Reports indicate his personal wealth has increased by roughly $620 million in recent months, driven largely by investments in crypto-related ventures, including World Liberty Financial. This firm has reportedly launched its own stablecoin, USD1, raising further questions about the intersection of political influence and crypto regulation. Senate to Take Up Market Structure Bill While the GENIUS Act is likely to reach the president’s desk soon, momentum around the CLARITY Act appears to be shifting toward the Senate. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand are working toward a new draft of the bill with the goal of finalizing legislation by September 30. House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill said the revised draft will be the “best” version debated since 2023. Regulatory Roles Could Shift A comprehensive market structure bill would clarify regulatory jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC. Current drafts suggest handing more oversight to the CFTC, particularly for registering and supervising digital asset platforms. This restructuring could significantly reshape how cryptocurrencies are governed in the United States moving forward.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-12 00:33:46

The decision, which caught most of the industry off guard, adds another layer of pressure on U.S. businesses that rely heavily on imported copper to function. Refined copper is the largest import category, and its inclusion is expected to cause ripple effects across key sectors like energy, construction, electronics, and auto manufacturing. People close to the matter confirmed the tariff’s reach, noting that semi-finished copper products will also be affected. Those include rods, tubes, and other intermediary forms essential for turning raw copper into finished goods. U.S. producers don’t make enough of either to meet current demand, which is why this move is already causing concern among manufacturers. Industry tells Trump to leave copper scrap alone Just hours after Trump’s announcement on Tuesday, his Council of Economic Advisers met with metals industry executives. They urged the president not to include export controls on copper scrap. The U.S. produces more scrap than it can use, and the excess is shipped overseas. Industry leaders argued that blocking these exports wouldn’t help the domestic shortfall, it would just create a surplus no one can process. Executives from Rio Tinto, Southwire, and Trafigura were among those who asked Trump to instead restrict the exports of ore and scrap rather than taxing imports. Their position is that focusing on outbound shipments would be more effective in protecting domestic supply. The U.S. imported 908,000 metric tons of refined copper last year. It’s defined as copper with more than 99.993% purity, and it’s what fabricators rely on to make alloys, rods, and wires. Southwire, the largest fabricator in North America, supplies copper for military applications including naval vessels and bases. The company declined to comment. On top of that, the U.S. also imported 800,000 tons of semi-fabricated copper and alloy products in the same year. These imports filled the gap that domestic production couldn’t cover. A March 31 filing from the Copper Development Association to the Commerce Department explained that copper semis are critical to the military-industrial supply chain. The group, speaking for 90% of domestic copper semi producers, argued that the U.S. is structurally dependent on imports. Krisztina Kalman, co-founder of consultancy MM Markets, said she believes the 50% tariff will eventually hit semi-products too. “Any disturbance in foreign supply of copper and semi-finished products could expose the U.S. to significant issues in delivering electricity,” she said. She also warned that U.S. producers don’t have the capacity to replace the lost imports. “The local fabricators will not be able to produce 800,000 tons more semi-products with current capacity, and it could take up to seven years to install new capacity.” Chile, Canada react as market braces for long-term disruption Chile, the world’s top copper producer, has not yet received formal notice of the new tariffs, but Mining Minister Aurora Williams confirmed on Thursday that her government is pushing for an exemption. “Chilean mining production, in all its gambits, has high responsibility, is highly valued and highly necessary for manufacturing in the U.S.,” she told reporters. She also stressed that Chile’s refined copper is shipped with full traceability. Canada, the second-largest supplier of copper to the U.S., responded more aggressively. Industry Minister Melanie Joly called the tariffs “illegal” and promised to “fight” them. Speaking at an event in Vancouver, she said the measures were “a direct attack against its workers.” Meanwhile, the copper market is already reacting. Analysts at Macquarie said that once tariffs kick in, U.S. consumers will begin using copper from stockpiles that were built up earlier this year. They estimate those inventories will last about nine months, giving some temporary breathing room before the real supply squeeze hits. Last year, U.S. production of refined copper from ore totaled 850,000 tons, while imports added another 810,000 tons, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Recycling and inventory drawdowns made up the remaining 5% of the country’s copper demand. With only two active copper smelters in the U.S., about half of the semi-processed ore produced here is sent abroad; mostly to China. Rebuilding domestic capacity isn’t going to happen overnight. If refined copper is taxed but semi-fabricated products are not, analysts warn that those semi-products could flood the U.S. market instead. Alon Olsha and Richard Bourke of Bloomberg Intelligence wrote, “Without broader incentives and tariffs on semi-finished goods, import reliance will likely persist and hurt copper consumers.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, warned in June that AI might trigger a steep rise in joblessness soon. According to him, automation could wipe out one-half of white-collar entry level roles and push unemployment to roughly 20 percent over the coming 5 years. Huang argued that when companies develop new concepts, they can both boost output and create roles. But without fresh ambitions, he added, “productivity drives down,” which could mean fewer positions. He further added that the most fundamental aspect is having new ideas in society. Huang stressed the fact that as long as society has new ideas, it will grow and be productive. Investment in AI has surged, sparking a technology boom and stoking concerns about job losses. Some 41 percent of CEOs expect AI to cut staff numbers at several thousand firms in the coming 5 years, based on a survey from 2024 by Adecco. A January 2024 report from the World Economic Forum found that 41 percent of companies are planning to shrink their hiring by the year 2030 due to automation provided by AI. AI will make some jobs obsolete while creating new jobs, Huang says Huang added that AI will eventually affect everyone’s jobs. Some of these jobs may become completely obsolete, while new jobs will form. He added that he hopes that increased productivity from AI will lift industries. Nvidia reached a market value of $4 trillion and is at the forefront of the AI wave. It’s chips power data centres used by Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to run cloud operations and AI models. Defending AI’s progress, Huang noted that in the past 300 years, and through the computer age, both output and employment have risen. He said new technology helps foster “an abundance of ideas” and fresh ways of building better futures. AI is set to change how tasks are accomplished. Over half of major U.S. firms are planning to bring automation to their tasks like supplier payments and invoice processing, based on a Duke University survey. Huang admitted that AI has even altered his own role, but he still has his job. Many companies already use tools such as ChatGPT and other chatbots to accomplish tasks like writing job adverts, press statements, and marketing plans.

The financial platform is now up more than 161% in 2025, fueled by the crypto market’s rally and a flood of retail momentum. But that spike came just as Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan plans to charge fintech firms for access to customer bank data, a decision that could slam Robinhood and its peers with new costs. That news hit hard. Robinhood relies on slim margins to offer free services. Just the idea of added costs rattled the market. PayPal and Affirm each dropped nearly 6% on the same day. And while Robinhood stayed green, the pullback from its intraday high showed just how fragile a rally could be in this era. Robinhood keeps facing backlash over crypto “Robinhood has long claimed to be the best bargain, but we believe those representations were deceptive,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said. His office is focusing on the company’s use of payment for order flow, where market makers pay Robinhood to execute trades. James said that practice could result in worse prices for users. Lucas Moskowitz, Robinhood Crypto’s general counsel, defended the platform’s practices in a statement to CNBC, calling the company’s trade disclosures “best-in-class.” “We disclose pricing information to customers during the lifecycle of a trade that clearly outlines the spread or the fees associated with the transaction, and the revenue Robinhood receives,” Lucas said. That wasn’t Robinhood’s only problem this week. The company announced it would begin taking 25% of staking rewards from U.S. users starting October 1. In Europe, it plans to take 15%. That puts it close to Coinbase, which charges anywhere from 25.25% to 35%, but higher than Gemini’s flat 15% fee. Robinhood avoided staking before due to U.S. regulatory pressure, but under President Donald Trump, the SEC has backed off its crackdown. Recent cases against Coinbase and Binance have been dropped, giving firms room to bring back services like staking. Robinhood triggers OpenAI dispute with tokenized stock rollout Robinhood is also facing scrutiny in Europe over its new tokenized stock program. The company launched blockchain-based assets giving users synthetic exposure to private firms like OpenAI and SpaceX through special purpose vehicles (SPVs). These tokens don’t offer voting rights or direct ownership. They track the value of SPVs that hold shares in the actual companies. In an interview with CNBC International, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev admitted, “It is true that these are not technically equity.” But he defended the offering. “What’s important is that retail customers have an opportunity to get exposure to this asset,” Vlad said, arguing that institutional investors often use similar financial instruments. Vlad also said that Robinhood is cooperating. “Since this is a new thing, regulators are going to want to look at it,” he said. “And we expect to be scrutinized as a large, innovative player in this space.” On CNBC’s Squawk Box, SEC Chair Paul Atkins called the model “an innovation,” a rare bit of support even as regulatory rules remain unclear in most regions. While the legal drama builds, Robinhood is already working on what could be its next big move. The company said it’s developing an app tied to Trump’s newly signed megabill, which includes $1,000 investment accounts seeded by the government for every newborn in the country. The initiative, known as ‘Trump Accounts’, could give Robinhood access to millions of new users. It’s early, but the company said it’s already prototyping the app. Robinhood’s year has been fast and messy. The market loves the growth. But the real question is how long Robinhood can keep flying this high before regulators pull it back to earth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On X, he warned that Bitcoin’s most recent surge put the cryptocurrency in what he described as the “ Banana Zone ,” ripe for potentially damaging emotional decision making based on FOMO, the fear of missing out. Bitcoin recently jumped above $117,000, a new record peak, igniting speculation it could surge as high as $124,000 or higher. Kiyosaki has a great answer to the run-up: Don’t go by emotion but strategy. “Be a smarter investor,” he said, noting that impulsive purchasing during euphoric market cycles is often associated with crippling losses. “Don’t be a HOG. HOGs get slaughtered. Be a PIG instead. PIGs get fat.” He shared that his buys were at $110,000, indicating conviction that we are long-term bullish, and cautioned against diving into the market at the top for no particular reason. His strategy? Wait for the market to correct, then buy back at a discount. Traders fuel fear and greed in banana zone rally Real Vision CEO and macro investor Raoul Pal is credited with popularizing the “Banana Zone”. It refers to a phase of rapid, nearly vertical price growth typically limited to high-demand, low-supply assets such as Bitcoin. Kiyosaki expressed a similar sentiment to Pal, stating that the “limited” nature of Bitcoin means that when there is an appetite for the coin, thereby driving up its interest, it faces a ton of upward pressure due to its scarcity. This cycle is usually driven by institutional adoption, media frenzy, and retail investor frenzy. It delivers the possibility of explosive gains but also introduces volatility, extreme risk, and emotional trading. As with previous surges, the current burst of optimism could lead to a short-lived price spike and some real downside risk, Kiyosaki said. He cautioned that many fresh investors are diving into the markets without understanding how fickle a game trading cryptocurrency can be. This flood of FOMO-driven buyers, he said, could add significant instability to the market. He said that as the price only goes up, inexperienced investors could become panicky, resulting in a “slaughtering” of those who bought in at these levels. In Kiyosaki’s view, this stage sees many investors piling in without doing any independent research, hoping for a quick buck. This “herd instinct” frequently results in excessive buying at the peak, with mass panic selling when the price “falls off a cliff”. He said investors should focus on educating themselves instead of chasing price surges while maintaining discipline. He cautioned that this was not the time to follow the crowd blindly, but rather an opportunity to sharpen their thinking. Traders push Bitcoin higher as risk escalates Bitcoin’s climb to $118,000 has bulls and analysts cheering. Some in the market believe the asset is in the early stages of a long-term bull run. Estimates of $124,000 or more are already being labeled conservative by certain circles. The more aggressive forecasters call for $250,000 by the end of 2025, and even $1 million by 2030 — particularly if macroeconomic travails continue to erode faith in fiat currencies. Kiyosaki, an ardent critic of central bank control over global monetary policy and fiat currency systems, believes Bitcoin is “people’s money” and that the flagship cryptocurrency presents a strong hedge against inflation. He’s sung Bitcoin’s praises for its fixed supply and decentralized nature multiple times. In June 2024, he repeated his faith in Raoul Pal’s Banana Zone theory and became a legendary figure of the upcoming bull market. He says he bought his first Bitcoin when the price was $6,000. Those early decisions have more than paid off, and he emphasizes that gains did so because he was investing smart and patiently, not gambling on hype.

The spike wiped out an estimated $1.25 billion in short positions within a single trading day, according to CoinGlass figures. Bitcoin Bull Trap Or Breakout? Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards took to X as the breakout unfolded. “New all-time highs beget new ATHs. It’s usually unwise to ignore a major breakout like this, until invalidated,” he wrote, adding that corporate treasury demand has “grown exponentially, with dozens of new companies popping up in recent months.” Edwards’ base-case projection calls for a further 50–70 percent advance over the next six months—roughly $170,000–$196,000. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold His focus on treasuries is backed by hard data. Public companies added a record 159,107 BTC in Q2—pushing aggregate corporate holdings above 847,000 BTC, or about four percent of max supply. Corporate Bitcoin acquisitions have even outpaced ETF net inflows. Matthew Sigel, head of digital-asset research at VanEck, framed Bitcoin’s trajectory within a broader macro and policy backdrop. “The natural course for Bitcoin remains higher, driven by persistent US debt and deficit problems, demographic tailwinds, a weakening dollar, growing momentum around Fed rate cuts, and the potential for a new Fed chair next year,” he wrote on X. Sigel also highlighted Capitol Hill’s looming “Crypto Week,” where stablecoin legislation is widely viewed as the most passable of several digital-asset bills. Those developments, he argues, make $180,000 “very much in play for 2025.” Law-makers appear to share the sense of urgency. A press statement from the House Financial Services Committee confirms that the week of 14 July will be dedicated to advancing the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the GENIUS Act. Passage would establish the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and market structure, a change Sigel says could “unlock wide-open capital markets” for the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Spot Bitcoin ETFs are hardly idle: net inflows into BlackRock’s iShares fund alone have pushed its holdings past 700,000 BTC in the 18 months since launch. Yet Edwards and Sigel both note that treasury companies have become the marginal buyer in 2025. The dynamic creates what Edwards calls a “cap-raising flywheel,” as firms showcase outperforming share prices—up nearly 60 percent year-to-date for the treasury cohort—when courting investors. Notably, the rally is unfolding against a supportive macro backdrop. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller told a Dallas Fed audience he is “open to cutting the policy rate in July,” arguing current settings are “too tight” given waning inflation pressures. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Fed chair Jerome Powell over the past weeks, demanding immediate rate cuts. Trump’s tariff escalation also seems to fade out, supporting the Bitcoin rally. Notwithstanding euphoric headlines, technicians warn that momentum must sustain above $110,000 to avoid a failed-breakout pattern. “This theory would be weakened with closes below $110K and invalidated below $105K,” Edwards concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $117,854.

Litecoin remains a trusted name for its strong network and stable performance, drawing attention from those focused on long-term gains. BONK, meanwhile, has taken the meme coin space by surprise, with its chart trends sparking real interest. But it’s BlockDAG (BDAG) that’s turning the most heads. With over $336 million raised so far in presale, 23.8 billion coins sold, and a smart referral program, it’s showing what community-driven growth can look like. This comparison unpacks how all three line up on stability, momentum, and future upside. Litecoin: Solid Performance and Steady Network Strength The outlook for Litecoin (LTC) remains appealing to those who trust stability when markets swing unpredictably. As one of the oldest coins around, Litecoin still draws traders who appreciate its quick transactions and consistently low fees. Recent data reinforces the Litecoin (LTC) forecast, showing strong support levels that help it maintain its position as a steady choice when hype dies down. Litecoin’s proven security and transaction speed keep it practical for day-to-day transfers and cross-chain activity. Even as newer Layer 2 projects bring more competition, Litecoin’s ongoing upgrades and fresh partnerships for payments hint that it can still adapt. Its reliable reputation makes it more than just a legacy coin, it’s a practical tool that keeps evolving alongside the market. For anyone looking to balance risk with reliability, Litecoin remains a staple worth watching. BONK: Chart Activity and Community Support Keep Eyes On BONK began as a playful meme project, but it’s now pulling serious attention as fresh price action draws traders to keep a close eye on BONK chart trends. Recent spikes in volume and steady zones of support show that this dog-themed coin may have staying power beyond the meme. Many traders now turn to BONK chart analysis to gauge its next possible move. If BONK pushes past the $0.000025 mark, some believe that steady buying pressure could unlock more gains ahead. Unlike other meme coins that fade, BONK’s team keeps working on new ideas that add real demand. This has helped keep the community engaged and the project moving forward. Watching how these chart patterns evolve in the months ahead could signal whether BONK’s fun energy turns into a more solid place among the top crypto coins in 2025. BlockDAG: Community Growth Driven by a Smart Referral Program BlockDAG stands out as one of the top crypto coins for 2025, having already raised over $336 million in its presale and sold 23.8 billion coins along with 18,516 miners. This strong traction shows real community trust. But what really powers its reach is a straightforward referral program that rewards users for sharing. The official program lets anyone earn 25% BDAG on every successful referral, while newcomers receive a 5% bonus on their first purchase. There’s no limit on how much can be earned, and users can easily share a unique link or QR code and track their rewards live on their dashboard. This makes every buyer an active part of BlockDAG’s organic growth, no expensive marketing campaigns needed. Right now, the limited presale price is locked at just $0.0016 until August 11 , offering a potential 3,025% ROI if the coin hits its fixed $0.05 launch price. Alongside this, BlockDAG’s energy-efficient mining and DAG-based architecture keep transaction speeds fast and costs low, making the network scalable for millions of users worldwide. This clear balance of smart incentives, solid figures, and a buyer-friendly approach gives BlockDAG a strong edge. Its blend of real tech utility and a motivated community could make it one of the standout crypto stories as the market heads into 2025. How These Three Coins Could Shape 2025 Litecoin’s solid foundation and consistent Litecoin (LTC) forecast reinforce its role as a steady option when the market turns shaky. BONK’s vibrant chart moves, backed by real trading signals and community backing, show why its chart trends deserve attention. Yet it’s BlockDAG’s big $336 million presale results, smart referral system, and powerful pricing window that really stand out. This combination of simple incentives and proven traction could shape BlockDAG’s story into one of the most talked-about gains in crypto. As 2025 approaches, all three offer different paths to watch, one rooted in reliability, one built on viral energy, and one driven by community power and clear returns.

This $0.03 Crypto With DeFi Utility Could Beat It There,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-dogecoin-doge-ever-hit-1-this-0-03-crypto-with-defi-utility-could-beat-it-there/,"With Dogecoin (DOGE) hovering around the $0.15 mark and still far from the elusive $1 milestone, the market is once again asking whether meme-fueled momentum alone is enough to drive lasting value. Meanwhile, a new coin is rising from the DeFi market, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a $0.03 token positioning itself not through hype, but through functional utility in real-world decentralized lending. The project has already sold more than 65% of presale stage 5 at $0.03. Investors are rushing in, this being the lowest MUTM will ever be. The project has raised more than $12 million and has attracted over 13,000 investors. In the race toward $1, speculation may still fuel headlines, but it’s utility-driven protocol Mutuum Finance that are quietly rewriting the rules. Dogecoin Holds Steady Around Key Levels, Eyes Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at approximately $0.1683, slightly down from intraday highs near $0.172, after rebounding from a support zone around $0.166 . Recent on-chain data shows whale wallets holding 1M–100M DOGE increasing accumulation even as retail traders reduced exposure, hinting at confident long-term interest despite sideways movement. DOGE’s movement contrasts with emerging utility-based tokens, most notably Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as investors remain watchful for assets with on‑chain DeFi use cases. Strong Demand Marks Stage 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some real steam as it climbs up Stage 5 of its presale. Having already amassed over 13,000 early adopters and over $12 million in funding raised, the project is leaping giant strides as a top contender in the DeFi. Mutuum Finance, in a bid to contribute more to its DeFi, is launching a fully collateralized stablecoin backed by USD on the Ethereum blockchain. Contrary to highly risk-leveraged algorithmic stablecoins, the token has been designed in such a manner that will guarantee its value even during times of market fluctuation. Mutuum Finance has launched a Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, wherein a 50,000 USDT reward is provided. The bounty is divided into four levels of severity, i.e., the critical, major, minor, and low. This will balance out all the vulnerability and reward tiers. Incentives for Early Supporters As a token of appreciation to the early supporters and in commemoration of the presale hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners like these will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a reward for being part of the early supporters of the project. With growing community at an exponential rate, the early supporters are rewarded, not only with the potential future gains, but with real, live rewards. Mutuum Finance’s Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is constructed as a hybrid lending protocol that will serve the passive and active DeFi users. The users can earn passive income since they lend their USDT via smart contracts pools, which provide stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending protocol. In addition, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables borrowers and lenders to be as engaging as they can ever be in exchanging terms of an agreement and do not require a third party to have influence over them on their behalf. The model is more prevalent for the clients of less secure assets. Dogecoin (DOGE) may still dream of $1, but it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s making real moves. Priced at $0.03, over $12 million raised, 13,000+ investors, and 65% of Stage 5 sold, MUTM is backed by real DeFi utility, a CertiK audit, and a $50K bug bounty. With a USD-backed stablecoin, dual lending model, and a $100K giveaway live, the time to act is now. Join the presale before the next price jump.

48073345,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=764647,1752284593,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48073345.jpeg,Brazil downplays economic risk amid market jitters and US tensions,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-open-to-lula-talks/,"Brazil’s government on Friday minimized concerns over the economic fallout from US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, expressing hope for future negotiations even as tensions flared over legal proceedings involving former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump told reporters he might eventually speak to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva but criticized Brazil’s judiciary for prosecuting Bolsonaro, who faces charges of attempting to overturn Lula’s 2022 election victory. “Maybe at some point I’ll talk to him. Right now I’m not,” Trump said before departing for flood-hit Texas, reiterating his belief that Bolsonaro is being treated “very unfairly.” In response, Lula reaffirmed Brazil’s willingness to negotiate but warned of retaliation if diplomacy fails. “We’ll first try to negotiate, but if there’s no negotiation, the law of reciprocity will be put into practice,” Lula said in a Thursday interview with Record TV. Brazil downplays economic risk amid market jitters and US tensions Despite the tariff threat, Brazil’s Finance Ministry projected limited economic impact, maintaining its 2.5% GDP growth forecast for 2025. Officials said only specific sectors, like aerospace and energy machinery—heavily reliant on US buyers—might suffer. A White House official, speaking anonymously, said that critical sectors such as oil and minerals would remain exempt, aligning with broader tariff policies announced in April. Oil is Brazil’s top export to the US, but local industry groups expressed uncertainty about whether exemptions would continue. The US also imports significant volumes of Brazilian steel, coffee, pulp, beef, and orange juice—goods Brazil believes can be redirected to other markets. “It is not like we cannot survive without the US,” Lula said, reiterating Brazil’s ongoing efforts to diversify its trade partnerships. China already accounts for 28% of exports, compared to 12% for the US. Still, Brazilian exporters are wary. The country’s beef lobby warned the tariffs would make trade with the US “economically unfeasible.” In a letter to Lula earlier in the week, Trump linked the proposed tariffs to Bolsonaro’s ongoing prosecution, leaving little room for Brazil to maneuver. Lula, speaking to TV Globo, condemned Trump’s rationale as “extremely outrageous,” stating that Bolsonaro “didn’t just try to stage a coup—he tried to prepare my death.” Bolsonaro denies all accusations. Markets react cautiously as tensions weigh on investor confidence Financial markets reflected the unease. The Brazilian real slid 0.7% against the dollar on Friday, while the Bovespa stock index dipped 0.5%, with the weekly decline for the real on track to be the steepest since February. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s promised 50% copper tariffs are set to include all refined metal. This shows the president’s far-reaching efforts to bolster American production of one of the world’s most ubiquitous materials. Trump’s announcement of the levy, which he said would begin Aug. 1, lacked much detail. Still, refined copper will be included, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named, as discussions are private. Refined copper is critical to various industries, including construction, electric vehicles, power grids, and consumer electronics. Bloomberg reported that levies are also expected to apply to semi-finished copper products, which could further widen the policy’s impact across the supply chain. While the plan underscores Trump’s aggressive push to protect and revive American manufacturing, it is not yet finalized. A White House official noted that the tariff measures are still being evaluated and should not be considered definitive until officially announced by the president. In response to the announcement, the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers met with industry stakeholders hours later. Sources say the industry urged the administration not to apply export restrictions on copper scrap, a byproduct of which the US is a major global supplier. With domestic scrap output exceeding local demand, much of the excess is shipped abroad, making it a critical component of international trade for the US metals sector.

This was just after the US President slapped a 35% tariff on the Nation. Navarro stated in an interview that he encouraged Canadian citizens to ask their leaders to negotiate fairly with the US. His remarks reveal that US trading partners still have time to negotiate for lower tariff rates as the August 1 deadline is around the corner. Navarro also noted that Trump’s tariff policies did not apply to products brought into the country through the trade agreement between the US, Mexico, and Canada. Navarro finds Canadians very challenging in trade talks with the US Trump’s 35% tariff policies on Canada’s imports highlight that the president has ratcheted his trade talk and is focused on imposing tariff rates on the US trading partners after being involved in lengthy trade talks. US-Canada trade talks did not resemble those of other trading partners subjected to reciprocal tariffs. Mark Carney, the Prime Minister of Canada, mainly focused on ensuring Trump did not impose higher tariffs on their imports. Canada was initially subjected to a 25% tariff on imports from Country. The 35% tariff rate, which is set to take effect in August, was approximately 10% higher than the current one. However, this was not as intense as expected. This is because the USMCA agreement, which includes most of Canada’s exports to the US, neutralized the situation. On Friday, July 11, Navarro referred to Canada as a tough negotiator. In his opinion, Trump was doing the right thing as his tariffs counteracted higher taxes on US products and barriers to trade in other countries. Navarro stated that they talked with both the Mexicans and the Canadians. From the talks, he claimed that dealing with the Mexicans was a true pleasure during trade discussions in Trump’s first term, when he helped create the USMCA agreement. He further explained that the Mexicans were tough negotiators, but they were also fair and reasonable. On the other hand, Navarro mentioned that he found the Canadians very challenging and noted that they have always been hard to work with. Trump intends to subject several US trading partners to a blanket tariff ranging from 15% to 20% Following Trump’s 35% tariff threat on certain Canadian exports on July 11, and w ith the possibility of raising taxes in several other countries, he intensified his trade talks in statements that affected stock prices and strengthened the US dollar. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, posted on social media, Trump highlighted that Fentanyl is not the only issue the US faces with Canada. According to him, they have a lot of tariffs, non-tariff policies , and trade barriers that create huge trade deficits for the United States. The US president’s statement on Canada followed his remark to NBC News, where he pointed out plans to subject several US trading partners to a blanket tariff ranging from 15% to 20%. NBC reported that Trump mentioned that they would ensure that all the other countries pay, whether 20% or 15%. Based on his argument, they would figure that out. He also anticipated that the tariffs would be welcomed positively, revealing that the stock market reached a new high that day. Notably, the existing global average minimum tariff rate is nearly 10% for almost all of America’s trading partners. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While investors with diversified portfolios have been leaning on non-US assets for returns, July is flipping the script. The US index is now outpacing major global ETFs that had previously taken the lead, including those tied to Europe, emerging markets, and ex-US world stocks. This reversal comes even as trade tensions are ramping up again under President Donald Trump. During a call with Kristen Welker of NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Trump pointed to Wall Street’s record levels as proof the tariffs are being “very well-received.” For US investors locked into the S&P 500, that confidence seems justified… at least for now. White House targets Brazil and Canada as ETFs slide US markets may be up, but foreign assets are under pressure. The iShares MSCI Brazil ETF (EWZ), which had been outperforming the S&P 500 earlier this year, is now down 4.6% just in July. That drop came after Trump slapped a brutal 50% tariff on Brazilian imports this week. The iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) is also falling behind, following a similar pattern. Both countries are now facing direct trade retaliation from Washington, and the market is reacting fast. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, Chief Investment Officer for the Americas and Global Head of Equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note that Trump appears “emboldened to escalate trade actions” after winning some recent policy fights. Ulrike noted that many of the most heavily weighted stocks in the S&P 500 are largely safe from these tariff shocks. “We think the index can climb to 6,500 by June next year despite periodic volatility,” she wrote . That would represent about a 4% rise from where the index stood last Friday. The insulation Ulrike is talking about comes from the S&P 500’s heavy exposure to tech and other sectors that aren’t directly tied to the flow of physical goods. That makes it harder for tariffs to dent the value of many big US companies. It also gives domestic stocks a cushion that international funds just don’t have right now. US recovers dominance as global bets lose steam During the first half of 2025, foreign markets had the upper hand—a rare situation, given the last decade of US-led performance. But by July, that dynamic has started to swing back. Vanguard’s global ETFs excluding the US are now trailing the S&P 500, wiping out earlier gains. Investors who went all-in on diversification at the start of the year are now watching US stocks pull ahead again. Peter Oppenheimer, Chief Global Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs International, said US equities are still pricey. “Valuation spreads between the US and the rest of the world are at historical highs,” Peter wrote in a client memo. Even with that, he admitted that the US has reclaimed its footing faster than expected. “After a decade of US-led dominance, the case for diversification is back,” he said, but current numbers are proving otherwise. The S&P 500’s comeback puts pressure on global funds that were supposed to be the safe bet in a volatile election year. But that safety looks weaker now that Brazil and Canada are taking direct hits. Trump’s new tariffs are doing more damage abroad than at home, at least in the short term. Investors with broader exposure might feel the squeeze more than those who stuck with the core US index. And with Ulrike forecasting a 6,500 level by next summer, that bet on the S&P 500 is starting to look more appealing again, even if it comes with occasional swings. Right now, the American stock market is running hot, tariffs or not. And unless something drastic changes, July could be the point where the US fully reclaims its lead from the rest of the world.

Polygon (POL) is aiming for a breakout, with the next Polygon (POL) price target set at $0.2167 as it climbs above resistance at $0.1983. At the same time, signs of a VeChain (VET) price surge are building, with the token testing a big trendline and flashing bullish indicators. On the presale side, BlockDAG (BDAG) is turning heads with its Buyer Battles, sending out millions of BDAG coins daily. The setup is simple, fast, and loaded with energy. With two major tokens on the edge of a run and one presale making noise with big daily rewards, the market’s heating up fast. Let’s get into the details. Polygon (POL) Eyes $0.2167 as Breakout Momentum Grows The chart for Polygon (POL) is looking strong. A bullish MACD crossover just formed, and the Balance of Power indicator shows buyers stepping in. RSI is at 54.88 and climbing, which leaves room for more upside before things get overheated. If POL moves past $0.1983, the Polygon (POL) price target lands at $0.2167, matching up with the 1.618 Fibonacci level. If buyers keep pushing, prices might go beyond that too. If it dips, there’s support around $0.182 near the 0.618 Fib mark, which could help stabilize short-term pullbacks. VET Price Surge Could Be Close as Trendline Gets Tested VeChain (VET) is lining up for a breakout. The token is testing a descending trendline, which could be the trigger for a VeChain (VET) price surge. It’s already up 2.39% in 24 hours and recently hit $0.02140. If VET breaks above the current resistance, the first move could take it to $0.035, which would be a 63% jump. But it may not stop there. Some analysts see a full VeChain (VET) price surge hitting $0.05197, a 113% gain. History backs this up too, with a past breakout sending VET soaring by 252%. Daily Battles Heat Up: 50M BDAG Coins on the Line! Top crypto traders all share one habit: they move fast when the right setup appears. No waiting, no doubt, just action. That’s why BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles is getting serious attention across the space. Here’s the deal: 50 million BDAG coins are released each day. If they don’t all get picked up, the top buyer of the day takes the rest. The clock resets every day at 00:00 UTC. This isn’t a basic rewards event. It shows how much BlockDAG is focused on community. The platform already has a working testnet, mobile miner, and build tools live. Now, Buyer Battles adds more ways for early users to win. Right now, BDAG is still priced at $0.0016 in Batch 29, with the launch price confirmed at $0.05. That gives a 3,025% gain locked from the start. But this fixed rate ends with the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. BlockDAG has now raised $336 million, and the presale is charging toward the $600 million goal. Buzz is building fast. Some market watchers are now calling for a $1 listing price. For anyone tracking the top cryptos to buy now, the timing could make all the difference. Once the early price window closes, it won’t open again. Where’s the Heat in the Market Right Now? If it breaks resistance, the Polygon (POL) price target is now marked at $0.2167. Meanwhile, signs of a Vechain (VET) price surge are showing, with forecasts reaching up to 113% if current barriers are crossed. Still, when it comes to finding the top crypto to buy now , BlockDAG brings a strong case. At $0.0016, it offers the potential for 3,025% gains at launch, with no delay in action. With Buyer Battles active, traders can grab millions of coins every single day, adding even more upside. But the $0.0016 price won’t last much longer. The window is closing fast, and those who move now could see the biggest return.

According to SoSoValue data, IBIT saw $448 million in net inflows on July 10. On the same day, trading volume exceeded $5.39 billion, reflecting strong liquidity and sustained investor demand. The ETF’s net asset value is $80.11 billion, with each share trading around $64.50. These numbers represent not just a lot of money going into IBIT, but also the inclination of Bitcoin’s market value. IBIT now owns over 700k BTC and is one of BTC’s largest institutional holders. This holding represents around 3.55% of the total amount of Bitcoin. The fund was doing well amid a spurt in investor confidence in Bitcoin and the demand for exposure in a secure, regulated form. Unlike having Bitcoin directly under management, these ETFs, like IBIT, mean you can gain exposure without handling wallets or private keys, making them an attractive prospect for institutional/traditional investors. IBIT outpaces traditional ETFs and gold Though the meteoric trajectory of IBIT has no precedence in the crypto space, it has also outperformed the most successful traditional ETFs. IEFA required 2,034 days to achieve the same level while IEMG required 2,089 days. In contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF achieved this in just over a year. However, and in complete contrast, IBIT pulled off the task within a little over a year. Source: Eric Balchunas X According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the growth was “historic,” noting that IBIT hit the AUM milestone five times faster than any other fund. He also pointed out that the combined total AUM for all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has topped over $140 billion for the first time. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has also beaten gold to the accumulation finish line. It has taken in $70 billion AUM five times faster than gold-backed EFTs captured that level. This is a sign that more and more people are treating Bitcoin not as a risky bet, but are comparing it to something like traditional commodities in being a store of value. This change is crucial, as international financial uncertainty encourages investors to find alternative methods to protect themselves against inflation and fiat currency fluctuation. Bitcoin, the “digital gold,” is being looked at in some quarters as a rival to physical gold in institutional portfolios. IBIT accelerates toward matching Satoshi’s Bitcoin holdings Another major milestone has been reached: BlackRock’s IBIT is home to more than 700k BTC . This puts the firm on course to top the estimated holdings of Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who is thought to have as much as 1 million BTC. If the current pace of accumulation continues, BlackRock would exceed that amount by 2026. Today, IBIT is the 21st largest ETF in the world — a stunning accomplishment for an upstart newcomer. Its success has reset the baseline for how swiftly a crypto-related financial product can earn trust and traction on Wall Street. This shift mirrors a fundamental change in the relationship between digital assets and traditional financial systems. Institutional players hesitated to get involved with crypto for years, citing volatility, lack of regulation, and security issues. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly one that Forbes reported was backed by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, opens a new chapter. With ongoing interest from pension funds, family offices, and big wealth managers, the fund will likely experience even bigger inflows as Bitcoin becomes more mainstream in finance.

The lack of retail-driven hype amid BTC’s record-breaking run suggests there may still be room for further growth in the flagship cryptocurrency. Bitcoin ATH Sees Absence Of Hype According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Bitcoin’s current rally is notably characterized by the absence of retail investors. The contributor argues that this lack of retail participation implies BTC may still have significant upside potential. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Ahead? DXY Breakdown Suggests Capital Shift To Risk-On Assets The analysis centers on the Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge metric, which tracks the frequency of retail trading activity in the Bitcoin spot market. The analyst shared the following chart to illustrate the trend. When retail trading activity rises significantly compared to the one-year moving average (MA), the chart forms bubbles. Green bubbles indicate that there are very few retail investors currently in the market. Orange bubbles show that trading activity among retail investors is picking up. Similarly, red bubbles indicate caution, hinting that there are too many retail investors in the market and that it may be a good time to consider exit strategies. As the below chart shows, retail activity remains subdued – even as BTC continues to reach new ATHs. In fact, the metric has stayed within the gray zone since March 2024, reflecting a lack of mass retail entry. Historically, retail trading tends to surge as BTC approaches or exceeds ATH levels. The analyst notes that this absence may indicate the cycle top is still ahead: The bull market is still largely driven by institutions and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When retail finally enters the scene, that might mark the beginning of the final phase. BTC Witnessing Subdued Selling Pressure In addition to the low retail presence, other on-chain indicators suggest that Bitcoin’s current rally is not overheating. For example, the Miner Position Index has been declining since November 2024, implying reduced selling pressure from miners. Another key metric, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, is holding steady around 2.2 – below the 2.7 levels observed during ATHs in March and December 2024. Recent analysis predicts the next significant resistance may emerge at around $130,900. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up?

This latest milestone comes after BTC’s former high at $111,000 levels in May, representing a 10% gain over the past week and roughly 5.9% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $117,584. The sharp price increase appears to be giving strength to activity among both miners and leveraged traders, prompting a closer examination of current market behavior. Analysts monitoring on-chain activity have flagged a resurgence of miner activity alongside a rise in derivative positions, suggesting multiple forces may now be contributing to price movements. Related Reading: Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold As these two segments of the market engage more actively, questions are emerging around the sustainability of this rally and whether these behaviors signal confidence or caution. The current on-chain environment shows both selling pressure from miners and increased exposure from long-positioned traders. Bitcoin Miner Activity Rises Alongside Price Surge One of CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributors, Arab Chain, observed a marked increase in miner activity as Bitcoin crossed the $118,000 level. According to the analyst, this uptick in activity is tied to miner transfers to exchanges, marking the first such increase since May 23. This trend suggests miners could be taking advantage of recent price gains to realize profits. As Arab Chain explained, “The continued activity of miners, coupled with Bitcoin’s price rising to new highs, clearly indicates that they are selling Bitcoin.” Despite this renewed transfer volume, miner behavior has not yet reached the scale of over-the-counter (OTC) selling seen in previous months. Historically, large-scale selling by miners has introduced notable volatility into the market, particularly when sustained across a broader period. The analyst also pointed out the economic leverage miners hold in decision-making, owing to their ability to manage operational costs and balance between holding and selling mined Bitcoin. Whether this increase in exchange flows will develop into heavier selling remains to be seen. Derivatives Market Shows Renewed Leverage Exposure In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader focused on derivatives market activity, highlighting a 24% surge in open interest from approximately $33 billion on July 1 to over $41 billion by July 11. The timing of this increase coincides with Bitcoin’s breakout above $118,000, and reflects renewed leveraged interest following a reset late last month. This level of open interest suggests that traders are positioning more aggressively, potentially anticipating continued upside. The analyst also noted a shift in funding rates from negative to their highest positive reading in a month, around 0.012% per eight hours. Positive funding indicates that long-positioned traders are paying to maintain their positions, a sign of bullish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback However, Enigma Trader cautioned that such positioning can become precarious if momentum slows. “This setup often fuels upside continuation if spot demand backs it, but also increases the risk of a long squeeze should momentum stall,” the analyst wrote.

ETH Eyes $5K & TIA Gains Strength,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-seattle-sports-partnership-drives-presale-to-336m-eth-eyes-5k-tia-gains-strength/,"While Ethereum (ETH) continues to command attention with its upgrades and market confidence, its path toward a new all-time high of $5000 remains under close watch. At the same time, Celestia’s modular approach has strengthened the Celestia (TIA) price rally, showcasing its ability to stay resilient despite volatile conditions. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s remarkable presale momentum has secured over $336 million, boosted by its fresh partnership with the Seattle Seawolves. This analytical review examines their current standing in terms of performance, scalability, and practical adoption, and reveals which among them qualifies as the best crypto right now. Ethereum Price Target: Is $5000 Still Within Reach? Ethereum has stayed crucial for DeFi protocols and smart contract activities, supporting its $5000 price goal despite recent dips. Awakening of early wallets and steady whale accumulation indicate strategic moves from big holders. The platform still leads in total value locked, active development teams, and continues to roll out upgrades like proto-danksharding to maintain its dominance. Although transaction fees remain high, Layer 2 solutions are helping reduce network strain, adding to Ethereum’s strength. While regulatory uncertainty still affects certain regions, its wide adoption makes it difficult to replace. Overall, as long as usage and developer contributions remain strong, the Ethereum (ETH) price target remains valid, maintaining its position as an essential player in crypto with unmatched utility. Celestia (TIA) Price Rally Driven by Modular Design and Rollup Strength Celestia has proven how effective a modular blockchain model can be in practical terms. Its system separates consensus from execution, allowing builders to deploy rollup chains without the usual network bottlenecks. This structure is a key factor behind the recent TIA price rally, which has gained significant market attention. With a recent 26% increase, Celestia is attracting more developers and liquidity, strengthening its rollup-focused framework with solid proof in live markets. Unlike typical Layer 1 projects that overstate capabilities, Celestia delivers scalability efficiently. Its current momentum suggests the Celestia (TIA) price rally could move beyond $2.26 as adoption grows. Its fundamental strength aligns with its market performance, a trait that sets it apart from many others vying for attention this cycle. BlockDAG’s Seattle Seawolves Collaboration Fuels Web3 Expansion BlockDAG is setting itself apart not by just focusing on blockchain alone, but by entering mainstream spaces like sports to display its practical benefits. Its deal with the Seattle Seawolves, a leading Major League Rugby team, is far from a typical marketing move. The aim is to enhance fan experiences with exclusive digital collectibles, player-led content, and blockchain-powered tools that bring fans closer to the action. This partnership highlights practical Web3 usage that fans can witness firsthand. The strategic move is supported by BlockDAG’s strong technical framework built for secure, high-volume interactions. By working alongside the Seawolves, BlockDAG is testing its technology under real-world conditions, offering fans meaningful digital engagements that enhance their loyalty. Adding to this powerful push is its presale performance. BlockDAG has already raised over $336 million in presale funding, selling 23.8 billion coins and delivering a notable 2,660% growth in early buyers’ funds since batch 1. Currently, its batch 29 price stands at $0.0016, available until August 11th. With BDAG projected to launch at $0.05, this price point suggests a potential 3,025% upside. Combined with its practical market approach, BlockDAG stands strong among the best crypto right now, backed by real adoption, solid returns, and wide utility. Final Take! Ethereum’s enduring upgrades and revived wallet movements add credibility to the Ethereum (ETH) price target, keeping it among the top crypto networks by utility and stability. Celestia continues to impress with its modular design and rising Celestia (TIA) price rally, making it a strong Layer 1 for scalability-focused buyers. However, BlockDAG’s unmatched presale achievement, real-world partnerships with sports teams, and wide technological rollout solidify its place as the best crypto right now for those seeking practical growth combined with meaningful Web3 integration.

With inflows now exceeding $4 billion, both assets are seeing strengthened technical setups and increased investor conviction. This fresh momentum is being seen as the beginning of a broader altcoin reaccumulation cycle—one that may extend far beyond just the market leaders. Alongside this surge in legacy assets, a new generation of narrative-driven tokens is beginning to gain attention. Among them is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically themed altcoin quietly building a base of support among those seeking early exposure to conviction-led projects. Bitcoin and XRP Lead the Charge with Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains the dominant player in institutional crypto portfolios. The approval and rollout of multiple ETFs have made Bitcoin more accessible than ever to traditional investors, including pension funds, hedge funds, and asset managers. These inflows are not only driving price resilience but also redefining Bitcoin’s role as a long-term macro asset. XRP has also staged a return to institutional portfolios. With its regulatory uncertainty resolved and Grayscale’s XRP ETF moving forward, the token has re-entered the spotlight. Analysts point to its utility in cross-border transactions, low-fee transfer mechanics, and increasing global adoption as reasons why capital inflows are likely to continue rising. Together, the two assets are serving as anchors for a broader resurgence in crypto market activity—particularly as ETF access reduces barriers for traditional capital. Altcoin Rotation Begins as Traders Search for Narrative-Driven Plays With Bitcoin and XRP stabilizing, seasoned investors are beginning to look down the market cap list. Historically, when large-cap tokens lead ETF-driven rallies, mid-cap and narrative-rich altcoins follow shortly after. Market sentiment is now focused on tokens that reflect strong thematic relevance: political identity, decentralized governance, or real-world application. This environment has created space for newer projects to emerge—particularly those with strong positioning and early traction. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Catching Market Attention As Ethereum solidifies its lead with continued Layer 2 expansion and institutional flows, and XRP reclaims market share following its regulatory resolution, many altcoin traders are looking ahead — toward assets that combine narrative strength with growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into that spotlight with: A strong political narrative that breaks away from generic crypto themes A defined early advantage phase with high-conviction support Increasing mentions across analyst reports and trading forums Clear signs of preparing for broader exchange visibility As momentum shifts toward high-conviction projects that blend ideology with technology, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out its lane at the perfect time. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rising Political Altcoin with Cultural Relevance Among the early-stage projects attracting analyst attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE . Positioned as a decentralized political memecoin , it stands at the intersection of meme culture and ideological narrative—offering a rare mix of cultural resonance and structural integrity. The project is anchored by a zero-tax trading model, a fixed-supply framework, and a community-driven governance roadmap. Designed to appeal to users aligned with anti-centralization values, MAGACOIN FINANCE is earning mentions in altcoin watchlists for its potential to capture attention in a cycle where identity and conviction are key drivers. Its political theme gives it an edge in a saturated market of trend-based tokens, while its early development progress has shown signs of long-term vision rather than short-lived momentum. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Be Q3’s Breakout Altcoin With over $4 billion in ETF-related inflows into Bitcoin and XRP, the foundations of a new bull phase may already be forming. For traders and investors seeking something with staying power, ideological relevance, and early access advantages, MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most compelling tokens to watch this quarter.

It’s a technology born from frustration with centralized control systems, and it has thrived because of one key principle – neutrality. Neutrality from politics, from institutions, from borders. Now that BTCFi is picking up the pace, it’s highly important to remember this principle – and defend it. Allowing BTCFi to be steered by the same political and institutional forces that have long shaped traditional finance (TradFi) would mean repeating many of the same historical mistakes that led the world to adopt the concept of crypto in the first place. It would also pose a significant risk to Bitcoin’s core purpose and future viability. The case for political neutrality At its core, Bitcoin was created to be outside of government control, immune to the kind of monetary manipulation that has plagued fiat currencies. Which means that neutrality isn’t a ‘nice-to-have’ in this situation – it’s the foundation upon which everything else is built. Bitcoin works because it doesn’t care where you live – it’s an open, trustless, permissionless system that anyone can take part in so long as they simply have an internet connection. BTCFi must inherit this same core principle. If we start building it around the priorities of state-affiliated actors, there’s a very real risk of Bitcoin changing from a tool of decentralized empowerment into what would basically be just ‘TradFi 2.0.’ Wrapped up in new tech, perhaps, but still governed by the same old rules. Decentralized systems only work if they are decentralized in every way – infrastructure and values alike. What happens if BTCFi gets politicized The answer to this question is simple. Bitcoin could lose the one trait that makes it uniquely valuable and attractive – its neutrality. When institutions or governments influence how BTCFi evolves, the protocols being built will inevitably begin to cater to them. It won’t be long before we see gatekeeping and censorship. The introduction of permissioned systems wrapped in the illusion of decentralization. If we go down that road, Bitcoin’s utility as a neutral global store of value will plummet. And if so, the next wave of financial innovation will likely leave it behind in favor of other assets that are still politically neutral. Is the original cryptocurrency becoming the one that lost its way? I don’t think many people in the industry would want to see it happen. The good news is that the Bitcoin community has the tools to protect BTCFi from such a fate, but there needs to be an intentional approach to this. Let me explain what I mean by that. The path forward – B uilding with purpose Firstly, when DeFi developers work on their infrastructure, they need to make it politically neutral by default. That means no special privileges or reliance on centralized intermediaries. Native Bitcoin layer-twos must be trustless and resilient, and any DeFi product built on top of them should be censorship-resistant and globally accessible. Second, there needs to be more support from crypto investors – especially large holders – for projects that align with Bitcoin’s core values. If capital flows into politically aligned or institutionally influenced products, we’re feeding the wrong machine. Finally, speed matters. If BTCFi products can achieve rapid adoption, it will be that much harder for the whole ecosystem to be hijacked. In other words, momentum is its own form of protection – by outpacing regulators and institutions with centralized interests, they will have a hard time catching up to try and influence BTCFi’s development. But in order to achieve all of the above, developers must focus on making their products usable and safe. Without these two pillars, mass adoption will be a long way off. Investors and the broader community must be actively engaged to promote projects that preserve the ideals of openness and decentralization while also delivering tangible value to people. Why BTCFi is taking off – and why it needs safeguards The momentum behind BTCFi is undeniable. In late 2024, its total value jumped from $800 million to $6.5 billion in just a few months. Some analysts predict that by 2030, over $47 billion worth of Bitcoin could be actively used in DeFi. There are clear reasons for this surge. The growth of Bitcoin ETFs has made BTC the most ‘mainstream’ crypto asset, adding a sense of legitimacy and attracting whales who want to do more with their holdings without selling them. But with that same surge comes attention – regulators and institutions alike are watching and getting involved a lot more actively now. That’s why now is the time to set the tone for how BTCFi evolves. It has the potential to transform how Bitcoin is used, but that transformation will only be meaningful if we stay true to Bitcoin’s foundational values. Bitcoin’s greatest strength is that it doesn’t discriminate or take sides – a nd BTCFi should be no different. Michael Egorov is the founder of leading DeFi exchange Curve Finance .

From high-speed networks to meme-driven demand and AI innovation, different themes are shaping what many consider the best cryptos to buy now. Solana, PEPE, and Render each offer distinct advantages, whether it’s low-cost smart contracts, strong community hype, or decentralized computing power. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is generating major buzz of its own. Its daily Buyer Battles, fixed $0.0016 entry price, and a $336 million presale total make it one of the top names to watch as launch day nears. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Daily Buyer Battles Offer 50M BDAG to Top Participants BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have added an exciting twist to its ongoing presale. Every 24 hours, 50 million BDAG coins are available, and any unsold coins are awarded to the buyer with the largest single purchase of the day. This encourages consistent participation and gives buyers a chance to earn extra without paying extra, turning the presale into a competition. With the entry price fixed at $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, many see this period as the best chance to buy before the price jumps to $0.05. The built-in 3,025% return, paired with the Buyer Battles system, adds a competitive edge and positions BlockDAG as one of the best cryptos to buy now. So far, over $336 million has been raised and more than 23.8 billion coins sold across 29 batches. BlockDAG’s focus on community engagement through referrals and strategic incentives shows how user-driven momentum can push a project forward. 2. PEPE: Meme Coin Keeps Drawing Attention PEPE made headlines in 2024 by jumping 1,500% in market cap, rising from a small microcap to a top 50 meme coin. Community-led token burns and exchange listings, including Coinbase, helped build momentum. Social media buzz and posts from Elon Musk pushed PEPE even further into the spotlight. Currently priced near $0.00001032 with a $4 billion market cap, PEPE still draws buyers looking for the next viral move. While it’s more volatile than other coins, its unpredictable nature is part of the appeal. For some, PEPE remains one of the best cryptos to buy now, especially if meme coin enthusiasm returns. 3. Solana (SOL): DeFi Ecosystem Expands Despite Price Dip Solana (SOL) continues to gain attention as a powerful alternative to Ethereum. With ultra-fast transactions and low fees, Solana supports a growing range of smart contracts and decentralized applications. After rebounding from the FTX-linked crash, it moved from around $100 early in 2024 to over $200 later that year. By early 2025, SOL reached $293 but has since pulled back to $151. For many, this lower range is an opportunity to enter before any potential recovery. With a strong developer community and new DeFi projects launching on the network, Solana still holds a spot among the best cryptos to buy now as the market heads into the final quarter. 4. Render (RNDR): Fueling AI Growth with GPU Sharing Render (RNDR) operates in the fast-growing AI sector by providing decentralized access to GPU computing power. It’s used for heavy-demand tasks like 3D rendering and machine learning, offering a useful alternative to centralized cloud providers. RNDR rose from about $4.40 to $7.50 last year, even hitting $13.53 during peak hype. Currently trading around $3.40 with a $1.7 billion market cap, Render appears to be at a more accessible entry point. If AI adoption keeps accelerating, Render’s services may see greater demand, lifting RNDR back onto the list of best cryptos to buy now for those watching the next AI wave. Evaluating the Best Crypto to Buy Now The crypto market keeps evolving, with Solana, PEPE, and Render each offering different reasons to consider them among the best cryptos to buy now. Whether it’s DeFi potential, meme momentum, or AI infrastructure, they represent the variety of themes driving today’s trading choices. However, BlockDAG is capturing more attention this month. With its locked $0.0016 price, $336 million raised, and a daily reward system through Buyer Battles, the project is quickly becoming a standout choice. For those seeking strong upside potential and daily engagement, BlockDAG may be one of the best cryptos to buy now before the next wave of adoption begins.

Related Reading: Drop NFTs Like It’s Hot: Snoop Dogg’s Telegram Collection Raises $12M In 30 Minutes Crypto Hacker Takes $42 Million From GMX On Friday, the recent GMX V1 exploit ended on a happy note after the individual responsible for the incident turned into a white-hat hacker. Perpetual and spot crypto exchange GMX lost over $40 million on Wednesday when an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the protocol’s first version on Arbitrum. According to online reports, GMX V1’s vault contract had a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to manipulate the GLP token price through the system’s calculations. Blockchain security firm SlowMist explained that “The root cause of this attack stems from GMX v1’s design flaw, where short position operations immediately update the global short average prices (globalShortAveragePrices), which directly impacts the calculation of Assets Under Management (AUM), thereby allowing manipulation of GLP token pricing.” Through a reentrancy attack, they successfully established massive short positions to manipulate the global average prices, artificially inflating GLP prices within a single transaction and profiting through redemption operations. As a result, approximately $42 million worth of assets, including Legacy Frax Dollar (FRAX), wrapped bitcoin (WBTC), wrapped ETH (WETH), and other tokens, were transferred from the GLP pool to an unknown wallet. The perpetual crypto exchange halted GMX V1’s trading and GLP’s minting and redeeming on both Arbitrum and Avalanche to prevent another attack and protect users’ funds. However, they clarified that the exploit was limited to GMX’s V1 and its GLP pool. GMX V2, its markets, or liquidity pools, and the GMX token were not affected and remained safe. White-Hat Claims $5 Million Bounty Following the incident, GMX sent a message on-chain and on X offering a $5 million white-hat bounty to the attacker, claiming that their abilities were “evident to anyone looking into the exploit transactions.” GMX’s team noted that returning the funds within the next 48 hours and accepting the bounty would allow the hacker to “spend the funds freely,” instead of taking additional risks to access them. They also vowed not to pursue any legal action and to assist the exploiter in providing proof of source for the funds if it is ever required. Today, the exploiter responded in an on-chain message, accepting the bounty and starting the return process. As Lookonchain reported, they initially returned $10.49 million worth of FRAX on Friday morning. Meanwhile, another $32 million worth of assets had been swapped into 11,700 ETH, which are now valued at $35 million after the King of Altcoins’ price jumped to the $2,990 mark. In the following hours, the hacker returned 10,000 ETH, worth $30 million, keeping only 1,700 ETH, valued at $5.2 million, as the bounty. Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time GMX later confirmed that the funds have now been safely returned and thanked the white-hat hacker for their actions, ultimately giving a positive turn to the incident.

The SEC had already approved the conversion on July 1 on an “accelerated basis”. However, a day later, the regulator issued a stay order to review the approval due to a pending internal review. “Grayscale, the Exchange and the Fund’s current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay in public launch of the Fund,” the company said. Grayscale also claimed that the fund’s approval should stand by default as the SEC missed its legal deadline to act on the proposal, and that under federal law, the conversion of the fund should be considered automatically approved. The asset manager’s lawyers are now contemplating filing a petition to force the regulator to allow its fund to begin trading as soon as possible. “Grayscale and the Exchange are therefore considering whether to file a petition requesting the Commission to lift the stay imposed by Rule 431(e) while the Commission reviews the action taken by delegated authority, so that the Fund may promptly launch while that review proceeds,” they postulated. The move to convert GDLC into a spot fund is in line with Grayscale’s wider strategy to introduce more crypto products to mainstream financial markets, following the successful introduction of its spot BTC ETF in early 2024. Meanwhile, asset managers have flooded the SEC’s desk with applications for ETF proposals tracking the prices of several cryptocurrencies, including meme coins like Dogecoin and Official Trump and other altcoins, amid a more lenient regulatory backdrop in the United States since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.",Cryptocurrency|News|Grayscale|SOL|Solana|SOLUSD|XRP News|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,REGULATION|SOL|BUSINESS|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-12 04:42:08

Thus far, there have been many opposing outlooks from different market participants. While some are convinced that altcoins will underperform for the rest of the year, others remain optimistic that the highly anticipated altcoin season will come into play before the close of the year. One such analyst who maintains a bullish outlook for altcoin is João Wedson. The verified analyst published on Cryptoquant and CoinMarketCap is sharing yet another bullish take with his 7,000+ follower base. In a post shared on X, the analyst makes a bold assertion, stating that a “mini altcoin season” is in play. Notably, altcoin season is a period when alternative coins outperform Bitcoin for a few weeks to several months. Per Wedson’s observation, as illustrated by an altcoin season index vs Bitcoin chart he shared, 90% of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 72 hours. “After months of saying that June and July would heat up the altcoin market — this is just the beginning! Few will believe we’re in an Altcoin Season because the media and baseless analyses fill your head with hopelessness.” The analyst wrote . It, however, bears mentioning that the Altcoins in question include Altcoins outside the top 100 category. Notably, altcoin season usually kicks off when 75% of the top 100 Altcoins outperform Bitcoin within 90 days. According to data from CoinMarketCap , only 26 out of 100 leading altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The highest value of 30 was last recorded in June, while April 26 marked a yearly low, with only 12 altcoins outpacing Bitcoin. Wedson, who appears to be sticking to his guns, maintains that multiple “mini altcoin seasons” can be observed within a week. He remarks that whale activity is usually heightened at this time, and concludes with an even more bullish forecast for altcoins. “I’ve shared many times that within just one week, several mini Altcoin Seasons can happen — and that’s exactly when whales make fast, massive profits. But make no mistake: a larger Altcoin Season is already underway.” He added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Ethereum News|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ADA,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-07-12 04:46:21

Crypto Trade Groups Urge Congress To Pass Crypto Legislation According to the Friday letter from Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, The Digital Chamber CEO Cody Carbone and President and Acting CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation Ji Hun Kim, the three digital asset policy collectives called on U.S. lawmakers to advance the “important” crypto legislation. 1/ United for CLARITY: The 3 leading U.S. digital asset trade groups — @BlockchainAssn , @crypto_council , and @DigitalChamber — are calling on Congress to pass the bipartisan CLARITY Act. It’s time for regulatory certainty. pic.twitter.com/AL7AdtvlQG — Blockchain Association (@BlockchainAssn) July 11, 2025 “The CLARITY Act represents meaningful progress toward the regulatory certainty needed for our industry to foster innovation and for blockchain technology to thrive in the U.S.,” the CEOs said. “Advancing this bipartisan market structure legislation sends a strong message that the U.S. is committed as the global leader in digital assets,” they added. If enacted, the CLARITY would largely see crypto regulatory responsibility delegated from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC). The move would mark a win for crypto proponents after years of the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement approach and treatment of digital assets as securities. “As the conversation continues, we encourage the Senate to build on the momentum from the House and engage closely with industry stakeholders to bring bipartisan market structure legislation to the Senate floor as soon as possible,” the letter states. “We look forward to continuing to work with both chambers to help ensure U.S. leadership in digital assets.” Congress Braces For Dueling Crypto Weeks The blockchain trade groups’ letter comes ahead of the Republican Party’s purported “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill. However, Democratic lawmakers Maxine Waters and Stephen Lynch unveiled on Friday that they would be launching their own “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” in opposition to Republicans’ crypto legislative efforts. “My Republican colleagues are eager to continue doing the bidding for the crypto industry while conveniently ignoring the vulnerabilities and opportunities for abuse that exist in crypto,” Congressman Lynch said.

Wedson noted that the market may have reached a critical “Alpha Price” zone at current levels, and therefore a short-term correction is possible. However, he argued that this decline could create a new buying opportunity within the next few days. On the other hand, he said that if Bitcoin breaks above the $119,300 level, a strong uptrend could begin in the market. Related News: BREAKING: Highly Surprising Move from Coinbase - Official X Account Changes Profile Photo to Surprise Altcoin - Price Jumps Speaking specifically about Cardano, Wedson argued that ADA is currently in a distribution phase, which could present a good entry opportunity in the short term. However, he emphasized that the real breakout could occur in the final quarter of the year, saying, “It's possible that ADA will be trading well above $3 by the end of October or the beginning of November.” While acknowledging that this surge could disrupt some technical analysis patterns, Wedson stated that on-chain data is quite promising. “Our average buy price for ADA is $0.2883.

This stage is characterized by rapid, emotionally driven price gains fueled by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). With Bitcoin recently surging to $118,000 and reaching an all-time high, Kiyosaki cautions that peak euphoria often brings heightened volatility. Kiyosaki agrees with Pal that Bitcoin’s limited supply can trigger sharp price surges when demand spikes, often driven by institutions, media buzz, and retail FOMO, but also brings high volatility. Another RICH DAD LESSON: “PIGs get fat. HOGs get slaughtered.” I state this lesson because I bought my latest BITCOIN at $110k. I am now in position for what Raoul Pal calls “the Banana Zone.” In the Banana Zone the HOGS will rush in….driven to insanity by the dreaded… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 11, 2025 Bitcoin Enters the FOMO-Driven Banana Zone Before getting into the dynamics, let’s understand what is the Banana zone. This phase, often seen in Bitcoin bull markets, tends to be marked by explosive growth fueled by media hype, institutional interest , and retail FOMO. However, while the euphoria is building, Kiyosaki is urging caution. He warns that many new investors may be jumping in blindly, chasing rapid gains without understanding the volatility that comes with such parabolic runs. The emotional buying hype could easily flip into panic selling, especially if the price corrects sharply. Instead of getting swept up in the hype, Kiyosaki advises staying grounded and advises to focus on education, doing your research, and investing with discipline. In short, while the “Banana Zone” might look like a golden opportunity, it’s also a dangerous trap for the unprepared. “I Am a Fat PIG with Bitcoin,” Says Kiyosaki Kiyosaki bought Bitcoin early, around $6,000, and has made big profits by staying patient and not chasing hype. He credits his success to smart investing, not luck, and continues to support Bitcoin because of its limited supply and independence from governments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH , He still believes a major price surge, the “Banana Zone”, is on the way. He further revealed his latest Bitcoin purchase at $110,000, positioning himself well for the “Banana Zone.” He describes himself as a disciplined “fat pig,” patiently accumulating during market peaks, in contrast to “hogs” who jump in late and get burned. He expects temporary corrections but remains bullish, with a long-term target of $250,000 by 2025 and even $1 million by 2030 . Bitcoin Rises as Faith in Fiat Fades Many investors are starting to lose trust in traditional currencies (such as dollars or euros), primarily because governments are accumulating excessive debt, and people are concerned about inflation. In this environment, Bitcoin is starting to look more attractive, like digital gold, because there’s a limited supply of it, which makes it a good way to protect your wealth. But Kiyosaki and other experts believe this shift in thinking is helping Bitcoin gain momentum . Big institutions are also showing more interest, which adds fuel to the fire. Some analysts suggest that if the U.S. Federal Reserve alters its current policies, particularly by lowering interest rates, Bitcoin could surge again, potentially reaching five- or even six-figure prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

33767162,[object Object],1752298246,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Ethereum Adoption Grows: GameSquare Invests $5 Million In ETH As Part Of Treasury Strategy,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-adoption-grows-gamesquare-invests-5-million-in-eth-as-part-of-treasury-strategy/,"In an announcement yesterday, Nasdaq-listed software company GameSquare Holdings revealed that it had purchased $5 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) as part of its $100 million ETH-focused treasury strategy. With this move, GameSquare joins a growing number of companies diversifying their corporate treasuries by investing in digital assets. GameSquare Embraces Ethereum As Part Of Treasury Strategy As the cryptocurrency market regains bullish momentum – highlighted by Bitcoin (BTC) reaching successive all-time highs (ATHs) over the past few days – mainstream interest in digital assets is once again surging. In this context, Ethereum continues to see rising adoption. The Texas-based firm recently completed its initial ETH purchase, acquiring 1,818.84 ETH at a weighted average price of $2,749, totalling $5 million. This marks the first step in GameSquare’s broader plan to deploy $100 million into Ethereum and related digital assets. The company’s strategy focuses on building a crypto-native treasury framework designed to generate sustainable, risk-adjusted yield through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Commenting on the development, Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare said: In partnership with Dialectic and Ryan Zurrer, we are leveraging Medici, Dialectic’s proprietary platform that combines machine learning, automated optimization, and multi-layered risk controls, to target best-in-class risk-adjusted yields of 8-14%, well above current staking benchmarks of 3-4%. Unlike traditional treasury strategies focused around Bitcoin, GameSquare’s ETH allocation seeks to actively generate yield by engaging with DeFi infrastructure, rather than simply holding the asset. This signals a novel growing trend of companies favoring ETH over BTC for treasury diversification. While pursuing higher returns typically involves increased risk, Medici’s reputation for advanced risk management and performance tracking offers a layer of confidence. As more companies embrace ETH-based yield strategies, DeFi protocols are likely to attract deeper liquidity over time. Smart Money Accumulating ETH Despite currently trading about 40% below its ATH of $4,878 – set back in November 2021 – Ethereum is seeing increased accumulation by large investors, often referred to as “smart money.” For instance, recent on-chain data shows that ETH whales – wallets holding between 10,000 to 100,000 ETH – added heavily to their holdings earlier this month, scooping as much as 200,000 ETH. Simultaneously, Ethereum-based spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining traction. Data from SoSoValue indicates nine consecutive weeks of positive inflows as of July 10, reinforcing broader investor interest in ETH. That said, some caution remains warranted, as not all ETH-focused treasury strategies have yielded favorable results historically. At press time, ETH trades at $2,993, up an impressive 7.4% in the past 24 hours.",Ethereum|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency|ETH|Ether|Ethereum Adoption|ethereum etf|ethereum treasury strategy|ETHUSDT|GameSquare,EN,0,0,AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-12 05:30:46

As a result of this, most banks do not take clients dealing with crypto assets.

However, if digital assets are used in financial intermediation, then the company and individual engaging in the activity would require a crypto license.

Legalised crypto platforms- Despite not legalizing crypto assets or regulating specific laws, people are engaging with crypto in the Dominican Republic. Platforms offering services are required to follow AML and KYC compliance to ensure the safety of customers’ funds. Arkham and Arkham Futures are some of the best crypto platforms in the Republic to ensure the protection of the user. These platforms do not engage in illegal activities and have strict compliance with KYC and AML. What is the government of the Dominican Republic saying about crypto? The government of the Dominican Republic, more specifically the Central Bank, has taken several cautious steps regarding cryptocurrency in the country. It has reiterated that crypto is not legal tender and is not backed by the government. It has not officially banned crypto but has warned the local institutions, banks, and citizens from using crypto due to its potential risks. The government has also emphasised that the national currency of the Dominican Republic remains the sole legal tender for payments in the country. Crypto License in Dominican Republic 2025 The Dominican Republic does not have any specific cryptocurrency license. Despite the lack of licensing in the country, there is no explicit prohibition on engaging in crypto activities. The existing financial regulations apply to crypto in the country, as the government is yet to address crypto and provide clarity on it specifically. Crypto Tax in the Dominican Republic The Dominican Republic follows a territorial tax regime to balance revenue and promote innovation. Under this regime, any income earned within the country is subject to tax. This same principle applies to crypto as well.

48086318,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=403743,1752299550,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/48086318.jpeg,Report: BTC Treasuries Face $12.8B Maturity Wall by 2028,https://cryptopotato.com/report-btc-treasuries-face-12-8b-maturity-wall-by-2028/,"A looming $12.8 billion debt maturity wall could threaten the sustainability of major Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) like Marathon Digital and Nakamoto by 2028. This is according to a new Keyrock report showing that while such firms collectively hold more than 725,000 BTC, their reliance on capital markets and negative cash flows for acquisitions has made them vulnerable to weakening Bitcoin prices and souring investor sentiment. The Debt-Fueled Accumulation Boom BTC-TCs, public companies using debt and equity to amass Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, have exploded since Strategy pioneered the model in 2020. The Michael Saylor-led business intelligence provider now dominates the sector, holding no fewer than 597,000 BTC, or 82% of the cohort total, valued at about $67 billion at current rates. So far, the steadily growing industry has raised more than $3.35 billion in preferred equity and approximately $9.48 billion in debt, alongside substantial common stock sales to fuel their BTC buying spree. According to Keyrock, this capital structure has created a significant refinancing risk: $12.8 billion in debt maturities, heavily clustered in 2027 and 2028. While convertible notes, such as Strategy’s $7.3 billion in 0% issuance, have become popular and offer potential equity conversion relief, they hinge on sustained high stock prices. This means that if prices fall below conversion thresholds, it could force the BTC-TCs to sell portions of their holdings or resort to distress refinancing, which could trigger downward spirals. Newer entrants like Twenty One Capital and Tokyo-listed Metaplanet are trying to prevent such scenarios by employing varied strategies, including leveraging Japan’s zero rates and getting into SPAC mergers. That being said, Keyrock’s analysis shows that the core reliance on favorable market access remains pervasive across the sector. Sustainability Hinges on Fragile Premiums and Cash Flow Per the report, Bitcoin-focused businesses face two major risks: the cost of paying off their debts and how long they can keep operating without running out of money. Despite this, investors are willing to pay 73% more than the actual value of the BTC these companies hold. They justify this using Strategy as a case study. The firm has boosted its Bitcoin-per-share by about 63.6% each year, thanks to smart fundraising during bull markets that helped it buy more Bitcoin without hurting shareholders. However, according to Keyrock, there’s a big difference in how much cash these firms make. For instance, it says companies like Strategy and Marathon Digital are losing a lot of money from their day-to-day operations, about $78.3 million and $43.5 million each quarter. To stay afloat, they rely entirely on selling new shares at high prices. Nakamoto is in a similar position. Meanwhile, outfits like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and CoinShares are doing better. They either make a profit each quarter or have enough cash saved up, which helps them handle costs without needing to sell shares or dip into their BTC stash. Now, suppose BTC prices drop, or the hoarding strategy fails, and the market stops valuing these companies far above the actual worth of their holdings. In that case, Keyrock analysts claim that Marathon and Nakamoto could run into trouble, forcing them to sell Bitcoin or issue lots of new shares every quarter, which could reduce the value for existing investors. Strategy is also exposed to this risk, but it’s in a stronger position because it’s bigger and investors trust it more.

As DeFi continues to grow and more users seek efficient and cost-effective trading options, Jupiter's role becomes increasingly significant. While the crypto market is ever-changing, Jupiter's focus on maximizing value for users positions it as an attractive option in the current market cycle, especially for those engaged in the Solana ecosystem. Solana's SOL: The High-Speed Challenger in the Crypto World Solana is a blockchain platform built for speed and scalability. It offers a foundation for decentralized apps, much like Ethereum and Cardano. What sets Solana apart is its design choices that aim for faster transactions and flexible development options in multiple programming languages.

This coin holds value as it underpins Solana's operations, giving users access to various projects on the platform. Solana's potential lies in its ability to handle high-capacity workloads without the need for complex solutions. This makes it attractive to developers and investors looking for a platform that can host busy services. In the current market, SOL looks promising compared to other coins. While Ethereum faces issues with speed and costs, Solana offers a faster and more efficient alternative. With the growing demand for scalable blockchain options, SOL's technology positions it well in market trends. It may be the shining star investors are seeking in the evolving crypto landscape. Hyperliquid: The High-Speed Blockchain Transforming DeFi Hyperliquid is making a bold entry into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).

In late April to May 2023, PEPE's value soared, reaching a market cap of $1.6 billion at its peak. Early investors saw huge gains, and a strong community formed around the coin. This surge kicked off a ""memecoin season,"" with many new meme-based cryptocurrencies popping up. PEPE's roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a ""meme takeover,"" hinting at big plans ahead. In the current market, PEPE stands out as an intriguing player. It taps into the power of memes and community spirit. While the future is uncertain, many are keeping a close eye on PEPE, wondering if it will reach new heights in the next big crypto cycle.

From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a light-hearted take on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to the serious world of crypto. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum cap and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a joke or ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin took the world by surprise in 2021. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, its value skyrocketed, propelling it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, offering faster transaction times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Its community-driven approach has fostered a loyal following, contributing to charitable causes and sponsorships. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its simplicity and the backing of a vibrant community. While other cryptocurrencies focus on complex technologies and use cases, Dogecoin remains accessible to newcomers. Market trends show a growing interest in decentralized finance and meme coins, suggesting that Dogecoin could continue to gain traction. However, its unlimited supply may affect long-term value. Investors looking for potential gains might find Dogecoin attractive, but should consider the volatility and do their research.

Even with the recent market recovery, the price is still sitting over 45% below its all-time high price, highlighting the struggles that the altcoin has faced in recent times. Amid this, a crypto analyst has suggested that the Solana price could crash even further from here, predicting a 40% crash could be in the cards once more. Why Solana Could See A Price Crash Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader has highlighted the development of a rare bullish harmonic pattern on the Solana price chart. Now, while this pattern formation is inherently bullish for any digital asset, the shorter term does come with some hurdles for the altcoin to surmount first. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time The main thing to focus on here is that this bullish pattern does initially trigger a liquidity sweep of previous lows. In this case, the recent Solana price low lies at the $95 level, which is a 40% decrease from its current price, trending above $150. The possibility of this low sweep is made even more prominent by a couple of technical developments on the chart. The first technical point the analyst shows is the Point of Control (POC) Battle. According to the analysis, the Solana price is now testing this POC level with low momentum, shown by the slow climb over the last few days. Additionally, there is also mounting resistance at the Value Area High and the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which lies just above $163. Then, there is the completion of the C-leg of the wave, putting it as low as $95. A crash to this level becomes more likely if the Solana price fails to break through the resistance with conviction. If the price is rejected and the C-leg does play out, then this correction is expected to trigger the 40% crash to the $95 level. It’s Not All Bearish News As already mentioned above, the bearish leg of the rare bullish harmonic pattern is only temporary and often gives way to an even stronger impulse move. As the crypto analyst explains, the crash to $95 will only happen in the immediate short term, but it does not actually invalidate the overall bullish trend. Related Reading: Market Expert Says It’s Now ‘Illegal’ To Short Bitcoin, Here’s Why Once the D-leg is over and the crash is completed, the crypto analyst predicts that the Solana price will start to rally again. From the predicted $05 lows, an over 100% move is expected to take it back to $200 and beyond before the rally is over. The analyst explains that “Until this scenario is confirmed or invalidated, Solana remains range-bound between major high time frame levels.” Therefore, “Traders should stay alert for signs of rejection at current resistance — or, conversely, a volume-backed breakout above the value area high that would negate the harmonic setup.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Solana|Sol|SOL news|SOL Price|Solana news|Solana Price|SOLUSD|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-07-12 06:00:49

Identifying these promising tokens can significantly impact investment outcomes. This article spotlights top cryptocurrencies that could see substantial value growth. Read on to uncover which tokens may offer remarkable opportunities for multiplying investments in the near future. The path to potential high gains begins here. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Toncoin: The New Contender Shaping the Future of Blockchain Toncoin is making waves as the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON), a decentralized blockchain born from the vision of Telegram's original project. Although Telegram stepped back due to legal challenges in 2020, the TON Foundation and a community of enthusiasts picked up the torch. Toncoin uses a proof-of-stake system, which means it's designed for speed and reliability. It doesn't just stop at fast payments with low fees; TON aims to build a whole ecosystem. This includes decentralized storage, services, domain names, private networking, and efficient ways to process payments. Looking ahead, Toncoin shows promising potential. Predictions based on past price movements and Bitcoin's halving cycles suggest that Toncoin could see significant gains in the coming years. By 2025, prices might reach up to $30.30, a notable increase from today's value. In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrencies, Toncoin's focus on creating a versatile and scalable network sets it apart. As the market looks for more efficient and secure blockchain solutions, Toncoin stands out as an attractive option. Its commitment to building a comprehensive platform could make it a key player in the next phase of digital finance. Shiba Inu Coin: The Dogecoin Rival Making Waves on Ethereum Shiba Inu (SHIB) began as a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin, but it's forging its own path. Launched in August 2020 by an anonymous creator named Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This lets it tap into Ethereum's vast network of apps and tools. With an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, SHIB grabbed attention when half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and ""burned"" 40% of the total supply. These moves boosted SHIB's profile and showed commitment to the community. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB is building real-world uses. It's developing ShibaSwap, a trading platform without middlemen. Plans include an NFT platform and a system where holders can vote on decisions. In the current market, SHIB's link to Ethereum could give it an edge. While meme coins often fade, SHIB's focus on useful features might help it stand out.

HBAR fuels the network by paying for transactions and securing the system through a Proof of Stake mechanism. Hedera Hashgraph holds promise as a faster and more secure platform for transactions and smart contracts, especially in sectors like finance.

NEAR Protocol: A Faster Way to Build Decentralized Apps NEAR Protocol is a platform that makes it easy for developers to create decentralized applications. It uses a method called sharding to improve efficiency and handle more users at the same time. Think of it as a big, shared computer that isn't controlled by anyone but is available to everyone. The founders, Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, have raised over $20 million from major venture firms to bring this project to life. NEAR's technology has big potential in the crypto world. Its Nightshade sharding helps the network grow without slowing down. The Rainbow Bridge lets people move tokens from Ethereum to NEAR, making it flexible. Aurora uses Ethereum’s technology to make things faster and cheaper. In today's market, where scalability and fees are big issues, NEAR looks promising. Coins like Ethereum have struggled with high fees, but NEAR's solutions could make it more attractive to users and developers. This might help NEAR stand out in the next market cycle.

While trading or owning stablecoins has been legalized in Bolivia, their use for business payments is not permitted, and they are not considered legal tender. Stablecoins transactions in Bolivia are only allowed via an authorized bank. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Bolivia 2025 What is the Bolivian government saying about crypto? Crypto License in Bolivia 2025 Crypto tax in Bolivia 2025 Crypto adoption rate in Bolivia 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Bolivia 2025 May 23, 2025 , YPFB Bans Executive Order 5399 bans the state-owned oil company from purchasing crypto to make payments.

May 7, 2025, Supreme Decree No. 5384 The Bolivian government confirms recognition of disruptive technologies– blockchains, tokenized assets, virtual assets, and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). Recognizes financial technological companies of the country, establishing a legal framework that enables startups and developing fintechs. April 16, 2025- Resolution no. 019/2025 Laid the groundwork for the initial recognition of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASP). Marking a milestone by lifting the old restrictions and recognizing fintech developing frameworks.

Public awareness : After lifting the crypto ban in the country, the Bolivian government launched public awareness campaigns to teach people about crypto basics, risks, and how digital assets work. Consumer protection : The Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) officials are drafting crypto regulations focusing on transparency, safety, and innovation. It aims to prevent crypto scams while balancing rules and technology. USD-pegged stablecoins : In March 2025, the BCB utilized USD-pegged stablecoins for cross-border payments, remittances, and trading. It also traded crypto exchanges as a store of value in countries with volatile local currency. Crypto License in Bolivia 2025 Is there any crypto license in Bolivia? No, Bolivia does not have a specific crypto license. The government is currently prioritizing financial stability and capital preservation for digital assets. Hence, no license is required to conduct legal crypto activities in Bolivia. Crypto tax in Bolivia 2025 No capital gains tax : There is no specific tax legislation regarding crypto in Bolivia. While the standard taxes, like VAT/GST, are applied to goods or services purchased, crypto profits would likely be taxed under PIT (personal income tax).

While the Bolivian government is addressing the risks associated with crypto, it is also crucial for them to recognize the potential benefits to harness the full potential of cryptocurrency in the country’s economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

AIOZ Network (AIOZ) – The AI x Decentralized CDN Play Price: ~$0.55Narrative: AI infrastructure + decentralized streaming AIOZ aims to disrupt the $100B+ content delivery and AI compute market by building a decentralized network of edge nodes.

Internet Computer (ICP) – A Comeback Story in the Making Price: ~$8Narrative: Fully on-chain web apps + decentralized cloud Though not under $1, ICP remains a small-cap comeback candidate. Often misunderstood, DFINITY’s Internet Computer enables fully decentralized applications with no reliance on AWS or centralized APIs.

Kaspa (KAS) – The Fastest Proof-of-Work Blockchain Price: ~$0.08Narrative: Scalable PoW + decentralization purity Kaspa uses the GhostDAG protocol to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues while retaining security. It can process multiple blocks per second without sacrificing decentralization. For those who believe in PoW but want speed, Kaspa is a perfect fit. Why it Could 1000x: If Layer 1 wars heat up again, Kaspa could emerge as a surprise winner. Final Thoughts: Risk and Reward These small-cap altcoins all share one trait: asymmetrical upside. Some deliver real-world utility, others thrive on community momentum and narrative speculation, and in crypto, both paths can lead to exponential returns. A 1000x surge doesn’t require certainty—it just needs a spark, a story, and the right moment. Among them, XYZ stands out as a high-risk, high-reward play. With its fusion of meme coin energy and plans for real-world asset verification and sportsbook rewards, it has the kind of viral appeal that can ignite speculative frenzies.

These coins represent not just opportunities for substantial financial gains but also innovative technological contributions in the blockchain space. The Landscape of Opportunity: What Makes These Altcoins Stand Out? Often overlooked, small-cap altcoins possess unique traits that could potentially fuel their exponential growth. These include strong technical foundations, vibrant communities, and niche market positioning that caters to specific tech advancements or cultural trends. Detailed Analysis of Promising Altcoins Here's an in-depth look at select altcoins, each poised for significant impact and huge potential returns: XYZ (XYZVerse): Merging Memes with Market Utility Currently priced below $0.01, XYZ, also known as XYZVerse, stands out due to its dual appeal in meme culture and practical utility in real-world asset verification and decentralized betting. Its presence has stirred noticeable excitement, leading to its recognition as the Best New Meme Project . Check out the detailed ambitions of XYZVerse at their official site, XYZVerse.io . The enthusiastic backing by an active community and the spearheading of innovative features for online entertainment and betting suggest XYZ could lead the pack in meme-based cryptocurrencies with substantial use cases. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Adoption at Its Core With an impressive support network that includes major corporations like IBM and Boeing, Hedera Hashgraph (priced at about $0.07) leverages its advanced hashgraph consensus to offer quick, secure transactions for enterprise applications. Its robust technology and growing adoption in sectors like finance and telecommunications provide a strong case for potential growth. AIOZ Network: Empowering the AI and CDN Spheres Priced around $0.55, AIOZ Network aims to revolutionize content delivery networks through decentralized services and AI enhancements. This altcoin could significantly benefit from the escalating demand for decentralized data solutions and content streaming services. Additional Noteworthy Altcoins Other cryptocurrencies such as Jupiter (JUP), Internet Computer (ICP), and TRON (TRX) also hold promising prospects. These platforms are developing foundational technology layers—from DeFi ecosystems to fully on-chain web applications—that could redefine their respective fields. Investing in Potential: A Balanced View While the allure of high returns is strong, prospective investors should approach these opportunities with a balanced perspective, understanding the risks involved. Each altcoin's success hinges on various factors including technological adoption, market sentiment, and ongoing development.

The best platforms combine smart token economics, privacy-first access, and fluid gameplay across casino and sportsbook ecosystems. This report highlights three standout GambleFi projects redefining the crypto betting landscape: Dexsport — The ultimate decentralized casino and sportsbook Rollblock — AI-powered gambling with predictive analytics WINR Protocol — Fully on-chain gaming with scalable DeFi incentives Dexsport — Decentralized Betting Built for Web3 KYC: Not requiredBonus Model: Up to 25% in freebets, weekly cashback, VIP tiers, thematic promotions Dexsport remains the gold standard for GambleFi in 2025. Offering over 10,000 games, a full-featured sportsbook, and instant wallet onboarding, it epitomizes frictionless, borderless betting. Players can connect via MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Telegram, or email—no documents or ID ever required. The sportsbook is built for depth and speed: Over 100 betting markets per event Streaming matches—even on zero balance Turbo Combo parlay boosters Dedicated coverage across football, UFC, CS2, Dota2, and Valorant Promotions include themed campaigns, freebet drops, and cashback up to 10% for VIP users. Dexsport's adds a layer of smart utility, giving holders priority access, bonus boosts, and governance participation. Why It Stands Out: Full decentralization across casino and sportsbook Anonymous access with wallet-only login Massive game volume from top studios On-chain bet tracking and provably fair mechanics Dexsport is more than a casino—it’s a next-gen betting platform where transparency, speed, and user sovereignty come first. Rollblock — AI Meets GambleFi for Smarter Risk and Rewards KYC: Not requiredBonus Model: 100% welcome bonus (up to 10 ETH), rakeback, VIP club rewards, liquidity farming Rollblock brings AI into the world of decentralized betting. Users benefit from predictive models, automated risk profiles, and smart staking protocols. Designed for pro-level bettors and liquidity providers, Rollblock is both intuitive and powerful. Key features include: Casino games, sports betting, and predictive analytics NFT-enhanced gaming profiles and achievement tiers Staking returns via $RBLK liquidity pools with up to 30% APY 100% matched deposit bonus and recurring rakeback payouts Affiliate program with flexible commission models Its GambleFi stack allows players to optimize risk-reward strategies while earning passive yield through gameplay. Rollblock’s machine learning layer adapts to user behavior, recommending odds, calculating exposure, and personalizing strategy suggestions. Why It Stands Out: Integration of AI for dynamic bet modeling NFT-based identity layers across gameplay High-yield liquidity pools for active and passive users Deep customization and user-level analytics No KYC, instant access, full anonymity Rollblock pushes GambleFi into the predictive era—where data, staking, and AI create a truly intelligent casino framework. WINR Protocol — On-Chain Casino with Scalable DeFi Infrastructure KYC: Not requiredBonus Model: Weekly and monthly rewards, referral incentives, staking boosts WINR Protocol powers a gasless, 100% on-chain casino suite built for speed, integrity, and scalability. Every game runs directly on smart contracts—making it trustless and provable by design. Its architecture suits developers, liquidity miners, and gaming ecosystems alike. What sets WINR apart: No centralized backend—full EVM deployment Game outcome resolution with zero external middleware Native staking pools for passive income Referral bonuses and weekly milestone rewards Customizable operator dashboards for white-label deployment The $WINR token plays multiple roles: staking, fee discounts, liquidity access, and voting rights for future upgrades. Its reward system creates recurring incentives for both players and builders, while liquidity depth supports scalable volumes. Why It Stands Out: Fully on-chain, no gas fees on gaming execution Open architecture and developer-friendly modules Diverse gaming suite: dice, slots, roulette, blackjack Strong staking economy and governance via $WINR Zero KYC access with verified smart contract fairness WINR Protocol is an infrastructure play as much as it is a casino—designed to scale gambling across decentralized applications with speed and integrity. Comparison Overview Project KYC Required Bonus System Distinction Dexsport No Freebets, cashback, $1,500 promo Web3 casino with sports betting Rollblock No 100% match, rakeback, liquidity AI analytics + NFT gamification WINR Protocol No Weekly rewards, staking bonuses Fully on-chain casino infrastructure Final Thoughts From Dexsport’s robust sportsbook to Rollblock’s intelligent gaming layer and WINR Protocol’s smart-contract backbone—2025’s top GambleFi platforms prove that crypto betting is evolving rapidly. These ecosystems deliver privacy, performance, and programmable rewards that traditional casinos can’t match. Whether you're a passive staker, a competitive gamer, or a privacy-first bettor—one of these platforms offers exactly the flexibility and functionality modern players demand.

Key Reasons Behind the Surge,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/why-is-story-ip-crypto-rising-today-key-reasons-behind-the-surge/,"The post Why Is Story (IP) Crypto Rising Today? Key Reasons Behind the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story (IP) crypto has captured market attention with a sharp price surge, fueled by a breakout from a prolonged consolidation phase. The sudden momentum shift reflects growing market interest, supported by a rise in trading volume and strategic accumulation by larger holders. As Story escapes its previous range, traders are eyeing higher targets amid renewed optimism. This upward move highlights a technically driven rally, suggesting that the asset may be entering a new phase of bullish continuation in the near term. Before analyzing the future projections, let’s see why the Story (IP) price is rising. Bitcoin smashed a new ATH during the past trading day, which has filled the entire crypto market with bullish momentum. The Story price rose above the accumulation zone that it had been stuck at for over a month. Story experienced a massive influx of liquidity of over $148 million, as per some reports, which is speculated to be huge whale activity. A breakout from a technical pattern where the IP price remained accumulated for a long time Despite the current breakout, the IP price failed to secure above a crucial resistance range. Does this suggest the Bulls’ strength was limited, and will this drag the IP price below $4? The latest price breakout led the IP price breakout from the descending parallel channel but failed to surpass the pivotal resistance zone between $4.97 and $5.15. However, this cannot be considered a rejection, as the technicians remain within the bullish frame. The price has surpassed the Gaussian channel, which was bearish and hence a daily close above the range may flip the indicator to bullish. On the other hand, the RSI failed to enter the overbought zone but remains stuck along the upper threshold. The overall sentiment is currently very bullish, wherein the on-chain indicators and technical analysis suggest it has outperformed many altcoins recently. On the other hand, rising whale activity and large trade volumes point to accumulation by major holders. Meanwhile, the volatility remains high, as a rapid squeeze up can be followed by a sharp pullback or correction. Besides, some models expect a decline towards $3.6 by mid-August if buying momentum waves. Wrapping it Up!! Story (IP) is rallying today due to a combination of a broader crypto rally led by Bitcoin and very high trading volume, including potential whale activity and technical breakout patterns. That said, some technical forecasts warn of possible short-term retracements before further upside. For now, the Story (IP) price is maintaining a strong ascending trend with strong bullish momentum and hence is above $5 and will eventually reach $5.5 in the near term.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-12 06:12:48

Ethereum’s once-reliable climb has flattened, and a new batch of meme coin favorites is picking up the slack. The name traders keep repeating in chat rooms and threads is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a politically charged, zero-tax coin that seems to fit 2025’s appetite for narrative and utility in equal measure. Inside MAGACOIN FINANCE: Why Traders Are Talking MAGACOIN holders have similar reasons for what has attracted them to the project. Its tax-free transfer ensures gains aren’t nibbled away by a fee each time tokens move wallets, and a security stamp from clearing a HashEx audit already puts it ahead of several meme plays. The project also boasts a straightforward governance model as there are no venture-capital allocations, and every big decision heads to a community vote. Wrapping its tokenomics in a tongue-in-cheek political theme ensures a strong narrative that can keep memes flowing and holders engaged long after the initial pump fades. Numbers back the buzz. Early funding rounds pulled in more than ten million dollars, and on-chain data shows steady wallet growth as word spreads in Telegram channels. Supply is capped at 170 billion tokens, a decision to avoid the endless float that weighs on older meme giants. These features have analysts calling the project a “hybrid narrative token,” one with real mechanics beneath the memes. Ethereum Hits the Brakes Ethereum is still the backbone of decentralized finance, yet its price chart tells a quieter story this year. It sits roughly a quarter below its spring peak, held back by declining activity, and other Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks offer more efficient transaction layers. Even the long-awaited ETF approvals failed to light the usual fire under the market. The lull hasn’t dented Ethereum’s long-term thesis, but it leaves momentum-hungry traders searching elsewhere in the short term. Meme Tokens Find Their Spark Whenever Bitcoin inches toward fresh highs—as it has lately—speculative capital trickles down the ladder, and meme coins often catch the overflow. Dogecoin has posted solid weekly jumps, Shiba Inu isn’t far behind, and newcomers like FARTCOIN and PENGU are making headlines. Yet many of these rallies still hinge on nostalgia or sheer volatility. MAGACOIN offers an extra layer with a story that taps into political theater while keeping token holders in charge of the script. That blend of culture and control draws a crowd that once would have parked money solely in Ethereum or XRP. Final Thoughts Markets thrive on rotation. As Ethereum pauses to catch its breath and meme coins ride a fresh gust of speculative wind, MAGACOIN FINANCE looks well placed to benefit. Its fee-free design, audited code, and community-owned roadmap give it substance, while the political-meme angle supplies the spark. Whether it becomes 2025’s defining breakout remains to be seen, but the ingredients—clear narrative, active holders, and real utility—are already in the pot.

48087653,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74115,1752300949,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Bounce Back as Troller Cat Hits 1193% ROI and 721% Upside: Best Meme Coin to Buy Today,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-bounce-back-as-troller-cat-hits-1193/,"The meme coin market is back under the spotlight as rapid price movements bring both risk and reward. Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin bounced by 9.66%, regaining trader interest, while Shiba Inu rose 6.53%, signaling renewed community excitement. These moves have reignited debates over which meme coins still have room to grow, and which are already past their peak. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ride short-term waves, Troller Cat is building long-term momentum. Now in Stage 12 of its presale, it combines meme energy with robust tokenomics, offering staking at a 69% APY, and features a transparent, deflationary model. The project has already delivered an ROI of over 1193.2%, and the subsequent price increase is on the horizon. With 14 presale stages still left, staking live, and a 721.06% upside to the projected listing price, Troller Cat positions itself as the best meme coin to buy today, not just for laughs, but for real returns. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Structured Chaos Built for ROI Stage 12 of the Troller Cat presale draws inspiration from Horse_ebooks, a viral Twitter bot that became a cult internet icon through nonsensical but oddly profound tweets. This thematic layer underscores Troller Cat’s broader approach, embracing absurdity as a means to capture attention, drive virality, and ultimately, generate demand. With memes as the engine and smart tokenomics as the structure, this phase is more than just storytelling; it’s a calculated step in the project’s growth. The current price of $TCAT in Stage 12 is $0.00006466. Having launched at just $0.00000500, the token has already increased in value by over 1193.2%. Over 1,300 holders have joined the presale so far, raising more than $325,000. With a projected listing price of $0.0005309, a buyer entering now could realize a return of 721.06%, excluding staking and referral earnings. The next stage will raise the price by another 30%, making this a time-sensitive entry point. Liquidity will be locked for 2 years following the token launch, and the team provides full transparency on all presale data, including wallet counts, totals raised, and more. In addition, the platform’s ad-driven buyback-and-burn model promises sustained deflation, turning platform usage into direct upward pressure on token value. Referral Program: Built for Viral Growth Troller Cat’s referral program is crafted to reward word-of-mouth engagement. Anyone can generate a unique referral link or code and share it with others. When a new participant joins the presale using that referral, the original user receives bonus tokens instantly, no forms or delays required. The system offers a 10% referral bonus, which is unlocked once the referred user spends at least $25 in the presale. This ensures genuine user acquisition and filters out spam or fake referrals. Rewards are obvious through a real-time dashboard, making it easy to track earnings, invites, and conversions. This system empowers community members to become active promoters, transforming every user into a stakeholder in the project’s expansion. A $15,000 investment in $TCAT at $0.00006466 could grow to over $123,000 if it hits its $0.0005309 listing price, excluding staking and referral rewards. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Classic Meme Strength, Short-Term Rally Dogecoin surged 9.66% over the past 24 hours to trade at $0.1983, marking a strong recovery from recent lows. Volume increased across major exchanges, and sentiment-driven buyers returned to chase the move. Analysts point to the $0.20 level as a psychological barrier that could unlock further upside if broken. Technically, Dogecoin has found support around $0.18, with several indicators flashing bullish momentum. However, its movement remains heavily tied to market sentiment, social trends, and public endorsements, rather than utility upgrades or protocol development. Despite being the meme coin OG, Dogecoin lacks staking features or a token-burning system. For holders seeking passive yield or structured tokenomics, Dogecoin offers entertainment, but little in terms of on-chain earning mechanics. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Ecosystem Buzz Lifts Short-Term Sentiment Shiba Inu climbed 6.53% in the last 24 hours to $0.00001332, rebounding off strong support at $0.00001250. Resistance now sits at $0.00001400, and if broken, could spark a push back toward previous highs. Technical analysts are watching volume patterns closely as the token attempts to regain bullish ground. The bounce coincided with community chatter around new Layer 2 integrations and NFT ecosystem updates. These ecosystem developments have reignited interest among long-term supporters and traders alike. However, Shiba Inu still lacks native staking or referral utility. While its roadmap shows ambition, SHIB currently relies on speculative narratives and ecosystem growth rather than structured financial incentives for holders. This leaves investors without yield or burn-driven token support in the near term. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat is the best meme coin to buy today. It offers massive early ROI, 721.06% upside potential from Stage 12, a 69% APY staking rate, and referral rewards, all within a transparent and secure presale ecosystem. Add to that its deflationary design and 2-year liquidity lock, and Troller Cat emerges as the most balanced meme investment currently available. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both posted gains in the last 24 hours, but neither offers the structured staking, entry-level upside, or referral incentives that Troller Cat brings to the market. To maximize your early-stage crypto potential, join the Troller Cat presale now, use a referral code to boost your token total, and secure your share before Stage 13 begins with a 30% price increase.

Bitcoin Solaris Offers Liquid Alternative with Confirmed LBank Exchange Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet question has been circulating across Telegram and X: “When can I sell my BlockDAG?” For early supporters, the wait continues as listing timelines remain unclear and secondary liquidity hasn’t fully materialized. While the project still holds promise, some investors are beginning to wonder when theory will turn into traction. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is already showing signs of momentum. With visible liquidity, transparent updates, and a focus on accessibility and performance, it’s capturing the attention of those seeking both innovation and immediate value. BlockDAG: Good Concept, Bad Timing? To be clear, BlockDAG is far from a scam. Its directed acyclic graph architecture has genuine technical merit. The promise of scalable parallel transactions has been around for years, and if implemented correctly, it could work beautifully. But the delays are beginning to overshadow the promise. Many are finding themselves stuck, unable to cash out or even transfer tokens. And in a market where speed equals confidence, stalling is fatal. Bitcoin Solaris Hits LBank and Unlocks Access On the flip side, Bitcoin Solaris is making moves fast. It has already secured a confirmed listing on LBank, which offers immediate peace of mind to investors who want real liquidity from day one. This isn’t speculative. It’s live. Listings like this mean more than just hype. They open the door to: Centralized trading pairs Broader market visibility Price discovery from launch day Safer, smoother user onboarding That kind of infrastructure doesn’t just support users. It empowers them. Why Everyone’s Watching BTC-S Now One of the best breakdowns recently came from Crypto Vlog , which highlighted the project’s upcoming features and why the LBank listing is already positioning BTC-S as a more “sellable” and usable coin than competitors still figuring out their next testnet. It’s not just influencers. Over 14,150 investors have already joined the Bitcoin Solaris presale. That’s a level of traction that demands attention. The Presale That’s Actually Delivering We are in Phase 11 of the BTC-S presale , and it’s racing toward one of the fastest closes in recent memory: Current Price: $11 Launch Price: $20 Potential Gain: 150% More importantly, Bitcoin Solaris has just introduced a Price Rollback, a temporary drop to $5 for a limited time. This isn’t a gimmick or a bonus. It’s a rare opportunity to enter at early-bird prices right before launch. And just to keep it smooth: wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for receiving tokens post-launch. No need to connect or transact through them during the presale. Deep Tech, Real Use So what makes Bitcoin Solaris more than just a name? Dual-consensus model (PoW + DPoS) balances security with lightning-fast performance Up to 10,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer Validator rotation improves decentralization and reduces attack vectors Smart contract execution via Rust for enterprise and DeFi scalability Built-in interoperability for cross-chain assets Mobile-first mining through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App Energy-efficient framework that uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin You can even calculate projected mining yield with their live calculator . It’s the kind of transparency and access that BlockDAG holders are still waiting on. Tokenomics That Actually Make Sense BTC-S isn’t just about the now; it’s designed for decades of sustainable use: 66.66% for mining over 90 years 20% for presale 5% for liquidity 2% for development (including Helios DeFi layer) 2% for community rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% for the team and advisors This model ensures that 98% of tokens flow to users, miners, and the ecosystem, with zero central hoarding. The Better Exit Plan Can you sell your BlockDAG? Possibly. The potential is there, but timelines remain fluid and clarity is still developing. That’s not unusual for emerging tech, and many still believe in its long-term vision. At the same time, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is moving at a different pace. Exchange listings are already secured, transactions are flowing, and its dual-layer architecture is live and gaining traction. It’s a contrast in timing. While some projects are still preparing, BTC-S is already putting plans into action.
